Overview
Spark ML is one of the dominant frameworks for many major machine
    learning algorithms, such as the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm
    for recommendation systems, the Principal Component Analysis algorithm,
    and the Random Forest algorithm. However, frequent misconfiguration means
    the potential of Spark ML is seldom fully utilized. Using native math
    libraries for Spark ML is a method to achieve that potential.
This article discusses how to accelerate model training speed by using native libraries
     for Spark ML. In addition, it discusses why Spark ML benefits from native libraries, how to
     enable the native libraries with CDH Spark, and provides performance comparisons between Spark ML
     on different native libraries.
