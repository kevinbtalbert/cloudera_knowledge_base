Native math libraries for Spark ML
Sparkâ€™s MLlib uses the Breeze linear algebra package,
    which depends on netlib-java for optimized numerical
    processing. netlib-java is a wrapper for low-level
    BLAS, LAPACK, and ARPACK libraries.

Although Spark's MLlib can use these libraries, due to licensing
     issues with runtime proprietary binaries, neither the Cloudera
     distribution of Spark nor the community version of Apache Spark includes
     the netlib-java native proxies by default. So if you
     make no manual configuration, netlib-java only uses the
     F2J library, a Java-based math library that is translated from
     Fortran77 reference source code.
To check whether you are using native math libraries in Spark ML or the
     Java-based F2J, use the Spark shell to load and print the implementation
     library of netlib-java. For example, the following
     commands return information on the BLAS library and include that it is
     using F2J in the line, com.github.fommil.netlib.F2jBLAS,
     which is bolded below:
scala> import com.github.fommil.netlib.BLAS
import com.github.fommil.netlib.BLAS

scala> println(BLAS.getInstance().getClass().getName())
18/12/10 01:07:06 WARN netlib.BLAS: Failed to load implementation from: com.github.fommil.netlib.NativeSystemBLAS
18/12/10 01:07:06 WARN netlib.BLAS: Failed to load implementation from: com.github.fommil.netlib.NativeRefBLAS
com.github.fommil.netlib.F2jBLAS

Adoption of Spark ML native math librariesThe range of acceleration provided by native libraries varies from model to model.
