Overview
This document provides best practice recommendations for handling small files and
   partitioning with Impala tables. The guidelines included here are for HDFS-backed tables only.
   When you are using a cloud service, such as Amazon S3, different guidelines apply because
   different conditions exist. Although the focus of this document is partitioning recommendations
   for Impala, these guidelines can also be applied to partitioning Hive tables as well.
