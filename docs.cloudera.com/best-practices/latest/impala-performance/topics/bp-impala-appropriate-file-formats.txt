Appropriate file formats
Following are recommendations for which file formats provide the best performance in
   Impala.
By: Manish Maheshwari, Data Architect and Data Scientist at Cloudera, Inc.

For BI queries, the Parquet file format performs best because of its
       combination of columnar storage layout, compression, and encoding.
       The default setting for COMPRESSION_CODEC is snappy
       compression, but GZip
       compression is also supported.
Impala also supports reading ORC file formats from version 2.12 and
       onwards, however expect query performance with ORC tables to be slower
       than it is with Parquet tables.
Text formats can be used when all columns are retrieved from a table.
       However, because compression on text is lower, HDFS I/O could be longer
       than when you use the Parquet file format.
