Load balancing for coordinators
Cloudera recommends setting up a load balancer for incoming
    connections to Impala.
By: Manish Maheshwari, Data Architect and Data Scientist at Cloudera, Inc.
Load balancers such as HaProxy or F5
     usually work well to load balance incoming JDBC and Impala shell
     connections. The load balancer hostname should also be configured for Hue
     to connect to Impala.
The rule of thumb for load balancer configurations are as follows:

Always configure your load balancer to use balance source,
       which uses the source IP address, to ensure that connections from one
       client are always routed to the same coordinator node.
The load balancer timeout should be set to a value that is greater than
       the Impala idle session timeout. For example, if you are using HaProxy
       and set it up with a timeout of 5 minutes using timeout server 300s,
       ensure that the Impala idle timeout is set to less than 300 seconds.
