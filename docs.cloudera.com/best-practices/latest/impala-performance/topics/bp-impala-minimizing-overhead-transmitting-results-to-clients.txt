Minimizing overhead when transmitting results to clients
Always try to minimize the overhead incurred when transmitting query results back to clients.
By: Manish Maheshwari, Data Architect and Data Scientist at Cloudera, Inc.
Use techniques such as:

Always use the LIMIT clause in queries to sample data.
       See LIMIT Clause for more information.
Use the NUM_ROWS_PRODUCED_LIMIT query option to limit
       the number of rows produced by a query. This can be set as the default
       for user pools where exploratory queries are expected to run and the user
       might forget to add a LIMIT clause. See NUM_ROWS_PRODUCED_LIMIT Query Option
       for more information.

When using the impala-shell, use the -B
         option to avoid “prettyprinting”
         the result set and redirect query results to a file using the
         --output_file option. For example:
impala-shell --ssl -k -i impala-coordinator1.company.com:21000 -B --output_file /tmp/result
