Partitioning granularity recommendations
Following are recommendations for table partitioning granularity that provides the best
   performance in Impala.
By: Manish Maheshwari, Data Architect and Data Scientist at Cloudera, Inc.


       Choose a partitioning strategy that ensures there is at least 256 MB of data in each partition. 
     
Over-partitioning causes query planning to take longer than necessary
       because Impala prunes the unnecessary partitions, which results in small
       files in each partition.
Cloudera recommends that you keep the number of partitions in tables
       under 30,000.

Always use integer data types for partition key columns:

Partition key values are turned into HDFS directory names so you
           can minimize memory usage by using numeric values for common partition
           key fields such as YEAR, MONTH, and DAY.
Use the smallest integer data type that holds the
           appropriate range of values. Typically, TINYINT for
           MONTH and DAY, and SMALLINT for YEAR. Use the
           EXTRACT() function to pull out individual date and time fields from a
           TIMESTAMP value, and CAST() the return value to the
           appropriate integer data type.
