Overview
This document explains the factors that affect Impala query
    performance. In addition, it provides procedures for tuning, monitoring, and
    benchmarking Impala queries and other SQL operations to maximize Impala
    scalability. Scalability and performance go hand in hand. Improving query
    performance by reducing the disk I/O or memory used  improves scalability by
    optimally using resources. When resources are used more efficiently, more
    queries can run in parallel.
