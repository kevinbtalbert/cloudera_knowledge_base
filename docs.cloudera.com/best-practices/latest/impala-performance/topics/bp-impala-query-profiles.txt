Query profiles
When Impala executes any query, it captures the runtime details of
    the execution in a query profile.

You can view query profiles from the command line by logging in to the
     Impala shell and running the profile; command. If you want
     to use Cloudera Manager, from the home page of the Admin Console, select
     Impala > Queries. The query profiles display on the Results
     tab of this page:
