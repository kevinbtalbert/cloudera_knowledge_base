Error:
memory limit exceeded. Limit=2.00 GB Reservation=1.25 GB ReservationLimit=1.60 GB OtherMemory=775.70 MB Total=2.00 GB Peak=2.00 GB

Description and cause:
Typically this occurs because the memory limit is not set for the pool or table statistics are missing, or both.

Solution:

Run COMPUTE STATS for each table involved in the query.

Rerun the query with a memory limit set using the SET MEM_LIMIT
           query option. For example:
SET MEM_LIMIT=3gb;
