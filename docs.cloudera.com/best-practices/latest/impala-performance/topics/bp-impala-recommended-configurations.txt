Recommended configurations
Following are the recommended configuration setting for the best performance with
   Impala.
By: Manish Maheshwari, Data Architect and Data Scientist at Cloudera, Inc.

Set the  --use_local_tz_for_unix_timestamp_conversions
       startup flag and the --convert_legacy_hive_parquet_utc_timestamps
       startup flag both to true. Setting these startup flags to true ensures
       that the timestamps between Hive and Impala match. See TIMESTAMP Data Type for more details.
Always set the --idle_session_timeout and the
       --idle_query_timeout timeouts for the Impala daemon
       (impalad). Ensure that the setting for idle_session_timout
       is less than the setting for the timeout set for your load balancer. See
       Setting the Idle Query and Idle Session Timeouts for impalad for details.
Set the --fe_service_threads startup option for the
       Impala daemon (impalad) to 256. This option specifies the maximum number
       of concurrent client connections allowed. See Startup Options for impalad Daemon
       for details.
Increase the --num_metadata_loading_threads startup
       option to 64 to improve metadata loading performance.
       See Configuring Impala Startup Options through Cloudera Manager for more information.
