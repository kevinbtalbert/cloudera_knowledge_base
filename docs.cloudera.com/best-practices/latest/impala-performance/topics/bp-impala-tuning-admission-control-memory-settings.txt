Admission control
Increasing memory for resource pools can increase query concurrency that is under
   admission control.
By: Manish Maheshwari, Data Architect and Data Scientist at Cloudera, Inc.
Impala admission control controls the number of concurrent queries running
     on the Impala service at any time. If the time difference between the query
     being queued and when the admission completes is high, then revisit the
     total memory allocated to that pool:
Queued: 127ms (127000586)
Completed admission: 3.50s (3498016148)
By increasing the memory, more queries can be run concurrently as long as
     the total concurrency is within the limits as recommended in Admission Control.
