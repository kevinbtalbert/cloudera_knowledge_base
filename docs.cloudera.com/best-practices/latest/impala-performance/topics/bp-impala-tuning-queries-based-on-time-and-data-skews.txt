    which are listed in the Exec Summary section of the
    query profile, are possible due to either data skews or workload skews:

Data skews can be fixed by running the HDFS balancer periodically and
      then running INVALIDATE METADATA to rebalance the data.
      See HDFS Balancers and INVALIDATE METADATA Statement
      for more information.

Workload skews can be addressed by ensuring that similar CPU and memory
        configurations are used on all the Impala daemons. To address CPU usage,
        ensure that similar hardware is used on nodes running Impala daemons. To
        address memory configurations use Cloudera Manager. From its home page
        select Impala > Configuration. Then search for the Impala Daemon Memory Limit
        configuration property:
