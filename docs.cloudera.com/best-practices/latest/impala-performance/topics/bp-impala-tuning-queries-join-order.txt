Wrong join order
Adjusting query join order or join type can improve Impala performance.
By: Manish Maheshwari, Data Architect and Data Scientist at Cloudera, Inc.
Description and cause:
A slow query can also be caused by using incorrect join order or incorrect join types.
Solution:

To identify the join type and join ordering errors, compare the actual
       number of rows (#Rows) to the estimated number of
       rows (Est. #Rows) in the query profile. If the
       actual versus estimated numbers of rows vary significantly, the join
       order and the selected join type might be incorrect.
Ensure that you have statistics collected on all tables and columns so
       the correct join order and type can be automatically selected.
