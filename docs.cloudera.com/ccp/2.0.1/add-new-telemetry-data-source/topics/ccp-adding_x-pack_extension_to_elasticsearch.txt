Add X-Pack Extension to
        Elasticsearch
You can add the X-Pack extension to Elasticsearch to enable secure connections for
        Elasticsearch. 
Ensure that Elasticsearch and Kibana are installed. You must
            also choose the X-pack version that matches the version of Elasticsearch that you are
            running.

Use the Storm UI to stop the random_access_indexing
                    topology.


From Topology Summary, click
                                random_access_indexing


Under Topology actions, click
                                Deactivate. 



Install X-Pack on Elasticsearch and Kibana. 
See Installing X-Pack for information on
                    installing X-Pack.

After installing X-pack, navigate to the Elasticsearch node where Elasticsearch
                    Master and the X-Pack were installed, then add a user name and password for
                    Elasticsearch and Kibana to enable external connections from Metron
                    components:
For example, the following creates a user xpack_client_user
                    with the password changeme and superuser
                    credentials:

sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/x-pack/users useradd xpack_client_user -p changeme -r superuser


Create a file containing the password you created in Step 3 and upload it to
                    HDFS. 
For example:

echo changeme > /tmp/xpack-password
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -mkdir /apps/metron/elasticsearch/
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -put /tmp/xpack-password /apps/metron/elasticsearch/
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -chown metron:metron /apps/metron/elasticsearch/xpack-password



Pull the most recent CCP configuration to the local file system by running the
                    following on the node on which CCP is installed:

$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PULL -o ${METRON_HOME}/config/zookeeper -z $ZOOKEEPER -f


 Set the X-Pack es.client.settings by adding it to
                        $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/global.json. 
For example, add the following to the global.json
                    file:

{
...
  "es.client.settings" : {
      "xpack.username" : "xpack_client_user",
      "xpack.password.file" : "/apps/metron/elasticsearch/xpack-password"
  }
  ...
}


OPTIONAL: Set up SSL connection for Elasticsearch client:


Navigate to a node that has an HDFS client, then create a file
                            containing the password you used for your truststore file and upload it
                            to HDFS. 
For example:

echo changeme > /tmp/truststore-password
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -mkdir /apps/metron/elasticsearch/
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -put /tmp/truststore-password /apps/metron/elasticsearch/
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -chown metron:metron /apps/metron/elasticsearch/truststore-password




Add the following properties to es.client.settings in
                            the $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/global.json file: 

{
...
  "es.client.settings" : {
    "ssl.enabled": true,
    "keystore.path" : "$LOCAL_FILE_SYSTEM_PATH",
    "keystore.password.file" : "/apps/metron/elasticsearch/truststore-password"   
  }
  ...
}


noteMake sure you do not overwrite the existing
                                    es.client.settings properties.

The truststore.jks file must reside on all Storm
                            supervisor nodes as well as the REST application node.
For more information about configuring Elasticsearch SSL for X-pack,
                            see Encrypted
                            Communication.



Add the X-Pack changes to ZooKeeper: 

$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/ -z $ZOOKEEPER


Use Ambari to restart the REST API.

Use the Storm UI to restart the random_access_indexing
                    topology. 


From Topology Summary, click
                                random_access_indexing.


Under Topology actions, click
                                Start.
