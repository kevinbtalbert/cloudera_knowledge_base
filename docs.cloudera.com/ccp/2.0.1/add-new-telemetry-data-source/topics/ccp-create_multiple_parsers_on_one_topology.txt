Create Multiple Parsers on
      One Topology
You can specify multiple parsers to run on one aggregated Storm topology to conserve
      resources. However, for performance reasons, you should group multiple parsers that have
      similar velocity or data flow and perform functions with similar complexity.
Use the CLI to create multiple parsers that you want to specify on a single Storm
               topology. 
Refer to Create a Parser for Your New Data Source by Using the
               CLI.

 Deploy the new parser topologies to the cluster:


Log in to the host that has Metron installed as root user.


Deploy the new parsers you want to specify onto one topology:

$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k $KAFKA_HOST:6667 -z $ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181 -s $DATASOURCE_ONE,$DATASOURCE_TWO

For example:

$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181 -s bro,yaf



If you want to override parser parameters, you can add the parameter and its
                     value to the deployment command.
For a list of parser parameters, see Create a Parser for Your New Data
                        Source by Using the CLI.
For example:

$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181 -s bro,yaf -spoutNumTasks 2,3 -parserParallelism 2 -parserNumTasks 5

This command will create a topology with the following parameters:


Bro - spout number of tasks = 2
YAF - spout number of tasks = 3
YAF - parser parallelism = 2
YAF - parser number of tasks = 5




Use the Apache Storm UI to verify that the new topology is listed and that it
                     has no errors.


This new data source processor topology ingests from each $DATASOURCE Kafka topic
               that you created earlier and then parses the event with the CCP Grok framework using
               the Grok pattern defined earlier.
