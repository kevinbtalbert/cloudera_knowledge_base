HDFS
If you do not configure the individual writers, the sensor-specific configuration uses
      default values. 
You can use this default
            configuration either by not creating an indexing configuration file or by entering the
            following in the file:
{
}
Not specifying a writer configuration causes a warning in the Storm console, such as
          WARNING: Default and (likely) unoptimized writer config used for hdfs writer and
          sensor squid. You can safely ignore this warning.
The default configuration has the following features:


solr writer


index name the same as the sensor


batch size of 1


enabled




elasticsearch writer


index name the same as the sensor


batch size of 1


enabled




hdfs writer


index name the same as the sensor


batch size of 1


enabled
