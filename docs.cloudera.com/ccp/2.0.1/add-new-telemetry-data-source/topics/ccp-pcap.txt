pcap
Packet capture (pcap) is a performant C++ probe that captures network packets and
      streams them into Kafka. A pcap Storm topology then streams them into Cloudera Cybersecurity
      Platform (CCP). The purpose of including pcap source with CCP is to provide a middle tier in
      which to negotiate retrieving packet capture data that flows into CCP. This packet data is of
      a form that libpcap-based tools can read.
The network packet capture probe is designed to capture raw network packets and
          bulk-load them into Kafka. Kafka files are then retrieved by the pcap Storm topology and
          bulk-loaded into Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Each file is stored in HDFS as a
          sequence file.
CCP provides three methods to access the pcap data:


Rest API


pycapa


DPDK


There can be multiple probes into the same Kafka topic. The recommended hardware for
          the probe is an Intel family of network adapters that are supportable by Data Plane
          Development Kit (DPDK).
