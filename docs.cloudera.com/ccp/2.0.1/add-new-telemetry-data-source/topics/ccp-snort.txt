Snort
Snort is one of the telemetry data source parsers that are bundled in Cloudera
        Cybersecurity Platform (CCP). 
Snort is a network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS). Snort monitors network traffic
            and generates alerts based on signatures from community rules. Cloudera Cybersecurity
            Platform (CCP) sends the output of the packet capture probe to Snort. CCP uses the
            kafka-console-producer to send these alerts to a Kafka topic. After the Kafka topic
            receives Snort alerts, they are retrieved by the parsing topology in Storm.
By default, the Snort parser uses ZoneId.systemDefault() as the source
          time zone for the incoming data and MM/dd/yy-HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS as the default
          date format. Valid time zones are determined according to the Java
            ZoneId.getAvailableZoneIds() values. DateFormats should match options at
            https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html. 
Following is a sample configuration with dateFormat and timeZone explicitly set in the
          parser configuration file:
"parserConfig": {
"dateFormat" : "MM/dd/yy-HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS",
"timeZone" : "America/New_York"
}
