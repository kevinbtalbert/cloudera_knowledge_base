Solr
Solr is an open source enterprise search platform. It is highly reliable, scalable and
      fault tolerant, providing distributed indexing, replication and load-balanced querying,
      automated failover and recovery, centralized configuration and more.
You can use Zoomdata to
            customize a dashboard for Solr data.
