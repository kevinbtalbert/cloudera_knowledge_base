Telemetry Data Source
    Parsers Bundled with CCP
Telemetry data sources are sensors that provide raw events that are captured and pushed
    into Apache Kafka topics to be ingested in Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) powered by
    Metron. CCP features several built -in parsers that support some common security
    devices.
SnortSnort is one of the telemetry data source parsers that are bundled in Cloudera         Cybersecurity Platform (CCP). Cisco Adaptive Security ApplianceCisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) is one of the telemetry data source parsers         that are bundled in Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP). BroThe Bro ingest data source is a custom Bro plug-in that pushes DPI (deep packet         inspection) metadata into Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP).ArcSight CEFCommon Event Format (CEF) is an extensible, text-based format designed to support         multiple device types by offering the most relevant information.  FireEyeFireEye, Inc. provides products and services to protect against advanced cyber         threats, such as advanced persistent threats and spear phishing. YAF (NetFlow)The YAF (yet another flowmeter) data source ingests NetFlow data into Cloudera         Cybersecurity Platform (CCP). IndexingThe Indexing topology takes data ingested into Kafka from enriched topologies and         sends the data to an indexing bolt configured to write to HDFS and either Elasticsearch or         Solr. pcapPacket capture (pcap) is a performant C++ probe that captures network packets and       streams them into Kafka. A pcap Storm topology then streams them into Cloudera Cybersecurity       Platform (CCP). The purpose of including pcap source with CCP is to provide a middle tier in       which to negotiate retrieving packet capture data that flows into CCP. This packet data is of       a form that libpcap-based tools can read.Parent topic: Creating Parsers
