Troubleshooting Indexing
If Ambari indicates that your indexing is stopped after you have started your indexing,
    this might be a problem with the Python requests module.
Check the Storm UI to ensure that indexing has started for your topologies. If the Storm UI
        indicates that the indexing topology has started, you might need to install the latest
        version of python-requests. Version 2.6.1 of python-requests fixes a bug introduced in
        version 2.5.2 that causes the system modules to break.
