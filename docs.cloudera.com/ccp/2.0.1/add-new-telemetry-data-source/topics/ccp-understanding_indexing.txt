Understanding Indexing
The indexing topology is a topology dedicated to taking the data from a topology that
      has been enriched and storing the data in one or more supported indices. More specifically,
      the enriched data is ingested into Kafka, written in an indexing batch or bolt with a
      specified size, and sent to one or more specified indices. The configuration is intended to
      configure the indexing used for a given sensor type (for example, snort).
The following figure illustrates how the raw topology data is ingested, parsed, enriched,
         and finally delivered to a specified index:

Currently, Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) supports the following indices:


Solr


Elasticsearch


HDFS under /apps/metron/enrichment/indexed



Depending on how you configure the indexing topology, it can have HDFS and either
        Elasticsearch or Solr writers running.
If you would like to view the sensor output in the Alerts user interface, you must
         configure the sensor for either Solr or Elasticsearch.
The Indexing Configuration file is a JSON file stored in Apache
        ZooKeeper and on disk at $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/indexing.
Errors during indexing are sent to a Kafka queue called
        index_errors.
Within the sensor-specific configuration, you can configure the individual writers. The
        following parameters are currently supported:


index


The name of the index to write to (defaulted is the name of the sensor).


batchSize


The size of the batch allowed to be written to the indices at once (defaulted is
              1).


enabled


Whether the index or writer is enabled (default is true).
