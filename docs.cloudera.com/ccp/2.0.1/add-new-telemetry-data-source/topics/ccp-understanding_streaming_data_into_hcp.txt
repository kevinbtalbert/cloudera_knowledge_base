Streaming Data
After you add your parser and configure your indexing, you need to stream all raw
    events from that source into Kafka.
Although CCP includes parsers for several data sources (for example, Bro, Snort, and YAF),
      you must still stream the raw data into CCP through a Kafka topic.
If you choose to use the Snort telemetry data source, you must meet the following
        configuration requirements:


When you install and configure Snort, to ensure proper functioning of indexing and
            analytics, configure Snort to include the year in the timestamp by modifying
              thesnort.conf file as follows:
# Configure Snort to show year in timestamps
config show_year


By default, the Snort parser is configured to use
              ZoneId.systemDefault() for the source timeZone for the
            incoming data and MM/dd/yy-HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS as the default dateFormat. Valid
            timezones are defined in Java's ZoneId.getAvailableZoneIds().
            DateFormats should use the options defined in
              https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html.
            The following sample configuration shows the dateFormat and
              timeZone values explicitly set in the parser configuration:
"parserConfig": {
"dateFormat" : "MM/dd/yy-HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS",
 "timeZone" : "America/New_York"


Depending on the type of data you are streaming into CCP, you can use one of the following
      methods:



NiFi

This streaming method works for most types of data sources. To use it with CCP, you
          must install it manually on port 8089. For information on installing NiFi, see the NiFi
          documentation.
important
NiFi cannot be installed on top of HDP, so you must install NiFi manually to use
            it with CCP.




Performant network ingestion probes

This streaming method is ideal for streaming high-volume packet data. 



Real-time and batch threat intelligence feed
              loaders

This streaming method works for intelligence feeds that you want to view in real-time
          or collect batches of information to view or query at a later date. 



Stream Data Using NiFiNiFi provides a highly intuitive streaming user interface that is compatible with most       types of data sources.
