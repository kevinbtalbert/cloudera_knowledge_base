Verify That Events Are
    Indexed
After you add your new data source, you should verify that events are indexed and
    output matches any Stellar transformation functions you used.

From the Alerts UI, search the source:type filter for the
          $DATASOURCE messages. 
By convention, the index of new messages is called $DATASOURCE_index_[timestamp] and
          the document type is $DATASOURCE_doc.
