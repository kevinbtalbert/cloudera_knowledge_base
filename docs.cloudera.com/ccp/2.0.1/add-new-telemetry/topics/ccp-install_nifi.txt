Install NiFi
NiFi is built to automate the flow of data between systems. As a result, NiFi works
        well to collect, ingest, and push data to CCP. If you haven't already done so, install NiFi. 
important
NiFi cannot be installed on top of HDP, so you must install NiFi manually to use it with
                    CCP.
