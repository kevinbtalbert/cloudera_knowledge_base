      Source
Prior to adding a new telemetry data source, you must install it. If you have already
      installed your data source and have a log source, you can skip this section and move to the
      next one. All procedures in the Runbook use the Squid telemetry data source. 

 Log into the sensor node on which you want to install Squid:

ssh $SQUID_HOST


 Install and start Squid:

sudo yum install squid
sudo service squid start
