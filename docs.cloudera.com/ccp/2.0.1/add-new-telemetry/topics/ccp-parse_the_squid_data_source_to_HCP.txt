Parse the Squid Data Source
      to CCP
Parsers transform raw data (textual or raw bytes) into JSON messages suitable for
      downstream enrichment and indexing by Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP). There is one
      parser for each data source and the information is piped to the Enrichment/Threat Intelligence
      topology.
Parse the Squid Telemetry EventParsers transform raw data into JSON messages suitable for downstream enrichment and       indexing by Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP). There is one parser for each data source       and CCP pipes the information to the Enrichment/Threat Intelligence topology. You can       transform the field output in the JSON messages into information and formats that make the       output more useful. For example, you can change the timestamp field output from GMT to your       timezone.Create an Index TemplateTo work with a new data source data in the Metron dashboard, you need to ensure that     the data is landing in the search index (Elasticsearch) with the correct data types. You can     achieve this by defining an index template. The index template specifies how to interpret the     metron events and how to index strings using either a keyword or full text search.Verify That the Events Are IndexedAfter you finish adding your new data source, you should verify that the data source     events are indexed and the output matches any Stellar transformation functions you     used.
