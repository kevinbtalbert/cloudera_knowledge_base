Stream Data into
      CCP
The first step in adding a new data source telemetry is to stream all raw events from
      the telemetry data source into its own Kafka topic.
Install Your New Data SourcePrior to adding a new telemetry data source, you must install it. If you have already       installed your data source and have a log source, you can skip this section and move to the       next one. All procedures in the Runbook use the Squid telemetry data source. Install NiFiNiFi is built to automate the flow of data between systems. As a result, NiFi works         well to collect, ingest, and push data to CCP. If you haven't already done so, install NiFi. Create a NiFi Flow to Stream Events to CCPYou can use NiFi to create a data flow to capture events from Squid and push them into       Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP). For this task we will use NiFi to create two       processors, one TailFile processor that will ingest Squid events and one PutKafka processor       that will stream the information to Metron. When we create and define the PutKafka processor,       Kafka will create a topic for the Squid data source. We'll then connect the two processors,       generate some data in the Squid log, and watch the data flow from one processor to the       other.
