Verify That the Events Are Indexed
After you finish adding your new data source, you should verify that the data source
    events are indexed and the output matches any Stellar transformation functions you
    used.

From the Alerts UI, search the source:type filter for squid messages.
By convention, the index where the new messages are indexed is called
          squid_index_[timestamp] and the document type is squid_doc.
