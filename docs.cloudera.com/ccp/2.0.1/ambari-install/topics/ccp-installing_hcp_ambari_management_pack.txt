Install HCP Ambari
      Management Pack
A Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) Ambari management pack bundles service
      definitions, stack definitions, and stack add-on service definitions so they do not need to be
      included with the Ambari core functionality and can be updated in between major releases. You
      can use the HCP management pack to install Metron, plus the parser topologies, indexing
      topologies, and enrichment topologies.
You can find the management pack repositories for each of
         the operating systems supported by CCP in the CCP Release Notes. The following is an
         example of installing the HCP Ambari management pack on CentOS 7. 
noteAlthough HCP has been rebranded to CCP, the product management
               pack is still named HCP management pack and it is still located in the
                  hortonworks repository in the HCP
               directory.

 Download the HCP management pack tar file from the HCP repo location: 

wget -nv http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/HCP/centos7/2.x/updates/2.0.1.0/tars/metron/hcp-ambari-mpack-2.0.1.0-6.tar.gz

You can find the management pack repositories for each of the operating systems
               supported by CCP at HCP Repositories.

If you are using Elasticsearch, download the Elasticsearch management pack tar file
               from the HCP repo location:

wget -nv http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/HCP/centos7/2.x/updates/2.0.1.0/tars/metron/hcp-ambari-mpack-2.0.1.0-6.tar.gz


Install the HCP management packs onto the Ambari server:
Install the elasticsearch_mpack only if you are using
               Elasticsearch. 

ambari-server install-mpack --mpack=/${MPACK_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY}/hcp-ambari-mpack-2.0.1.0-6.tar.gz --verbose ambari-server install-mpack --mpack=/${MPACK_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY}/elasticsearch_mpack-2.0.1.0-6.tar.gz --verbose

You should see a message saying that the install mpack completed
               successfully.

Install the Mysql-connector to enable the installation of the Hive
               component:

sudo yum install mysql-connector-java*


Make the jar file available for the Hive installation:

ls -al /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar
cd /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/
ln -s /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar mysql-connector-java.jar


Start or restart the Ambari Server, depending on whether your are installing CCP on
               a new or existing cluster:
ambari-server start
or
ambari-server restart
