      Interface
You can use the CCP Management user interface to add and configure telemetry parsers
      to Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP). You can launch the UI either from Ambari or from a
      browser.

From the Ambari Dashboard navigation panel, click Metron.
            

Verify that the Summary tab is selected. 

From the Quick Links menu, select Management
                  UI. 
The Metron Management UI tool displays in a separate browser tab.
Alternatively, you can launch the module from
                  $METRON_MANAGEMENT_UI_HOST:4200 in a browser.
