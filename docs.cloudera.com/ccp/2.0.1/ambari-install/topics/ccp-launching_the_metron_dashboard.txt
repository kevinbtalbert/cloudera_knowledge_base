Open the Metron
      Dashboard
After you install and configure CCP, you can load and launch the Metron dashboard. The
      Metron dashboard enables you to identify, investigate, and analyze cybersecurity data. 
Ensure that you have selected Metron in the left navigation
               panel in Ambari.

 From the Service Action menu, select Kibana
                  Dashboard Install. 

After the dashboard installs, click Kibana in the left
               navigation panel.

 From the Quick Links pull-down menu, select
                  Metron UI. 
The Metron dashboard should display in a separate browser tab.
If you have already installed the Metron dashboard, reloading the dashboard will not
      overwrite your customizations to the dashboard. If you want to overwrite your customizations
      to the dashboard, you must delete the .kibana index from Elasticsearch and reload the Metron
      dashboard again from Ambari.
