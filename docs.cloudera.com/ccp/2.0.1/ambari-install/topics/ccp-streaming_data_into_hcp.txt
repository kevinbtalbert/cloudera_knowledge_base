Streaming Data into
      CCP
To prepare for Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) to ingest data source data into
      CCP, you must stream each raw event stream from the telemetry data source into its own
      individual Kafka topic. This applies to the telemetry data sources for which CCP includes
      parsers (for example, Bro, Snort, and YAF). Even though CCP includes parsers for these data
      sources, CCP does not install these data sources or ingest the raw data. This is something
      that you must do.Depending on the type of data you are streaming into CCP, you can use one of the following
            methods:
NiFi

This type of streaming method works for most types of data sources.
note
Ensure that the NiFi web application is using port 8089.


Performant network ingestion probes

This type of streaming method is ideal for streaming high volume packet data.
                  

Real-time and batch threat intelligence feed loaders

This type of streaming method is used for real-time and batch threat
                     intelligence feed loadNiFiers.
