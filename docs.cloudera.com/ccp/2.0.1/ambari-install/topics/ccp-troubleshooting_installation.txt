Troubleshooting Your
      Installation
If you encounter errors or issues during your Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP)
      installation, you can uninstall your installation. 


Uninstalling your Metron installation
You can follow the uninstallation steps in Upgrade Metron to
                  uninstall your Metron installation.
If Ambari does not allow you to uninstall after you have stopped all of the
                  Metron services and the Storm topologies, perform the following from any node that
                  has access to Ambari and has curl installed:

curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -H "X-Requested-By: ambari" -X DELETE 
      http://$AMBARI_HOST:$AMBARI_PORT/api/v1/clusters/$METRON_CLUSTER_NAME/services/METRON

If you don't know the name of your Ambari host, choose Manage
                     Ambari from the admin menu on the Ambari
                     Dashboard tab. The name of your cluster is displayed in
                  the Clusters section. If you cannot see the entire cluster
                  name, click the icon to rename your cluster and the entire cluster name will
                  display. Click x to dismiss the rename field without
                  renaming your cluster.
