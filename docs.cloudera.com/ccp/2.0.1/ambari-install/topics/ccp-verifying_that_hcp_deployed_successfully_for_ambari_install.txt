Verify That CCP Deployed
      Successfully for Ambari Install
After you install Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP), you need to verify that your
      services are displayed in Ambari and that you can access the Metron Dashboard.
Verify that the topologies bundled with CCP are deployed. 
From Ambari, navigate to Storm > Quick
                  Links > Storm UI.
You should see the following topologies listed:


Snort
pcap
YAF (Yet Another Flowmeter)
Bro Network Security Monitor
Indexing topology


 Check that the enrichment topology has emitted some data.   
This could take a few minutes to show up in the Storm UI. The Storm enrichment
               topology UI should look something like the following:


Storm UI with Enrichment Details


 Ensure that the Metron dashboard is available and receiving data by displaying the dashboard
               at $METRON_UI_HOST:5000.  
Check to ensure that the indexing is done correctly and the data is
               visualized. Check to ensure that some data is written into HDFS at /apps/metron for at least one of the
               data sources. Customize CCP to meet your own needs.
