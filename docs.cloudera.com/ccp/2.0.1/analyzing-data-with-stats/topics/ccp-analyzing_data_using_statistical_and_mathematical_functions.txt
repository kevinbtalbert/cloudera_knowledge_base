Analyzing Data Using
      Statistical and Mathematical Functions Overview
Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) provides a variety of advanced analytics that
      use statistics and advanced mathematical functions. Capturing the statistical snapshots in a
      scalable way can open up doors for more advanced analytics such as outlier analysis. These
      analytics provide a robust set of statistical functions and statistical-based algorithms in
      the form of Stellar functions. These functions can be used from everywhere where Stellar is
      used.
Approximation StatisticsData scientists frequently want to find anomalies in numerical data. To that end, CCP       has some simple approximation statistics.Mathematical FunctionsData scientists frequently want to find anomalies in numerical data. To that end, CCP       has some mathematical functions.Distributional StatisticsData scientists frequently want to find anomalies in numerical data. To that end, CCP       has some simple distributional statistics.Statistical Outlier DetectionData scientists frequently want to find anomalies in numerical data. To that end, CCP       has some simple statistical outlier detectors.
