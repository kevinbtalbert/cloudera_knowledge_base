Approximation Statistics
Data scientists frequently want to find anomalies in numerical data. To that end, CCP
      has some simple approximation statistics.

Function
Description
Input
Returns



HLLP_ADD
Add value to the HyperLogLogPlus estimator set. 



hyperLogLogPlus - The hllp estimator to add a value to


value+ - Value to add to the set. Takes a single item or a
                                 list.



The HyperLogLogPlus set with a new value added


HLLP_CARDINALITY
Returns HyperLogLogPlus-estimated cardinality for this set. 



hyperLogLogPlus - The hllp set



Long value representing the cardinality for this set


HLLP_INIT
Initializes the HyperLogLogPlus estimator set. p must be a value between
                        4 and sp and sp must be less than 32 and greater than 4. 



p - The precision value for the normal set


sp - The precision value for the sparse set. If p is set, but sp is
                                 0 or not specified, the sparse set will be disabled.



A new HyperLogLogPlus set


HLLP_MERGE
Merge hllp sets together. The resulting estimator is initialized with p
                        and sp precision values from the first provided hllp estimator set. 



hllp - List of hllp estimators to merge. Takes a single hllp set or
                                 a list.



True if the filter might contain the value and false otherwise
