Distributional Statistics
Data scientists frequently want to find anomalies in numerical data. To that end, CCP
      has some simple distributional statistics.

Description
Input
Returns



STATS_ADD
Adds one or more input values to those that are used to calculate the
                        summary statistics.



stats - The Stellar statistics object. If null, then a new one is
                                 initialized.


value+ - One or more numbers to add



A Stellar statistics object


STATS_BIN
Computes the bin that the value is in based on the statistical
                        distribution.



stats - The Stellar statistics object


value - The value to bin


bounds? - A list of percentile bin bounds (excluding min and max)
                                 or a string representing a known and common set of bins. For
                                 convenience, we have provided QUARTILE, QUINTILE, and DECILE which
                                 you can pass in as a string arg. If this argument is omitted, then
                                 we assume a Quartile bin split.



Which bin N the value falls in such that bound(N-1) < value <=
                        bound(N). No min and max bounds are provided, so values smaller than the
                        0'th bound go in the 0'th bin, and values greater than the last bound go in
                        the M'th bin.


STATS_COUNT
Calculates the count of the values accumulated (or in the window if a
                        window is used).



stats - The Stellar statistics object



The count of the values in the window or NaN if the statistics object is
                        null


STATS_GEOMETRIC_MEAN
Calculates the geometric mean of the accumulated values (or in the
                        window if a window is used). 



stats - The Stellar statistics object



The geometric mean of the values in the window or NaN if the statistics
                        object is null.


STATS_INIT
Initializes a statistics object



window size - The number of input data values to maintain in a
                                 rolling window in memory. If window_size is equal to 0, then no
                                 rolling window is maintained. Using no rolling window is less
                                 memory intensive, but cannot calculate certain statistics like
                                 percentiles and kurtosis.



A Stellar statistics object


STATS_KURTOSIS
Calculates the kurtosis of the accumulated values (or in the window if a
                        window is used). 



stats - The Stellar statistics object



The kurtosis of the values in the window or NaN if the statistics object
                        is null


STATS_MAX
Calculates the maximum of the accumulated values (or in the window if a
                        window is used).



stats - The Stellar statistics object



The maximum of the accumulated values in the window or NaN if the
                        statistics object is null.


STATS_MEAN
Calculates the mean of the accumulated values (or in the window if a
                        window is used).



stats - The Stellar statistics object



The mean of the values in the window or NaN if the statistics object is
                        null.


STATS_MERGE
Merges statistics objects



statistics -A list of statistics objects



A Stellar statistics object


STATS_MIN
Calculates the minimum of the accumulated values (or in the window if a
                        window is used).



stats - The Stellar statistics object



The minimum of the accumulated values in the window or NaN if the
                        statistics object is null.


STATS_PERCENTILE
Computes the p'th percentile of the accumulated values (or in the window
                        if a window is used).

                        object is null.


STATS_SD
Calculates the standard deviation of the accumulated values (or in the
                        window if a window is used).
