To illustrate how to use the MAD functionality we will create a dummy data stream of
      Gaussian noise. This example will also explain how to use the profiler to tag messages as
      outliers or not.
Data GeneratorWe can create a simple python script to generate a stream of Gaussian noise at the       frequency of one message per second as a python script which should be saved at          ~/rand_gen.py.The ParserWe will create a parser that will take the single numbers in and create a message         with a field called value in them using the         CSVParser.Enrichment and Threat IntelligenceWe will set a threat triage level of 10 if a message generates a     outlier score of more than 3.5. This cutoff will depend on your data and should be adjusted     based on the assumed underlying distribution. Note that under the assumptions of normality, MAD     will act as a robust estimator of the standard deviation, so the cutoff should be considered the     number of standard deviations away. IndexWe also need an indexing configuration.The ProfilerWe can set up the profiler to track the MAD statistical state required to compute MAD.     For the purposes of this demonstration, we will configure the profiler to capture statistics on     the minute mark. We will capture a global statistical state for the value field     and we will look back for a 5 minute window when computing the median.Execute the FlowWhen you have finished configuring the MAD functionality, you will need to execute         the flow.Parent topic: Outlier Analysis
