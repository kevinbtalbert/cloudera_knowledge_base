Mathematical Functions
Data scientists frequently want to find anomalies in numerical data. To that end, CCP
      has some mathematical functions.

Description
Input
Returns



ABS
Returns the absolute value of a number.



number - The number to take the absolute value of



The absolute value of the number passed in


BIN
Computes the bin that the value is in given a set of bounds



value -the value to bin


bounds - A list of value bounds (excluding min and max) in sorted
                                 order



Which bin N the value falls in such that bound(N-1) < value <=
                        bound(N). No min and max bounds are provided, so values smaller than the
                        0'th bound go in the 0'th bin, and values greater than the last bound go in
                        the M'th bin.
