Median Absolution Deviation
Much has been written about this robust estimator. See the first page of
         Alternatives to the Median Absolute Deviation for coverage of the good and the
      bad of median absolution deviation (MAD). The usage, however is fairly
      straightforward.


Gather the statistical state required to compute the MAD.




The distribution of the values of a univariate random variable over
                      time.


The distribution of the absolute deviations of the values from the
                      median.








Use this statistical state to score unseen values. The higher the score, the
                  more unlike the previously seen data the value is.




There are a couple of issues which make MAD hard to compute. First, the statistical
        state requires computing median, which can be computationally expensive to compute exactly.
        To get around this, we use the OnlineStatisticalProvider to compute a sketch rather than the
        exact median. Secondly, the statistical state for seasonal data should be limited to a
        fixed, trailing window. We do this by ensuring that the MAD state is mergeable and able to
        be queried from within the Profiler.
