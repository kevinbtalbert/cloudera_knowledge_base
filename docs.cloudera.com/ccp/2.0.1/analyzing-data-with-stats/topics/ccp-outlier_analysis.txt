Outlier Analysis
Data scientists frequently want to find anomalies in numerical data. To that end, CCP
      has some simple statistical anomaly detectors.
Median Absolution DeviationMuch has been written about this robust estimator. See the first page of          Alternatives to the Median Absolute Deviation for coverage of the good and the       bad of median absolution deviation (MAD). The usage, however is fairly       straightforward.ExampleTo illustrate how to use the MAD functionality we will create a dummy data stream of       Gaussian noise. This example will also explain how to use the profiler to tag messages as       outliers or not.
