OUTLIER_MAD_STATE_MERGE
Update the statistical state required to compute the Median Absolute
                        Deviation.



state - A list of Median Absolute Deviation States to merge.
                                 Generally these are states across time.


currentState? - The current state (optional)



The Median Absolute Deviation state


OUTLIER_MAD_ADD
Add a piece of data to the state



state -The MAD state


value - The numeric value to add



The MAD state


OUTLIER_MAD_SCORE
Get the modified z-score normalized by the MAD: scale * | x_i -
                        median(X) | / MAD. 



state - The MAD state


value - The numeric value to score


scale? -Optionally the scale to use when computing the modified
                                 z-score. Default is 0.6745.



The modified z-score
