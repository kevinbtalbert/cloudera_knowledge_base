Analyzing Enriched Data
      Using Apache Zeppelin Overview
Apache Zeppelin is a web-based notebook that supports interactive data exploration,
      visualization, sharing and collaboration. CCP users will use Zeppelin at two
      levels.


Senior analysts and data scientists can use Zeppelin to produce workbooks to analyze
        data and to create recreatable investigations or runbooks for junior analysts.


Junior analysts can use recreatable investigations or runbooks in Zeppelin to discover
        cybersecurity issues much like they do with the Metron Dashboard. However, Zeppelin can
        perform more complex calculations and handle larger groups of data.



Setting up Zeppelin to Run with CCPYou can import the Zeppelin Notebook using Ambari or manually. To complete your set up       you'll need to use Zeppelin interpretors and load the telemetry information. Using Zeppelin to Analyze DataZeppelin enables you to analyze the enriched telemetry information Metron archives in       HDFS.
