Setting up Zeppelin to Run
      with CCP
You can import the Zeppelin Notebook using Ambari or manually. To complete your set up
      you'll need to use Zeppelin interpretors and load the telemetry information. 
Setting up Zeppelin is very
         simple. To access Zeppelin, go to http://$ZEPPELIN_HOST:9995. 
In addition to this documentation, there are three other sources for Zeppelin
      information.


The Zeppelin installation for CCP provides a couple sample notes including tutorials
               specific to Metron. These notes are listed on the left side of the
                  Welcome screen and in the Notebook
               menu.




Zeppelin documentation provides information on launching and using Zeppelin, and you
          can refer to the following links for this information:

Working with Notes





Apache Zeppelin documentation provides information on Zeppelin basic features,
               supported interpreters, and more. 



Using Zeppelin InterpretersWhen you install Zeppelin on CCP the installation includes the interpreter for Spark.     Spark is the main backend processing engine for Zeppelin. Spark is also a front end for Python,     Scale, and SQL and you can use any of these languages to analyze the telemetry data.Loading Telemetry Information into ZeppelinBefore you can analyze telemetry information in Zeppelin, you must first download it     from Metron. Metron archives the fully parsed, enriched, and triaged telemetry for each sensor     in HDFS. This archived telemetry information is simply raw JSON files which makes it simple to     parse and analyze the information with Zeppelin.
