CCP High Level
      Architecture
Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) is primarily backed by Storm and
      Kafka.
CCP also leverages the following components:


ZooKeeper
ZooKeeper provides dynamic configuration updates to running Storm topologies.
                  This enables CCP to push updates to our Storm topologies without restarting
                  them.
HBase
CCP uses HBase primarily for enrichments. But HBase is also used it to store user
                  state for our UIs.
HDFS
HDFS uses HDFS for long term storage. Parsed and enriched messages land here,
                  along with any reported exceptions or errors encountered along the way.
Solr and Elasticsearch (plus Kibana)
HDP uses Solr and Elasticsearch (plus Kibana) for real-time access. CCP provides
                  out of the box compatibility with both Solr and Elasticsearch, and custom
                  dashboards for data exploration in Kibana.
Zeppelin
Zeppelin provides dashboards to perform custom analytics.
Kafka
Information is pushed into Metron by setting up Kafka topics for parsers to read
                  from. There are a variety of options for setting up Kafka topics, including, but
                  not limited to:
Grok Kafka plugin
Fastcapa
NiFi
