Telemetry Data Collectors
Telemetry data collectors push or stream the data source events into Apache Metron.
      Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) works with Apache NiFi to push the majority of data
      sources into Apache Metron.
 For high-volume network data, CCP provides a performant network ingest probe. And for
         threat intelligence feeds, CCP supports a set of both streaming and batch loaders that
         enables you to push third-party intelligence feeds into Apache Metron.
