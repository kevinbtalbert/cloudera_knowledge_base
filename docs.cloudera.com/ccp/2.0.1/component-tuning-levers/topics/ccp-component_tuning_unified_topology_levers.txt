Component Tuning Variables
      Overview
There are a number of services that you can use to tune the performance of your CCP
      cluster. These services include Kafka, Storm, and HDFS. Within these services, you can modify
      parsers, enrichment, and indexing (Elasticsearch or Solr).
When you consider tuning your CCP architecture, it is important to note where you can
         modify settings. For example, Storm gives you the ability to independently set tasks in
         executors for parser topologies. This is important if you want to set the number of tasks
         higher than the number of executors to accommodate for future performance tuning and
         rebalancing without the need to bring down your topologies. However, for enrichment and
         indexing topologies, CCP uses Flux, and there is no method for specifying the number of
         tasks from the number of executors in Flux. By default, the number of tasks equals the
         number of executors.
The following lists the major properties for each service that you can modify to tune your
         cluster:


Kafka partitions


Storm


Kafka spout


Polling frequency


Polling timeouts


Offset commit period


Max uncommitted offsets






Storm workers (OS processes)


Storm executors (threads in a process)


Storm ackers


Max spout pending


Spout and bolt parallelism




HDFS

Batch size

Replication factor



Indexing
Elasticsearch templates
Solr
