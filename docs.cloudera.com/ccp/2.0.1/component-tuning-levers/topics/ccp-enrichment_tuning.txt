Enrichment Tuning
Because all of the data is coming together in enrichments, you will probably need
      larger enrichments settings than your parallelism settings. Enrichment settings focus more on
      the compute workload than on the mapping workload in parsers or the IO driven workload in
      indexing. Enrichment makes significant use of caching for performance.
You can modify many performance tuning properties for enrichment using Ambari or Storm
         Flux. Modifying properties using Ambari is simple and can be performed by any user.
         However, you should have knowledge of Storm Flux usage and formatting before attempting to
         modify any Flux files.
The enrichment properties materialize as follows:
Ambari UI -> properties file -> Flux -> Storm
