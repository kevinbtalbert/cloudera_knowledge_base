Kafka Partitions
The main lever you can adjust to tune Kafka throughput is the number of
      partitions.
When you calculate the number of Kafka partitions, it is important to remember that it is
         the unit of parallelism. A topic with more partitions has higher throughput and higher
         latency than a topic with less. It is important to determine the correct number of
         partitions because too many will lead to unnecessarily higher latency while too few will
         not meet throughput expectations. This parameter is not directly configured via Metron but
         rather when manually creating the associated Kafka topics.
