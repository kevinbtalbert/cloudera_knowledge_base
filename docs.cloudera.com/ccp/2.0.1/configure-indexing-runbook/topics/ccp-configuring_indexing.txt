Configuring Indexing
The indexing topology is a topology dedicated to taking the data from a topology that
      has been enriched and storing the data in one or more supported indices. More specifically,
      the enriched data is ingested into Kafka, written in an indexing batch or bolt with a
      specified size, and sent to one or more specified indices. The configuration is intended to
      configure the indexing used for a given sensor type (for example, snort).
Currently, Cloudera
            Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) supports the following indices:


Elasticsearch


Solr


HDFS under /apps/metron/enrichment/indexed


Depending on how you start the indexing topology, it can have HDFS and either elasticsearch
    or SOLR writers running.
Just like the Global Configuration file, the Indexing Configuration file format is a JSON
    file stored in ZooKeeper and on disk at $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/ indexing.
Within the sensor-specific configuration, you can configure the individual writers. The
    parameters currently supported are:

index

The name of the index to write to (defaulted to the name of the sensor).

batchSize

 The size of the batch that is written to the indices at once (defaulted to 1).

enabled

 Whether the index or writer is enabled (default true).



Default ConfigurationIf you do not configure the individual writers, the sensor-specific configuration will       use the default values. Specify Index ParametersYou can to specify the parameters for the writers rather than using the default values       using the CCP Management user interface.Turn off HDFS WriterYou can turn off the HDFS writer when you are configuring and testing your       system.
