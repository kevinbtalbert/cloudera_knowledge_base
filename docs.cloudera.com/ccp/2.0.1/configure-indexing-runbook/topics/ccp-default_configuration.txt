Default
      Configuration
If you do not configure the individual writers, the sensor-specific configuration will
      use the default values. You can choose to use this default configuration by either not creating the Indexing
         Configuration file or by entering the following in the file.  You can name the file
         anything you like, for example index_config.json, but it must be
         located at
            $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/indexing.{
}If a writer configuration
            is unspecified, then a warning is indicated in the Storm console. For example, WARNING:
            Default and (likely) unoptimized writer config used for hdfs writer and sensor squid.
            You can ignore this warning message if you intend to use the default
            configuration.This
            default configuration uses the following configuration:

elasticsearch writer


index name the same as the sensor


batch size of 1


enabled




hdfs writer


index name the same as the sensor


batch size of 1


enabled
