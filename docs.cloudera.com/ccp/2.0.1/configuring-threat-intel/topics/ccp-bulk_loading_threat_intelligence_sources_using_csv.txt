Bulk Loading CSV Threat
      Intelligence Sources
Although Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) is designed to work with STIX/Taxii
      threat feeds, you can also be bulk loaded with threat data from a CSV file.
CSV Flatfile Loader
The shell script $METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh reads data from
          local disk and loads the threat intelligence data into an HBase table. This loader uses
          the special configuration parameter inputFormatHandler to specify how to consider the
          data. The two implementations are BY_LINE and
            org.apache.metron.dataloads.extractor.inputformat. WholeFileFormat.
The default is BY_LINE, which makes sense for a list of CSVs in which
          each line indicates a unit of information to be imported. However, if you are importing a
          set of STIX documents, then you want each document to be considered as input to the
          Extractor.
Start the user parser topology by running the following:
$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -s user -z $ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181 -k $KAKFA_HOST:6667
The parser topology listens for data streaming in and pushes the data to HBase. Now
          you have data flowing into the HBase table, but you need to ensure that the enrichment
          topology can be used to enrich the data flowing past.
The parameters for the utility are as follows:


Short Code
Long Code
Is Required?
Description



-h

No
Generate the help screen/set of options


-e
--extractor_config
Yes
JSON document describing the extractor for this input data
                        source


-t
--hbase_table
Yes
The HBase table to import into


-c
--hbase_cf
Yes
The HBase table column family to import into


-i
--input
Yes
The input data location on local disk. If this is a file, then that file
                        will be loaded. If this is a directory, then the files will be loaded
                        recursively under that directory.


-l
--log4j
No
The log4j properties file to load


-n
--enrichment_config
No
The JSON document describing the enrichments to configure. Unlike other
                        loaders, this is run first if specified.



HDFS via MapReduce

The shell script $METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh will kick off the
          MapReduce job to load data stated in HDFS into an HBase table. The following is as example
          of the
          syntax:
                           $METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh -i /tmp/top-10k.csv -t enrichment -c t -e ./extractor.json -m MR

The input data location on local disk. If this is a file, then that file

                        recursively under that directory.


-l

No
The log4j properties file to load


-n
--enrichment_config
No
The JSON document describing the enrichments to configure. Unlike other
                        loaders, this is run first if specified.



Configure a CSV Extractor Configuration FileAfter you have chosen a threat intelligence feed source, you must configure an       extractor configuration file that describes the source.Configure CSV Mapping for the Intelligence FeedAfter you configure an extractor configuration file, you must configure which element       of a tuple to cross-reference with which threat intelligence feed. This configuration is       stored in ZooKeeper.Run the CSV Threat Intel LoaderAfter you define the threat intelligence source, threat intelligence extractor, and       threat intelligence mapping configuration, you must run the loader to move the data from the       threat intelligence source to the Metron threat intelligence store and to store the enrichment       configuration in ZooKeeper.Parent topic: Enriching with Threat Intelligence Information
