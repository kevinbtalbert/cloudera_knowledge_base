Configure CSV Mapping for
      the Intelligence Feed
After you configure an extractor configuration file, you must configure which element
      of a tuple to cross-reference with which threat intelligence feed. This configuration is
      stored in ZooKeeper.On the host with Metron installed, log in as root.   Cut and paste the following file into a file called
                  enrichment_config_temp.json:  

{
     "zkQuorum" : "$ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181"
    ,"sensorToFieldList" : {
     "$DATASOURCE" : {
          "type" : "THREAT_INTEL"
         ,"fieldToEnrichmentTypes" : {
               "domain_without_subdomains" : [ "zeusList" ]
          }
     }
   }
}

 Remove any non-ASCII invisible characters in the pasted syntax in Step 2:  

iconv -c -f utf-8 -t ascii enrichment_config_temp.json -o enrichment_config.json
