Configure TAXII Connection
      Configuration File
In addition to the Extractor configuration file, this TAXII loader requires a
      configuration file describing the connection information to the TAXII server.

 Log in as root to the host on which Metron is installed.

sudo -s $METRON_HOME


 Create a connection configuration file called
                  threatintel_connection_config_temp.json at
                  $METRON_HOME/config and populate it with the threat intelligence
               source schema:

{
  "endpoint" : "http://localhost:9000/services/discovery"
  ,"username" : "guest"
  ,"password" : "guest"
  ,"type" : "DISCOVER"
  ,"collection" : "guest.MalwareDomainList_Hostlist"
  ,"table" : "threatintel"
  ,"columnFamily" : "t"
  ,"allowedIndicatorTypes" : [ "domainname:FQDN", "address:IPV_4_ADDR" ]
}
where:

endpoint

The URL of the endpoint

type


POLL or DISCOVER depending on the
                           endpoint.

collection

The Taxii collection to ingest

table

columnFamily

The column family to import into

allowedIndicatorTypes

an array of acceptable threat intelligence types (see the "Enrichment
                           Type Name" column of the Stix table above for the possibilities).
