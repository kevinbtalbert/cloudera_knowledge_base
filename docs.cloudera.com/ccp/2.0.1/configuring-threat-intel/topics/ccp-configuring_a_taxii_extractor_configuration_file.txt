Configure TAXII Extractor
      Configuration File
After you fetch the latest Hail a TAXII feeds to the TAXII server, you must create an
      extractor configuration file to bulk load the threat intelligence enrichment store into
      HBase.

 Log in as root to the host on which Metron is installed.

sudo -s $METRON_HOME


Determine the schema of the threat intelligence source. 
The schema of our mock enrichment source is
                  domain|owner|registeredCountry|registeredTimestamp.

 Create an extractor configuration file called
                  threatintel_extractor_config_temp.json at
                  $METRON_HOME/config and populate it with the threat intelligence
               source schema:

{
"config" : {
    "columns" : {
        "ip" : 0
    }
    ,"indicator_column" : "ip"
    ,"type" : "malicious_ip"
    ,"separator" : ","
  }
  ,"extractor" : "STIX"
} 



 Remove any non-ASCII invisible characters that might have been included if you
               copy and pasted: 
iconv -c -f utf-8 -t ascii threatintel_extractor_config_temp.json -o
                  threatintel_extractor_config.json
