Enriching with Threat
      Intelligence Information
The threat intelligence topology takes a normalized JSON message and cross references
      it against threat intelligence information, tags it with alerts if appropriate, runs the
      results against the scoring component of machine learning models where appropriate, and stores
      the telemetry in a data store. Prior to configuring threat intelligence, you must meet the following requirements:
Choose your threat intelligence sources
As a best practice, install a threat intelligence feed aggregator, such as
               SoltraEdge


Mark messages as threats based on data in external data stores


Mark threat alerts with a numeric triage level based on a set of Stellar rules

You can bulk load threat intelligence information from the following
            sources:

CSV Ingestion


HDFS through MapReduce


Taxii Loader


Bulk Loading CSV Threat Intelligence SourcesAlthough Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) is designed to work with STIX/Taxii       threat feeds, you can also be bulk loaded with threat data from a CSV file.Bulk Loading Threat Intelligence Sources Using STIX/TAXIICloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) is designed to work with STIX/TAXII threat       feeds. OpenTAXII is a Python implementation of TAXII services that delivers a rich feature set       and friendly pythonic API.
