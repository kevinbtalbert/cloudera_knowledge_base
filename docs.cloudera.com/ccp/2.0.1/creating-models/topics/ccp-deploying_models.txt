Deploy Models
After creating a model, you need to deploy the model onto HDFS and submit a request
      for one or more instances of the model. Create a simple sample python model.   
Let's say that you have a model, exposed as a REST microservice called "mock_dga"
               that takes as an input argument "host" which represents an internet domain name and
               returns a field called "is_malicious" which is either "malicious" if the domain is
               thought to be malicious or "legit" if the domain is not thought to be malicious. The
               following is a very simple example service that thinks that the only legitimate
               domains are "yahoo.com" and "amazon.com":

from flask import Flask
from flask import request,jsonify
import socket
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/apply", methods=['GET'])
def predict():
        h = request.args.get('host')
        r = {}
        if h == 'yahoo.com' or h == 'amazon.com':
                r['is_malicious'] = 'legit'
        else:
                r['is_malicious'] = 'malicious'
        return jsonify(r)

if __name__ == "__main__":
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.bind(('localhost', 0))
        port = sock.getsockname()[1]
        sock.close()
        with open("endpoint.dat", "w") as text_file:
                text_file.write("{\"url\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:%d\"}" % port)
        app.run(threaded=True, host="0.0.0.0", port=port)

 Store this python model in a directory called /root/mock_dga as
                  dga.py and an accompanying shell script called
                  rest.sh which starts the model:  

#!/bin/bash
python dga.py
 If you have not already done so, start MaaS:  

$METRON_HOME/bin/maas_service.sh -zk $ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181
 Start one or more instances of the model, calling it "dga" and assigning an amount of memory
               to each instance:     
Because you have placed the model in the /root/mock_dga
               directory, enter the following:

$METRON_HOME/bin/maas_deploy.sh -zk $ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181 -lmp /root/mock_dga -hmp /user/root/models -mo ADD -m 512 -n dga -v 1.0 -ni 1
