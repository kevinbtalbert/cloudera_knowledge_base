Modify a Model
You can remove a number of instances of the model by executing
         maax_deploy.sh with remove as the -mo argument. 

For example, the following removes one instance of the dga model, version
               1.0:

$METRON_HOME/bin/maas_deploy.sh -zk -$ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181 -mo REMOVE -m 512 -n dga -v 1.0 -ni 1


If you need to modify a model, you need to modify the model itself and deploy a new
               version, then remove the old version instances afterward.
