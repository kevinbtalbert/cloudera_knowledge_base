Start Topologies and Send
      Data
The final step in setting up Model as a Service, is to start the topologies and send
      some data to test the model.
 Start the sensor upon which the Model as a Service will run:  

$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k -$KAFKA_HOST -z $ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181 -s $PARSER_NAME


 Generate some legitimate data and some malicious data on the sensor.   
For example:

#Legitimate example:
squidclient http://yahoo.com
#Malicious example:
squidclient http://cnn.com


 Send the data to Kafka:  

cat /var/log/squid/access.log | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list $KAFKA_HOST:6667 --topic squid


 Browse the data in Elasticsearch at
                  http://$ELASTICSEARCH_HOST:9100/_plugin/head to verify that it
               contains the appropriate documents. 
For the current example, you would see the following:


One from yahoo.com which does not have is_alert set and does
                     have is_malicious set to legit.
One from cnn.com which does have is_alert set to true,
                        is_malicious set to malicious, and
                        threat:triage:level set to 100.
