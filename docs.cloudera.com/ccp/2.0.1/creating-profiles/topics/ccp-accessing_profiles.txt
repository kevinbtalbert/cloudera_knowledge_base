Accessing Profiles
You can use a client API to access the profiles generated by the CCP Profiler to use
      for model scoring. CCP provides a Stellar API to access the profile data but this section
      provides only instructions for using the Stellar client API. You can use this API in
      conjunction with other Stellar functions such as MAAS_MODEL_APPLY to perform
      model scoring on streaming data.
Selecting Profile MeasurementsThe PROFILE_GET command allows you to select all of the profile       measurements written. Specifying Profile Time and DurationThe third required argument for PROFILE_GET is a list of          ProfilePeriod objects. These objects allow you to specify the timing,       frequency, and duration of the PROFILE_GET. This list is produced by another       Stellar function. There are two options available: PROFILE_FIXED and          PROFILE_WINDOW.Client Profile ExampleThe following are usage examples that show how the Stellar API can be used to read     profiles generated by the Metron Profiler. This API would be used in conjunction with other     Stellar functions like MAAS_MODEL_APPLY to perform model scoring on streaming data.Parent topic: Using Profilers
