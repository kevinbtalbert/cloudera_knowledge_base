Batch Profiler
A batch profile creates
        a profile based on telemetry that was captured in the past. This is sometimes referred to as
        profile seeding or backfilling. Batch profiles can be used to understand the historical
        behaviors and trends of a profile to determine if the profile has predictive value for model
        building. You can use the streaming profiler and the batch profiler to gather and understand
        both current and historical behaviors and trends. This information can be used to determine
        if the profiler feature set matches reality and has predictive value for model building. 
Create a Batch ProfileCreate a batch profile when you want to create a profile based on telemetry that was       captured in the past. Batch profiles can be used to understand the historical behaviors and       trends. Specify ProfilesYou can specify the profile to use for batch processing as either a JSON file on disk       or by utilizing a profile already loaded into ZooKeeper for use by the streaming profiler. Run the Batch ProfilerCCP provides a script called start_batch_profiler.sh to simplify       running the batch profiler. Run the Batch Profiler in Advanced ModeAs an alternative to using the start_batch_profiler.sh you can run       the batch profiler in advanced mode. Running the batch profiler in advanced mode allows you to       specify certain arguments to customize the profiler.Configure the Batch ProfilerYou can customize the batch profiler to specify where the profiler runs, the format of       the telemetry input, and various other properties available in the batch profiler properties       file.Batch Profiler PropertiesUse the batch profiler properties to configure the batch profiler.
