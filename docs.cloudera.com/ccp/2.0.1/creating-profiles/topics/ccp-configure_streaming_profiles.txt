      Profiler
You can customize the streaming profiler to specify various properties available in
      the profiler.properties file, such as the name and output of the Kafka topic,
      the duration of the profile period, and the name of the HBase table to which the profiles are
      written.

Modify the streaming profiler's properties located at
                  $METRON_HOME/config/profiler.properties to customize them for
               your profiler needs.
See Streaming Profiler Properties for more information on these
               properties.
