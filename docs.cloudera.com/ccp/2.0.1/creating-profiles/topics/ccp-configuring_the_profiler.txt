Install and Configure the
      Profiler
The Profiler is automatically installed and started when you install CCP through
      Ambari. 
The configuration for the Profiler topology is stored in
         ZooKeeper at /metron/topology/profiler. These properties also exist in the
         default installation of CCP at
         $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json. You can change these values
         two ways: with Ambari or on disk and then uploaded to ZooKeeper using
            $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh.

 Display the Ambari user interface and click the Services
               tab. 

noteYou might need to work with your Platform Engineer to modify Profiler
                  values.


 Click Metron in the list of services, then click the
                  Configs tab. 

 Click the Profiler tab.   
Ambari displays a list of Profiler properties that you can use to configure
               Profiler.






Use these properties to configure the Profiler, then click the
                  Save button near the top of the window. 
The profiler input topic is bound to the enrichment output topic. If that
               enrichment output topic is changed, then the profiler will restart as well as the
               enrichment topology.
