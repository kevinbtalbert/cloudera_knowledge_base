Create a Batch
      Profile
Create a batch profile when you want to create a profile based on telemetry that was
      captured in the past. Batch profiles can be used to understand the historical behaviors and
      trends. 

If a profile file does not already exist, create a profile definition by editing
                  $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json as follows:

cat $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json
{
  "profiles": [
    {
      "profile": "hello-world",
      "foreach": "'global'",
      "init":    { "count": "0" },
      "update":  { "count": "count + 1" },
      "result":  "count"
    }
  ],
  "timestampField": "timestamp"
}

If you have not previously created a profile definition, you will need to create
               the profiler.json file.

noteAll of the properties listed above including the
                     timestampField are required in the profiler definition.


Upload the profile definition to ZooKeeper:

source /etc/default/metron
cd $METRON_HOME
bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i config/zookeeper/ -z $ZOOKEEPER

You can validate your upload by reading back the CCP configuration from ZooKeeper
               using the same script:

bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m DUMP -z $ZOOKEEPER
...
PROFILER Config: profiler
{
  "profiles": [
    {
      "profile": "hello-world",
      "onlyif":  "exists(ip_src_addr)",
      "foreach": "ip_src_addr",
      "init":    { "count": "0" },
      "update":  { "count": "count + 1" },
      "result":  "count"
    }
  ]
}


Ensure that you have archived telemetry data available for the batch profiler to
               consume. 
By default, CCP stores this in HDFS at
                  /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/*.

hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/* | wc -l


Check the HBase table to validate that the Profiler is writing the profile.
Remember that the Profiler is flushing the profile every 15 minutes. You will need
               to wait at least this long to start seeing profile data in HBase.

/usr/hdp/current/hbase-client/bin/hbase shell
hbase(main):001:0> count 'profiler'


Review the batch profiler's properties located at
                  $METRON_HOME/config/batch-profiler.properties to ensure that the
               properties are set appropriately for the batch profiler you want to run.
See Batch Profiler Properties for more information on these
               properties.

If you want to run DEBUG logging for the profiler, edit the log4j
               properties file that resides in $SPARK_HOME/config:

log4j.logger.org.apache.metron.profiler.spark=DEBUG

If the log4j file does not exist, you can create one.

Run the batch profiler.

source /etc/default/metron
cd $METRON_HOME
$METRON_HOME/bin/start_batch_profiler.sh


Query for the profile data using the Profiler
         Client.
