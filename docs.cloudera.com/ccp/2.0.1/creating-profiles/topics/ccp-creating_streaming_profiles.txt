    Profile
Create a streaming profile when you want to create a profile based on telemetry that is
    currently being captured, enriched, triaged, and indexed by CCP. 
Ensure that the PROFILE_GET client is correctly configured to
      match your desired Profile configuration before using it to read that Profile. 

Create a streaming profile definition by editing
            $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json.
As an example, in the editor copy/paste the basic "Hello, World" profile below.

{
  "profiles": [
    {
      "profile": "hello-world",
      "foreach": "ip_src_addr",
      "init": { 
         "count": "0" 
       },
      "update": { 
         "count": "count + 1" 
       },
      "result":  "count"
    }
  ]
}


You can also include the timestampField to:
List the system time, which is the time at which you are processing the data.
List the event time, which is the time contained in the data itself. 


Upload the profile definition to ZooKeeper:

source /etc/default/metron
cd $METRON_HOME
bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i config/zookeeper/ -z $ZOOKEEPER

You can validate your upload by reading back the Metron configuration from ZooKeeper
          using the same script. The result should look-like the following.

bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m DUMP -z $ZOOKEEPER
...
PROFILER Config: profiler
{
  "profiles": [
    {
      "profile": "hello-world",
      "onlyif":  "exists(ip_src_addr)",
      "foreach": "ip_src_addr",
      "init":    { "count": "0" },
      "update":  { "count": "count + 1" },
      "result":  "count"
    }
  ]
}


Ensure that test messages are being sent to the Profiler's input topic in Kafka. 
The Profiler will consume messages from the input topic defined in the Profiler's
          configuration (see Configure the Streaming Profiler). By default this is the
          indexing topic.

Check the HBase table to validate that the Profiler is writing the profile. 
Remember that the Profiler is flushing the profile every 15 minutes. You will need to
          wait at least this long to start seeing profile data in HBase.

/usr/hdp/current/hbase-client/bin/hbase shell
hbase(main):001:0> count 'profiler'


Use the Profiler Client to read the profile data. 
The following PROFILE_GET command reads the data written by the hello-world profile.
          This assumes that 10.0.0.1 is one of the values for ip_src_addr contained within the
          telemetry consumed by the Profiler.

source /etc/default/metron
bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER
[Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET( "hello-world", "10.0.0.1", PROFILE_FIXED(30, "MINUTES"))
[451, 448]

This result indicates that over the past 30 minutes, the Profiler stored two values
          related to the source IP address "10.0.0.1". In the first 15 minute period, the IP
          10.0.0.1 was seen in 451 telemetry messages. In the second 15 minute period, the same IP
          was seen in 448 telemetry messages.
Enter quit to exit Stellar.
