      Profiler
CCP provides a script called start_batch_profiler.sh to simplify
      running the batch profiler. 
The start_batch_profiler.sh script assumes
         the following:
The script does one of the following:
Builds the profiles defined in
                        $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json
Utilizes the profiles already loaded into ZooKeeper quorum at
                        $ZOOKEEPER if the environment variable
                        $SPARK_PROFILER_USE_ZOOKEEPER is set.

The properties defined in
                  $METRON_HOME/config/batch-profiler.properties are passed to both
               the profiler and Spark. You can define both Spark and profiler properties in this
               same file.
The script will also configure the event time field to use if the field value is
               stored in the ${SPARK_PROFILER_EVENT_TIMESTAMP_FIELD} environment
               variable.
Spark is installed at /usr/hdp/current/spark-client. This can be
               overridden if you define an environment variable called SPARK_HOME
               prior to executing the script.


Start the batch profile by entering the following:

source /etc/default/metron
cd $METRON_HOME
bin/start_batch_profiler.sh
