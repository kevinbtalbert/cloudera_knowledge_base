Run the Batch Profiler in
      Advanced Mode
As an alternative to using the start_batch_profiler.sh you can run
      the batch profiler in advanced mode. Running the batch profiler in advanced mode allows you to
      specify certain arguments to customize the profiler.

Start the batch profile by entering the following:

${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark-submit \
    --class org.apache.metron.profiler.spark.cli.BatchProfilerCLI \
    --properties-file ${SPARK_PROPS_FILE} \
    ${METRON_HOME}/lib/metron-profiler-spark-*.jar \
    --config ${PROFILER_PROPS_FILE} \
    --profiles ${PROFILES_FILE}

The batch profiler accepts the following arguments when run from the command line.
               All arguments following the profiler jar are passed to the profiler. All argument
               preceeding the profiler jar are passed to Spark.


-p, --profiles
The path to a file containing the profile definition in JSON. Only one of
                           --zookeeper or --profiles should be
                        used.
-z, --zookeeper
The ZooKeeper quorum from which to read profile definitions. Only one of
                           --zookeeper or --profiles should be
                        used.
-t, --timestampfield
Specifies which data field to use for event time. The field to use for
                        event time is usually stored as part of the profile. It can be overridden
                        via this setting.
-c, --config
The path to a file containing key-value properties for the profiler. This
                        file contains the properties described in Batch Profiler Properties.
-g, --globals
The path to a file containing key-value properties that define the global
                        properties. You can use this property to customize how certain Stellar
                        functions behave during execution.
-r, --reader
The path to a file containing key-value properties that are passed to the
                        DataFrameReader when reading the input telemetry. This allows additional
                        customization for how the input telemetry is read.
