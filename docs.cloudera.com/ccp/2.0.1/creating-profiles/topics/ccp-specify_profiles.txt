Specify Profiles
You can specify the profile to use for batch processing as either a JSON file on disk
      or by utilizing a profile already loaded into ZooKeeper for use by the streaming profiler. 

To load a profile from disk:


If a profile file does not already exist, create a profile definition by
                     editing $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json as
                     follows:

cat $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json
{
  "profiles": [
    {
      "profile": "hello-world",
      "foreach": "'global'",
      "init":    { "count": "0" },
      "update":  { "count": "count + 1" },
      "result":  "count"
    }
  ],
  "timestampField": "timestamp"
}



When launching the batch profiler directly, use the --profiles
                        <path to profiler.json> option. 
If using the wrapper script to launch the batch profiler, it will
                     automatically add the command argument --profiles
                        $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json to the batch launching
                     process if $SPARK_PROFILER_USE_ZOOKEEPER is not
                     defined.



To load a profile from ZooKeeper:


Choose to use profiles already loaded into zookeeper (for example, for use by
                     the streaming profiler) by setting the environment variable
                        $SPARK_PROFILER_USE_ZOOKEEPER. 
This will cause the wrapper script to add --zookeeper
                        $ZOOKEEPER to the batch launching process, which will cause the
                     spark profiler to extract profiles from the zookeeper quorum located at
                        $ZOOKEEPER.
