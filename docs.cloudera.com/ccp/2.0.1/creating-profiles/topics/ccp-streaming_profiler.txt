Streaming Profiler
A streaming profile
        creates a profile based on telemetry that is currently being captured, enriched, triaged,
        and indexed by CCP. Streaming profiles can be used to understand real-time behaviors and
        trends. You can use the streaming profiler and the batch profiler to gather and understand
        both current and historical behaviors and trends. This information can be used to determine
        if the profiler feature set matches reality and has predictive value for model building. 
Create a Streaming ProfileCreate a streaming profile when you want to create a profile based on telemetry that is     currently being captured, enriched, triaged, and indexed by CCP. Configure the Streaming ProfilerYou can customize the streaming profiler to specify various properties available in       the profiler.properties file, such as the name and output of the Kafka topic,       the duration of the profile period, and the name of the HBase table to which the profiles are       written.Run the Streaming ProfilerCCP provides a script called start_profiler_topology.sh to simplify       running the Streaming Profiler. Streaming Profiler PropertiesUse the profiler properties to configure the streaming profiler.Troubleshoot Streaming Profiles By Using StellarTroubleshooting issues when programming against a live stream of data can be difficult.     The Stellar REPL (an interactive top level or language shell) is a powerful tool to help work     out the kinds of enrichments and transformations that are needed. The Stellar REPL can also be     used to help when developing profiles for the profiler. Streaming Profile ExamplesYou can use the streaming profiler examples to better understand the functionality     provided by the profiler. Each example shows the configuration that would be required to     generate the profile.Parent topic: Using Profilers
