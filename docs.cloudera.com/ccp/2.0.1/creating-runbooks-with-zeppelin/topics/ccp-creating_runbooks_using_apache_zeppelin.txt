Creating Runbooks Using Apache Zeppelin
Apache Zeppelin is a web-based notebook that supports interactive data exploration,
      visualization, sharing and collaboration. 
HCP users will use Zeppelin
         at two levels:


Senior analysts and data scientists can use Zeppelin to produce notebooks to analyze
        data and to create recreatable investigations or runbooks for junior analysts.


Junior analysts can use recreatable investigations or runbooks in Zeppelin to discover
        cybersecurity issues much like they do with the Metron Dashboard. However, Zeppelin can
        handle larger groups of data.



Setting up Zeppelin to Run with CCPYou can import the Zeppelin Notebook using Ambari or manually. To complete your set up       you'll need to use Zeppelin interpretors and load the telemetry information.Using Zeppelin to Create RunbooksZeppelin enables data scientists and senior analysts to create workbooks for junior       analysts that can be used as runbooks for recreatable investigations. These runbooks can be       static, which require no input from the junior analyst, or dynamic, which require the junior       analyst to enter or choose information. You can see an example of a static type of notebook in       the Metron - YAF Telemetry note. This section provides instructions for creating both kinds of       runbooks.
