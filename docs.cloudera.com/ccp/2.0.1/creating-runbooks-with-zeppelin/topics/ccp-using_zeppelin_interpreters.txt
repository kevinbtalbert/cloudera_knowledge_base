Using Zeppelin Interpreters
When you install
      Zeppelin on CCP the installation includes the interpreter for Spark. Spark is the main backend
      processing engine for Zeppelin. Spark is also a front end for Python, Scala, and SQL and you
      can use any of these languages to analyze the telemetry data.
