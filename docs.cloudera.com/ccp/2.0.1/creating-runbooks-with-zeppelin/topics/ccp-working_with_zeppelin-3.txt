Working with Zeppelin
The Zeppelin user interface consists of notes that are divided into paragraphs. Each
    paragraph consists of two sections: the code section where you put your source code and the
    result section where you can see the result of the code execution. When you use the Spark
    interpreter, you can enter source code in Python, Scala, or SQL. When you run the code from the
    browser, Zeppelin sends the code to a backend processor such as Spark. The processor or service
    then returns results; you can then use Zeppelin to review and visualize results in the browser.
