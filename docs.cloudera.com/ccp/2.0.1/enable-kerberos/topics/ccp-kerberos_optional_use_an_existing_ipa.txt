Optional: Use an Existing IPA
You can use an existing FreeIPA setup with Kerberos.
To use an existing IPA KDC with Automated Kerberos Setup, you must prepare the
                following: 
All cluster hosts should be joined to the IPA domain and
                            registered in DNS- If IPA is not configured to authoritatively
                        manage DNS, explicitly configuring the private IP and corresponding fully
                        qualified domain names of all hosts, in the /etc/hosts file on all the hosts
                        is recommended. 
If you do not plan on using Ambari to manage the krb5.conf
                            file, ensure the following is set in each krb5.conf file in your
                            cluster: default_ccache_name = /tmp/krb5cc_%{uid} -
                        Redhat/Centos 7.x changed the default ticket cache to keyring, which is
                        problematic for the hadoop components. 
The Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) have been setup on the
                            Ambari Server host and all hosts in the cluster- If during
                        installation you chose to use the Ambari provided JDK, this has already been
                        done for you. If you configured a custom JDK, ensure the unlimited strength
                        JCE policies are in place on all nodes. For more information, refer to
                            “Install the JCE for Kerberos”.

Please also note: 

If you plan on leveraging this IPA to create trusts with other KDCs,
                    please follow the FreeIPA “Considerations for Active Directory integration”
                    to ensure your hosts use a non-overlapping DNS domain, with matching uppercase
                    REALM. 
Kerberos authentication allows maximum 3 seconds time discrepancy. Use
                    of IPA’s NTP server or an external time management service is highly recommended
                    for all cluster hosts, including the FreeIPA host.
To avoid exposing the IPA admin account, consider creating a dedicated
                    hadoopadmin account that is a member of the admins group, or has been added to a
                    role with User & Service Administratration privileges. Remember to reset the
                    initial temporary password for the account before use in Ambari. For more
                    details on this process see the section below.


Creating an IPA account for use with Ambari 
Example creating hadoopadmin account with explicit
                privileges# obtain valid ticket as IPA administrator
kinit admin

# create a new principal to be used for ambari kerberos administration
ipa user-add hadoopadmin --first=Hadoop --last=Admin --password

# create a role and and give it privilege to manage users and services
ipa role-add hadoopadminrole
ipa role-add-privilege hadoopadminrole --privileges="User Administrators" 
ipa role-add-privilege hadoopadminrole --privileges="Service Administrators"

# add the hadoopadmin user to the role
ipa role-add-member hadoopadminrole --users=hadoopadmin

# login once, or kinit, to reset the initial temporary password for the hadoopadmin account
kinit hadoopadmin



importantDo not install an Ambari Agent on the IPA host.

IPA leverages the SPNEGO principal (HTTP/ipa.your.domain.com) for secure
                            access to its Web UI component. Installing the Ambari Agent on the IPA
                            host causes the kvno of SPNEGO principal to increase, which causes
                            problems for IPA HTTP server. If you have already accidentally done this
                            and IPA is not able to start, symlink IPA’s http keytab path
                            (/var/lib/ipa/gssproxy/http.keytab) to
                            /etc/security/keytabs/spnego.service.keytab and contact your IPA
                            provider’s support.
The /etc/krb5.conf file on the IPA host has some additional properties
                            not captured in Ambari’s krb5.conf template. Since letting Ambari manage
                            krb5.conf on the cluster hosts is recommended, making the IPA host a
                            part of the cluster is problematic for the IPA services. If you had this
                            option checked when the ambari agent was installed, and do not have a
                            backup of the original krb5.conf, reference the “krb5.conf
                                template” to restore immediate functionality.
