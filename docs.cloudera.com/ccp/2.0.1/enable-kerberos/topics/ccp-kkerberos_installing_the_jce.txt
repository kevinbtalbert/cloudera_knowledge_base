Install the JCE for Kerberos
Before enabling
        Kerberos in the cluster, you must deploy the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) security
        policy files on the Ambari Server and on all hosts in the cluster, including the Ambari
        Server. If you are using OpenJDK, some distributions of the OpenJDK (such as RHEL/CentOS and
        Ubuntu) come with unlimited strength JCE automatically and therefore, installation of JCE is
        not required.

On the Ambari Server, obtain the JCE policy file appropriate for the JDK
                    version in your cluster:
OptionDescription
Oracle JDK 1.8
JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 8 Download

Oracle JDK 1.7
JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 7 Download

wget --no-check-certificate --no-cookies --header "Cookie:
                    oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie"
                    "http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jce/8/jce_policy-8.zip" 

Save the policy file archive in a temporary location.

On Ambari Server and on each host in the cluster, add the unlimited security
                    policy JCE jars to $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/.

For example, run the following to extract the policy jars into the JDK
                        installed on your host:
unzip -o -j -q jce_policy-8.zip -d /usr/jdk64/jdk1.8.0_40/jre/lib/security/


Restart Ambari Server: sudo ambari-server restart.

Proceed to “Running the Kerberos Security Wizard”.
