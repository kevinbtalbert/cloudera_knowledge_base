Set up TGT Renewal
Apache Storm does not handle automatic TGT renewal for running topologies. As a
        result, you must manage the TGT renewal process to ensure that your access does not expire.
        HCP includes a Python script you can use to manage the TGT renewal process. Run the script
        on an interval that is shorter than the renew_lifetime property configured
        for your TGT.

On a node running Storm, install the following:

sudo yum install -y gcc krb5-devel python-devel
sudo yum install -y libffi libffi-devel
sudo yum install -y python-cffi
sudo yum install -y openssl-devel


Set up Python with metron user:

su - metron


Export the following to set your Python home and and Python library
                    paths:

export PYTHON27_HOME=/opt/rh/python27/root
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/rh/python27/root/usr/lib64"


Create a project_dir directory:

mkdir project_dir


Upgrade the Python setuptools to version 18.5 and install
                        requests-kerberos which is an authentication handler for
                    using Kerberos with Python Requests.

${PYTHON27_HOME}/usr/bin/virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade setuptools==18.5
pip install requests-kerberos


Execute the tgt_renew.py script:

su - metron
python $METRON_HOME/bin/tgt_renew.py $HOST:PORT $TOPOLOGY_OWNER

Where: 


HOST:PORT
The port for the Storm UI server.
TOPOLOGY_OWNER
The topology owner is typically "metron" for a Kerberized cluster
                                with Metron topologies.



Create a cron job to run the tgt_renew.py
                script at intervals shorter than the renew_lifetime
            property configured for your TGT.
