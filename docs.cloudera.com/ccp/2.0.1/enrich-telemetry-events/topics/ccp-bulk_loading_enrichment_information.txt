Bulk Loading Enrichment Information
Bulk loading is used to load information that does not change frequently. For example,
      bulk loading is ideal for loading from an asset database on a daily or even weekly basis
      because you don't typically change the number of assets on a network very often.
Enrichment data can be bulk loaded from the local file system, HDFS. The enrichment loader
      transforms the enrichment into a JSON format that is understandable to Metron. The loading
      framework has additional capabilities for aging data out of the enrichment stores based on
      time. Once the stores are loaded, an enrichment bolt that can interact with the enrichment
      store can be incorporated into the enrichment topology.
You can bulk load enrichment information from the following sources:


CSV Flat File Ingestion


HDFS via MapReduce


Taxii Loader



OPTIONAL: Create a Mock Enrichment SourceFor our runbook demonstration, we create a mock enrichment source. In your production       environment you will want to use a genuine enrichment source.Configure an Extractor Configuration FileThe extractor configuration file is used to bulk load the enrichment store into       HBase.Using Stellar Properties to Transform Enrichment DataYou can transform and filter enrichment data as it is loaded into HBase by using       Stellar extractor properties in the extractor configuration file. This feature is available to       all extractor types. This task is optional.Configure Element-to-Enrichment MappingWe now need to configure what element of a tuple should be enriched with what       enrichment type. This configuration is stored in ZooKeeper.Run the Enrichment LoaderAfter the enrichment source and enrichment configuration are defined, you must run the       loader to move the data from the enrichment source to the CCP enrichment store (HBase) and       store the enrichment configuration in ZooKeeper.Parent topic: Enriching Telemetry Events Overview
