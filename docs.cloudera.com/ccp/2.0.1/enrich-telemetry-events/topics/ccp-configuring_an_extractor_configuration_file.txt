Configure an Extractor
      Configuration File
The extractor configuration file is used to bulk load the enrichment store into
      HBase. Log in as root to the host on which Metron is installed.  

sudo -s $METRON_HOME
 Determine the schema of the enrichment source.  
The schema of our mock enrichment source is
               domain|owner|registeredCountry|registeredTimestamp. Create an extractor configuration file called extractor_config.json at
                  $METRON_HOME/config and populate it with the enrichment
               source schema.   
For example:

{
 "config" : {
    "columns" : {
        "domain" : 0
        ,"owner" : 1
        ,"home_country" : 2
        ,"registrar": 3
        ,"domain_created_timestamp": 4
    }
    ,"indicator_column" : "domain"
    ,"type" : "whois"
    ,"separator" : ","
  }
  ,"extractor" : "CSV"
}

 Remove any non-ASCII invisible characters that might have been included if you copy and
               pasted:  

iconv -c -f utf-8 -t ascii extractor_config_temp.json -o extractor_config.json


noteThe extractor_config.json file is not stored anywhere by the
                  loader. This file is used once by the bulk loader to parse the enrichment dataset.
                  If you would like to keep a copy of this file, be sure to save a copy to another
                  location.
