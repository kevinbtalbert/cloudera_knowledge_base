      Element-to-Enrichment Mapping
We now need to configure what element of a tuple should be enriched with what
      enrichment type. This configuration is stored in ZooKeeper. Log in as root user to the host that has Metron installed.  

sudo -s $METRON_HOME
 Copy and paste the following into a file called enrichment_config_temp.json
               at $METRON_HOME/config.  

{
     "zkQuorum" : "$ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181"
    ,"sensorToFieldList" : {
          "squid" : {
             "type" : "THREAT_INTEL"
            ,"fieldToEnrichmentTypes" : {
                 "domain_without_subdomains" : [ "whois" ]
              }
          }
    }
}

 Remove any non-ASCII invisible characters that might have been included if you copy and
               pasted:  

iconv -c -f utf-8 -t ascii enrichment_config_temp.json -o enrichment_config.json
