Enriching Telemetry Events
      Overview
After the raw security telemetry events have been parsed and normalized, you need to
      enrich the data elements of the normalized event.Enrichments add external data from data stores (such as HBase). CCP uses a combination of
         HBase, Storm, and the telemetry messages in json format to enrich the data in real time to
         make it relevant and consumable. You can use this enriched information immediately rather
         than needing to hunt in different silos for the relevant information.CCP supports two
            types of configurations: global and sensor specific. The sensor specific configuration
            configures the individual enrichments and threat intelligence enrichments for a given
            sensor type (for example, squid). This section describes sensor specific
            configurations.CCP
            provides two types of enrichment:
Telemetry events
Threat intelligence information

CCP provides the
            following telemetry enrichment sources but you can add your own enrichment sources to
            suit your needs:

Asset


GeoIP


User

Prior to enabling an
            enrichment capability within CCP, the enrichment store (which for CCP is primarily
            HBase) must be loaded with enrichment data. The dataload utilities convert raw data
            sources to a primitive key (type, indicator) and value and place it in HBase.CCP supports three types
            of enrichment loaders: 

Bulk load from HDFS via MapReduce


Taxii Loader


Flat File ingestion


For simplicity's
            sake, we use the bulk loader to load enrichments: 
Bulk Loading Enrichment InformationBulk loading is used to load information that does not change frequently. For example,       bulk loading is ideal for loading from an asset database on a daily or even weekly basis       because you don't typically change the number of assets on a network very often.Map Fields to HBase EnrichmentsNow that you have data flowing into the HBase table, you need to ensure that the       enrichment topology can be used to enrich the data flowing past. You can refine the parser       output using transformation, enrichment, and threat intelligence.OPTIONAL: Global ConfigurationThe global configuration file is a repository of properties that can be used by any       configurable component in the system.Verify That the Events Are EnrichedAfter you finish enriching your new data source, you should verify that the output       matches your enrichment information. By convention, the index where the new messages are       indexed is called squid_index_[timestamp] and the document type is          squid_doc.
