Run the Enrichment
      Loader
After the enrichment source and enrichment configuration are defined, you must run the
      loader to move the data from the enrichment source to the CCP enrichment store (HBase) and
      store the enrichment configuration in ZooKeeper.
If you will be bulk loading enrichments using the MR mode, add the metron user to
               the access control list of users and groups in the Yarn Queue Manager.
You do not need to perform this step if you use the LOCAL mode.


In Ambari, click  (Ambari views) and choose Yarn Queue
                        Manager.


In the upper left corner of the window, under Add
                        Queue, select default.
Ambari displays the default information on the right side of the
                     window.


By Submit Applications, click
                        Custom.


In the Users field, add
                     metron.
For example:



 Use the loader to move the enrichment source to the enrichment store in ZooKeeper.      
Perform the following from the location containing your extractor and enrichment
               configuration files and your enrichment source. In our example, this information is
               located at $METRON_HOME/config.

$METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh -n enrichment_config.json -i whois_ref.csv -t enrichment -c t -e 
 extractor_config.json

The parameters for the utility are as follows:



Short Code
Long Code
Required
Description



-h

No
Generate the help screen/set of options


-e
--extractor_config
Yes
JSON document describing the extractor for this input data
                              source


-t
--hbase_table
Yes
The HBase table to import into


-c
--hbase_cf
Yes
The HBase table column family to import into


-i
--input
Yes
The input data location on local disk. If this is a file, then
                              that file will be loaded. If this is a directory, then the files will
                              be loaded recursively under that directory.


-l
--log4j
No
The log4j properties file to load


-n
--enrichment_config
No
The JSON document describing the enrichments to configure. Unlike
                              other loaders, this is run first if specified.



CCP loads the enrichment data into Apache HBase and establishes a ZooKeeper
               mapping. The data is extracted using the extractor and configuration defined in the
                  extractor_config.json file and populated into an HBase table
               called enrichment. Verify that the logs were properly ingested into HBase:  

hbase shell
scan 'enrichment'
 Verify that the ZooKeeper enrichment tag was properly populated:  

$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m DUMP -z $ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181

 Generate some data by using the Squid client to execute requests.  


 Use ssh to access the host for Squid. 


 Start Squid and navigate to /var/log/squid:  

sudo service squid start
sudo su - 
cd /var/log/squid



 Generate some data by entering the following:  

squidclient http://www.cnn.com
