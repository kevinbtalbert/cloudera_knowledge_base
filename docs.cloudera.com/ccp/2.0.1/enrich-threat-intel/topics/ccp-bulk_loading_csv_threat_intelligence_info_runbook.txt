Bulk Loading CSV Threat
    Intelligence Information
Metron is designed to work with STIX/Taxii threat feeds, but can also be bulk loaded
    with threat data from a CSV file. Command-separated values (CSV) is a simple file format used to
    store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. Files in the CSV format can be imported
    to and exported from programs that store data in tables.The shell script $METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh reads data from the
      local disk and loads the threat intelligence data into an HBase table. This loader uses the
      special configuration parameter inputFormatHandler to specify how to consider
      the data. The two implementations are BY_LINE and
        org.apache.metron.dataloads.extractor.inputformat.WholeFileFormat. The
      default is BY_LINE, which makes sense for a list of CSVs in which each line
      indicates a unit of information to be imported. However, if you are importing a set of STIX
      documents, then you want each document to be considered as input to the Extractor.
OPTIONAL: Create a Mock CSV Threat Intel Feed SourceCloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) is designed to work with STIX/Taxii threat       feeds, but can also be bulk loaded with threat data from a CSV file. In this example, we       create a mock CSV enrichment source. If your production environment, you will want to use a       genuine enrichment source.Configure a CSV Extractor Configuration FileYou use the extractor configuration file to bulk load the threat intelligence       enrichment store into HBase.Configure Element-to-Threat Intelligence Feed Mapping You now need to configure what element of a tuple should be enriched with what       enrichment type. This configuration is stored in ZooKeeper.Run the Threat Intelligence LoaderNow that you have defined the threat intel source, threat intel extractor, and threat     intel mapping configuration, you must run the loader to move the data from the enrichment source     to the CCP enrichment store (HBase) and store the enrichment configuration in       ZooKeeper.Parent topic: Enriching Threat Intelligence Information
