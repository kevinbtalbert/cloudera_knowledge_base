Configure a CSV Extractor
      Configuration File
You use the extractor configuration file to bulk load the threat intelligence
      enrichment store into HBase.

Log in as root to the host on which Metron is installed.

sudo -s $METRON_HOME


Determine the schema of the threat intelligence source. 
The schema of our mock enrichment source is:

domain | source


 Create an extractor configuration file called
                  threatintel_extractor_config_temp.json at
                  $METRON_HOME/config and populate it with the threat intelligence
               source schema:

{
"config" : {
    "columns" : {
        "domain" : 0
        ,"source" : 1
    }
    ,"indicator_column" : "domain"
    ,"type" : "zeusList"
    ,"separator" : ","
  }
  ,"extractor" : "CSV"
} 



 Remove any non-ASCII invisible characters that might have been included if you
               copy and pasted:  
iconv -c -f utf-8 -t ascii threatintel_extractor_config_temp.json -o
                  threatintel_extractor_config.json
