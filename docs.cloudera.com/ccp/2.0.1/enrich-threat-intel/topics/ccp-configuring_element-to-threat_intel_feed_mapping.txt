      Intelligence Feed Mapping
 You now need to configure what element of a tuple should be enriched with what
      enrichment type. This configuration is stored in ZooKeeper.Log in as root user to the host that has Metron installed.   

sudo -s $METRON_HOME

 Copy and paste the following into a file called
                  threatintel_config_temp.json at
                  $METRON_HOME/config. 

{
  "zkQuorum" : "localhost:2181"
 ,"sensorToFieldList" : {
    "squid" : {
           "type" : "THREAT_INTEL"
          ,"fieldToEnrichmentTypes" : {
             "domand_without_subdomains" : [ "zeusList" ]
                                      }
              }
                        }
}

The threatintel_config_temp.json file causes CCP to look up the
               value of the field in the HBase enrichment. If the field is found, CCP adds the HBase
               field values as new enrichments to the event. 
You must specify the following:


The ZooKeeper quorum which holds the cluster configuration
The mapping between the fields in the enriched documents and the enrichment
                     types.


This configuration allows the ingestion tools to update ZooKeeper post-ingestion
               so that the enrichment topology can take advantage immediately of the new
               type.
 Remove any non-ASCII invisible characters that might have been included if you copy and
               pasted:  

iconv -c -f utf-8 -t ascii threatintel_config_temp.json -o threatintel_config.json
