OPTIONAL: Create a Mock CSV
      Threat Intel Feed Source
Similar to enrichments, we need to set up a data.csv file, the
      extractor config JSON, and the enrichment config JSON. For this example, we use a Zeus malware
      tracker list.Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) is designed to work with STIX/Taxii threat
      feeds, but can also be bulk loaded with threat data from a CSV file. In this example, we
      create a mock CSV enrichment source. If your production environment, you will want to use a
      genuine enrichment source.
 Log into the $HOST_WITH_ENRICHMENT_TAG as root. 
 Copy the contents from the Zeus malware tracker list link to a file called
                  domainblocklist.csv.  

curl -o domainblocklist.txt https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/blocklist.php?download=domainblocklist

Make sure you don't have an empty newline character as the last line of the CSV
               file, as that will result in a null pointer exception.
Similarly to enrichment we will need to process this feed into a CSV so we can bulk
               load it into HBase:

cat domainblocklist.txt | grep -v "^#" | grep -v "^$" | grep -v "^https" | awk '{print $1",abuse.ch"}' > domainblocklist.csv
