Batch Loading Enrichment
      Information
Batch loading is used to load information that does not change frequently. For
      example, batch loading is ideal for loading from an asset database on a daily or even weekly
      basis because you don't typically change the number of assets on a network very
      often.
Enrichment data can be batch loaded from the local file system, HDFS. The enrichment
            loader transforms the enrichment into a JSON format that is understandable to Metron.
            The loading framework has additional capabilities for aging data out of the enrichment
            stores based on time. Once the stores are loaded, you can incorporate an enrichment
            bolt, that can interact with the enrichment store, into the enrichment topology.

Batch Loading SourcesYou can batch load enrichment information from a number of  sources.Configure an Extractor Configuration FileYou use the extractor configuration file to batch load the enrichment store into       HBase. Configure Element-to-Enrichment MappingConfigure which element of a tuple should be enriched with which enrichment type. This       configuration is stored in Apache ZooKeeper.Run the Enrichment LoaderAfter you configure the extractor configuration file and the element-enrichment     mapping, you must run the loader to move the data from the enrichment source to the CCP     enrichment store and store the enrichment configuration in Apache ZooKeeper.Parent topic: Enrichment Overview
