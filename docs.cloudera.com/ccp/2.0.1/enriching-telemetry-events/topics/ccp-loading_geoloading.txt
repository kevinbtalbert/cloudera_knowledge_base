      Information
You need to reload geocoding information periodically because the context will change
      over time.

Ensure that Metron has set the location of the GeoIP database.


From Ambari, display the Metron service.


Enter geo in the search field.
Ambari displays the location under in the GEOIP Load Defaults
                        URL field under Adapter.



To reload the geocoding information into HDFS, as run the following:

cd /usr/hcp/current/metron
sudo su hdfs -c "bin/geo_enrichment_load.sh -z localhost:2181"

CCP downloads the GeoLite2-City database into HDFS.
