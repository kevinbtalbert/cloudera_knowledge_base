      Enrichment By Using the Management User Interface 
The organization enrichment is an HBase enrichment that provides information about
      host, user, and any other assets derived from organizational data sources such as CMDB or
      employee databases. After you establish dataflow to the HBase table, you can use the CCP
      Management user interface or the CLI to ensure that the enrichment topology is enriching the
      data flowing past.
Your sensor must be running and producing data to load sample
         data.

From the list of sensors in the Management user interface main window, select your
               sensor. 

Click the pencil icon in the toolbar. 
The Management UI displays the sensor panel for the sensor.

In the Schema box, click    (expand window). 
The Management UI displays a panel for the sensor.


From INPUT FIELD, select the field to transform, enter the name of the new field in
               the NAME field, and then choose a function with the appropriate parameters in the
               TRANSFORMATIONS box. 

From the ENRICHMENTS field, choose the appropriate
               enrichment type.

Click SAVE. 
If you change your mind and want to remove a transformation, click the "x" next to
               the field.

You can also suppress fields with the transformation feature by clicking 
               (suppress icon). 
This icon prevents the field from being displayed, but it does not remove the
               field entirely.

Click SAVE.
