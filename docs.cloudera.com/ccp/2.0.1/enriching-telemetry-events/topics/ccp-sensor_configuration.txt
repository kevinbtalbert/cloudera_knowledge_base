Sensor Configuration
You can use the sensor-specific configuration to configure the individual enrichments
    and threat intelligence enrichments for a given sensor type (for example, Snort). The sensor
    configuration format is a JSON object stored in Apache ZooKeeper.
The sensor enrichment configuration uses the following fields:


fieldToTypeMap
In the case of a simple HBase enrichment (a key/value lookup), the mapping between
              fields and the enrichment types associated with those fields must be known. This
              enrichment type is used as part of the HBase key. Note: applies to hbaseEnrichment
              only. | `"fieldToTypeMap" : { "ip_src_addr" : [ "asset_enrichment" ] }`
                |
fieldMap
The map of enrichment bolts names to configuration handlers which know how to divide
              the message. The simplest of which is just a list of fields. More complex examples
              would be the Stellar enrichment which provides tellar statements. Each field listed in
              the array arg is sent to the enrichment referenced in the key. Cardinality of fields
              to enrichments is many-to-many. | `"fieldMap": {"hbaseEnrichment":
                ["ip_src_addr","ip_dst_addr"]}` |
config
The general configuration for the enrichment.


The `config` map is intended
        to house enrichment specific configuration. For instance, for
          hbaseEnrichment, the mappings between the enrichment types to the column
        families is specified.
The
          fieldMap contents are of interest because they contain the routing and
        configuration information for the enrichments. When we say 'routing', we mean how the
        messages get split up and sent to the enrichment adapter bolts.
The simplest, by far, is just providing a simple list as in
"fieldMap": {
      "geo": [
        "ip_src_addr",
        "ip_dst_addr"
      ],
      "host": [
        "ip_src_addr",
        "ip_dst_addr"
      ],
      "hbaseEnrichment": [
        "ip_src_addr",
        "ip_dst_addr"
      ]
      }
Based on this sample config,
        both ip_src_addr and ip_dst_addr will go to the `geo`,
        `host`, and `hbaseEnrichment` adapter bolts.
