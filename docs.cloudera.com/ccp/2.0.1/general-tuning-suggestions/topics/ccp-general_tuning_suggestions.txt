General Tuning Suggestions
Tuning Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) depends in large part on tuning three
    areas: Kafka, Storm, and indexing.
Indexing is where most of your tuning issues are likely to occur because it is the most IO
      intensive.
The second area that needs
      tuning is parallelism in both Kafka and Storm. The performance of the Storm topology and
      therefore the performance of Metron, degrades when it cannot ingest data fast enough to keep
      up with the data source. Therefore, much of Metron tuning focuses on adjusting the data
      throughput of the Storm topologies. For more information on tuning a Storm topology, see Apache Storm Overview.
The third area that requires analysis and tuning is consumer lags on the key Kafka topics:
      enrichment, indexing, parser.
When tuning your Metron configuration, consider the following:



Look at Elasticsearch and Solr tuning


Assign small values for parallelism, and increase values incrementally


Aim for an even balance across your topologies


Check your system logs for the following:


Empty results - may indicate that your data is broken


Kafka - Consumer lags on key Kafka topics


Load average or system latency - a high load average might indicate underlying
                stress on the machine


Exceptions - Any exceptions shown in the Storm log or key topologies can indicate
                possible problems with underlying systems and data




What topology do I want to tune?


What is the capacity of Storm topology?



It is also important to
      consider the growth of your cluster and data flow. You might want to set the number of tasks
      higher than the number of executors to accommodate for future performance tuning and
      rebalancing without the need to bring down your topologies.
