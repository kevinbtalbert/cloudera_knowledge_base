    CCP
Tuning your Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) architecture can help maximize the
    performance of the Apache Metron Storm topologies.
In the simplest terms, CCP
      powered by Apache Metron is a streaming architecture created on top of Kafka and three main
      types of Storm topologies: parsers, enrichment, and indexing. Each parser has its own topology
      and there is also a highly performant, specialized spout-only topology for streaming PCAP data
      to HDFS. 
The CCP architecture can be tuned almost exclusively using a few primary Storm and Kafka
      parameters along with a few Metron-specific options. You can think of the data flow as being
      similar to water flowing through a pipe, and the majority of these options assist in tweaking
      the various pipe widths in the system.
