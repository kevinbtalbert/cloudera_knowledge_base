Snort
Snort is a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that is being used to generate
      alerts identifying known bad events. Snort relies on a fixed set of rules that act as
      signatures for identifying abnormal events. Along with displaying the relevant details of each
      alert, the panel shows that there is only a single unique alert type; a test rule that creates
      a Snort alert on every network packet. Another table was created to show source/destination
      pairs that generated the most Snort alerts.
