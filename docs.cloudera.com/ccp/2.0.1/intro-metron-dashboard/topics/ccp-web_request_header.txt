Web Request Header
The Bro Network Security Monitor extracts application-level information from raw
    network packets. In this example, Bro is extracting HTTP and HTTPS requests being made over the
    network. The panels highlight the breakdown by request type, the total number of web requests,
    and raw details from each web request.
