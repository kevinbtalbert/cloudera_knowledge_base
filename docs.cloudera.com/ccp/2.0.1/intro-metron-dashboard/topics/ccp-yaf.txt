YAF
As part of the default sensor suite, YAF is used to generate flow records. These flow
      records provide significant visibility into which actors are communicating over the target
      network. A table panel displays the raw details of each flow record. A histogram of the
      duration of each flow illustrates that while most flows are relatively short-lived there are a
      few that are much longer in this example. Creating an index template that defined this field
      as numeric was required to generate the histogram.
