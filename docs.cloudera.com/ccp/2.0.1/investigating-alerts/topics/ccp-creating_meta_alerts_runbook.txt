Create Meta Groups
Another way you can group filtered alerts is by creating meta alerts. This enables you
      to deal with the group as a single instance. You can create meta alerts at any of the various
      levels of groups.
Select a groups of alerts on which you want to focus, then click   (meta
               alert icon) and confirm that you wish to create a meta alert.
The meta alert disappears from the tree view. You can still see the meta alert in
               the alerts table view.

You can rename your meta alert by completing the following steps: 


Display the Alerts UI display panel by clicking on empty space in the meta
                     alert row.


Alerts Information Panel





Click the current meta alert name at the top of the panel and enter your new
                     meta alert name.


Dismiss the panel by clicking the X in the upper right corner of the
                     panel.
