Escalating Alerts
You can escalate one or more alerts at a time to create an event that can be tracked by
    an external ticketing system.

 Select an alert by clicking on empty space in the alert row. 
The Alerts UI displays a panel listing the status of the alert all available data in
          Elasticsearch about the alert.






The current alert status is highlighted.

note
To manage more than one alert at a time, click the check boxes at the end of alert
              rows, then select the action you want to perform from the ACTIONS menu.



 Click Escalate.

CCP writes the event to a Kafka escalation topic. An external orchestration software
          can pick up the event from the topic and use the API to create an incident or append to an
          existing incident.

 You can also add a comment to this action by clicking  (Comment
          button), entering your comment in the Comments field, and clicking
            ADD COMMENT.
