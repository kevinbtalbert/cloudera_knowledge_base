Filter Alerts
The first Alerts UI feature you can use to focus your data is
      Filters. You can use Filters to choose the type
    of data you are viewing.

In the Filters panel on the left of the window, click the
            Bro filter.
The central panel of the Alerts UI displays all of the Bro data it has
          received.

note
Next to the Bro filter, the UI displays the total number of Bro alerts.




 You can continue to apply filters to the alerts displayed in the
            Alerts window to further refine the alerts list.    
As you select filters and facets, they are displayed in the
            Searches field.
For example, in the following figure, we've applied the source.type
          filter with the bro facet and then the ip_dst_addr
          filter with the IP address 95.163.121.204.


 To clear filters that have been populated to the Searches
          field, click  (delete icon) at the end of the Searches
          field.
