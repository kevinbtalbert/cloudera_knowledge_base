Investigating Alerts
      Overview
The Alerts user interface frequently produces large amounts of data. You can use
      features of the Alerts UI to refine and investigate the alert information to identify
      malicious events.
Filter AlertsThe first Alerts UI feature you can use to focus your data is       Filters. You can use Filters to choose the type     of data you are viewing.Group AlertsFrequently, there are a large number of alerts contained in each of the          Filters. To further refine the alert data, you can use the          Group By feature. In addition to limiting the type of data you are       viewing, you can apply searches, status, etc. to all the alerts in a group at the same time. Create Meta GroupsAnother way you can group filtered alerts is by creating meta alerts. This enables you       to deal with the group as a single instance. You can create meta alerts at any of the various       levels of groups.Escalating AlertsYou can escalate one or more alerts at a time to create an event that can be tracked by     an external ticketing system.
