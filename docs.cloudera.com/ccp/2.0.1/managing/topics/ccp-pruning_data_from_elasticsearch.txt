Prune Data from
    Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch provides tooling to prune index data through its Curator utility.  Use the following command to prune the Elasticsearch data:    
The following is a sample invocation that you can configure through Cron to prune
          indexes based on the timestamp in the index name.

/opt/elasticsearch-curator/curator_cli --host localhost delete_indices --filter_list '
     {
       "filtertype": "age",
       "source": "name",
       "timestring": "%Y.%m.%d",
       "unit": "days",
       "unit_count": 10,
       "direction": "older‚Äù
     }'

Using name as the source value causes Curator to
          look for a timestring value within the index or snapshot name, and to
          convert that into an epoch timestamp (epoch implies UTC). For finer-grained control over indexes pruning, provide multiple filters as an array of JSON
          objects to filter_list. Chaining multiple filters implies logical
            AND.  

--filter_list '[{"filtertype":"age","source":"creation_date","direction":"older","unit":"days","unit_count":13},
{"filtertype":"pattern","kind":"prefix","value":"logstash"}]'

For finer-grained control over the indexes pruning that will be pruned, you can also
          provide multiple filters as an array of JSON objects to filter_list.
          Chaining multiple filters implies there is an implicit logical AND when
          chaining multiple filters.

--filter_list '[{"filtertype":"age","source":"creation_date","direction":"older","unit":"days","unit_count":13},
{"filtertype":"pattern","kind":"prefix","value":"logstash"}]'
