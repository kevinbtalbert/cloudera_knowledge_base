        Dashboard Backup
You can restore a back up of your Metron dashboard by writing the Kibana dashboard to
        Solr or Elasticsearch.

To restore a back up of your Metron dashboard, you can write the Kibana
                    dashboard to Solr or Elasticsearch.
For example:

python packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/KIBANA/5.6.x/package/scripts/dashboard/dashboardindex.py \
  $ES_HOST 9200 \
 $SOME_PATH/dashboard.p

Note that this overwrites the .kibana index.
