Start a Sensor
After you install a sensor, you can start it using Management user
      interface. From the main window, click  (start) in the  (tool bar) on the right side of the
               window. 





Starting the sensor might take a few minutes. When the operation completes
               successfully, the Status value for the sensor changes to Running.
