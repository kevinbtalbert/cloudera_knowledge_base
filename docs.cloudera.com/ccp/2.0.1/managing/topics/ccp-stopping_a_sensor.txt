Stop a Sensor
After you install a sensor, you can stop it using the Management user
      interface. From the main window, click  (stop) in  (tool bar) on the right side of the
               window.  





Stopping the sensor might take a few minutes. When the operation completes
               successfully, the Status value for the sensor changes to Stopped.
