Update Properties
Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) configuration information is stored in Apache
      ZooKeeper as a series of JSON files. 
You can populate your
            ZooKeeper configurations from multiple locations:


$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper


Management UI


Ambari


Stellar REPL


Because Ambari explicitly manages some of these configuration properties, if you change a
      property explicitly managed by Ambari from a mechanism outside of Ambari, such as the
      Management UI, Ambari is aware of this change and overwrites it whenever the Metron topology
      is restarted. Therefore, you should modify Ambari-managed properties only in Ambari.
For example, the es.ip property is managed explicitly by Ambari. If you
      modify es.ip and change the global.json file outside
      Ambari, you will not see this change in Ambari. Meanwhile, the indexing topology would be
      using the new value stored in ZooKeeper. You will not receive any errors notifying you of the
      discrepancy between ZooKeeper and Ambari. However, when you restart the Metron topology
      component via Ambari, the es.ip property would be set back to the value
      stored in Ambari.
Following are the Ambari-managed properties:
