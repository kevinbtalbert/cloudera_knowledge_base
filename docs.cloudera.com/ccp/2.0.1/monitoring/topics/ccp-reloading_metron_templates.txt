      Templates
Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) provides templates that display the default
      format for the Metron UI dashboards. You might want to reload these templates if the Metron UI
      is not displaying the default dashboard panes, or if you would like to return to the default
      format. From web browser, display the Ambari UI:  

https://$METRON_HOME:8080
 Click the Services tab.  Select Kibana in the left pane of the window.  




 From the Service Actions menu, select Load
                  Template.  In the Confirmation dialog box, click the OK.    





Ambari displays a dialog box listing the background operations it is
               running.




 In the Background Operation Runningdialog box, click
                  OK to dismiss the dialog box.  
Ambari has completed loading the Metron template. You should be able to see the
               default formatting in the Metron dashboards.
