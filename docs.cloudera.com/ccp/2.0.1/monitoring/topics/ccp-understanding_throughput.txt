Data flow for CCP occurs in real-time and involves Apache Kafka files ingesting raw
      telemetry data; parsing it into a structure that CCP can read; enriching it with asset, geo,
      and threat intelligence information; and indexing and storing the enriched data. 
 Depending on the type of data streaming into CCP, streaming occurs using Apache NiFi,
         performance networking ingestion probes, or real-time and batch threat intelligence feed loaders.

Apache Kafka ingests information from telemetry data sources rough the telemetry
                  event buffer. 
This information is the raw telemetry data consisting of host logs, firewall logs,
                  emails, and network data. Depending on the type of data you are streaming into
                  CCP, you can use one of the following telemetry data collectors to ingest the
                  data:

NiFi

This type of streaming works for most types of telemetry data sources.
                           See the NiFi documentation for more information,

Performant network ingestion probes

This type of streaming works for streaming high volume packet data. 

Real-time and batch threat intelligence feed loaders

This type of streaming works for real-time and batch threat intelligence
                           feed loaders.




After the data is ingested into Kafka files, it is parsed into a normalized JSON
                  structure that CCP can read. This information is parsed using a Java or general
                  purpose parser and then it is uploaded to Apache ZooKeeper. A Kafka file
                  containing the parser information is created for every telemetry data source.


The information is enriched with asset, geo, and threat intelligence
                  information.


The information is indexed and stored, and any resulting alerts are sent to the
                  Metron dashboard.
