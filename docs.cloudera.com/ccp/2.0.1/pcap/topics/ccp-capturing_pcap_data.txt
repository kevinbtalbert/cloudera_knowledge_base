Capturing PCAP Data
In your production environment there is likely to be one or more hosts configured with
      one or more span ports that receives raw packet data from a packet aggregation device. You can
      use one of HCP's packet capture programs to capture the PCAP data; pycapa and DPDK. These
      programs are responsible for capturing the raw packet data off the wire and sending that data
      to Kafka where it can be ingested by HCP.
The following example uses Pycapa.
service pycapa start
If everything worked correctly, the raw packet data can be consumed from a Kafka topic
      called pcap. The data is binary.

$ /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh -z zookeeper1:2181 --topic pcap
