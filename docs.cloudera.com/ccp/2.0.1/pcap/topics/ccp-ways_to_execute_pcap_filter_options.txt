Methods to Execute PCAP
      Filter Options
CCP provides two methods that you can use to query pcap data using the filter options.
      The two available methods are: PCAP user interface and command line. The PCAP user interface
      uses the fixed filter option. The CLI method can use either the fixed filter option or the
      query filter option.
Using the PCAP Panel UI to Query PCAP DataThe PCAP panel user interface is ideally suited for the SOC analyst who is identifying       and investigating malicious events. You can use the PCAP panel to refine query information       provided by other UIs such as the Alerts or Kibana tools. The PCAP panel uses the fixed filter       option to query the PCAP data. The PCAP panel provides a graphical user interface to       explicitly define the parameters used in the query.Using the CLI to Query PCAP Data With the Fixed Filter OptionYou can use the CLI to run both types of filter queries. When using the CLI with the       fixed filter option, you can utilize more options that you can when using the PCAP panel user       interface. For example, the PCAP panel user interface does not have an option to specify the       number of reducers to use. The fixed filter filters PCAP data by the packet header. The filter       runs on explicit matches only so you cannot use any specialized functions or comparison       operators.Using the CLI to Query PCAP Data With the Query Filter OptionOnly the CLI enables you to use the query filter option. The query filter leverages       Stellar and allows you to more flexibly define the parameters used by the query. This filter       option uses a binary regular expression that can be run on the packet payload itself. The       query filter option can produce a very large output and create multiple files populating them       with the specified number of records and titling them with timestamps.Parent topic: Using PCAP
