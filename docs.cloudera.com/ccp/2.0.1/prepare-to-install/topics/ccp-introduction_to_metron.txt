Introduction to Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform
Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) is a cybersecurity application framework that
    provides the ability to parse diverse security data feeds, enrich, triage, and store the data at
    scale, and detect cybersecurity anomalies.
CCP integrates a variety of open source big data technologies in order to offer a centralized
      tool for security monitoring and analysis. CCP provides capabilities for log aggregation, full
      packet capture indexing, storage, advanced behavioral analytics and data enrichment, while
      applying the most current threat intelligence information to security telemetry within a
      single platform.
