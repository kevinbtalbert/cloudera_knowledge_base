Maximum Open File Descriptors
Prior to installing CCP, ensure that you meet the maximum number of open file
    descriptors required by CCP.
The recommended maximum number of open file descriptors is 50,000, or more. To check the
        current value set for the maximum number of open file descriptors, execute the following
        shell commands on each host:
ulimit -Sn

ulimit -Hn
If the output is not greater than 50,000, run the following command to set it to a
        suitable default:
ulimit -n 50000
