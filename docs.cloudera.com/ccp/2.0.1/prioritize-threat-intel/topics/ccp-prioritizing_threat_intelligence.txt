Prioritizing Threat
      Intelligence Overview
Not all threat intelligence indicators are equal. Some require immediate response,
      while others can be dealt with or investigated as time and availability permits. As a result
      you need to triage and rank threats by severity.
In Cloudera Cybersecurity
            Platform (CCP), you assign severity by associating possibly complex conditions with
            numeric scores. Then, for each message, you use a configurable aggregation function to
            evaluate the set of conditions and to aggregate the set of numbers for matching
            conditions. This aggregated score is added to the message in the
               threat.triage.level field. 

PrerequisitesBefore you can prioritize a threat intelligence enrichment, you must ensure that the       enrichment is working properly. Threat Triage ExamplesThreat triage rules identify the conditions in the data source data flow and associate       alert scores with those conditions. Perform Threat TriageTo create a threat triage rule configuration, you must first define your rules. These       rules identify the conditions in the data source data flow and associate alert scores with       those conditions.
