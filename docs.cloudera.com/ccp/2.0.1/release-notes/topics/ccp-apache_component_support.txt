Apache Component Support
Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) 2.0.1 is built on HDP 3.1.4 and HDF 3.3.1 and
      later. The official Apache versions of all CCP 2.0.1 components are:

Apache Metron 0.7.1



HDP supported component versions


All components
            listed are official Apache releases of the most recent stable versions available.The Hortonworks approach
            is to provide patches only when necessary, to ensure the interoperability of components.
            Unless you are explicitly directed by Hortonworks Support to take a patch update, each
            of the CCP components should remain at the package version levels listed in the Support
            Matrix to ensure a certified and supported copy of CCP 2.0.1.note
