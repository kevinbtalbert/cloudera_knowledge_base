Community Features
Some Apache Community features are developed and tested by the Hortonworks community
      but are not officially supported by Hortonworks. These features are excluded for a variety of
      reasons, including insufficient reliability or incomplete test case coverage, declaration of
      non-production readiness by the community at large, and feature deviation from Hortonworks
      best practices. Do not use these features in your production environments.
