      Repositories
You can download CCP 2.0.1 from HCP repository locations specific to the operating
      system you use. 
Use the following table to
            identify the HCP 2.0.1 repo location for your operating system and operational
            objectives:
noteAlthough HCP has been rebranded to CCP, the product management pack
            is still named HCP and it is still located in the hortonworks
            repository in the HCP directory.
note
When installing Elasticsearch with the management pack on Ubuntu, you must
                manually install the Elasticsearch repositories. The management pack does not do
                this, like it does on CentOS.
