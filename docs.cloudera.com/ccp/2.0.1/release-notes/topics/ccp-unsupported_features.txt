Unsupported Features
Although some features exist with CCP 2.0.1, Hortonworks does not support some
        community features and technical preview features.
Community FeaturesSome Apache Community features are developed and tested by the Hortonworks community       but are not officially supported by Hortonworks. These features are excluded for a variety of       reasons, including insufficient reliability or incomplete test case coverage, declaration of       non-production readiness by the community at large, and feature deviation from Hortonworks       best practices. Do not use these features in your production environments.Technical Preview FeaturesSome features included in the CCP 2.0.1 release are not yet officially supported by       Hortonworks. These technical preview features are still under development and are not       recommended for a production environment.
