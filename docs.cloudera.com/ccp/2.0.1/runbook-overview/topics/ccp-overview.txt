Introduction to the CCP
      Runbook
After installing Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform, you must set up Cloudera
      Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) to monitor your data. To set up CCP you must add new telemetry
      data sources, enrich telemetry events, triage threat intelligence information, and ensure
      telemetry events are viewable in the user interface.
Unlike other CCP
         documentation, the Runbook provides detailed examples that are populated with information
         specific to the Squid data source. Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP,
         HTTPS, FTP, and more. It reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and
         reusing frequently-requested web pages.
The following sections guide you through how to add the Squid telemetry to CCP. The
         following procedures use the Management module UI whenever possible. If you would like to
         see these steps performed using the CLI, see the CCP Administration Guide.
