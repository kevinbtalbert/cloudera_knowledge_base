Introduction to Using
      Zeppelin With CCP
The Zeppelin dashboard is intended for use by Security Operations Center (SOC)
      analysts and investigators. 
Like the Metron dashboard, the Zeppelin dashboard can be used to view and analyze the
         enriched telemetry data provided by CCP. However Zeppelin can be used by a data scientist
         to create runbooks for recreatable investigations. These runbooks can be static, which
         require no input, or dynamic, which require you to enter or choose information.
