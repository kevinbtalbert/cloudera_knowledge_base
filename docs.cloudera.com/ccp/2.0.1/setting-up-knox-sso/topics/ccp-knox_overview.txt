Knox OverviewCloudera DocsKnox Overview
Apache Knox is a REST API and Application Gateway for the Apache Hadoop Ecosystem.
        Knox acts as a reverse proxy for all UIs and the REST application. You can use Knox for its
        proxying and authentication services.
Knox provides several security benefits:

All requests go through Knox so same-origin browser restrictions are not a
                concern.
Knox, in combination with a firewall, can restrict traffic to always go through
                Knox. This greatly reduces the security attack surface area of the UIs and REST
                application.
Knox provides access to other common Apache Hadoop services.
Knox provides a single sign on experience between the UIs and REST application.
All requests can be protected and secured.
