Enable Transparent Huge Pages
The Fastcapa probe performs its own memory management by leveraging Transparent Huge
    Pages (THP). In Linux, you can use the Transparent Huge Pages to enable either dynamically or
    automatically upon startup. Hortonworks recommends that these be allocated on boot to increase
    the chance that a larger, physically contiguous chunk of memory allocated.
For better performance, allocate 1 GB THPs if supported by your
      CPU. Ensure that your CPU supports 1 GB THPs. A CPU flag pdpe1gb indicates whether
          or not the CPU supports 1 GB THPs.  

grep --color=always pdpe1gb /proc/cpuinfo | uniq

 Edit /etc/default/grub to add the following book parameters at the line
          starting with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX:  

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=... default_hugepagesz=1G hugepagesz=1G hugepages=16
 Rebuild the Grub configuration then reboot. The location of the Grub configuration file will
          differ across Linux distributions.  

cp /etc/grub2-efi.cfg /etc/grub2-efi.cfg.orig
/sbin/grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2-efi.cfg
 After the host reboots, ensure that the THPs were successfully allocated:    

$ grep HugePage /proc/meminfo
AnonHugePages:    933888 kB
HugePages_Total:      16
HugePages_Free:        0
HugePages_Rsvd:        0
HugePages_Surp:        0


The total number of huge pages should be distributed fairly evenly across each
          non-uniform memory access (NUMA) node. In the following example, a total of 16 requested
          THPs are distributed as 8 to each of 2 NUMA nodes:

$ cat /sys/devices/system/node/node*/hugepages/hugepages-1048576kB/nr_hugepages
8
8

 After the THPs are reserved, mount them to make them available to the probe:  

cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig
mkdir -p /mnt/huge_1GB
echo "nodev /mnt/huge_1GB hugetlbfs pagesize=1GB 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
mount -fav
