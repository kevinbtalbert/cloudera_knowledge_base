Fastcapa Counters Output
When running the Fastcapa probe, some basic counters are output to
         stdout. During normal operation these values are much
      larger.

                                ------ in ------  --- queued --- ----- out ----- ---- drops ----
[nic]               8               -               -               -
[rx]                8               0                8                0
[tx]                8               0                8                0
[kaf]               8               1                7                0

                        



[nic] + in : The Ethernet device is reporting that it has seen
                eight packets.



[rx] + in : The receive workers have consumed eight packets from
                the device.



[rx] + out : The receive workers have enqueued 8 packets onto the
                transmission rings.



[rx] + drops : If the transmission rings become full, it prevents
                receive workers from enqueuing additional packets. The excess packets are dropped.
                This value never decreases.



[tx] + in : The transmission workers consumed 8 packets.



[tx] + out : The transmission workers packaged 8 packets into Kafka
                messages.



[tx] + drops : If the Kafka client library accepted fewer packets
                than expected. This value might change as additional packets are acknowledged by the
                Kafka client library



[kaf] + in : The Kafka client library received 8 packets.



[kaf] + out : A total of 7 packets successfully reached
                Kafka.



[kaf] + queued : There is 1 packet within the rdkafka
                queue
