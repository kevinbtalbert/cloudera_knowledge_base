Install Librdkafka
Install the Apache Kafka C/C++ client library (librdkafka) to assist in configuring
      Fastcapa.
The Fastcapa probe has been tested with Librdkafka 0.9.4. Specify an installation path for librdkafka:   

export RDK_PREFIX=/usr/local

In the following example, the libs will actually be installed at
                  /usr/local/lib; note that lib is appended to the
               prefix. Download, build, and install librdkafka:  

wget https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/archive/v0.9.4.tar.gz  -O - | tar -xz
cd librdkafka-0.9.4/
./configure --prefix=$RDK_PREFIX
make 
make install

 Ensure that the installation s on the search path for the runtime shared library loader:  

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$RDK_PREFIX/lib
