Enable Transparent Huge PagesThe Fastcapa probe performs its own memory management by leveraging Transparent Huge     Pages (THP). In Linux, you can use the Transparent Huge Pages to enable either dynamically or     automatically upon startup. Hortonworks recommends that these be allocated on boot to increase     the chance that a larger, physically contiguous chunk of memory allocated.Install DPDKAfter you enable transparent huge pages, you must install a data plane development kit     (DPDK) and the associated network interface controller (NIC). Install LibrdkafkaInstall the Apache Kafka C/C++ client library (librdkafka) to assist in configuring       Fastcapa.Install FastcapaAfter you enabled transparent huge pages, and installed both DPDK and librdkafka, you       can install Fastcapa.Parent topic: Setting up pcap Overview
