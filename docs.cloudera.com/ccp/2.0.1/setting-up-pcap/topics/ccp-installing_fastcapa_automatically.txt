Install Fastcapa
        Automatically
Installing Fastcapa has several steps and involves building Data Plan Development Kit
        (DPDK), loading specific kernel modules, enabling huge page memory, and binding compatible
        network interface cards.
The best documentation for installing the Fastcapa probe is code that actually does this
                for you. You can use an Ansible role that performs the entire installation:
                    metron-deployment/roles/fastcapa.
