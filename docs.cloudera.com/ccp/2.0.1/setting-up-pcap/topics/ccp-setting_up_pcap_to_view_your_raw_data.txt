Setting up pcap
      Overview
Because the pcap data source creates an Apache Storm topology that can rapidly ingest
      raw data directly into HDFS from Apache Kafka, you can store all of your cybersecurity data in
      its raw form in HDFS and review or query it at a later date. 
CCP supports two pcap components:

The pycapa tool, for low-volume packet capture


The Fastcapa tool, or high-volume packet capture
Fastcapa is a probe that performs fast network packet capture by leveraging
                     Linux kernel-bypass and user space networking technology. The probe will bind
                     to a network interface, capture network packets, and send the raw packet data
                     to Kafka. This provides a scalable mechanism for ingesting high-volumes of
                     network packet data into a Hadoop cluster.
Fastcapa leverages the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK). DPDK is a set of
                     libraries and drivers to perform fast packet processing in Linux user
                     space.




Set up pycapaYou can use the pycapa tool to capture low-volume data flow.Start pcapTo start pcap, CCP provides a utility script. This script takes no arguments and is       very simple to run. Installing FastcapaYou can install Fastcapa either automatically or manually. The automated installation       is the simplest but it requires CentOS 7.1. If you are not running CentOS 7.1 or would like       more visibility into the installation process, you can manually install Fastcapa.Using FastcapaYou can use the Fastcapa tool to capture high-volume data flow.Use Fastcapa in a Kerberized EnvironmentYou can use the Fastcapa probe in a Kerberized environment.
