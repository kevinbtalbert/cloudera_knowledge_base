Start pcap
To start pcap, CCP provides a utility script. This script takes no arguments and is
      very simple to run.  Log in to the host on which you are running Metron. 
 If you are running CCP on an Ambari-managed cluster, perform the following steps;
               otherwise proceed with Step 3: 



You can retrieve the appropriate server information from Ambari in
                        Kafka service > Configs
                     > Kafka Broker >
                        zookeeper.connect.


On the HDFS host, create /apps/metron/pcap, change its
                     ownership to metron:hadoop, and change its permissions to 775:

hdfs dfs -mkdir /apps/metron/pcap
hdfs dfs -chown metron:hadoop /apps/metron/pcap
hdfs dfs -chmod 755 /apps/metron/pcap



Create a Metron user's home directory on HDFS and change its ownership to the
                     Metron user:

hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/metron
hdfs dfs -chown metron:hadoop /user/metron
hdfs dfs -chmod 755 /user/metron



Create a pcap topic in Kafka:


Switch to metron user:
su - metron

Create a Kafka topic named pcap:
/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh \
--zookeeper $ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181 \
--create \
--topic pcap \
--partitions 1 \
--replication-factor 1

List all of the Kafka topics, to ensure that the new pcap topic exists:
/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper $ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181 --list






 If CCP is installed on an Ambari-managed cluster, use the following command to
               tart the pcap topology: 

su - metron $METRON_HOME/bin/start_pcap_topology.sh


 If CCP is installed by CLI, use the following command to start the pcap topology. 

$METRON_HOME/bin/start_pcap_topology.sh

 Check the Storm topology to ensure that packets are being captured.   
After Storm has captured a sufficient number of packets, you can check to ensure
               it is creating files on HDFS:

hadoop fs -ls /apps/metron/pcap
