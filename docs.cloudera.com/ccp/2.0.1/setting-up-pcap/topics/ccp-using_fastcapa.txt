Using Fastcapa
You can use the Fastcapa tool to capture high-volume data flow. Create a configuration file that, at a minimum, specifies your Kafka broker:   

[kafka-global]
metadata.broker.list = kafka-broker1:9092


You can view the example configuration file conf/fastcapa.conf to
          learn other useful parameters. If the capture device is not bound, bind it:  

ifdown enp9s0f0
modprobe uio_pci_generic
$DPDK_HOME/sbin/dpdk-devbind --bind=uio_pci_generic "09:00.0"
 Run Fastcapa:  

fastcapa -c 0x03 --huge-dir /mnt/huge_1GB -- -p 0x01 -t pcap -c /etc/fastcapa.conf

 Terminate Fastcapa and clear the queue by usingSIGINT or by typing
            CTRL-C.   
The probe will cleanly shut down all of the workers and allow the backlog of packets
          to drain.
To terminate the process without clearing the queue, use SIGKILL or
            enterkillall -9 fastcapa.
Fastcapa Environmental Abstraction Layer ParametersThe most commonly used DPDK Environmental Abstraction Layer (EAL) parameter             involves specifying which logical CPU cores should be used for processing.Fastcapa-Core ParametersThe core parameters are command-line parameters that define how Fastcapa interacts       with DPDK. Fastcapa-Kafka Configuration FileThe Kafka configuration file defines how Fastcapa interacts with       librdkafka.Fastcapa Counters OutputWhen running the Fastcapa probe, some basic counters are output to          stdout. During normal operation these values are much       larger.Parent topic: Setting up pcap Overview
