Install Profiler
Data scientists use the Profiler to describe the behavior of entities on a network.
      The first step in setting up a Profiler is to install it. Build the Metron RPMs (see Building the RPMs).   
You might have already built the Metron RPMs when core Metron was
               installed.

$ find metron-deployment/ -name "metron-profiler*.rpm"
metron-deployment//packaging/docker/rpm-docker/RPMS/noarch/metron-profiler-0.4.1-201707131420.noarch.rpm

 Copy the Profiler RPM to the installation host.   
The installation host must be the same host on which CCP was installed. Depending
               on how you installed CCP, the Profiler RPM might have already been copied to this
               host with the other CCP RPMs.
[root@$METRON_HOME ~]# find /localrepo/  -name "metron-profiler*.rpm"
               /localrepo/metron-profiler-0.4.0-201707112313.noarch.rpm  Install the RPM.   

[root@$METRON_HOME ~]# rpm -ivh metron-profiler-*.noarch.rpm

[root@$METRON_HOME ~]# rpm -ql metron-profiler
/usr/metron
/usr/metron/0.4.1
/usr/metron/0.4.1/bin
/usr/metron/0.4.1/bin/start_profiler_topology.sh
/usr/metron/0.4.1/config

/usr/metron/0.4.1/lib
/usr/metron/0.4.1/lib/metron-profiler-0.4.0-uber.jar


 Create a table within HBase that will store the profile data. By default, the
               table is named profiler with a column family P. 

$ /usr/hdp/current/hbase-client/bin/hbase shell
hbase(main):001:0> create 'profiler', 'P'


The table name and column family must match the Profiler's configuration (see
                  Metron Profiler for Storm or Metron Profiler for Spark). 
 Edit the configuration file located at
                  $METRON_HOME/config/profiler.properties.    

kafka.zk=node1:2181
kafka.broker=node1:6667


Change kafka.zk to refer to ZooKeeper in your environment.
Change kafka.broker to refer to a Kafka Broker in your
               environment. Start the Profiler topology.  

$ cd $METRON_HOME
$ bin/start_profiler_topology.sh


At this point the Profiler is running and consuming telemetry messages. We have
               not defined any profiles yet, so it is not doing anything very useful. The next
               section walks you through the steps to create your very first "Hello, World!"
               profile.
