Stellar Functions
The Stellar language supports a number of functions. 


Referencing fields in the enriched JSON


String literals are quoted with either ' or "



String literals support escaping for ', ", \t,
          \r, \n, and backslash

The literal '\'foo\'' would represent 'foo'



The literal "\"foo\"" would represent "foo"



The literal 'foo \\ bar' would represent foo \
              bar






Simple boolean operations: and, not, or



Simple arithmetic operations: *, /, +,
          - on real numbers or integers


Simple comparison operations <, >, <=,
          >=



Simple equality comparison operations ==, !=



if/then/else comparisons (for example, if var1 < 10 then 'less than 10' else
          '10 or more')


Simple match evaluations (for example, match{ var1 < 10 => 'warn', var1 >= 10
          => 'critical', default => 'info'}



Determining whether a field exists (via exists)


An in operator that works like the in in Python


The ability to have parenthesis to make order of operations explicit


User defined functions, including Lambda expressions



Stellar Boolean ExpressionsIn Stellar, you can use variables in boolean expressions and variables that are not       explicitly interpreted as booleans subject to specifies rules.Stellar Language KeywordsYou can use Stellar language keywords to identify a syntactic form such as "not",       "else", and "or."Stellar Language Inclusion ChecksYou can use Stellar language inclusion checks such as "in", "and", and "not" to define       the content of the Stellar syntax.Stellar Language ComparisonsYou can use Stellar language comparisons to define the Stellar syntax.Stellar Language Equality CheckYou can use the Stellar language equality check to define both sides of a Stellar       syntax.Stellar Language Lambda ExpressionsStellar provides the capability to pass lambda expressions to functions which wish to       support that layer of indirection. Stellar Language Match ExpressionStellar provides the capability to write match expressions, which are similar to       switch statements commonly found in C-like languages.Stellar Language FunctionsCloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) supports an extensive list of core Stellar       language functions.Stellar BenchmarksA microbenchmarking utility is included to assist in executing microbenchmarks for     Stellar functions.
