Stellar Language
      Comparisons
You can use Stellar language comparisons to define the Stellar syntax.


If either side of the comparison is null then return false.


If both values being compared implement number then the following:


If either side is a double then get double value from both sides and compare using
              given operator.


Else if either side is a float then get float value from both sides and compare
              using given operator.


Else if either side is a long then get long value from both sides and compare
              using given operator.


Otherwise get the int value from both sides and compare using given
              operator.




If both sides are of the same type and are comparable then use the compareTo method to
          compare values.


If none of the above are met then an exception is thrown.
