Stellar Language Equality
      Check
You can use the Stellar language equality check to define both sides of a Stellar
      syntax.
Below is how the == operator is expected to work:


If either side of the expression is null then check equality using Java's `==`
          expression.


Else if both sides of the expression are of Java's type Number then:


If either side of the expression is a double then use the double value of both
              sides to test equality.


Else if either side of the expression is a float then use the float value of both
              sides to test equality.


Else if either side of the expression is a long then use long value of both sides
              to test equality.


Otherwise use int value of both sides to test equality




Otherwise use equals method compare the left side with the right side.


The `!=` operator is the negation of the above.
