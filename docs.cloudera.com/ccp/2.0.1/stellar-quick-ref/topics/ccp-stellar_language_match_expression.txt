Stellar Language Match Expression
Stellar provides the capability to write match expressions, which are similar to
      switch statements commonly found in C-like languages.
match{ logical_expression1 => evaluation expression1, logical_expression2 => evaluation_expression2, default => default_expression} 
Where:



logical_expression is a Stellar expression that evaluates to true or
          false. For instance var > 0 or var > 0 AND var2 ==
            'foo' or IF ... THEN ... ELSE




evaluation_expression is a Stellar Expression



default is a required default return value, should no logical expression
          match



default is required


Lambda expressions are supported, but they must be no argument lambdas such as
                () -> STATEMENT





Only the first clause that evaluates to true will be executed.
