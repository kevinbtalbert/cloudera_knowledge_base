Improve Scoring with a
      Domain Whitelist
Once you have identified and investigated a potential typosquatted domain and found
      that it is legitimate, you can stop future alerts by using a domain whitelist
      enrichment.
 Display the Management module UI. 

 Select the Squid sensor from the list of sensors on the main window. 

 Click the pencil icon in the list of tool icons 
               for the Squid sensor. 

Click Advanced.

Click  (expand window button) next to the RAW
                  JSON field.


Replace the is_potential_typosquat information with the
               following:

"is_potential_typosquat := not (ENRICHMENT_EXISTS('domain_whitelist', domain_without_tld, 'enrichment', 't')) && BLOOM_EXISTS(OBJECT_GET('/tmp/reference/alexa10k_filter.ser'), domain_without_tld)",




Click SAVE below the JSON panel.

Click SAVE at the bottom of the Squid sensor configuration
               panel.

Open cnn.com or npr.com in the browser connected
               to the HCP proxy.

Open the Alerts UI.

Click on the timestamp column header until the events are
               sorted descending by timestamp.
Proxy events to cnn.com and npr.org are no
               longer alerts.
