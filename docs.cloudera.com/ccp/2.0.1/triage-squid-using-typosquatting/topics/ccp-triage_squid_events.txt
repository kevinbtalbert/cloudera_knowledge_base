Triage Squid Events
Security event triage rules determine which events require further follow up and which
      events can be archived without further investigation. CCP processes many events every day so
      effective triage helps analysts focus on the most important events. 
The two components of security event triage are:
Determine if the event is an alert.
If the event is an alert, assign a score. If the event is not an alert, it is not
               scored. 


Triage Squid Using the Typosquatting AlgorithmFor this example, we use a simple triage rule to detect typosquatting. Typosquatting       uses common domain misspellings to install malicious web content.Improve Scoring with a Domain WhitelistOnce you have identified and investigated a potential typosquatted domain and found       that it is legitimate, you can stop future alerts by using a domain whitelist       enrichment.
