Create a Meta Alert
The meta alert feature enables you to create a save a group of filtered alerts. Like
      the group feature, you can group filtered alerts that pertain to an incident. However, with
      meta alert, you can save your grouping, creating a system entity, to view it later. Also, when
      you filter alerts, if a relevant alert is contained in a meta alert, the entire meta alert
      will be included in the filter results. Click one of the groups listed by Group By.   
The Alerts table view changes to a tree view listing the
               values of the groups.

               or more groups containing alerts on which you want to focus.  When you have selected a group of alerts that you want to focus on, click 
               (meta alert icon), then confirm that you wish to create a meta alert with the
               selected alerts.

               the alerts table view.You can rename your meta alert by completing the following steps:
