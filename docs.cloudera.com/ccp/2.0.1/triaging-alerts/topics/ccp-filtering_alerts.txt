Filter Alerts
The Alerts UI currently provides five filters that you can apply to alerts. You can use
    these filters to refine the list of alerts and collect additional information on the alerts.
    These filters are listed in the Filters panel on the left of the
      Alerts window.

 Click one of the filters in the Filters panel on the left of
          the window.    
The Filter expands to list all of the facet values contained in the filter. For
          example, in the following figure, the
            enrichments:geo_dst_addr:country filter contain the countries
          Russia, France, and USA.


note
The UI displays the number of alerts corresponding to each facet next to the
              facet.


After you modify the filter, you will see a warning indicating that the current alert
          data is not in sync with your filter parameters: 

Click the 
          (search) button to refresh the alerts data.

You can continue to apply filters to the alerts displayed in the
            Alerts window to further refine the alerts list. 
As you select filters and facets, they are displayed in the
            Searches field.
For example, in the following figure, we've applied the source.type
          filter with the bro facet and then the ip_dst_addr
          filter with the IP address 95.163.121.204.


You can also enter alert filters in the Search field.
For example:
alert_status:(NEW OR OPEN)

 To clear filters that have been populated to the Searches
          field, click  (delete icon) at the end of the Searches
          field.
