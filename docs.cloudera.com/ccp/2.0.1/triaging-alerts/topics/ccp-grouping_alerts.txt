Group Alerts
You can group alerts so you can apply filters, status, etc. to multiple alerts at a
      time.

 Click one of the groups listed by Group By.
The Alerts table view changes to a tree view listing the
               values of the groups.
In the following example, the group is source.type and the values
               are Yaf, Snort and Bro.
The Alerts UI displays the total number of alerts in the group below the Alerts
               total. See Alerts in Groups (7560).


noteThe icon to the left of the value provides the cumulative severity score for
                  all the alerts in the value. If the score exceeds 999, then the value displays as
                  999+.


Click one of the values to list the alerts for that value.


You can click an alert to add it to the Searches field.  

noteSearches will search through all the groups, not just the group containing the
                  alert.


All features that are available for the Alerts table are available for the tree
               view.  
For example, if you apply an action, such as Escalate, to an alert, it will apply
               to all alerts within the group. Similarly, if you search for a parameter, it will
               search all alerts within the group.

You can continue to refine your alerts by applying additional groups.  
You can change the order in which the groups are applied to the alerts by clicking
               and dragging the groups on the Groups By line.

To ungroup your alerts and return to the Alerts window, click Ungroup which is
               located on the far right of the list of groups.
