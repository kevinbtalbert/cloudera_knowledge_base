Launch the Alerts User
      Interface
When an event violates your threat intelligence thresholds, you are sent an alert that
      you can view in the Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) Alerts user interface, enabling you
      to evaluate the severity of the violation and manage it accordingly. The Alerts user interface
      is bundled with CCP and installed with the Ambari management pack.


Elasticsearch must be up and running and should have alerts populated by HDP
               topologies.
The Alerts UI defaults to port 4201. If you are already using port 4201 for another
               purpose, you must change the default port for the Alerts UI to another port number.
