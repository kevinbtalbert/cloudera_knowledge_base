Search Alerts
You can search for alerts using the search bar above the Alerts table. The search tool
      follows the Lucene syntax which supports a rich query language.  To search on an item that is displayed in the Alerts table, simply click on the item and it
               will display in the Searches field.  


Searches Field



You can also directly type in the Searches field to enter
               search criteria. 
For example, you can enter source:type:snort.
 To remove an item in the Searches field, mouse over the information in
               the Searches field until an x appears
               at the end of the text. Click on the x to remove the search
               filter and the operator following or preceding it.  To clear the entire Searches field, click the x
               at the end of the field.  You can specify the time range of your search by using the time range selector on the far
               right of the Searches field.    


note
The time-range selector is not available if you put a timestamp in the
                        Searches field.


The time-range button defaults to All time which displays
               all alerts corresponding to the Searches parameters. To customize the time range,
               click the time-range drop-down menu and select one of the following:

                           search.
The valid date format is: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.

Quick Ranges

Time Selector Dialog Box


After you make your choice, the time-selector label will reflect your
                           selection.
