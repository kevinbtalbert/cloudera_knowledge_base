      polls for alerts and refreshes the Alerts table at an interval that you can configure. This
      polling is paused whenever you open any configuration panels or use the
         Searches field.By default, the alerts table shows the recent alerts at the top. For example, alerts are
         sorted descending on timestamp. For information on modifying these configurations.The
            Alerts table also provides the threat intelligence score for each alert. Next to the
            score is a bar that indicates the severity of the score:
Red

A score of 69 or higher

Orange

A score between 39 and 69

Yellow

A score below 39
