Viewing Alerts
The Alerts user interface defaults to displaying the Alerts table when first opened.
      You can modify the alerts displayed in the Alerts table to help identify issues.
Start and Pause Automatic PollingThe automatic polling in the Alerts UI defaults to a paused state when you first log       in. To start automatic polling, you must click the play button.Using the Alerts TableThe Alerts table displays the alerts generated by the CCP framework. The Alerts UI       polls for alerts and refreshes the Alerts table at an interval that you can configure. This       polling is paused whenever you open any configuration panels or use the          Searches field.Search AlertsYou can search for alerts using the search bar above the Alerts table. The search tool       follows the Lucene syntax which supports a rich query language. Filter AlertsThe Alerts UI currently provides five filters that you can apply to alerts. You can use     these filters to refine the list of alerts and collect additional information on the alerts.     These filters are listed in the Filters panel on the left of the       Alerts window.Manage Alert StatusYou can manage one or more alerts at a time using the ACTIONS       menu. You can use the ACTIONS to change the status of or dismiss an       alert.Escalate an AlertYou can escalate one or more alerts at a time to create an event that can be tracked       by an external ticketing system.Group AlertsYou can group alerts so you can apply filters, status, etc. to multiple alerts at a       time.Create a Meta AlertThe meta alert feature enables you to create a save a group of filtered alerts. Like       the group feature, you can group filtered alerts that pertain to an incident. However, with       meta alert, you can save your grouping, creating a system entity, to view it later. Also, when       you filter alerts, if a relevant alert is contained in a meta alert, the entire meta alert       will be included in the filter results.
