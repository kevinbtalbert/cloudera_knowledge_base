Storm is Not Receiving Data From a New Data Source
If, after installing a new data source, Storm is not receiving data from the data
      source, there are several configurations you can check.

Ensure that your Grok parser statement is valid.


Log in to HOST $HOST_WITH_ENRICHMENT_TAG as root. 


Deploy a new, valid parser topology:  

$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k $KAFKA_HOST:6667 -z $ZOOKEEPER_HOST:2181 -s $DATASOURCE



Navigate to the Apache Storm UI to validate that the new topology is
                     displayed and without errors.



 Ensure that the Apache Kafka topic you created for your new data source is
               receiving data. 

 Check your Apache NiFi configuration to ensure that data is flowing between the
               Kafka topic for your new data source and Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP).
