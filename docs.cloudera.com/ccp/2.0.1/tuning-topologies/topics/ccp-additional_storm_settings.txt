      Storm Settings
After the number of parser executors has been determined and thoroughly tested, you
      can set or modify the last remaining Storm parameters.

Based on the capacity you've seen during testing, reduce the overall number of
               ackers.
Alternatively, you can leave a single acker per worker as it will ensure that
               there are no messages sent between Storm workers over the network interface.

Set the Max Spout Pending parameter such that the maximum
               number of unacked tuples in the topology is close to the Parser
                  Executor capacity (for example, ~0.950). 
Setting the maximum number of unacked tupples to the Parser
                  Executor capacity ensures that if there is a large spike in incoming
               events, the topology will not become overloaded. For example, to determine this value
               you can increase the producer events per second by a large amount and test various
               values for Max Spout Pending. The value can be set under the
               Storm settings of the relevant parser.


Check the Parser Executor capacity.
The Parser Executor capacity should not exceed ~0.950.
               Assuming the number of events generated by the producer is far greater than the
               capacity of the Parser topology, capacity is the only value that needs to be
               monitored in the Storm UI.

Set the Error Writer Parallelism and Num
                  Tasks values.
Generally, since a small number of errors is expected, it can be set quite low.
               There should be more than 3 for redundancy but going as high as 1 per worker may also
               be of benefit for even distribution.
