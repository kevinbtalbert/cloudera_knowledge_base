      Partitions
The first enrichment variable that should be determined is the minimum number of Kafka
      partitions required. 

Use the following formula to determine the minimum number of Kafka partitions for
               the enrichment topology

Num Partitions=Max( t/p,t/c)

where


t is the desired throughput
p is the maximum throughout using a single producer
c is the maximum throughput using a single consumer



noteYou can estimate the minimum number of partitions requires based on the
                  original calculations performed for parser topologies. However, this may or may
                  not be suitable as the message size increases as it progresses through Metron
                  topologies. This increased message size can affect throughput. For this reason, we
                  recommend that you perform the same steps to calculate the value for the
                  enrichment topic.
