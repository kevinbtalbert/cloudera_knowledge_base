Modifying Enrichment
      Properties Using Flux (Advanced)
Some of the tuning enrichment properties can only be modified using Flux. However, if
      you manually change your Flux file, if you perform an upgrade, Ambari will overwrite all of
      your changes. Be sure to save your Flux changes prior to performing an upgrade.

importantYou should be familiar with Storm Flux before you adjust the values
            in this section. Changes to Flux file properties that are managed by Ambari will render
            Ambari unable to further manage the property.

You can find the enrichment Flux file at
            $METRON_HOME/flux/enrichment/remote.yaml.
The following table lists the enrichment properties you can modify in the flux file:


Category
Flux Property or Function
Flux Section Location



Kafka spout
session.timeout.ms
line 201, id: kafkaProps


 
enable.auto.commit
line 201, id: kafkaProps


 
setPollTimeoutMs
line 230, id: kafkaConfig


 
setMaxUncommittedOffsets
line 230, id: kafkaConfig


 
setOffsetCommitPeriodMs
line 230, id: kafkaConfig


You can add Kafka spout properties or functions using two methods:

Flux properties - Flux → kafkaProps

Add a new key/value to the kafkaProps section HashMap on line
                  201. For example, if you want to set the Kafka Spout
                     consumer'ssession.timeout.ms to 30 seconds, add the
                  following:
       -   name: "put"
           args:
               - "session.timeout.ms"
               - 30000


Flux functions - Flux → kafkaConfig

Add a new setter to the kafkaConfig object section on line 230.
                  For example, if you want to set the Kafka Spout consumer's poll timeout to 200
                  milliseconds, add the following under configMethods:
         -   name: "setPollTimeoutMs"
             args:
                 - 200
