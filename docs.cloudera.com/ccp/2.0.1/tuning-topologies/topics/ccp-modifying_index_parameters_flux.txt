Modifying Index Parameters
      Using Flux (Advanced)
Some of the tuning indexing properties, for example the HDFS sync policy setting, can
      only be modified using Flux. However, if you manually change your Flux file, if you perform an
      upgrade, Ambari will overwrite all of your changes. Be sure to back up your Flux changes prior
      to performing an upgrade.

importantYou should be familiar with Storm Flux before you adjust the values
            in this section. Changes to Flux file properties that are managed by Ambari will render
            Ambari unable to further manage the property.

You can find the indexing Flux file at
            $METRON_HOME/flux/indexing/batch/remote.yaml.

See notes below about adding this prop


To modify index tuning properties, complete the following steps:


Add a new setter to the hdfsWriter around line 56.
 53             -   name: "withRotationPolicy"
 54                 args:
 55                     - ref: "hdfsRotationPolicy
 56             -   name: "withSyncPolicy"
 57                 args:
 58                     - ref: "hdfsSyncPolicy

Lines are 53-55 provided for context.


Add an hdfsSyncPolicy after the hdfsRotationPolicy
               that appears on line 41:
 41     -   id: "hdfsRotationPolicy"
...
 45           - "${bolt.hdfs.rotation.policy.units}"
 46
 47     -   id: "hdfsSyncPolicy"
 48         className: "org.apache.storm.hdfs.bolt.sync.CountSyncPolicy"
 49         constructorArgs:
 50           -  100000
