Storm Parser
      Parameters
You can modify certain parser properties to tune your CCP architecture using the
      Management user interface. Modifying properties using the Management UI is simple and can be
      performed by any user.
Parsers tend to vary a lot. Some will be very high volume receiving thousands of messages
         per second and others will be much lower. Rather than using a standard setting for the
         number of partitions and parallelism, you should base your settings on the expected data
         volume. That said, use the following guidelines:



The spout parallelism should be roughly the same as your Kafka partitions.


Consider data flow when assigning Kafka partitions to parsers.


Keep in mind the aggregate number of partitions when assigning them to partitions.
                  You do not want to assign the maximum number of partitions to each parser because
                  that can overload your system.



The parser topologies are deployed by a builder pattern that takes parameters from the CLI
         as set by the Management UI. The parser properties materialize as follows:
Management UI -> parser json config and CLI -> Storm
The following table lists the parser properties you can modify in the Management UI:


Category
Management UI Property Name
CLI Option



Storm topology config
Num Workers
-nw,--num_workers <NUM_WORKERS>


 
Num Ackers
--na,--num_ackers <NUM_ACKERS>


 
Storm Config
<JSON_FILE>, e.g., { "topology.max.spout.pending" : NUM
                        }


Kafka
Spout Parallelism
-sp,--spout_p <SPOUT_PARALLELISM_HINT>


 
Spout Num Tasks
-snt,--spout_num_tasks <NUM_TASKS>


 
Spout Config
<JSON_FILE>, e.g., { "spout.pollTimeoutMs" : 200
                     }


 
Spout Config
<JSON_FILE>, e.g., { "spout.maxUncommittedOffsets" : 10000000
                        }


 
Spout Config
<JSON_FILE>, e.g., { "spout.offsetCommitPeriodMs" : 30000
                        }


Parser bolt
Parser Num Tasks
-pnt,--parser_num_tasks <NUM_TASKS>


 
Parser Parallelism
-pp,--parser_p <PARALLELISM_HINT>


 
Parser Parallelism
-pp,--parser_p <PARALLELISM_HINT>


All of the Storm parameters are available in the STORM SETTINGS section of the
         Management UI.
For the Storm config and Spout config properties, you enter the JSON_FILE
         information in the appropriate field using the JSON format supplied in the following
         table.
