While the parameters for the Indexing topology should be modified via Ambari for
      persistence, there is a method by which the topologies can be started via the command line on
      the Metron node and parameters easily modified for testing. The commands below demonstrate how
      to create a copy of the Metron files for making changes quickly during testing.

From the userâ€™s home directory, execute the following commands:

sudo cp /usr/hcp/current/metron/bin/start_elasticsearch_topology.sh ~
  sudo cp /usr/hcp/current/metron/config/elasticsearch.properties ~
  sed -i 's+$METRON_HOME/config/+/home/<user>/+g' ./start_elasticsearch_topology.sh


While the product has been rebranded to Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP), the
               directory name currently remains hcp. 

Now, the variables can be edited outside of Ambari via the following command:

vi ~/elasticsearch.properties


To start the topology with the new variables, you must execute the following
               command:

~/start_elasticsearch_topology.sh
