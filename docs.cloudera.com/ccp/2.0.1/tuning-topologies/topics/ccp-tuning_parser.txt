Tuning a Parser
When tuning CCP, it is best to start with Parsers before moving on to Enrichments and
        Indexing topologies. A new parser should be tuned to efficiently handle the estimated
        throughput. 
Tune Parser Kafka PartitionsWhen you tune a new parser, the first variable that you should determine is the       minimum number of Kafka partitions required.Storm Parser ParametersYou can modify certain parser properties to tune your CCP architecture using the       Management user interface. Modifying properties using the Management UI is simple and can be       performed by any user.Tune Parser Core Storm SettingsYou can set the number of Kafka spouts to match the number of Kafka partitions. You       can also increase the number of workers and ackers to match the Storm nodes, unless the       estimated throughput for the parser is very low.Tune Additional Parser Storm SettingsAfter the number of parser executors has been determined and thoroughly tested, you       can set or modify the last remaining Storm parameters.
