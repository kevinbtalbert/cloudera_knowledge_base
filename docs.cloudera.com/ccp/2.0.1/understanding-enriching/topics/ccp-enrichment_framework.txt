Enrichment Framework
Enrichments add context to the streaming message.
The enrichment framework takes the data from the parsing topologies that have been
         normalized into the CCP data format (JSON files) and performs the following
         enhancements:


Enriches messages with external data from data stores by adding new information based
          on existing fields in the messages


Marks messages as threats based on data in external data stores


Marks threat alerts with a numeric triage level based on a set of Stellar rules


The configuration for the enrichment topology is defined by JSON documents stored in
         ZooKeeper. CCP features two types of configurations:

Sensor
Global

The following figure illustrates the enrichment flow for both individual sensor enrichment
      and threat intelligence enrichment.

CCP Enrichment Flow



Sensor Enrichment ConfigurationThe sensor enrichment configuration provides enrichments for a given sensor (for       example, Snort). Global ConfigurationGlobal enrichments are applied to all data sources as opposed to other enrichments that     are applied at the field level. In other words, every message from every sensor is validated     against the global configuration rules. Use Stellar for QueriesYou can use Stellar to create queries.Use Stellar to Transform Sensor Data ElementsYou can use Stellar to customize sensor data elements to more useful information. Management UtilityCloudera Cybersecurity Platform (HCP) recommends that your store your configuration on       disk prior to uploading them to ZooKeeper.
