Global Configuration
Global enrichments are applied to all data sources as opposed to other enrichments that
    are applied at the field level. In other words, every message from every sensor is validated
    against the global configuration rules. 
The format of the global enrichment is a JSON string-to-object map that is stored in
      ZooKeeper and looks something like the following:
{
  "es.clustername": "metron",
  "es.ip": "node1",
  "es.port": "9300",
  "es.date.format": "yyyy.MM.dd.HH",
  "fieldValidations" : [
              {
                "input" : [ "ip_src_addr", "ip_dst_addr" ],
                "validation" : "IP",
                "config" : {
                    "type" : "IPV4"
                           }
              } 
                       ]
}
Inside the global configuration is a framework that validates all messages coming from
        all parsers. This is performed using validation plug-ins that make assertions about fields
        or whole messages.
The format for this framework is a fieldValidations field inside the
      global configuration.
