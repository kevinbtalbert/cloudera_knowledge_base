Individual Sensor Enrichments
Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) includes three individual sensor
      enrichments.
CCP includes the following individual sensor enrichments:

Geo

Provides GeoIP information, which includes coordinates, city, state, and country
                information, to any external IP address.

Asset

Provides the host name for an IP address. If the IP address is known, then the
                enrichment provides everything else that is known of the asset from the LDAP, AD, or
                enterprise inventory stores.

User

Provides the user that owns the session or alert associated with the
                IP-application pair.


The JSON documents for the individual enrichment configurations are structured as
          follows:
Table 1. Individual Enrichment Configuration Fields

Field
Description
Example




fieldToTypeMap

In the case of a simple HBase enrichment, you must specify the mapping
                     between fields and the enrichment types associated with those fields. You must
                     also specify the enrichment type for the HBase key.

"fieldToTypeMap" : { 
"ip_src_addr" : [ 
"asset_enrichment" ] }




fieldMap

The map of enrichment bolts names to configuration handlers that know how
                     to divide the message. The simplest map is just a list of fields. More complex
                     maps consist of tellar enrichment which provides tellar statements. Each field
                     is sent to the enrichment referenced in the key.

"fieldMap": 
{"hbaseEnrichment": 
["ip_src_addr","ip_dst_addr"]}




config

The general configuration of the enrichment.

"config": 
{"typeToColumnFamily": { 
"asset_enrichment" : "cf" } }



The config map contains enrichment-specific configurations. For
          example, hbaseEnrichment specifies the mappings between the enrichment
          types to the column families.
The fieldMap contents contain the routing and configuration
          information for the enrichments. Routing defines how the message is divided and sent to
          the enrichment adapter bolts. The simplest fieldMapcontents provides a
          simple list, such as the following
           "fieldMap": {
      "geo": [
        "ip_src_addr",
        "ip_dst_addr"
      ],
      "host": [
        "ip_src_addr",
        "ip_dst_addr"
      ],
      "hbaseEnrichment": [
        "ip_src_addr",
        "ip_dst_addr"
      ]
      }

Based on this sample configuration, both ip_src_addr and
            ip_dst_addr go to the geo, host, and
            hbaseEnrichment adapter bolts.
