Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (HCP) recommends that your store your configuration on
      disk prior to uploading them to ZooKeeper.
You should store your configurations on disk in the following structure, starting at
            $BASE_DIR:



global.json: The global configuration



sensors: The subdirectory containing
            sensor-enrichment configuration JSON (for example, snort.json or bro.json)


By default, this directory is deployed by the Ansible infrastructure at
          $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper.
While the configurations are stored on disk, they must be loaded into ZooKeeper to be used.
         You can use the  $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_config.sh utility program to do
         this.
This has the following options:

-f,--force

Force operation

-h,--help

Generate Help screen

-i,--input_dir <DIR>

The input directory containing configuration files with names such as
              "$source.json"

-m,--mode <MODE>

The mode of operation: DUMP, PULL, or PUSH

-o,--output_dir (DIR)

The output directory that will store the JSON configuration from ZooKeeper

-z,--zk_quorum <host:port,[host:port]*>

ZooKeeper quorum URL (zk1:port,zk2:port,â€¦)


Following are some usage examples:


To dump the existing configs from ZooKeeper on the single-node vagrant machine:
              $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z node1:2181 -m DUMP



To push the configs into ZooKeeper on the single-node vagrant machine:
              $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z node1:2181 -m PUSH -i
              $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper



To pull the configs from ZooKeeper to the single-node vagrant machine disk:
              $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z node1:2181 -m PULL -o
              $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper -f
