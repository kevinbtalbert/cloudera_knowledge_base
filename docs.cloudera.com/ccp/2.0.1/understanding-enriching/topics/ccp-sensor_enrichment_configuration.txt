Sensor Enrichment Configuration
The sensor enrichment configuration provides enrichments for a given sensor (for
      example, Snort). 
The sensor enrichment configuration includes two types of enrichments: individual sensor
         enrichments and threat intelligence enrichments. The configuration for both types of
         enrichments is a complex JSON object with the following top-level fields:

index

The name of the sensor

batchSize

The size of the batch that is written to the indices at once

enrichment

A complex JSON object representing the configuration of the enrichments

threatIntel

A complex JSON object representing the configuration of the threat intelligence
              enrichments


The remaining configuration differs for the two types of enrichments. 

Individual Sensor EnrichmentsCloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) includes three individual sensor       enrichments.Stellar EnrichmentsIndividual sensor enrichments are sufficient for the geo,       host, and hbaseEnrichment, sensor topologies However, more     complex enrichments might contain their own configuration. Currently, the       stellar enrichment is more adaptable and thus requires a more nuanced     configuration.Threat Intelligence EnrichmentsCloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) provides an extensible framework to plug in     threat intelligence sources. Using Stellar to Set up Threat Triage ConfigurationsThe threat triage configuration defines conditions by associating them with scores. Parent topic: Enrichment Framework
