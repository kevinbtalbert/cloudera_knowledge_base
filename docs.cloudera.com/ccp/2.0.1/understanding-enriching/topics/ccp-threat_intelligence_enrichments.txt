Threat Intelligence Enrichments
Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) provides an extensible framework to plug in
    threat intelligence sources. 
Each threat intelligence source has two components: an enrichment data source and an
      enrichment bolt. The threat intelligence feeds are bulk loaded and streamed into a threat
      intelligence store similarly to how the enrichment feeds are loaded. The keys are loaded in a
      key-value format. The key is the indicator and the value is the JSON formatted description of
      what the indicator is. Hortonworks recommends using a threat feed aggregator such as Soltra to
      dedup and normalize the feeds via STIX/TAXII. CCP provides an adapter that is able to read
      Soltra-produced STIX/TAXII feeds and stream them into HBase. CCP additionally provides a flat
      file and STIX bulk loader that can normalize, dedup, and bulk load or stream threat
      intelligence data into HBase even without the use of a threat feed aggregator.
The JSON documents for the threat intelligence enrichment configurations are
          structured in the following way:
Table 1. Threat Intelligence Enrichment Configuration

Field
Description
Example




fieldToTypeMap

In the case of a simple HBase enrichment, you must specify the mapping between
              fields and the enrichment types associated with those fields. You must also specify
              the enrichment type for the HBase key.

"fieldToTypeMap" : { 
"ip_src_addr" : [ 
"malicious_ips" ] }




fieldMap

The map of threat intelligence enrichment bolts names to fields in the JSON
              messages. Each field is sent to the threat intelligence enrichment bolt referenced in
              the key.

"fieldMap": 
{"hbaseThreatIntel": 
["ip_src_addr","ip_dst_addr"]}




triageConfig

The configuration of the threat triage scorer. In the situation where a threat is
              detected, a score is assigned to the message and embedded in the indexed
              message.

"riskLevelRules" : { 
"IN_SUBNET(ip_dst_addr, 
'192.168.0.0/24')" : 10 }




config

The general configuration for the threat intelligence.

"config": 
{"typeToColumnFamily": { 
"malicious_ips" : "cf" } }



The config map houses threat intelligence specific configurations. For
          instance, the hbaseThreatIntel threat intelligence adapter specifies the
          mappings between the enrichment types and the column families.
The triageConfig field utilizes the following fields:
Table 2. triageConfig Fields

Field
Description
Example



riskLevelRules
The mapping of Metron Query Language (see above) queries to a score.
"riskLevelRules" : { "IN_SUBNET(ip_dst_addr, '192.168.0.0/24')" : 10 }


aggregator
An aggregation function that takes all non-zero scores representing the matching
              queries from riskLevelRules and aggregates them into a single
              score.
"MAX"


The supported aggregator functions are as follows:

MAX

The maximum of all of the associated values for matching queries

MIN

The minimum of all of the associated values for matching queries

MEAN

The mean of all of the associated values for matching queries

POSITIVE_MEAN

The mean of the positive associated values for the matching queries


The following is an example configuration for the YAF sensor:
{
  "index": "yaf",
  "batchSize": 5,
  "enrichment": {
    "fieldMap": {
      "geo": [
        "ip_src_addr",
        "ip_dst_addr"
      ],
      "host": [
        "ip_src_addr",
        "ip_dst_addr"
      ],
      "hbaseEnrichment": [
        "ip_src_addr",
        "ip_dst_addr"
      ]
    }
  ,"fieldToTypeMap": {
      "ip_src_addr": [
        "playful_classification"
      ],
      "ip_dst_addr": [
        "playful_classification"
      ]
    }
  },
  "threatIntel": {
    "fieldMap": {
      "hbaseThreatIntel": [
        "ip_src_addr",
        "ip_dst_addr"
      ]
    },
    "fieldToTypeMap": {
      "ip_src_addr": [
        "malicious_ip"
      ],
      "ip_dst_addr": [
        "malicious_ip"
      ]
    },
    "triageConfig" : {
      "riskLevelRules" : {
        "ip_src_addr == '10.0.2.3' or ip_dst_addr == '10.0.2.3'" : 10
      },
      "aggregator" : "MAX"
    }
  }
}
