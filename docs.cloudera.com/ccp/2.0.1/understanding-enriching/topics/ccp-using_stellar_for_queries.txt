Use Stellar for
      Queries
You can use Stellar to create queries.
The Stellar query language supports the following:


Referencing fields in the enriched JSON


Simple boolean operations: and, not, or


Simple arithmetic operations: *, /, +, - on real numbers or integers


Simple comparison operations <, >, <=, >=


if/then/else comparisons (in other words, if var1 < 10 then 'less than 10' else
            '10 or more')


Determining whether a field exists (via exists)


The ability to have parenthesis to make order of operations explicit


User defined functions


The following is an example of a Stellar query:
IN_SUBNET( ip, '192.168.0.0/24') or ip in [ '10.0.0.1', '10.0.0.2' ] or exists(is_local)
This query evaluates to “true” when one of the following is true:


The value of the ip field is in the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet.


The value of the ip field is 10.0.0.1 or 10.0.0.2.


The field is_local exists.
