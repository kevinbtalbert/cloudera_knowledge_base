Use Stellar to Transform
    Sensor Data Elements
You can use Stellar to customize sensor data elements to more useful information. 
For example, you can
        transform a timestamp to be specific to your timezone:
TO_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP(timestamp, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss', MAP_GET(dc, dc2tz, 'UTC'))

For a message with a timestamp and dc field, transform the timestamp to an epoch
        timestamp given a timezone that ou can  look up in a separate map, called dc2tz.
This converts the timestamp field to an epoch timestamp based on the following:


Format yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss


The value in dc2tz associated with the value associated with field dc, defaulting to
            UTC


For a list of Stellar
        transformation functions supported by CCP, see Stellar Language Quick Reference.
