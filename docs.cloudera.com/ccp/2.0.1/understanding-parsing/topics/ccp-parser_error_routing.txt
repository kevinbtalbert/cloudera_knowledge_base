Parser Message
      Routing
Parser messages are routed to the Kafka enrichment topic by default. 
You can change the output topic with the output_topic option when starting
         the parser topology or with the outputTopic parser configuration setting.
         The order of precedence from highest to lowest is as follows:


Parser start script option


Parser configuration setting


Default enrichments topic


You can also route the message to other locations besides Kafka with the
            writerClassName parser configuration setting. Messages can be routed
         independently for each sensor type when configured with parser configuration settings.
