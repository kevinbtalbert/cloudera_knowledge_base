Parser Overview
Parsers are pluggable components that transform raw data (textual or raw bytes) into
      JSON messages suitable for downstream enrichment and indexing. 
Data flows through the parser bolt via Apache Kafka and into the enrichments topology in
         Apache Storm. 
For example, for a Squid parser, NiFi ingests the contents of the Squid proxy access log,
         the parser transforms the contents of the log, converts it to json, and inserts it into a
         Squid Kafka topic, which is then passed on to Metron.

CCP supports two types of parsers: general purpose and Java. 
Errors are collected with the context of the error (for example, stacktrace) and the
         original message causing the error and are sent to an error queue. Invalid messages as
         determined by global validation functions are also treated as errors and sent to an error
         queue.

Java ParsersThe Java parser is written in Java and conforms with the MessageParser interface. This       kind of parser is optimized for speed and performance and is built for use with       higher-velocity topologies. General Purpose ParsersThe general-purpose parser is primarily designed for lower-velocity topologies or for       quickly setting up a temporary parser for a new telemetry. Parser Message RoutingParser messages are routed to the Kafka enrichment topic by default. Parser ConfigurationThe configuration for the various parser topologies is defined by JSON documents       stored in ZooKeeper.
