Changes to Supported
      Elasticsearch Properties Resulting from Migrating From Transport to REST Client
Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) has migrated the Elasticsearch Java client from
      the Transport client to the new Java REST client. The motivation for this change is that
      TransportClient will be deprecated in Elasticsearch 7.0 and removed entirely in 8.0. This
      migration changes some of the supported properties. You will need to modify some of your
      Elasticsearch properties to support the new REST client.
The following table provides
            a mapping of the old Elasticsearch properties to the new supported properties.
