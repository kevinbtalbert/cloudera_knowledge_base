Upgrading Elasticsearch
      Alert Field
Beginning with CCP 1.7.0, the Elasticsearch metaalert alert nested
      field has been changed to metron_alert. Due to this change, CCP 1.7.0 and
      later is unable to use indices containing the alert field. You must adjust your templates and mappings to reflect the new field name
            metron_alert, then create new indices with the new template and
         mapping, and migrate existing data to the new indices.
