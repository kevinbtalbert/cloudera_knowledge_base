Upgrading Elasticsearch for CCPCloudera Docs
Upgrading Elasticsearch for
      CCP
Cloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) has upgraded its support for Elasticsearch. When
      you upgrade to CCP 1.7.0 or later, you will need to make certain changes to your ES templates
      and mappings. 
Upgrading Elasticsearch Alert FieldBeginning with CCP 1.7.0, the Elasticsearch metaalert alert nested       field has been changed to metron_alert. Due to this change, CCP 1.7.0 and       later is unable to use indices containing the alert field. Changes to Supported Elasticsearch Properties Resulting from Migrating From Transport to REST ClientCloudera Cybersecurity Platform (CCP) has migrated the Elasticsearch Java client from       the Transport client to the new Java REST client. The motivation for this change is that       TransportClient will be deprecated in Elasticsearch 7.0 and removed entirely in 8.0. This       migration changes some of the supported properties. You will need to modify some of your       Elasticsearch properties to support the new REST client.
