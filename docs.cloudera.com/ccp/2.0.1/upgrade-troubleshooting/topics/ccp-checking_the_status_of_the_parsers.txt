Checking the Status of the Parsers
If your parsers do not restart, you can use Ambari to check the status of the parsers
      and restart them. 
 From Ambari, click Metron in the Services panel and make sure you've selected the
                  SUMMARY tab. 






 Click METRON PARSERS in the list of
                  Components. 
Ambari displays a list of  Components.


 Click the parser node you want to start, then, in the Action column, choose
                  Restart. 
Click OK in the Confirmation dialog
               box.

Ambari displays a Background Operations dialog box that indicates the status of the
               restart.
