Enrichment Tuning
        Example
We landed on the same number of partitions for enrichment and indexing as we did for
        bro - 48.
For configuring Storm, there is a flux file and properties file that we modified. Here
            are the settings we changed for Bro in Flux. +Note that the main Metron-specific option
            we've changed to accommodate the desired rate of data throughput is max cache size in
            the join bolts.
More information on Flux can be found here -
