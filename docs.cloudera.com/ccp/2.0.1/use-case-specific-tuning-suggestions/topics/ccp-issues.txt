You can run into issues when you tune your system.
__Error__

org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.CommitFailedException: Commit cannot be completed since the group has already rebalanced and assigned
the partitions to another member. This means that the time between subsequent calls to poll() was longer than the configured session.timeout.ms,
which typically implies that the poll loop is spending too much time message processing. You can address this either by increasing the
session timeout or by reducing the maximum size of batches returned in poll() with max.poll.records


Suggestions

This implies that the spout hasn't been given enough time between polls before committing
      the offsets. In other words, the amount of time taken to process the messages is greater than
      the timeout window. In order to fix this, you can improve message throughput by modifying the
      options outlined above, increasing the poll timeout, or both.
