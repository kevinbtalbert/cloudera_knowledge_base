Parser Tuning
    Example
We'll be using the Bro sensor in this parser tuning example.
We started with a single partition for the inbound Kafka topics and eventually worked our way
      up to 48 partitions. And we're using the following pending value, as shown below. The default
      is 'null' which would result in no limit.

storm-bro.config


  {
      ...
      "topology.max.spout.pending" : 2000
      ...
  }

And the following default spout settings. Again, this can be omitted entirely since we are
      using the defaults.

spout-bro.config


  {
      ...
  
      "spout.pollTimeoutMs" : 200,
      "spout.maxUncommittedOffsets" : 10000000,
      "spout.offsetCommitPeriodMs" : 30000
  }
  
And we ran our Bro parser topology with the following options. We did not need to fully match
      the number of Kafka partitions with our parallelism in this case, though you could certainly
      do so if necessary. Notice that we only needed 1 worker.

 /$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k $BROKERLIST -z $ZOOKEEPER -s bro -ksp SASL_PLAINTEXT
     -ot enrichments
     -e ~metron/.storm/storm-bro.config \
     -esc ~/.storm/spout-bro.config \
     -sp 24 \
     -snt 24 \
     -nw 1 \
     -pnt 24 \
     -pp 24 \
 
From the usage docs, here are the options we've used. 

 -e,--extra_topology_options (JSON_FILE)       Extra options in the form
                                               of a JSON file with a map
                                               for content.
 -esc,--extra_kafka_spout_config (JSON_FILE)   Extra spout config options
                                               in the form of a JSON file
                                               with a map for content.
                                               Possible keys are:
