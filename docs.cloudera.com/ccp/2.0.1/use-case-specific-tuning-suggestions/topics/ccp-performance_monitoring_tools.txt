Performance Monitoring Tools
Before we get to tuning our cluster, it helps to describe what we might actually want
      to monitor as well as any potential pain points. 
Prior to switching over to
         the new Storm Kafka client, which leverages the new Kafka consumer API under the hood,
         offsets were stored in ZooKeeper. While the broker hosts are still stored in ZooKeeper,
         this is no longer true for the offsets which are now stored in Kafka itself. This is a
         configurable option, and you may switch back to ZooKeeper if you choose, but Metron is
         currently using the new defaults. With this in mind, there are some useful tools that come
         with Storm and Kafka that we can use to monitor our topologies.

Kafka



Consumer group offset lag viewer


There is a GUI tool to make creating, modifying, and generally managing your Kafka
               topics a bit easier - see kafka-manager



Console consumer - useful for quickly verifying topic contents



Storm

For more information on the Storm user interface, see Reading and Understanding the Storm UI.

View Kafka Offset Lags ExampleYou can use the Kafka consumer group offset lag viewer to monitor the delta     calculations between the current and end offset for a partition.Parser Tuning ExampleWe'll be using the Bro sensor in this parser tuning example.Enrichment Tuning ExampleWe landed on the same number of partitions for enrichment and indexing as we did for         bro - 48.Indexing (HDFS) TuningThere are 48 partitions set for the indexing partition, per the previous enrichment         exercise.PCAP Tuning ExamplePCAP is a specialized topology that is a Spout-only topology. Both Kafka topic         consumption and HDFS writing is done within a spout to avoid the additional network hop         required if using an additional bolt.Parent topic: Use Case Specific Tuning Suggestions
