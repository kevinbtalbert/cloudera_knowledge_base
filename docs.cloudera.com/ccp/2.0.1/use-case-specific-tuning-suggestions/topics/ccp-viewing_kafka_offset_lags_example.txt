    Example
You can use the Kafka consumer group offset lag viewer to monitor the delta
    calculations between the current and end offset for a partition.

Set up some environment variables.

export BROKERLIST  your broker comma-delimated list of host:ports>
export ZOOKEEPER  your zookeeper comma-delimated list of host:ports>
export KAFKA_HOME  kafka home dir>
export METRON_HOME  your metron home>
export HDP_HOME  your HDP home>



If you have Kerberos enabled, set up the security protocol.

$ cat /tmp/consumergroup.config
security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT



Enter the following command to display a table containing offsets for all partitions
          and consumers associated with a running topology's consumer group:
${KAFKA_HOME}/bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh \
            --command-config=/tmp/consumergroup.config \     --describe \     --group enrichments \
            --bootstrap-server $BROKERLIST \     --new-consumer 
The command displays the following table:

GROUP                          TOPIC              PARTITION  CURRENT-OFFSET  LOG-END-OFFSET  LAG             OWNER
enrichments                    enrichments        9          29746066        29746067        1               consumer-2_/xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
enrichments                    enrichments        3          29754325        29754326        1               consumer-1_/xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
enrichments                    enrichments        43         29754331        29754332        1               consumer-6_/xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
...



noteOutput displays only when the topology is running because the consumer groups only
            exist while consumers in the spouts are up and running.

The LAG column lists the current delta calculation between the current and end offset
          for the partition. The column value indicates how close you are to keeping up with
          incoming data. It also indicates whether there are any problems with specific consumers
          getting stuck.

To watch the offsets and lags change over time, add a watch command and set the
          refresh rate to 10 seconds:

watch -n 10 -d ${KAFKA_HOME}/bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh \
    --command-config=/tmp/consumergroup.config \
    --describe \
    --group enrichments \
    --bootstrap-server $BROKERLIST \
    --new-consumer


The watch command runs every 10 seconds and refreshes the screen with new
          information. The command also highlights the differences from the current output and the
          last output screens.
