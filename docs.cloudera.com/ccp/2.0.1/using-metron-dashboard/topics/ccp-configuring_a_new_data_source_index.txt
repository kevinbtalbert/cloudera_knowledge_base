Configuring a New Data Source Index
Now that you have an index for the new data source with all of the right data types,
      you need to tell the Metron dashboard about this index.
Before you can add a new data telemetry source to the Metron
         dashboard, you must ensure that you've completed the following steps:
The data telemetry source must be added to CCP.For information on how to add a
                  new data telemetry source, see Prerequisites to Adding a New Telemetry Data
               Source.
An index template must be created for the data telemetry source.For information
                  on how to create an index template, see Understanding Indexing.


To configure your new data source index, see Creating an Index Pattern to Connect to
                  Elasticsearch.
