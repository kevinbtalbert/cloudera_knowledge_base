Reviewing the New Data Source Data
Now that the Metron dashboard is aware of the new data source index, you can look at
      the data. Click on the Discover tab and then choose the newly created data source
               index pattern.  Click any of the fields in the left column to see a representation of the variety of data for
               that specific field.  Click the Right Facing Arrow icon next to a specific record in the center of the window (the
                  Document table) to expand the record and display the
               available data.
