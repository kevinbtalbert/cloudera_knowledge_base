Cloudera Edge Management (Technical Preview)


Cloudera Edge Management (CEM) enables edge device managers, data engineers,
and IoT administrators to gain control of the data from edge devices with 
realtime edge data collection and management.
The edge management solution consists of two main components:

Edge agents running Apache MiNiFi
Edge Flow Manager (EFM) serving as a management hub

The CDP Public Cloud 7.2.17 release introduces the technical preview for the 
Light Duty Edge Flow Management cluster definition. This template includes 
Edge Flow Manager (EFM) and it works out of the box in a secure environment 
on CDP Public Cloud.
With the Edge Management template, you only provision EFM in CDP Public Cloud, 
and agents need to be installed and configured separately. Reach out to Cloudera 
to learn about CEM licensing and getting access to MiNiFi agents.
For additional information about the main functionalities of Edge Management 
(flow creation, authentication, authorization, monitoring, or agent management), 
see the Cloudera Edge Management documentation.
