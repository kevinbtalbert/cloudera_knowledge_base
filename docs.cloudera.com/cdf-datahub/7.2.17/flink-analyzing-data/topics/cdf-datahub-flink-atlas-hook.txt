Grant permission for the ATLAS_HOOK topic
The Flink Atlas integration requires that users running Flink jobs have the
        privileges to write to the ATLAS_HOOK Kafka topic. Before you can use Atlas metadata
        management with Flink, you must grant permission to the user or user group to be able to
        send the Atlas lineage data through the ATLAS_HOOK Kafka topic.

Make sure that the atlas service user has publish privileges to the
                ATLAS_HOOK topic. For more information, see the Atlas documentation.
