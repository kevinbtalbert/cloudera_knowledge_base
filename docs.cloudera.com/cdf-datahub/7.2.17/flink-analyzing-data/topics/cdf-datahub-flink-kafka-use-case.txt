Analyzing your data with Kafka



Understand the use caseAs a basic analytical use case, you can use Streaming Analytics clusters connected to   the Streams Messaging cluster to build an end-to-end streaming analytics application with Kafka as   source and sink.Prepare your environmentBefore you start analyzing your data using Flink and Kafka in CDP Public Cloud, you need   to register and prepare your environment so that a chosen user or group can use the clusters and   services in the environment, and submit Flink jobs securely.Running your Flink applicationAfter preparing your environment, you need to connect Kafka to Flink, and create         Kafka topics where the input and output data is messaged. When Kafka is ready, you need to         generate data to your Kafka topic and let Flink apply the computations you have added in         your application design.
