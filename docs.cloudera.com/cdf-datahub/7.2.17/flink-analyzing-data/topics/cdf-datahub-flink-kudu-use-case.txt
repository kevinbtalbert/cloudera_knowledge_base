Analyzing your data with Kudu



Running your Flink applicationAfter preparing your environment, you need to create a Kudu table, and also connect         Flink with Kudu by providing the Kudu master. You also need to choose a source to which you         connect Flink in Data Hub. After generating data to your source, Flink applies the         computations you have added in your application design. The results are redirected to your         Kudu sink.
