Create Atlas entity type definitions
As an administrator, you must create the Atlas entity type definitions before
        submitting a Flink job, and enable Atlas in Cloudera Manager to use Atlas for metadata
        management.
The Flink Atlas integration requires that users running
            Flink jobs have the privileges to write to the ATLAS_HOOK Kafka topic.
            You need to make sure that the ATLAS_HOOK has publish
            privileges in Ranger. In case this is not set, the metadata collection cannot be
            performed. For more information, see the Atlas documentation and the Grant permission for the ATLAS_HOOK topic
            documentation.

Copy and paste the following command:

curl -k -u <atlas_admin>:<atlas_admin_pwd> --location --request


Provide your workload username and password as atlas admin.

Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where you have created your
                    cluster.

Click Data Lake.

Click Endpoints.

Click on the copy icon beside the Atlas endpoint.

Replace the atlas server URL with the copied Atlas endpoint.

POST '<atlas_endpoint_url>/v2/types/typedefs'


Copy and paste the entity type definitions.
