Configuring Flow Management clusters to hot load custom NARs
Hot loading custom NARs means that you can store the NARs for your NiFi custom
  processors in an external folder, and load them from that directory for use on the NiFi canvas.
  This makes it easy to edit custom processors and add new ones without having to restart your Flow
  Management cluster.


Collect your Kerberos information.


In Management Console, click Environments. 
From the Actions drop-down, click Manage
         Access.
Create a Machine User with the EnvironmentUser Resource Role
        and set its Workload password.note
It is best practice to have a dedicated Machine User in this role. This Machine User is
          in charge of accessing the object store resources for NiFi, having a dedicated user
          ensures that there is least privilege access and separation of duties.

Note down the user you create there and password, for your safety valves.



You have created an ID Broker mapping.


Access IDBroker mappings.
To access IDBroker mappings in your environment, click Actions > Manage
          Access.
Choose the IDBroker Mappings tab where you can provide mappings for users or
          groups and click Edit.

Add your CDP Machine User and the corresponding AWS role that provides write
        access to your folder in your S3 bucket to the Current Mappings section by clicking the blue
        + sign.noteYou can get the AWS IAM role ARN from the Roles Summary page in AWS and can
         copy it into the IDBroker role field. The selected AWS IAM role must have a trust policy
         allowing IDBroker to assume this role.
Click Save and Sync.






You can configure NiFi to hot load custom NARs in all supported cloud providers.
You can only access resources in the object store of the cloud provider in which you
     environment is running. But but you can have a development and a production environment, for
     example, and configure both environments to access the same location to hot load custom
     NARs

It is possible to define multiple locations if desired by repeating the
      configuration properties with a different [***custom-name***] for each
      location. But all locations should be in the object store of the underlying cloud provider of
      where the NiFi cluster is located.


NiFi polls for new NARs in the configured location(s) every 5 minutes.




In Management Console, select Data Hub Clusters, then go to the Flow Management cluster,
     then NiFi Service.

Click Configuration.

Search for Safety Valve and then Find: NiFi Node Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
      Valve) for staging/nifi.properties.xml

Create the following new properties:

Name: nifi.nar.library.provider.[***custom-name***].implementation
Example: nifi.nar.library.provider.narstorage1.implementation
Value: org.apache.nifi.nar.hadoop.HDFSNarProvider

Path to the configuration files
Name: nifi.nar.library.provider.[***custom-name***].resources
Example: nifi.nar.library.provider.narstorage1.resources
Value, by default: /etc/hadoop/conf.cloudera.core_settings/core-site.xml

Storage location for the NARs (the bucket name in S3 for example)
Name: nifi.nar.library.provider.[***custom-name***].storage.location
Example: nifi.nar.library.provider.narstorage1.storage.location
Value: s3a://my-custom-nars-bucket

Directory library with path to the NARs relative to the storage location
Name: nifi.nar.library.provider.[***custom-name***].source.directory
Example: nifi.nar.library.provider.narstorage1.source.directory
Value: /myNARs

Workload username and password of the machine user to use to access the resources

Name: nifi.nar.library.provider.[***custom-name***].kerberos.principal
Example: nifi.nar.library.provider.narstorage1.kerberos.principal
Value: srv_my_s3_nar_user

Name: nifi.nar.library.provider.[***custom-name***].kerberos.password
Example: nifi.nar.library.provider.narstorage1.kerberos.password
Value: myPassword123

note
Cloudera recommends that the workload user name and password that you configure above is
       strictly dedicated to accessing custom NARs, and that the only permissions granted to this
       user are to access the custom NAR object store location. 
Alternately, you can also use the keytab file. However, this file must be distributed on
       all NiFi nodes. This becomes problematic when scaling up a NiFi cluster in DataHub. In
       addition, the file permissions must be properly changed to ensure the file is readable by the
        nifi user. However, if desired, the below configuration can be used:
Name: nifi.nar.library.provider.[***custom-name***].kerberos.keytab
Example: nifi.nar.library.provider.narstorage1.kerberos.keytab
Value: /path/to/my/file.keytab




Restart the NiFi service in the Cloudera Manager.


Refresh the NiFi UI and then drag and drop a new processor to the NiFi canvas and search for
    your custom processor.
