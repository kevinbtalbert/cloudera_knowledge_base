Application development

Flink application structureYou must understand the parts of application structure to build and develop a Flink 		streaming application. To create and run the Flink application, you need to create the 		application logic using the DataStream API.Flink Project TemplateThe Quickstart Archetype serves as a template for an Apache Flink streaming         application. You can use the Archetype to add source, sink and computation to the template.         Like this you can practice the development of a simple Flink application, or use the         Archetype as the starting point for a more complex application including state,watermark and         checkpoint.Configuring Flink applicationsCloudera Streaming Analytics includes Flink with configuration that works out of the   box. It is not mandatory to configure Flink to production, but you can use the available   configurations to optimize the application behavior in production. Cloudera Manager includes all   the necessary configurations for Flink that can also be accessed from the flink-conf.yaml   file.
