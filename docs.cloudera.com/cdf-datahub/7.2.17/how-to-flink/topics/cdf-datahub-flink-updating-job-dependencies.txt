Updating Flink job dependencies
When you migrate your Flink jobs to a cluster that has a new supported version of
        Flink, the applications need to use a new version of the artifacts provided by the Flink
        deployment in your cluster. To avoid incompabilities between the packaged artifacts of your
        application and the artifacts provided by the Flink cluster, ensure that the POM file of the
        application is updated to match the Flink version of the new Data Hub cluster.

Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where you have created your cluster.

Select the Streaming Analytics cluster from the list of Data
            Hub clusters.

Select Repository Details.

Search for the Cloudera Runtime Repository Specification
                    section, and review the Flink version.

Version:
                        1.13.2-csadh1.5.0.0-cdh7.2.12.0-35-17794544


Update the <flink.version> property of your
                        POM file using the Flink and Cloudera Streaming Analyitcs
                    (CSA) version of your Data Hub cluster.

                    version number: 1.13.2-csadh1.5.0.0.
