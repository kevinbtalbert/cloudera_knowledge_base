Flink metadata collection using Atlas
In Cloudera Streaming Analytics, you can use Flink with Apache Atlas to track the input
  and output data of your Flink jobs.
Atlas is a lineage and metadata management solution that is supported across the Cloudera Data
   Platform. This means that you can find, organize and manage different assets of data about your
   Flink applications and how they relate to each other. This enables a range of data stewardship
   and regulatory compliance use cases.
For more information about Atlas, see the  Cloudera Runtime documentation.

Related informationCreate Atlas entity type definitionsAtlas entities in Flink metadata collectionIn Atlas, the core concept of representing Flink applications, Kafka topics, HBase         tables, and so on, is called an entity. You need to understand the relation and definition         for entities in a Flink setup to enhance the metadata collection.Creating Atlas entity type definitions for FlinkBefore submitting Flink jobs to collect their metadata, you need to create Atlas         entity type definitions for Flink. In the command line, you need to connect to the atlas         server and add the predefined type definitions. You also need to enable Atlas for Flink in         Cloudera Manager.Verifying metadata collectionAfter enabling Atlas metadata collection, newly submitted Flink jobs on the cluster are     also submitting their metadata to Atlas. You can verify the metadata collection with messages in     the command line by requesting information regarding the Atlas hook.
