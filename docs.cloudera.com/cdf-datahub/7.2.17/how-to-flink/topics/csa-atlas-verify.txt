Verifying metadata collection
After enabling Atlas metadata collection, newly submitted Flink jobs on the cluster are
    also submitting their metadata to Atlas. You can verify the metadata collection with messages in
    the command line by requesting information regarding the Atlas hook.
To verify the metadata collection, you can run the "Streaming WordCount" example from
        Running a simple Flink application.
In the log, the following new lines
   appear:...
20/05/13 06:28:12 INFO hook.FlinkAtlasHook: Collecting metadata for a new Flink Application: Streaming WordCount
...
20/05/13 06:30:35 INFO hook.AtlasHook: <== Shutdown of Atlas Hook

Flink communicates with Atlas through a Kafka topic, by default the one named
    ATLAS_HOOK.
