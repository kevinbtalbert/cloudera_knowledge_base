Converting Tables to DataStreams
Tables are updated dynamically as the result of streaming queries. To convert them into
    DataStreams, you can either append them or retract them based on the SQL query you have
    chosen.
The Table changes as new records arrive on the queryâ€™s input streams. These
        Tables can be converted back into DataStreams by capturing
      the change of the query output.
There are two modes to convert a Table into a DataStream:
Append Mode: This mode can only be used if the dynamic Table is only
     modified by INSERT changes. For example, it is append-only and previously
     emitted results are never updated.
Retract Mode: This mode can always be used. It encodes INSERT and
            DELETE changes with a boolean flag.
            True marks inserts, and false marks deletes.

Both toAppendStream and toRetractStream methods take the
      conversion class or conversion type information as parameters. For the recommended Row
      conversions, you need to provide the Row.class. For Tuple conversions, you
      need to provide the Tuple TypeInformation object
        manually.Table table = tableEnv.sqlQuery("SELECT name, age FROM People");

DataStream<Row> appendStream = tableEnv.toAppendStream(table, Row.class);
DataStream<Tuple2<Boolean, Row>> retractStream = tableEnv.toRetractStream(table, Row.class);

DataStream<Tuple2<String, Integer>> tupleStream = tableEnv.toAppendStream(
  table, 
  new TypeHint<Tuple2<String, Integer>>() {}.getTypeInfo()
);
