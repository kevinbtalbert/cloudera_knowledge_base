DataStream API interoperability
The DataStream API interoperability offers you new ways to build your Flink streaming
  application logic as you can convert the DataStreams to Tables, and the Tables back to
  Datastreams. This means that you can run SQL queries on your DataStreams. You can also convert the
  result back to other streams, or insert them into one of the supported table sinks.
The following DataStream type conversions are supported:
DataStream<Row>
DataStream<TupleX<...>>


Converting DataStreams to TablesWhen converting DataStreams to Tables you need to define the StreamTableEnvironment for     the conversion. Cloudera recommends creating the tables with names as it is easier to refer to     them in SQL. You should also take the processing and event time into consideration as crucial     elements of Flink streaming applications.Converting Tables to DataStreamsTables are updated dynamically as the result of streaming queries. To convert them into     DataStreams, you can either append them or retract them based on the SQL query you have     chosen.Supported data typesYou should review the supported data types before designing your application to have     all the information regarding SQL type mappings, timestamp and date types.Parent topic: Flink SQL and Table API
