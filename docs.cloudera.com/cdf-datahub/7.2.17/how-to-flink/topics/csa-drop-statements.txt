DROP Statements
You can remove the database, table, and function objects from catalogs with DROP
    statements. You should also include the IF EXIST statement beside the DROP statement to avoid
    errors due to non existing objects.
Use IF EXISTS statement to avoid errors on non-existing objects.
For more information about DROP statements, see the Apache Flink documentation.
