Atlas entities in Flink metadata collection
In Atlas, the core concept of representing Flink applications, Kafka topics, HBase
        tables, and so on, is called an entity. You need to understand the relation and definition
        for entities in a Flink setup to enhance the metadata collection.
When submitting updates to Atlas, a Flink application describes itself and the entities it uses
            as sources and sinks. Atlas creates and updates the corresponding entities, and creates
            lineage from the collected and already available entities. Internally, the communication
            between the Flink client and the Atlas server is implemented using a Kafka topic. This
            solution is referred to as Flink hook by the Atlas community.
