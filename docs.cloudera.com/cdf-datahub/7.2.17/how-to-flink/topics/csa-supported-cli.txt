Using Flink CLICloudera Docs
Using Flink CLI 
You can use the Flink command line interface to operate, configure and maintain your
  Flink applications.
The Flink CLI works without requiring the user to always specify the YARN application ID when
   submitting commands to Flink jobs. Instead, the jobs are identified uniquely on the YARN cluster
   by their job IDs.
The following improvements are implemented for Flink CLI:
flink list: This command lists all the jobs on the YARN cluster by default,
     instead of listing the jobs of a single Flink cluster.
flink savepoint <jobId> and flink cancel <jobId>:
     The savepoint and cancel commands, along with the other single job commands, no longer require
     the -yId parameter, and work if you provide only the ID of the job.
flink run: You do not need to specify -m yarn-cluster, as
     it is included in the run command by default.
