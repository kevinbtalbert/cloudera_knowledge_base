Configuring Materialized View database information
In CDP Public Cloud, PostgreSQL is automatically configured for SQL Stream Builder (SSB)
  when creating your Data Hub cluster using the Streaming Analytics cluster template. You can review
  the database configuration for SSB using Cloudera Manager.
SSB uses PostgreSQL database to store the queried data of the
      Materialized View feature. In CDP Public Cloud, you can only use PostgreSQL as a database for
      SSB. In case you need to connect to the PostgreSQL database of SSB, you can review the
      necessary information of the database in Cloudera Manager. You can also configure the user and
      the password of the database using CLI, and then updating the existing information in Cloudera
      Manager.
Where to find the PostgreSQL database information?

Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where you have created your cluster.
Select Cloudera Manager from the list of services.
Select Clusters > SQL Stream Builder.
Click Configuration.
Filter down the configuration parameters to Materialized View
              Engine.The following information is listed about the PostgreSQL
                database:
Database Name
Database Host
Database Port
Database User
Database Password

When you want to change the default configuration of PostgreSQL database, first you
        need to change the information in PostgreSQL and then update the configuration in Cloudera
        Manager for SSB.


Connect to the database host using ssh.

ssh [***WORKLOAD USERNAME***]@[***DATABASE HOST***]
Password: [***YOUR WORKLOAD PASSWORD***]


Connect to PostgreSQL.

sudo -U postgres psql


noteAs an EnvironmentUser, you will be prompted to provide the password related to the
            PostgreSQL client. In this case, please reach out to your administrator to provide the
            correct password for the PostgrSQL client connection.


Change the username or the password for the database.

ALTER USER eventador_admin WITH PASSWORD [***NEW PASSWORD***];
ALTER USER eventador_admin RENAME TO [***NEW USERNAME***];
noteWhen changing the database username, the existing password for the username is
            deleted. You must change the password as well when renaming the user of the
            database.

After changing the password or username, you need to update the database
          information in Cloudera Manager.

Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where you have created your cluster.

Select Cloudera Manager from the list of services.

Select Clusters > SQL Stream Builder.

Click Configuration.

Filter down the configuration parameters to Materialized View
            Engine.
