SSB metadata collection using Atlas
As SQL Stream Builder (SSB) is built on Flink, you can use the Apache Atlas and Flink
  integration, and collect the metadata of your Flink jobs submitted from SSB. Using Atlas, you can
  find, organize and manage different assets of data about your Flink applications and how they
  relate to each other. 
To use Atlas with SSB, you need to create entity type definitions for Flink in Atlas, and
   enable the metadata collection in Cloudera Manager for Flink.
For more information, see the  Flink metadata collection using Atlas.
