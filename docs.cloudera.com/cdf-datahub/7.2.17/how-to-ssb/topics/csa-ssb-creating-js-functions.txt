Creating Javascript User-defined Functions
With SQL Stream Builder, you can create user functions to write powerful functions in
        JavaScript that you can use to enhance the functionality of SQL.
User functions can be simple translation functions like Celsius to Fahrenheit, more
            complex business logic, or even looking up data from external sources. User functions
            are written in JavaScript. When you write them, you create a library of useful
            functions.

Navigate to the Streaming SQL Console.


Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where you have created your
                cluster.


Select the Streaming Analytics cluster from the list of
                Data Hub clusters.


Select Streaming SQL Console from the list of
                services.
The Streaming SQL Console opens in a new window.



Open a project from the Projects page of Streaming SQL
            Console.


Select an already existing project from the list by clicking the
                  Open button or Switch button.


Create a new project by clicking the New Project
                button.


Import a project by clicking the Import button.


You are redirected to the Explorer view of the project.

Click  next to Functions.

Click New Function.






Add a Name to the UDF.
For example, name the UDF to HELLO_WORLD.

Add a Description to the UDF.

Select the Output and Input data type.
For example, select STRING.

Paste the JavaScript code to the editor.
For
                    example:// check to see if the card is VISA
function HELLO_WORLD(card){
    var cardType = "Other";
    if (card.charAt(0) == 4){
      cardType = "Visa";
    }
    return cardType;
}
HELLO_WORLD($p0); // this line must exist


Click Create.

Once created, you can use a User Function in your SQL statement:
For
                        example:-- simple usage
SELECT HELLO_WORLD(card) AS IS_VISA
FROM ev_sample_fraud;

-- in the predicate
SELECT amount, card
FROM ev_sample_fraud
WHERE HELLO_WORLD(card) = "Visa";
noteValid
                        inputs can be a field in the source virtual table or any other valid input.
                        Functions must be in upper case.noteUser Functions have access to
                        the Java 8 API, this increases the overall usefulness and power. For
                        example:function GETPLANE(icao) {
  try {
    var c = new java.net.URL('http://yyyyyy.io' + icao).openConnection();
    c.requestMethod='GET';
    var reader = new java.io.BufferedReader(new java.io.InputStreamReader(c.inputStream));
    return reader.readLine();
  } catch(err) {
    return "Unknown: " + err;
  }
}
GETPLANE($p0);



Developing JavaScript functionsWhen developing JavaScript functions that are more complicated than just simple         logic, it is recommended to use the jjs command-line utility to create and iterate while         writing functions.Parent topic: Functions
