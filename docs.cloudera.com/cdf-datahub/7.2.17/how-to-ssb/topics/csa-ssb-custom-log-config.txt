Adjusting logging configuration in Advanced Settings
You can customize the logging configurations for the SQL Stream Builder (SSB) job on
        the Streaming SQL Console in per-job mode or session mode. Adjusting the log configuration
        enables you to control the log levels of all the underlying libraries: Flink, Hadoop, Kafka,
        Zookeeper, other common libraries, and connectors to get more or less information in your
        jobâ€™s log.

The customization of the log configuration works differently based on the job
                deployment mode:
Session mode
The execution.target is set to
                                yarn-session mode, this is the default execution
                            mode. 
The log configuration is set at the start time if the Flink YARN session
                            is applied to every job execution. For example, the current log
                            configuration is applied if and only if the Flink YARN session is not
                            set on the Session tab of the Compose page.noteThe Reset
                                    Session button only resets the SSB Session, not the
                                underlying Flink YARN session. To do that, you have to kill the YARN
                                application that is indicated under Flink Yarn
                                    Session on the Session
                                tab.
Per-job mode 
The execution.target is set to
                                yarn-per-job mode.
When you change the default execution mode to per-job, the currently
                            applied log configuration is going to be used for the job. To configure
                            the execution mode, you need to start the SQL query with the following
                            line:SET 'execution.target'='yarn-per-job';
