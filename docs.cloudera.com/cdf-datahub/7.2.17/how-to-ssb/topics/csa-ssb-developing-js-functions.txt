Developing JavaScript functions
When developing JavaScript functions that are more complicated than just simple
        logic, it is recommended to use the jjs command-line utility to create and iterate while
        writing functions.
After the function performs the required task,  migrate it to the console.
            Additionally these files/functions can be saved in a source code control system like
            git/Github.

Create a file for your function.

noteIt is recommended to name the file with the same name as that of the
                        function.


Create some sample input when calling the function.

Call jjs on the command line to test the function.

$>cat TO_EPOCH.js
function TO_EPOCH(strDate) {
   var strFmt = "yyyy-MM-dd HH:ss:mm";
   var c = new java.text.SimpleDateFormat(strFmt).parse(strDate).getTime()/1000;
   return c.toString();
}

print(TO_EPOCH("2019-02-02 22:23:13"));

then
$>jjs TO_EPOCH.js

After you have successfully developed the JavaScript code,
            copy and paste only the function to your code window when creating the JavaScript
            function in SQL Stream Builder.
