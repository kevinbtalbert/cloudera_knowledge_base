Collecting diagnostic data
You can collect diagnostic data from SQL Stream Builder (SSB) and Flink using Cloudera
  Manager, and send it to Cloudera Support for easier troubleshooting.
When using SSB and Flink, Cloudera Manager automatically collects the usage and diagnostic data
   from the services. The collected data is analyzed to further improve the software, and to help
   you in support cases when you encounter an error. You can configure the frequency of data
   collection, and you can also manually trigger sending the diagnostic data to Cloudera. 
For more information about the diagnostic data collection and configuration, see the Cloudera Manager documentation.
The following telemetry data is collected when using SSB and Flink:

Number of users
Number of jobs
Number of registered data sources and connectors
Number of Materialized Views
Number of API keys
Number of tables
Number of catalogs
Total tasks slots in use
Log files from Streaming Engine and Materialized View Engine
Log files from YARN to collect Flink Job and Task Manager processes
