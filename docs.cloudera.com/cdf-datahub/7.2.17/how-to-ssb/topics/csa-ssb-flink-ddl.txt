Managing time in SSBTime attributes define how streams behave for time based operations such as window     aggregations or joins. For Kafka tables you can use the Event Time tab to create source provided     or user provided timestamp and watermarks. For other tables you can define time related     attributes in the Flink DDL or directly in the SQL query. You can use timestamps that are     already provided in the source or you can use custom timestamps.Parent topic: Flink SQL
