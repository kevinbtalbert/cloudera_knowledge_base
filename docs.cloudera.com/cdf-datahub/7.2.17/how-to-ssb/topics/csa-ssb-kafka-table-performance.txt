Performance & Scalability
The Kafka and SQL Stream Builder integration enables you to use the Kafka-specific
  syntax to customize your SQL queries based on your deployment and use case.
You can achieve high performance and scalability with SQL Stream Builder, but the proper
   configuration and design of the source Kafka topic is critical. SQL Stream Builder can read a
   maximum of one thread per Kafka partition. You can achieve the highest performance configuration
   when setting the SQL Stream Builder threads equal to or higher than the number of Kafka
   partitions. 
If the number of partitions is less than the number of SQL Stream Builder threads, then SQL
   Stream Builder has idle threads and messages show up in the logs indicating as such. For more
   information about Kafka partitioning, see the Kafka partitions documentation.
