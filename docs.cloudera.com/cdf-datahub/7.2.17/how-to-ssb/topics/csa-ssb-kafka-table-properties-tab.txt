When using the Add Kafka table wizard on the Streaming SQL Console, you can configure
  the properties under the Properties tab.
You can specify certain properties to define your Kafka source in detail. You can also add
   customized properties additionally to the default ones. To create properties, you need to give a
   name to the property and provide a value for it, then click Actions.
