Managing time in SSB
Time attributes define how streams behave for time based operations such as window
    aggregations or joins. For Kafka tables you can use the Event Time tab to create source provided
    or user provided timestamp and watermarks. For other tables you can define time related
    attributes in the Flink DDL or directly in the SQL query. You can use timestamps that are
    already provided in the source or you can use custom timestamps.
Source-provided timestamps
Source-provided timestamps are inserted directly into the data stream by the source
        connector. This query uses the source-provided order_time field to perform
        a temporal join on multiple Kafka
        topics:-- Table of orders
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id    STRING,
    price       DECIMAL(32,2),
    currency    STRING,
    order_time  TIMESTAMP(3),
    WATERMARK FOR order_time AS order_time
) WITH (/* ... */);

-- Table of currency rates
CREATE TABLE currency_rates (
    currency STRING,
    conversion_rate DECIMAL(32, 2),
    update_time TIMESTAMP(3), 
    WATERMARK FOR update_time AS update_time
) WITH (/* ... */);

-- Event time temporal join to enrich orders with currencies
SELECT
     order_id,
     price,
     currency,
     conversion_rate,
     order_time,
FROM orders
LEFT JOIN currency_rates FOR SYSTEM TIME AS OF orders.order_time
ON orders.currency = currency_rates.currency


User-provided timestamps
You can also specify timestamps contained in the data stream itself. For example, if your
        schema includes a field called "order_time", it is possible to construct a query such
        as:-- Table of orders
-- Converts order_time_string field to timestamp
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id    STRING,
    price       DECIMAL(32,2),
    currency    STRING,
    order_time_string STRING,
    order_time as to_timestamp(order_time_string),
    WATERMARK FOR order_time AS order_time
) WITH (/* ... */);

When an invalid timestamp is found in the stream (for example, NaN), the timestamp of the
        message is going to be 0. This way the message is excluded from the current window.
When your data does not include a timestamp in a suitable format, it is possible to compute
        a new timestamp column from another existing column using the Input Transform feature of
        SSB.
