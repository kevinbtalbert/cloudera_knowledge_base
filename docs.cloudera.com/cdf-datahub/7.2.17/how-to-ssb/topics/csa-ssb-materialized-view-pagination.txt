Materialized View Pagination
You can set a limit and order the results of a Materialized View query by adding values
  to the limit and offset configurations.
After creating a Materialized View, you can order and limit the results after opening the
   Materialized View. The default limit of the results is 100 entries. You can set the limit and
   offset using the REST URL. You need to modify the URL address in your browser by setting the
   value and the offset value as shown in the following
   example:localhost:18131/api/v1/query/5275/summary_query?key=6ef33a7a-c82a-4a72-946b-5fe0b33e033c&limit=20&offset=3
When you edit the Materialized View, the set limit and offset change based on the new filters
   set for the Materialized View query. If you set an invalid number for the limit and offset, an
   error message is displayed.
