Navigating in a project
When you open a project in Streaming SQL Console, you can navigate between the Project
  Manager and the Tab view of the Project Resources.




The Project Manager consists of the following views:
Explorer - tree view of the user defined and external resources of the
      project
SQL History - history of the queries that have been executed by the
      logged in user
Members - list of the users that are invited in the project
Source Control - configure the synchronization source (Git repository)
      for the project, import or export changes
Environments - manage environment configurations, define variables for
      templating
Data Hub Service Discovery - automatic discovery of Kafka, Kudu and
      Schema Registry services in your CDP Public Cloud environment

The Home tab of a project allows you to quickly access the user defined
    resources of a project. It also gives you a quick view about the total number of resources in
    each category with resource specific details. You can open the different resource tabs easily
    from the Home tab to create and manage items in a given resource
    category.
