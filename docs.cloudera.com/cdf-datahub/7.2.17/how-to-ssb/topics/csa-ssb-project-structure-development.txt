Project structure and development
Projects aim to provide a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for streaming
  applications in SQL Stream Builder (SSB): they allow developers to think about a task they want to
  solve using SSB, and collect all related resources, such as job and table definitions or data
  sources in a central place.
Projects aim to facilitate collaboration between developers by sharing common resources among
   its members. Projects can be synchronized with a Git repository, allowing easy migration between
   different clusters. The environment concept in a project allows the templating of
   cluster-specific or sensitive properties.
A project is a collection of resources, static definitions of data sources, jobs with
   materialized views, virtual tables, user-defined functions (UDF), and materialized view API keys.
   These resources are called internal to a project and can be safely used by any job within the
   project. 
Jobs can also use external resources that the logged in user has access to. These resources are
   defined in other projects (for example, a UDF or a virtual table in another project), or can come
   from a Data Source (for example, a Kudu table from the Kudu catalog). External resources are
   outside the scope of the project, thus they can be changed or altered by external factors. It is
   recommended to use only internal resources for projects that are intended to be exported.
The following table summarizes the concepts and structural elements of projects in SSB:


Project specific resources


Jobs
SSB job definitions including SQL, Materialized View configuration and endpoints, Job
       settings such as checkpointing and parallelism. The status of the job and its associated
       Flink job (if any) are not part of the definition.


Functions
User-defined JavaScript functions.


Virtual Tables
Virtual tables of the project. These are stored in the
        <project_name> database of the ssb catalog. When
       exporting a project, only these tables (ssb.<project_name>.*) are
       exported.


Data Sources
Data Sources include Kafka providers and Catalogs in the project. While the definition
       of the Data Source is considered internal to the project, the tables or topics provided by
       them are external, as they are managed by an outside system.


Materialized Views
Materialized Views that have been defined for Jobs in the project.


API Keys
API Keys for accessing Materialized View endpoints.


Job Notifications
Job Notification actions (webhook and email notifications) as well as notification
       groups can be defined in a project. They may be assigned to Jobs to be triggered by
        failure.Job notifications are not synchronized when using the Git import/export
        feature.


External resources


Virtual Tables
Virtual tables from other projects and catalogs that the logged in user has access to.
       Other members of the active project might not have access to these.


Connectors
Connectors available in SSB for connecting to external systems. These are shared among
       the whole SSB instance, and are accessible to all users in all projects.


Data Formats
Data Formats available in SSB that can be used by connectors when connecting to
       external systems. These are shared among the whole SSB instance, and are accessible to all
       users in all projects.


When you access the Streaming SQL Console, there are already existing projects on the
    My Projects page. The ssb_default and
    [***USERNAME***]_default projects are automatically generated projects. The
    ssb_default project and its resources are visible to every user, while the
    [***USERNAME***]_default project and its resources are only visible to that
   user. Every user who created an account in SSB has its own project generated by default where
   members can be invited.



Creating a projectBefore you can use Streaming SQL Console, you need to create a project where you can         submit your SQL jobs and manage your project resources.Navigating in a projectWhen you open a project in Streaming SQL Console, you can navigate between the Project   Manager and the Tab view of the Project Resources.Managing member of a projectCreated or imported projects can be shared with other users in Streaming SQL Console.         You can invite members using their Streaming SQL Console username and set the access level         to member or administrator.Source control of a projectWhen you provide a Git repository and branch for a project, you can push and pull your     project to Git. This enables you to track your versions of your project, create a backup of your     project in Git and manage the development lifecycle of your project.Setting the environment for a projectEnvironments are sets of user-defined variables that can be substituted into templates   in your SSB resources. Environments are like configuration files for your projects that adapt it   to be used in a specific environment. They enable you to keep the common resources and logic of a   project in a central repository and reuse it across different environments, different   clusters.Importing a projectYou can use a Git repository to import a SQL Stream Builder project that was         previously created and exported using source control.
