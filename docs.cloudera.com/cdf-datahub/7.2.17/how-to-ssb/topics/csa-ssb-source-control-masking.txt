Masking information before using source control 
When exporting projects from SQL Stream Builder, possible sensitive parameters in
        CREATE TABLE statements, data sources, or the SQL job will not be redacted. To conceal
        sensitive information, environment variables can be used.

Navigate to the Streaming SQL Console.


Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where you have created your
                cluster.


Select the Streaming Analytics cluster from the list of
                Data Hub clusters.


Select Streaming SQL Console from the list of
                services.
The Streaming SQL Console opens in a new window.



Open a project from the Projects page of Streaming SQL
            Console.


Select an already existing project from the list by clicking the
                  Open button or Switch button.


Create a new project by clicking the New Project
                button.


Import a project by clicking the Import button.


You are redirected to the Explorer view of the project.

Click Environments from the Project Manager.

Click New Environment.

Provide a Name for the environment.
For example, you can name it Dev.

Add keys and values as needed.
For example, you can add psql_password as key, and provide
                    the password as value.

Click Activate to apply the specified information for
                    the project.

When creating the table, reference the environment variable as shown in the
                    following example:

CREATE TABLE  `postgres_cdc_table_1682585103` (
 `order_id` INT,
 `city` VARCHAR(2147483647),
 `street_address` VARCHAR(2147483647),
 `amount` INT,
 `order_time` TIMESTAMP(3),
 `order_status` VARCHAR(2147483647)
) WITH (
 'connector' = 'postgres-cdc', 
 'password' = '${ssb.env.psql_password}' 
 'username' = '...'
);
