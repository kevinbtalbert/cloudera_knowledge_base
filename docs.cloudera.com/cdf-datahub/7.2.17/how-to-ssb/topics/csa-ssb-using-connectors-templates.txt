Using connectors with templates
Some of the connectors have default templates in Streaming SQL Console that allows
        you to create tables with them easily. These predefined templates not only contain the
        CREATE TABLE statement, but every mandatory and optional argument that is needed for the
        table.

Navigate to the Streaming SQL Console.


Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where you have created your
                cluster.


Select the Streaming Analytics cluster from the list of
                Data Hub clusters.


Select Streaming SQL Console from the list of
                services.
The Streaming SQL Console opens in a new window.



Open a project from the Projects page of Streaming SQL
            Console.


Select an already existing project from the list by clicking the
                  Open button or Switch button.


Create a new project by clicking the New Project
                button.


Import a project by clicking the Import button.


You are redirected to the Explorer view of the project.

Click  next to Jobs from the
                        Explorer.

Select New Job > Create.
The SQL Editor for the created job opens in a tab.

Click Templates.

Select one of the connector templates.
The corresponding CREATE TABLE statement is imported to the
                        SQL Editor.

After importing the template to the SQL Editor, you need
            to provide the mandatory properties and you can also fill out the optional arguments if
            needed. When you click Execute, the table of the chosen connector
            is created and listed under Virtual Tables.
