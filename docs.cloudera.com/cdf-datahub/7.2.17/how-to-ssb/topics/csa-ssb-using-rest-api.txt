Using SQL Stream Builder REST APICloudera Docs
Using SQL Stream Builder REST API
You can use the REST API to monitor, manage and
      configure the SQL Stream jobs with GET and POST HTTP methods. You can use the SQL Stream
      Builder (SSB) REST API in the command line or use a REST API Tool.
The following HTTP methods are available for SSB:
GET to query information about the specified endpoint
POST to create resources for the specified endpoint
PUT to update existing resources for the specified endpoint as a whole
PATCH to partially update existing resources for the specified endpoint
DELETE to remove objects from the specified endpoint

The REST API Reference
        document
      contains the available endpoints for SQL Stream Builder. However, you can also reach the SSB
      REST API reference document from on the main menu of Streaming SQL Console.


You can use the SSB REST API with Command Line Interface (CLI), but
   you can also use a REST API Tool, for example Postman.
The Streaming SQL Engine API details the following operations for SQL Stream Builder and
        Flink:
Heartbeat
Admin Operations
User Operations
User Keytab Operations
Data Source Operations
Table Operations
Project Operations
Project Environment Operations
Project Sync Operations
Project Invitation Operations
Project Permission Operations
SQL Operations
SSB Session Operations
Job Operations
Sampling Operations
Flink Job Operations
Flink Session Cluster Operations
Artifact Operations
UDF Artifact Operations
UDF Operations
API Key Operations
Connector Operations
Data Format Operations
Diagnostic Operations
The SSB project-related endpoints can be used with specifying which project the request
      is submitted to by adding the project ID parameter to the endpoint. This means that even
      though a project is selected as the active project on Streaming SQL Console, you can submit
      any request to a different project to which you have access to. The REST API user permissions
      are the same for a project as it is configured on the Members page in a project. The requests
      that are submitted using a specific project ID are submitted as a new session that does not
      interfere with the already existing user sessions in SSB.
Accessing the project ID
You can find the project ID on the homepage of Streaming SQL Console:

 You can also use the GET /api/v2/projects call in CLI to list all
        projects that the user has access to.

Obtaining endpoint URLs
You need to obtain the Endpoint URL of the Streaming SQL Engine API that is needed for the
        API calls using the following steps:
Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where you have created your cluster.
Select the Streaming Analytics cluster from the list of Data
            Hub clusters.
Click Endpoints on the Data Hub cluster details page.
Copy and note down the Streaming SQL Engine API endpoint.






Using REST API with CLI
When using the SSB REST API with CLI Tool, you need to create the POST or GET commands with
    curl, and also include the Manager host FQDN of the Data Hub cluster, the name of the Data Hub
    cluster, and the required operation for the endpoint. If necessary, you can include the
    Streaming SQL Engine port. The submitted commands return the information, or complete the
    process you have requested and display the status in the CLI.
The following examples show a secured GET method to list the SQL
        jobs:$ curl -u: --negotiate '[***WORKLOAD_USERNAME***]:[***WORKLOAD_PASSWORD***]' \
   	'[***ENDPOINT_BASE_URL***]/api/v1/jobs'

Using REST API Tool
When using REST API Tools, make sure that the base URL in the HTTP
        request is similar to the following
        example:[***ENDPOINT_BASE_URL***]/api/v1/jobsThe
        base path has to be the same for all endpoints. In terms of authentication, make sure you
        set “Basic Auth”, and use your workload username and password as credentials.
