Schema Registry


Schema Registry provides a shared repository of schemas that allows
applications to flexibly interact with each other. Applications
frequently need a way to share metadata across data format, schema, and
semantics. Schema Registry addresses these challenges by evolving
schemas such that a producer and consumer can understand different
versions of the schemas but still read all information shared between
both versions and safely ignore the rest.
