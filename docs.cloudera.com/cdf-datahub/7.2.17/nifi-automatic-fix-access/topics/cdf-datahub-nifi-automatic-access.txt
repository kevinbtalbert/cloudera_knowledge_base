Automatic access to new components and fixes without upgrading
Starting with CDP Public Cloud 7.2.16, NiFi in Flow Management DataHub clusters is
  configured out of the box with a feature allowing it to fetch new components and fixes published
  by Cloudera.
The objective of this feature is to distribute new components as well as fixes on
   existing components like processors, controller services, or reporting tasks, without the need to
   upgrade to a new version. To do this, the NiFi nodes check for new NAR files published on the
   Cloudera repository (https://archive.cloudera.com/p/cfm2/).
When the feature is enabled, NiFi checks every 24 hours if NARs corresponding to the
   currently used NiFi versions are made available by Cloudera in the repository. If NARs are
   available, the NiFi nodes download the NARs through the internet and deploy the files in the hot
   loading directory so that the new components are automatically made available in NiFi without
   requiring any restart.
note
If a fix is being pushed for a component like a processor, you will have multiple
    versions of the same component in NiFi and you will need to switch to the new version of the
    component using the corresponding API or directly in the UI, in case of a processor, for
    example, by right-clicking it.

When Cloudera publishes new components or fixes using this feature, the release notes
   will be updated in the documentation to detail the changes being made available.
To turn off this feature, clear the nifi.nar.hotfix.provider.enabled
   property in the Cloudera Manager instance managing your DataHub cluster.
You can also turn off the feature during provisioning by overriding the
    nifi.nar.hotfix.provider.enabled property. For details, see Cluster
    template overrides.
