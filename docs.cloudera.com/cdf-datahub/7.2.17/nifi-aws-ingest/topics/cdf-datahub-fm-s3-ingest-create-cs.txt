Create controller services for your data flow
Learn how you can create and configure controller services for an S3 ingest data flow
    in CDP Public Cloud. Controller services provide shared services that can be used by the
    processors in your data flow. You will use these Controller Services later when you configure
    your processors.

To add a Controller Service to your flow, right-click on the canvas and select
            Configure from the pop-up menu. This displays the
            Controller Services Configuration window.Select the Controller Services tab.Click the + button to display the Add Controller
            Service dialog.

Select the required Controller Service and click Add.



Perform any necessary Controller Service configuration tasks by clicking the
            Configure icon in the right-hand column.

When you have finished configuring the options you need, save the changes by
          clicking the Apply button.Enable the Controller Service by clicking the Enable button
          (flash) in the far-right column of the Controller Services
          tab.
In this example the following controller services are used:
AvroReader Controller Service 
CSVReader Controller Service
CSVRecordSetWriter Controller Service
AWSIDBrokerCloudCredentialsProvider Controller Service
You will use the record reader and record writer controller services when
        configuring the data source and merge record processors in your data flow.You will use the AWS controller service when configuring the PutS3Object
        data target processor.
AvroReader Controller Service 
This controller service parses Avro data and returns each Avro record as a separate
          record object.

CSVReader Controller Service 
This controller service parses your CSV-formatted data, returning each row in the CSV
          file as a separate record.

Configuration Resources


Provide the path to the core site configuration file that contains
                      IDBroker-related configuration to. The path is set as default. The only thing
                      you have to configure is username and password. 
noteThe core-site.xml file is
                      present on every Flow Management cluster. Cloudera Manager stores the right
                        core-site.xml file in the same
                        /etc directory for every cluster.


/etc/hadoop/conf.cloudera.core_settings/core-site.xml




Username


Specify your username.

Password


Specify your password.
If you use your own username, provide the CDP workload password
                      associated with your username.
