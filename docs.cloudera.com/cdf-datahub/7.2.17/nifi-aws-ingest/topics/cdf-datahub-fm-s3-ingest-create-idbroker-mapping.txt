Create IDBroker mapping
Learn how you can create the IDBroker mapping for the target data processors
      (PutS3Object and PutHDFS) of your data flow. To enable
    your CDP user to utilize the central authentication features CDP provides and to exchange
    credentials for AWS access tokens, you have to map your CDP user to the correct IAM role. 

The option to add / modify the mappings is available from the Management
          Console in your CDP environment.


Access IDBroker mappings in the Management Console.


To access IDBroker mappings in your environment, click Actions > Manage Access.







Choose the IDBroker Mappings tab where you can provide
              mappings for users or groups and click Edit.








Add your CDP user account, a service account, or  a user group and the corresponding
          AWS role that provides write access to your folder in your S3 bucket to the
            Current Mappings section by clicking the blue
            + sign.






noteYou can get the AWS IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) from the Roles Summary page
            in AWS and can copy it into the IDBroker role field. The selected AWS IAM role must have
            a trust policy allowing IDBroker to assume this role.

Click Save and Sync.
Configure controller services for your data flow.
