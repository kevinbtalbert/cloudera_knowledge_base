        environment.

        Flow Management cluster.
Your CDP user has been added to the appropriate pre-defined Ranger access
        policies to allow access to the NiFi UI.
You have set up a consumer group in Ranger, and you have a Ranger policy for
        Kafka allowing your CDP user to access this consumer group.
You have a Ranger policy on your Kafka topic you will use as a data source
        allowing the CDP user to consume from the topic.
You have created a target folder on your AWS Management Console for the data to
        be moved to the cloud.
You have created an AWS role with policies attached allowing write access to the
