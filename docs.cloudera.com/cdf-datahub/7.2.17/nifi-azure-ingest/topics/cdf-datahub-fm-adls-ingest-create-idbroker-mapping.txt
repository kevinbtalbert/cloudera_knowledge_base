Create IDBroker mapping
Learn how you can create the IDBroker mapping for the PutHDFS
    processor for your data flow. To enable your CDP user to utilize the central authentication
    features CDP provides and to exchange credentials for AWS access tokens, you have to map your
    CDP user to the correct IAM role.

This task is only needed if you use the PutHDFS processor for accessing
        your ADLS folder.
The option to add / modify these mappings is available from the Management
          Console in your CDP environment.

Access IDBroker Mappings.
To access IDBroker Mappings in your environment, click
                  Actions > Manage
                Access.
Choose the IDBroker Mappings tab where you can
              provide mappings for users or groups and click Edit.


Add your CDP user or group and the corresponding Azure role that provides write
          access to your folder in ADLS to the Current Mappings section by
          clicking the blue + sign.You can get the Azure Managed
          Identity Resource ID in your ADLS Storage Explorer by navigating to
              Managed Identities  > Your Managed
              Identity > Properties > Resource
              ID. The selected Azure MSI role must have a trust policy
          allowing IDBroker to assume this role.Click Save and Sync.
