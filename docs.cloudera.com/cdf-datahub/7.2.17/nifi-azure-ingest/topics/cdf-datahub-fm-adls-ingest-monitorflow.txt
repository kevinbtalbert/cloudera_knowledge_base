Monitoring your data flow
Learn about the different monitoring options for your ADLS ingest data flow in CDP
    Public Cloud.
You can monitor your data flow for information about health, status, and details
      about the operation of processors and connections. NiFi records and indexes data provenance
      information, so you can conduct troubleshooting in real time.
Data statistics are rolled up on a summary screen (the little table icon on the top
      right toolbar which lists all the processors). You can use the
        MonitorActivity processor to alert you, if for example you have not
      received any data in your flow for a specified amount of time.
If you are worried about data being queued up, you can check how much data is
      currently queued. Process groups also conveniently show the totals for any queues within them.
      This can often indicate if there is a bottleneck in your flow somewhere, and how far the data
      has got through that pipeline.
Another option to check that data has fully passed through your flow is to check
      out data provenance to see the full history of your data.
