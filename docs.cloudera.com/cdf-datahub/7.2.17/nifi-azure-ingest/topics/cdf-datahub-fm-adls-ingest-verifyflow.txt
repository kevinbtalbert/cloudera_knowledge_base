Verify data flow operation
Learn how you can verify the operation of your ADLS ingest data flow.

There are a number of ways you can check that data is running through the flow you
        have built.


You can verify that NiFi processors are not producing errors.You can look at the processors in the UI, where you can see the amount of data that
          has gone through them. You can also right click on the processors, or on connections to
          view status history.To verify that the data generated appears in ADLS folder specified in the
          processor, return to your ADLS Storage Explorer, where you should see your files listed in
          the target folder of your file system.You may have to refresh the page
          depending on your browser/settings.
