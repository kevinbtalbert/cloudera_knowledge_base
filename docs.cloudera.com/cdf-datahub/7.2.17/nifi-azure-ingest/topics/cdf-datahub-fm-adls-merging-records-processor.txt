Configure the processor for merging records
Learn how you can configure the MergeRecord processor for your
    ADLS ingest data flow. You can use it to merge together multiple record-oriented flow files into
    a large flow file that contains all records of your Kafka data input.

Launch the Configure Processor window, by right clicking the
            MergeRecord processor and selecting Configure. 
This gives you a configuration dialog with the following tabs:
              Settings, Scheduling,
              Properties, Comments.
Configure the processor according to the behavior you expect in your data
          flow.When you have finished configuring the options you need, save the changes by
          clicking Apply.
Make sure that you set all required properties, as you cannot start the processor until
            all mandatory properties have been configured.


In this example the following settings and properties are used:

RecordReader


Specify the Controller Service to use for reading incoming data.


CSVReader




RecordWriter


Specify the Controller Service to use for writing out the records.


CSVRecordSetWriter




Merge Strategy


Specify the algorithm used to merge records.
The Bin-Packing Algorithm generates a FlowFile populated by
                  arbitrarily chosen FlowFiles.


Bin-Packing Algorithm




Minimum Number of Records


Specify the minimum number of records to include in a bin.


900




Maximum Number of Records
