Build the data flow
Learn how to create an ingest data flow to move data to an Iceberg table in Hive or
        Impala.
Building a data flow to move data to an Iceberg table in
            Hive or Impala involves using NiFi in your Flow Management cluster. The example data
            flow generates FlowFiles with random CSV data and writes this data into an Iceberg
            table.

Open NiFi  in  Data Hub.


To access the NiFi service in your Flow Management  Data Hub cluster,
                            navigate to Management Console service > Data Hub Clusters. 


Click the tile representing the Flow Management Data Hub cluster you
                            want to work with.


Click the NiFi icon in the
                                Services section of the cluster overview page
                            to access the NiFi UI.
You are logged into NiFi automatically with your CDP
                            credentials.



Add the GenerateFlowFile processor for data input. This
                    processor creates FlowFiles with random data or custom content.


Drag and drop the processor icon into the canvas. This displays a
                            dialog that allows you to choose the processor you want to add.


Select the GenerateFlowFile processor from the
                            list.


Click Add or double-click the required processor
                            type to add it to the canvas.



You will configure the GenerateFlowFile processor to
                        define how to create the sample data in Configure the processor for
                            your data source.


Add the PutIceberg processor for data output.
You will configure the PutIceberg processor in
                        Configure the processor for your data target.
Connect the two processors to create a flow.
Drag the connection icon from the first processor, and drop it on the second
              processor.A Create Connection dialog appears with two tabs:
                                Details and
                            Settings.
Configure the connection.You can configure the connection's name, flowfile expiration time period, thresholds for back
                            pressure, load balance strategy and prioritization.
Click Add to close the dialog box and add the
              connection to your data flow.
Optional: 
You can add success and failure funnels to your data flow, which help you see
                    where flow files are being routed when your flow is running. Connect the
                        PutIceberg to these funnels with success and
                        failure connections.
If you want to know more about working with funnels, see the Apache NiFi
                        User Guide.

Your data flow will look similar to the following: 


Create controller services for your data flow. You will need these services when
            configuring the PutIceberg processor.
