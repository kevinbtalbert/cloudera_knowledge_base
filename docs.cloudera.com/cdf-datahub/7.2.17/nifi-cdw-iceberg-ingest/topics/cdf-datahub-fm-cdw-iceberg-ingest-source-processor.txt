Configure the processor for your data source
Learn how to configure the GenerateFlowFile data source processor for the CDW Iceberg
    ingest data flow.

You can set up a data flow to move data in Iceberg table format into Cloudera Data
        Warehouse (CDW) from many different locations. This example assumes that you are using
        sample data generated by the GenerateFlowFile processor.


Launch the Configure Processor window by right clicking the
            GenerateFlowFile processor and selecting
            Configure. A configuration dialog with the following tabs is
          displayed: Settings, Scheduling,
            Properties, and Comments.
Configure the processor according to the behavior you expect in your data
          flow.The GenerateFlowFile processor can create many
          FlowFiles very quickly. Setting the run schedule to a reasonable value is important so
          that the flow does not overwhelm the system.When you have finished configuring the options you need, save the changes by
          clicking the Apply button.Make sure that you set all required properties, because you cannot start the processor until
          all mandatory properties have been configured.

The following settings and properties are used in this example:

Scheduling
Description
Example value for ingest data flow




Run Schedule


Run schedule dictates how often the processor should be scheduled to run. The
                  valid values for this field depend on the selected Scheduling Strategy.

Custom text


If Data Format is text and if Unique FlowFiles is false, you can
                  provide custom to be used as the content of the generated FlowFiles.
The expression statement in the example value generates a random ID
                  between 1 and 10 000, with random last names assigned.

${random():mod(10000):plus(1)}, Smith
${random():mod(10000):plus(1)}, Johnson
${random():mod(10000):plus(1)}, Steward
