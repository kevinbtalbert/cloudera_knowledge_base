Create the Iceberg target table in CDW
Learn how to create an Iceberg table for your data flow.
Before you can ingest data into your Cloudera
            DataWarehouse (CDW) target in CDP Public Cloud, you need to create the table where you
            want to send data with NiFi. The following example shows how to create a table with
            Impala:

CREATE TABLE customer (id int, name string, created_at timestamp)
PARTITIONED BY (country_code string)
STORED BY ICEBERG;
