Learn about the different options that you have after building a simple Google Cloud
    Storage ingest data flow in CDP Public Cloud.
Moving data to the cloud is one of the cornerstones of any cloud migration. Cloud
      environments offer numerous deployment options and services. This example data flow provides
      you with a model to design more complex data flows for moving and processing data as part of
      cloud migration efforts.
You can build a combination of on-premise and public cloud data storage. You can
      use this solution as a path to migrate your entire data to the cloud over timeâ€”eventually
      transitioning to a fully cloud-native solution or to extend your existing on-premise storage
      infrastructure, for example for a disaster recovery scenario. Cloud storage can provide
      secure, durable, and extremely low-cost options for data archiving and long-term backup for
      on-premise datasets.
You can also use cloud services without storing your data in the cloud. In this
      case you would continue to use your legacy on-premise data storage infrastructure, and work
      with on-demand, cloud-based services for data transformation, processing and analytics with
      the best performance, reliability and cost efficiency for your needs. This way you can manage
      demand peaks, provide higher processing power, and sophisticated tools without the need to
      permanently invest in computer hardware.
