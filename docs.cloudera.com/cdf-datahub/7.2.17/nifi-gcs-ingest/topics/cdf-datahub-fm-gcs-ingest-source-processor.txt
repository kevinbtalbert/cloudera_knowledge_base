Configure the processor for your data source
You can set up a data flow to move data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) from many
    different locations. This example assumes that you are streaming the data that you are tailing
    from a local file on the NiFi host. Learn how you can configure the TailFile
    data source processor for your GCS ingest data flow.

Launch the Configure Processor window, by right clicking the
          TailFile processor and selecting
          Configure.This gives you a configuration dialog with
            the following tabs: Settings, Scheduling,
            Properties, Comments.Configure the processor according to the behavior you expect in your data
        flow.
You can provide the path to the nifi-app.log file that contains the
            log of the NiFi service running on the host.
When you have finished configuring the options you need, save the changes by
        clicking Apply.
Make sure that you set all required properties, as you cannot start the processor until
            all mandatory properties have been configured.

Configure the processor for merging your records.
