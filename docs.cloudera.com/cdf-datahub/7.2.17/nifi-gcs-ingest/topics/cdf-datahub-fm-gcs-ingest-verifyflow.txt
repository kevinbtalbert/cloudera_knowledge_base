Verify data flow operation
Learn how you can verify the operation of your Google Cloud Storage (GCS) ingest data
    flow.

There are a number of ways you can check that data is running through the flow you
        have built.

You can verify that NiFi processors are not producing errors.You can look at the processors in the UI, where you can see the amount of data that
          has gone through them. You can also right click on the processors, or on connections to
          view status history.You can check that the data generated appears in your Google Cloud Storage bucket.
          To do this, return to the dedicated folder of your GCS bucket in the Google Cloud console,
          where you should see your files listed. You may have to refresh the page depending on your
          browser/settings.
