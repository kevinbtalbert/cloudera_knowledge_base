Viewing data lineage in Apache Atlas
Learn how you can follow your data lifecycle conveying the origin of data and where it
    moves over time. You may view dataset level lineage graphs in the Atlas UI.
When deploying a NiFi cluster in CDP Public Cloud, a reporting task is automatically
      configured that sends lineage information about your flows into Apache Atlas. In the case of
      the example described in this simple use case, you can confirm in the Atlas UI that the data
      is correctly collected.
