Obtain the HBase connection details
To enable an Apache NiFi data flow to communicate with HBase, you must obtain the
        HBase connection details by downloading several client configuration files. The NiFi
        processors require these files to parse the configuration values and use those values to
        communicate with HBase. 

From the Services pane in the Operational Database
                    cluster that contains the HBase instance to which you want to ingest data, click
                        CM-UI.

Click HBase, located on the Cloudera Manager
                        Clusters pane.

From the HBase view, click Actions | Download
                        Client Configurations to download the client configuration files
                    as a zip file.






Expand the zip file and upload the following files to each of the NiFi nodes in
                    your Flow Management cluster:


hbase-site.xml
core-site.xml

For example:
scp hbase-site.xml cdp_username@publiclp:/tmp
You may also copy these files to a more permanent location later.


Adjust the file permissions to ensure that the NiFi processors can read them. 

For example:chmod 755 tmp/*-site.xml
