Configure the processor for your data target
You can set up a data flow to move data into many locations. This example assumes
        that you are moving data into Apache HBase using PutHBaseRecord. If you
        are moving data into another location, review Getting Started with Apache NiFi
        for information about how to build a data flow, and about other data ingest processor
        options.

If you are moving data into HBase, PutHBaseRecord is the preferred
                HBase processor to use. 


Launch the Configure Processor window, by right-clicking
                    the processor and selecting Configure.

Click the Properties tab.

Configure PutHBaseRecord with the required values. 

The following table includes a description and example values for the
                        properties required to configure an ingest data flow into HBase. For a
                        complete list of PutHBaseRecord, see the processor
                            documentation.
