Provides information on what to do once you have moved data into HBase in CDP Public
  Cloud.
You have built a simple data flow for an easy way to move data to HBase. This example data flow
   enables you to easily design more complex data flows for moving and processing data in HBase.
   Here are some ideas for next steps:
Review NiFi documentation to learning more about building and managing data
     flows.
Review NiFi Registry documentation for more information about versioning data
     flows.
Review the Cloudera Runtime HBase documentation for information about working
     with HBase.
