Add Ranger policies
Add Ranger policies to ensure that you have write access to your HBase
        tables.

Go to Ranger in your Data Lake, and select the cm_hbase
                    service.

From the Ranger cm_hbase service in your Data Lake,
                    create a new policy called customer-ingest that allows
                    the nifi-hbase-ingest user to access the HBase table into
                    which you want to ingest data.
The policy should ensure that the specified user has access to:
The HBase table for data ingest
The HBase Column family for data ingest into the specified table
All columns within the specified column family
Allows read and write permissions
