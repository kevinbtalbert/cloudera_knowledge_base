Understand the use case
You can use Apache NiFi to move data from a range of locations into an Operational
  Database cluster running Apache HBase in CDP Public Cloud. 
Today’s scalable web applications for use cases like hotel or flight bookings as well
   as mobile banking applications are relying on an equally scalable database which can serve data
   at a very low latency. Cloudera’s Operational Database in CDP Data Hub is powered by Apache HBase
   and provides application developers with everything they need to build scalable applications on
   top of it.
You can use Apache NiFi data flows into Apache HBase in a CDP Public Cloud
   Operational Database cluster to make sure that the applications you build on top always have
   access to the latest data.
This use case walks you through the steps associated with creating an ingest-focused data flow
   from Apache Kafka into HBase. If you are moving data from a location other than Kafka, review the
    Getting Started with Apache NiFi for information about how to build a data flow,
   and about other data get and consume processor options. You
   can also find instructions on building a data flow for ingest into other CDP components.
