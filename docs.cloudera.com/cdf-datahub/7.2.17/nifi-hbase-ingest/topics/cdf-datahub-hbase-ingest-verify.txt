Verify your data flow
Once you have configured and started your data flow, you can verify that you are
        successfully ingesting data into HBase.

You have confirmed that NiFi processors are not producing errors.


Open the HBase shell.

hbase shell


List your available HBase tables. You should see the customer table you created
                    at the beginning of this workflow.

For example: 
list

TABLE
customer
1 row(s)


Scan the customer table you created.

For example:
scan 'customer'


A successful data flow results in data moving into the
                customer table.
