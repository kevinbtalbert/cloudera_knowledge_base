Create the HBase target table
Before you can ingest data into Apache HBase in CDP Public Cloud, ensure that you
        have an HBase target table. These steps walk you through creating a simple table with one
        column family. Modify these instructions based on your ingest target table needs. 

Your CDP user has the necessary Ranger permissions to create an HBase
                table.


Ssh into one of your HBase nodes, entering your CDP user name and password when
                    prompted. 

ssh <cdp-user.name><HBase.node.name>


Use klist to verify your Kerberos ticket, to ensure that the
                    Ranger permissions you have setup to create HBase tables will work with your CDP
                    user.

Open the HBase shell.

hbase shell


Create a new table. 

For example, to create a new table called customer, with one
                        column family called customer_data, enter:
create 'customer', 'customer_data'


Verify that you have created your table.

list

TABLE
customer
1 row(s)


Create a Ranger policy that allows the CDP user to ingest data into this HBase
                    table. You will use this CDP user later, when specifying credentials for your
                    NiFi data flow.
