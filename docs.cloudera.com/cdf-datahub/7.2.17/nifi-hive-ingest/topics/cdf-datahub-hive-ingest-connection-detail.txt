Obtain the Hive connection details
To enable an Apache NiFi data flow to communicate with Hive, you must obtain the Hive
        connection details by downloading several client configuration files. The NiFi processors
        require these files to parse the configuration values and use those values to communicate
        with Hive.

From the Services pane in the Data Engineering cluster
                    that contains the Hive instance to which you want to ingest data, click
                        CM-UI.

Click Hive, located on the Cloudera Manager
                        Clusters pane.

From the Hive view, click Actions | Download
                        Client Configurations to download the client configuration files
                    as a zip file.






Expand the zip file and upload the following files to each of the NiFi nodes in
                    your Flow Management cluster:


hdfs-site.xml
hive-site.xml
core-site.xml

For example:
scp hdfs-site.xml cdp_username@publiclp:/tmp
You may also copy these files to a more permanent location later.


Adjust the file permissions to ensure that the NiFi processors can read them.

                        example:chmod 755 /tmp/*-site.xml
