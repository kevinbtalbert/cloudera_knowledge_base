Provides information on what to do once you have moved data into Hive in CDP Public

You have built a simple data flow for an easy way to move data to Hive. This example data flow
   enables you to easily design more complex data flows for moving and processing data in Hive. Here
   are some ideas for next steps:
Review NiFi documentation to learning more about building and managing data
     flows.
Review NiFi Registry documentation for more information about versioning data
     flows.
Review the Cloudera Runtime data access documentation for information about
     working with Hive, Impala, and Hue.
