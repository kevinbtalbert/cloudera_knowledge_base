Add Ranger policies
Add Ranger policies to ensure that you have write access to your Hive
        tables.

From the Ranger cm_hive service in your Data Lake,
                    create a new policy called Database access, and allow
                        select permissions on the database in which your Hive
                    target table is stored.

Create another policy to allow select,
                        update, and Write permissions
                    to ingest into the Hive target table.
