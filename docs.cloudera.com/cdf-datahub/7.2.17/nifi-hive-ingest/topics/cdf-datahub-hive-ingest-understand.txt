Understand the use case
You can use Apache NiFi to move data from a range of locations into a Data Engineering
  cluster running Apache Hive in CDP Public Cloud. 
This use case walks you through the steps associated with creating an ingest-focused data flow
   from Apache Kafka into Apache Hive. If you are moving data from a location other than Kafka,
   review the Getting Started with Apache NiFi for information about how to build a
   data flow, and about other data get and consume processor
   options. You can also find instructions on building a data flow for ingest into other CDP
   components.
