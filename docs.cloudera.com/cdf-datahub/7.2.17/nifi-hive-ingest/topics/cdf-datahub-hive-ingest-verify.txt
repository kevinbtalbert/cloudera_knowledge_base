Verify your data flow
Learn how you can verify the operation of your Hive ingest data flow.

There are a number of ways to check that data is running through the flow you have
                built and it actually appears in Hive.


Review the Hive ingest data flow on the NiFi canvas and confirm that the NiFi
                    processors are not producing errors.

You can look at the processors in the UI, where you can see the amount of data
                    that has gone through them. You can also right click on the processors, or on
                    connections to view status history.

From the Data Analytics Studio UI, in the Compose tab,
                    confirm that your Hive table is consuming content:

select * from retail.customer


You are able to see data flowing into your
                retail.customer table.
