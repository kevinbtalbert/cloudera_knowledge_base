Create the Hive target table
Before you can ingest data into Apache Hive in CDP Public Cloud, ensure that you have
        a Hive target table. These steps walk you through creating a simple table. Modify these
        instructions based on your data ingest target table needs.
You require a transactional Hive table. This is the type
            of table created by default. 

From Cloudera Management Console, go to your Data
                    Engineering cluster.

From Services, click Data Analytics
                        Studio, and select Compose from the
                    left-navigation pane.

Create a new target database.

create DATABASE retail


Create a new target table.

create table retail.customer(customer_id int, customer_name string)


Add policies to Ranger so that the CDP User you are using
            to create this data flow can ingest data into the Hive target table.
