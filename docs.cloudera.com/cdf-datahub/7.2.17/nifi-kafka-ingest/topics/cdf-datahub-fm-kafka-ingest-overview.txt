Ingesting data into Kafka
You can use an Apache NiFi data flow to ingest data into Apache Kafka by following these
    steps. 
Understand the use caseLearn how to use NiFi to move data from a range of locations into Kafka in CDP Public     Cloud. Meet the prerequisitesUse this checklist to make sure that you meet all the requirements before you start     building your data flow.Build the data flowLearn how to create NiFi data flows easily with a number of processors and flow     objectives to choose from.Create controller services for your data flowLearn how to create and configure controller services for the Kafka ingest data     flow.Configure the processor for your data sourceLearn how to configure a data source processor for the Kafka ingest data     flow.Configure the processor for your data targetLearn how to configure a data target processor for the Kafka ingest data     flow.Start the data flowLearn how to start your Kafka ingest data flow.Verify data flow operationLearn how you can verify the operation of your Kafka ingest data flow.Monitoring end to end latency for Kafka topicTo monitor end-to-end latency of Kafka topics, you can monitor the count of consumed         messages across all Kafka consumer groups and the time taken by all Kafka consumer groups to         consume messages that are produced in a Kafka topic, in a graphical way. You can also         monitor the same for each Kafka consumer group, each client in a Kafka consumer group, and         each partition in a Kafka topic.
