Configure the processor for your data source
Learn how to configure a data source processor for the Kafka ingest data
    flow.

You can set up a data flow to move data into Apache Kafka from many different
        locations. This example assumes that you are using sample data generated by the
          GenerateFlowFile processor. If you are moving data from a certain
        location, see the Apache NiFi Getting Started for information on how to build a
        data flow, and about other data ingest processor options.


Launch the Configure Processor window, by right clicking the
            GenerateFlowFile processor and selecting
            Configure. A configuration dialog with the following tabs is
          displayed: Settings, Scheduling,
            Properties, and  Comments.Configure the processor according to the behavior you expect in your data
          flow.The GenerateFlowFile processor can create many
          FlowFiles very quickly. Setting the run schedule to a reasonable value is important so
          that the flow does not overwhelm the system.When you have finished configuring the options you need, save the changes by
          clicking the Apply button.
Make sure that you set all required properties, because you cannot start the processor
            until all mandatory properties have been configured.


The following settings and properties are used in this example:
Table 1. GenerateFlowFile processor scheduling

Scheduling
Description
Example value for ingest data flow




Run Schedule


Run schedule dictates how often the processor should be scheduled to run. The
                  valid values for this field depend on the selected Scheduling Strategy.


500 ms



Table 2. GenerateFlowFile processor properties

Example value for ingest data flow




Custom text


If Data Format is text and if Unique FlowFiles is false, you can
                  provide custom to be used as the content of the generated FlowFiles.
The expression statement in the example value generates a random ID
                  between 1 and 10 000, with random last names assigned.


customer_id, customer_name
${random():mod(10000):plus(1)}, Smith
${random():mod(10000):plus(1)}, Johnson
${random():mod(10000):plus(1)}, Steward
