Verify data flow operation
Learn how you can verify the operation of your Kafka ingest data flow.

There are a number of ways to check that data is running through the flow you have
        built and it actually appears in Kafka.

You can verify that NiFi processors are not producing errors.You can look at the processors in the UI to see the amount of data that has gone
          through them. You can also right-click on the processors, or on connections to view status
          history.You can verify in Streams Messaging Manager that messages appear in the defined
          Kafka topic.To check this:
Navigate to your Streams Messaging Data Hub cluster. 
Click Streams Messaging Manager  in the
                Services section of the Cluster
                overview page.


Search for your previously created topic and verify that your NiFi flow is
              visible, and it shows the producer and consumer as well.


To check the messages written to the Kafka topic, click the blue
                Profile icon at the end of the Topic
              row and choose the Data Explorer tab.


Since we are using an Avro schema in this example, the messages are encoded
              and not entirely readable. You can select the Avro Deserializer (Avro in both
              Key and Value fields) and make the data readable.
