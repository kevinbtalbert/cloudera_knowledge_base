Configure the Controller Service
You can add Controller Services to provide shared services to be used by the
        processors in your data flow. You will use these Controller Services later when you
        configure your processors. 

You must define the Controller Services for the processors in your data flow in the
                onfiguration of the root process group where they will be used.


To add a Controller Service to your flow, right-click on the Canvas and select
                        Configure from the pop-up menu. This displays the
                        Controller Services Configuration window.

Select the Controller Services tab.

Click the + button to display the Add
                        Controller Service dialog.






Select the required Controller Service and click
                    Add.






Perform any necessary Controller Service configuration tasks by clicking the
                        Configure icon in the right-hand column.






When you have finished configuring the options you need, save the changes by
                    clicking the Apply button.

Enable the Controller Service by clicking the Enable
                    button (flash) in the far-right column of the Controller
                        Services tab.
