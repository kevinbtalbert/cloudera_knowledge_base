Configure the processor for your data source
You can set up a data flow to move data from many locations into Apache Kudu. This
        example assumes that you are configuring ConsumeKafkaRecord_2_0. If you
        are moving data from a location other than Kafka, review Getting Started with Apache
            NiFi for information about how to build a data flow, and about other data
        consumption processor options. 



Ensure that you have the Ranger policies required to access the
                        Kafka consumer group. 


This use case demonstrates a data flow using data in Kafka, and
                        moving it to Kudu. To review how to ingest data to Kafka, see
                            Ingesting Data to Apache Kafka.




Launch the Configure Processor window, by right-clicking
                    the processor and selecting Configure.

Click the Properties tab.

Configure ConsumeKafkaRecord_2_0 with the required values. 

The following table includes a description and example values for the
                        properties required to configure an ingest data flow. For a complete list of
                            ConsumeKafkaRecord_2_0, see the processor
                            documentation.

Topic Name Format
Specify whether the
                                        topics are a comma separated list of topic names, or a

Record Reader
Specifies the record
                                        reader to use for incoming Flow Files. This can be a range
                                        of data formats.

AvroReader



Record Writer 

Specifies the format you want to use in order
                                            to serialize data before for sending it to the data
                                            target. 
Note: Ensure that the source record writer and
                                            the target record reader are using the same Schema.

                                        communicating with Kafka.

false



Security Protocol
Specifies the protocol
                                        used to communicate with brokers. This value corresponds to
                                        Kafka's 'security.protocol' property.

SASL_SSL



SASL Mechanism
The SASL mechanism to use
                                        for authentication. Corresponds to Kafka's 'sasl.mechanism'
                                        property.

Username
Specify the username when
                                        the SASL Mechanism is PLAIN or SCRAM-SHA-256.

Password
Specify the password for
                                        the given username when the SASL Mechanism is PLAIN or

A Group ID is used to
                                        identify consumers that are within the same consumer group.
                                        Corresponds to Kafka's 'group.id' property.
