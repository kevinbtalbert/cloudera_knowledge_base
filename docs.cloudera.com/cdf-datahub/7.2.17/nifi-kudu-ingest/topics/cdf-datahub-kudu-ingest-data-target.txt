Configure the processor for your data target
You can set up a data flow to move data into many locations. This example assumes
        that you are moving data into Apache Kudu using PutKudu. If you are
        moving data into another location, review Getting Started with Apache NiFi for
        information about how to build a data flow, and about other data ingest processor
        options.
You can set up a data flow to move data into many
            locations. This example assumes that you are moving data into Apache Kudu in a Real-time
            Data Mart cluster, using PutKudu. If you are moving data into another
            location, review Getting Started with Apache NiFi for information about how
            to build a data flow, and about other data ingest processor options. 

You have created a machine user in CDP User Management and
                synchronized this user to your CDP Environment.


Launch the Configure Processor window, by right-clicking
                    the processor and selecting Configure.

Click the Properties tab.

Configure PutKudu with the required values. 

The following table includes a description and example values for the
                        properties required to configure an ingest data flow into Kudu. For a
                        complete list of PutKudu, see the processor
                            documentation.

                                        flow



Kudu masters
Comma separated list of the fully qualified
                                        domain names (FQDNs) of the Kudu masters to connect
                                        to.
These are the values you obtained in Meet
                                            the prerequisites before you began to build your
                                        data flow. 


Table name
The name of the Kudu table into which you want
                                        to ingest data. 
This is the table you created in Create
                                            the Kudu target table.note
It is important that the specified Kudu table name
                                                match the format of the table you created. Depending
                                                on how you created it, it has one of the following
                                                formats.
