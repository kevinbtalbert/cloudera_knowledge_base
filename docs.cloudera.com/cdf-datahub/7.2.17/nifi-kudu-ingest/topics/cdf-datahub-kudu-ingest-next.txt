Provides information on what to do once you have moved data into Kudu in CDP Public
  Cloud. 
You have built a simple data flow for an easy way to move data to Kudu. This example data flow
   enables you to easily design more complex data flows for moving and processing data in Kudu. Here
   are some ideas for next steps:
Review NiFi documentation to learning more about building and managing data
     flows.
Review NiFi Registry documentation for more information about versioning data
     flows.
Review the Cloudera Runtime data storage information about Apache Kudu for
     information about using Kudu in CDP Public Cloud.
