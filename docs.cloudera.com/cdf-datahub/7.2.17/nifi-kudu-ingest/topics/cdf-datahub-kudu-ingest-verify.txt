Verify that you can write data to Kudu
 Once you have configured and started your data flow, you can verify that you are
        successfully ingesting data into Kudu. 

There are a number of ways to check that data is running through the flow you have
                built and it actually appears in Hive.


 From your Real-time Data Mart cluster, go to the Impala UI.

Search for your data ingest target table. 

For example, in Create the Kudu target table, you created a
                        table called default.customer. 
describe formatted detail.customer;
select * from default.customer;


You are able to see data flowing into your
                default.customer table, with customer_id
            and customer_name entries.
