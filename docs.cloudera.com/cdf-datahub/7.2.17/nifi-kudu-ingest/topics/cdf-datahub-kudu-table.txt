Create the Kudu target table
Before you can ingest data into Kudu, you need a target Kudu table prepared to
        receive the data flow. 

Navigate to your Real Time Data Mart cluster and click
                        Hue from the Services
                    pane.

Click the Tables icon on the left pane.

Select the default database, and click + New to create a
                    new table.

In the Type field, select
                        Manually and click Next.

Provide the table Name, Format, Primary keys, and any partitions.

Click Submit.

The newly created table displays in the default database
                Tables pane.

In this example, you create a table with the following values:


Field name
Value



Name
customer


Format
Kudu


Primary keys
customer_id


Partitions
No specified partitions


+ Add Field to
                                include custom field valuecustomer_id
Type equals
                                    int


+ Add Field to
                                include a custom field value
                                customer_name
Type equals
                                    string







Check the Kudu UI Tables tab, for the name of the table you
                created. You will need this table name later on, when configuring the NiFi
                    PutKudu processor.
Depending on how you created it, it has one of the following formats.


impala::default.customer


default.customer
