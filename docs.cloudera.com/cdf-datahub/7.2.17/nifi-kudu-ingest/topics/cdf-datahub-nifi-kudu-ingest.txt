Ingesting data into Kudu
You can use an Apache NiFi data flow to ingest data into Apache Kudu in the CDP Public
  Cloud following these steps. 


Understand the use caseYou can use Apache NiFi to move data from a range of locations, into Kudu in your   Real-time Data Mart cluster in CDP Public Cloud. Meet the prerequisitesUse this checklist to make sure that you meet all the requirements before you start   building your data flow.Create the Kudu target tableBefore you can ingest data into Kudu, you need a target Kudu table prepared to         receive the data flow. Build the data flowFrom the Apache NiFi canvas, set up the elements of your data flow. This involves         opening NiFi in CDP Public Cloud, adding processors to your NiFi canvas, and connecting the         processors.Configure the Controller ServiceYou can add Controller Services to provide shared services to be used by the         processors in your data flow. You will use these Controller Services later when you         configure your processors. Configure the processor for your data sourceYou can set up a data flow to move data from many locations into Apache Kudu. This         example assumes that you are configuring ConsumeKafkaRecord_2_0. If you         are moving data from a location other than Kafka, review Getting Started with Apache             NiFi for information about how to build a data flow, and about other data         consumption processor options. Configure the processor for your data targetYou can set up a data flow to move data into many locations. This example assumes         that you are moving data into Apache Kudu using PutKudu. If you are         moving data into another location, review Getting Started with Apache NiFi for         information about how to build a data flow, and about other data ingest processor         options.Start your data flowStart your data flow to verify that you have created a working dataflow and to begin         your data ingest process. Verify that you can write data to Kudu Once you have configured and started your data flow, you can verify that you are         successfully ingesting data into Kudu.
