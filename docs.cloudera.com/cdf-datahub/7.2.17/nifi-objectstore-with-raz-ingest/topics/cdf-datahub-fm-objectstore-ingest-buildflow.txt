Build the data flow
Learn how you can build a data flow using the object store processors to fetch data
        from one bucket, and after data transformation, ingest the data into another bucket. This
        involves opening Apache NiFi in your Flow Management cluster, adding processors and other
        data flow objects to your canvas, and connecting your data flow elements.

Use the ListCDPObjectStore and
                    FetchCDPObjectStore processors to list and fetch data from
                your source bucket. Then, after transforming the data, use the
                    PutCDPObjectStore to push the transformed data into the
                target bucket. Use the DeleteCDPObjectStore to delete your data
                in the source bucket. 
Regardless of the type of flow you are building, the first steps in building your
                data flow are generally the same. Open NiFi, add your processors to the canvas, and
                connect the processors to create the flow.


Open NiFi  in  Data Hub.


To access the NiFi service in your Flow Management  Data Hub cluster,
                            navigate to Management Console service > Data Hub Clusters. 


Click the tile representing the Flow Management Data Hub cluster you
                            want to work with.


Click NiFi in the
                                Services section of the cluster overview page
                            to access the NiFi UI.







You will be logged into NiFi automatically with your CDP
                    credentials.

Create the data flow by adding the ListCDPObjectStore
                    processors onto the canvas.


Drag and drop the processor icon into the canvas.
In the dialog box you can choose which processor you want to
                            add.


Select the processor of your choice from the list.


Click Add or double-click the required processor
                            type to add it to the canvas.



Add the FetchCDPObjectStore processor.

Add any processors you require to transform your data.

Add the PutCDPObjectStore processor to write data to the
                    target bucket.

Add the DeleteCDPObjectStore processor to write data to the
                    target bucket.

Connect the processors to create the data flow by clicking the connection icon
                    in the first processor, and dragging and dropping it on the second
                    processor.

A Create Connection dialog appears with two tabs:
                            Details and Settings. You
                        can configure the connection's name, flowfile expiration time period,
                        thresholds for back pressure, load balance strategy and prioritization.


This is an example data flow with the
                ListCDPObjectStore, FetchCDPObjectStore,
                PutCDPObjectStore, and DeleteCDPObjectStore
            processors: 



Configure each object store processor in your data flow.
