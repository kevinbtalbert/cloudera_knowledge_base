Use this checklist to make sure that you meet all the requirements before you start
  building your data flow.

You have a CDP username and password set to access Data Hub clusters. The
    predefined resource role of this user is at least EnvironmentUser. This resource role
    provides the ability to view Data Hub clusters and set the FreeIPA password for the
    environment.
Your user is synchronized to the CDP Public Cloud environment.
You have a Flow Management Data Hub cluster running in your CDP Public Cloud
    environment.
Your CDP user has been added to the appropriate pre-defined Ranger access policies
    to allow access to the NiFi UI.
You have a source bucket on your object store from which you want to fetch data.
You have created a target bucket on your object store for the processed data to be
    moved into.
You have created a role with policies attached allowing read and write access to
    the object store you want to use in your data flow.

noteTo leverage the RAZ capabilities for Ranger defined policies that determine fine-grained
   access control to the object store, enable your CDP Public Cloud environment for RAZ.If the
    environment is not RAZ enabled, the processors will not integrate with RAZ but will still work
    using IDBroker and the corresponding mappings.
