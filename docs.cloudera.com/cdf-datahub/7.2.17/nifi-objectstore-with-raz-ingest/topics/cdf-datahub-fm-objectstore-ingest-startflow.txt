Start the data flow
When your flow is ready, you can begin ingesting data into your object store. Learn
        how to start your object store ingest data flow.

To initiate your data flow, select all the data flow components you want to
                    start.

Click the Start icon in the Actions
                     toolbar.
Alternatively, right-click a single component and choose
                        Start from the context menu. Data should be read from
                    the input bucket and it should be written to the defined folder of your object
                    store.






It is useful to check that data is running through the
            flow you have created.
