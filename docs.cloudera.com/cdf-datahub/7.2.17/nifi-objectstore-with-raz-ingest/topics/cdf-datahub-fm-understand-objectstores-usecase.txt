Understand the use case
Learn how you can use object store processors to build an end-to-end flow that ingests
  data into Cloud object stores in a CDP environment that is enabled for fine-grained access control
  through RAZ.
The object store processors are: 
ListCDPObjectStore: Lists the FlowFiles in the source bucket
     that you want to ingest.
FetchCDPObjectStore: Fetches the FlowFiles from the source
     bucket. If the files are compressed, this processor uncompresses the files.
PutCDPObjectStore: Writes the contents of a FlowFile to the
     specified directory in the target bucket.
DeleteCDPObjectStore: Deletes the ingested data from the source
     bucket.

These object store processors have the following advantages: 
The configuration of these processors is simple and easy. 
These processors can access the underlying object store of the cloud provider where the NiFi
     cluster is running, If you are running NiFi in Azure, these processors can be used to access
     ADLS. If you are running NiFi in AWS, these processors can be used to access S3. If you are
     running NiFi in Google Cloud, these processors can be used to access Google Cloud Storage.
These processors are cloud-agnostic. If you have a multi-cloud architecture with, for
     example, a cluster running in AWS and another running in Azure, you can move this flow from one
     cloud provider to another with minimal change such as the input bucket.
These processors are integrated with RAZ. With RAZ you can define policies in Ranger to
     specify who has access to what in the object store.
Unlike HDFS processors that can only access the buckets that is configured for the data lake
     for your CDP environment, the object store processors can access any location in the underlying
     object store.
