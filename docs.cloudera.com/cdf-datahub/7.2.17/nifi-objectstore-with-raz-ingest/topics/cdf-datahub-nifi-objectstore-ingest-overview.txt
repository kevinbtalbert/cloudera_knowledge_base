Ingesting data into CDP Object Stores with RAZ authorization
You can use an Apache NiFi data flow to ingest data into your object stores in a CDP
  Public Cloud environment that is enabled for Ranger Authorization Service (RAZ). Follow these
  steps: 
Understand the use caseLearn how you can use object store processors to build an end-to-end flow that ingests   data into Cloud object stores in a CDP environment that is enabled for fine-grained access control   through RAZ.Meet the prerequisitesUse this checklist to make sure that you meet all the requirements before you start   building your data flow.Build the data flowLearn how you can build a data flow using the object store processors to fetch data         from one bucket, and after data transformation, ingest the data into another bucket. This         involves opening Apache NiFi in your Flow Management cluster, adding processors and other         data flow objects to your canvas, and connecting your data flow elements.Configure each object store processorLearn how you can configure the object store processors for your ingest data flow. Set permissions in RangerCreate custom Ranger policies to enable the CDP user to read and write to the source         and target buckets.Start the data flowWhen your flow is ready, you can begin ingesting data into your object store. Learn         how to start your object store ingest data flow.Verify data flow operationLearn how you can verify the operation of your object store ingest data         flow.
