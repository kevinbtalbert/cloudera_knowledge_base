Configure each object store processor
Learn how you can configure the object store processors for your ingest data flow. 
Configure the processor according to the behavior you
            expect in your data flow. Make sure that you set all required properties, as you cannot
            start the processor until all mandatory properties have been configured. Property values
            can be parameterized.

Launch the Configure Processor window, by right clicking
                    the ListCDPObjectStore processor and selecting
                        Configure.
This gives you a configuration dialog with the following tabs:
                        Settings, Scheduling,
                        Properties,
                    Comments.

Configure the ListCDPObjectStore processor properties and
                    click Apply.

Storage Location
The input bucket that contains the data that you want to
                                        ingest. You can create a parameter for the input
