Scaling up a NiFi cluster
You have a NiFi cluster and you want to increase the throughput by adding new nodes
        to your NiFi cluster.
You have a NiFi flow which is running.

Log into CDP Public Cloud UI.

Go to Management Console >  Environments.

Select the datahub cluster where your NiFi flow is running.



If you go to the NiFi UI by clicking NiFi, you
                        can check the current number of NiFi nodes in your cluster, as shown in the
                        following image:




Click Actions, and select
                    Resize.
The Cluster Resize window appears.

Select your hostgroup from the dropdown, increase the number of nodes by
                    clicking the + icon, and then click
                        Resize.

noteYou need to select the hostgroup carefully. For light duty templates, the
                        hostgroup is nifi_scaling. For heavy duty templates,
                        the hostgroup is nifi.




It takes some time for the change to take place. In the NiFi UI you
                        can see when the upscale event is completed and the new nodes are added to
                        the NiFi cluster.




You have now successfully scaled up your NiFi cluster.
