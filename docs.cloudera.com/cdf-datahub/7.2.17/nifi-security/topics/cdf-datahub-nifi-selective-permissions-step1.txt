Assign the EnvironmentUser role
For flow management users who do not need administrator privileges, you must assign
        the EnvironmentUser role. This role enables users to set their password and access the
        environment. 

Ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:
You created a Flow Management cluster.
You determined the permission level for each user.



From the Cloudera Management console, go to the
                        Environments tab.

Use the Search bar to find the environment.

Click the environment name.

Click Actions >  Manage Access.
The Access page appears.

Locate the user and click Update Roles.
The Update Resource Role page for the user
                    appears.

Select the EnvironmentUser option.

Click Update Roles.

Go back to the Environments tab and locate the
                    environment.

Click Actions >  Synchronize Users to FreeIPA.
The Sync Users window appears.

Click Sync Users.
This synchronizes the user to the FreeIPA identity management system to enable
                    SSO.

The user is added to the environment and can access the
            environment and Flow Management clusters. You can now add the user or a group of users
            to Ranger policies that allow access to NiFi and NiFi Registry resources.
Complete the steps listed in Add the user to
                predefined
                Ranger access policies.
