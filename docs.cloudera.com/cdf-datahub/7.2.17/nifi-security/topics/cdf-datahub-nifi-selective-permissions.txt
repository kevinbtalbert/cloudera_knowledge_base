Assigning selective permissions to
    user
As a CDP administrator, assign the EnvironmentUser role to enable a user to access the
    environment and Flow Management clusters. Then, based on the user's access requirements, add the
    user or a group of users to the appropriate Ranger access policies for NiFi and NiFi Registry.
    
Perform the following steps to authorize access for a new user: 
Assign the EnvironmentUser role.
Add the user or group to the appropriate pre-defined Ranger access policies.
Create a custom Ranger access policy and add the user or group.


Assign the EnvironmentUser roleFor flow management users who do not need administrator privileges, you must assign         the EnvironmentUser role. This role enables users to set their password and access the         environment. Add user to predefined Ranger access policiesAfter assigning the EnvironmentUser role to the new user, you must add the user to         the appropriate predefined Ranger access policies for NiFi and NiFi Registry. These policies         determine what the user can command, control, and observe in a NiFi dataflow or in the NiFi         Registry.Create custom access policyIf the user cannot access the component through an inherited Ranger access policy,         you must create a custom Ranger access policy for the specific component and add the user to         this policy. If all the users in a group require the same access, you can add the user group         to the Ranger access policy.Authorization exampleYou can review an example to understand how you can enable a flow-management user to     perform specific tasks like setting up version control for a flow, by assigning the appropriate     Ranger policies.Parent topic: User authorization
