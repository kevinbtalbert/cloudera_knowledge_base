Pushing data to and moving data from Snowflake using NiFi
Cloudera supports pulling data out of Snowflake and pushing data into Snowflake, using
  Apache NiFi. You can use Apache NiFi to move data back and forth between Snowflake and other
  systems including Cloudera Data Platform. 
Moving data out of Snowflake
You can create a NiFi dataflow to move data out of Snowflake. To do this, you must meet some
   prerequisites, download the Snowflake JDBC driver jar file, update the NiFi truststore, configure
   your Controller Services, build the dataflow, and configure the source and target
   Processors.
