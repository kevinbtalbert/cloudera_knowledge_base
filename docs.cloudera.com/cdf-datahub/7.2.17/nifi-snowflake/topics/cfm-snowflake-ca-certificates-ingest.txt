Adding Snowflake CA certificates to  NiFi truststore
You must ensure that NiFi can communicate securely with Snowflake. To do this,
        configure NiFi to trust the Snowflake Certificate Authority (CA) by merging the default
        Snowflake JDK truststore content into the NiFi
            truststore.

The Snowflake endpoints have certificates signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). You
                must configure NiFi so that the Snowflake CAs are trusted by NiFi. The recommended
                approach is to follow the steps documented in How to Add Root and Intermediate
                    CAs to Truststore for TLS/SSL. See the link in the Related
                    information below.
Another approach is to merge the content of the default truststore of the JDK into
                the NiFi truststore. This approach is described here. 
note
If you have added the Snowflake CA into the NiFi truststore, you may skip this
                    section. For example, this is the case if you are using Flow Management clusters
                    in CDP Public Cloud.



You have reviewed and met the prerequisites 


Merge the content of the JDK truststore (represented by the file
                        cacerts), you can use the below command:


keytool 
-importkeystore 
-srckeystore [***path to cacerts***] 
-destkeystore [***path to NiFi truststore***]


When prompted, enter the password of the JDK truststore. The default is
                        changeit.

Enter the NiFi truststore password.



If you have changed the truststore, you must restart NiFi before the changes are
                taken into account.
After you have finished adding Snowflake certificates to the NiFi truststores, you
                may move on to the following steps.
Build the data flow.
Create the controller services for your data flow.
Configure your source processor.
Configure your target processor.
Confirm your data flow is successful.
