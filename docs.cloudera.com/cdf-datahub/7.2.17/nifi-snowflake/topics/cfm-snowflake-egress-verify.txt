Confirming your data flow success
Confirm that you have successfully built a data flow to move data out of Snowflake
        database tables by starting your data flow and verifying that data is moving through
        it.

In a real life use case, you may want to connect your
                    ExecuteSQLRecord processor with a processor that can send
                your data to an external system.


Select all the data flow components you want to start.

Click the Start icon in the Actions
                     toolbar.
Alternatively, right-click a single component and choose
                        Start from the context menu.


Your flow should  run without any errors. Data should be pulled from the Snowflake
                database tables using ListDatabaseTables and pooled using
                    ExecuteSQLRecord.
