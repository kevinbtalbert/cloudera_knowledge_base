Moving data out of Snowflake
You can create a NiFi data
    flow to move data out of Snowflake. To do this, you must meet some
    prerequisites, download the Snowflake JDBC driver JAR file, update the NiFi truststore,
    configure your controller services, build your data flow, and configure the source and target
    processors. 
Before you beginBefore setting up a NiFi data flow to pull data from a Snowflake database table, you   must meet certain minimum prerequisites.Downloading the Snowflake JDBC driver JAR fileBefore you can create a dataflow that moves data out of a Snowflake database, you         must ensure that NiFi can interact with the Snowflake database using a JDBC interface. To do         this, you must download the Snowflake JDBC driver JAR file, upload it to each NiFi node in         your cluster, and ensure that the proper permissions are set.Adding Snowflake CA certificates to NiFi truststoreYou must ensure that NiFi can communicate securely with Snowflake. To do this,         configure NiFi to trust the Snowflake Certificate Authority (CA) by merging the default         Snowflake JDK truststore content into the NiFi truststore.Building your data flowSet up the elements of your NiFi data flow that enables you to move data out of         Snowflake using Apache NiFi. This involves opening NiFi, adding processors to your NiFi         canvas, and connecting the processors.Creating Controller Services for your data flowYou can add controller services that can provide shared services to be used by the         processors in your data flow. Create them after you build the NiFi data flow and before you         configure the processors, so that they are available when you configure your NiFi         processors.Configuring your source processorYou can use the ListDatabaseTable processor to get data from your         Snowflake table. To do this, launch the Configure Processor window,         specify the necessary configurations, and start the process to verify that you can view the         Snowflake table. Configuring your target processorIn a data flow that is pulling data from a Snowflake database, configure the       ExecuteSQLRecord processor to handle data pooling from remote tables. To do     this, launch the processor configuration window and provide the configurations appropriate for     your use case.Confirming your data flow successConfirm that you have successfully built a data flow to move data out of Snowflake         database tables by starting your data flow and verifying that data is moving through         it.
