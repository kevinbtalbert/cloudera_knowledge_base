Configure your source processor
You can set up a data flow to push data into Snowflake database tables from many
        different locations. To do this, start by configuring the processor for your data source by
        launching the Configure Processor window and specifying the necessary
        configurations. 

Configure the GenerateFlowFile processor to create random data for
                this example data flow. GenerateFlowFile is useful when you are
                testing or creating proof of concept data flows. When you have confirmed that this
                data flow meets your business use case, you can replace it with a processor getting
                data from your actual data source.

                processor.



You must have built the data flow.
You must have configured your controller services.



Launch the Configure Processor window, by right-clicking
                    the GenerateFlowFile processor and selecting
                        Configure.
A configuration dialog box with the following tabs is displayed:
                        Settings, Scheduling,
                        Properties, and
                    Comments.

Configure the processor according to the behavior you expect in your data
                    flow.
See the Example section below for recommended configuration to
                    satisfy this example use case.

Save the changes by clicking  Apply .


The following settings and properties are used in this example:

Description
Example value for ingest data flow




Run Schedule


Run schedule dictates how often the processor should be scheduled
                                    to run. The valid values for this field depend on the selected
                                    scheduling strategy.

Custom text


If the value of Data Format is text and if Unique
                                    FlowFiles is set to false, you can provide custom to be used as
                                    the content of the generated FlowFiles.
The expression statement in the example value generates
                                    a random ID between 1 and 10 000, with random last names
                                    assigned.

Once you have configured your controller services, proceed to the following
                tasks:

Configure your target processor.
Confirm your data flow success.
