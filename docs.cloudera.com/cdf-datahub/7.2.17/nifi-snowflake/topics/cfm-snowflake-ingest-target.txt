Configuring your target processor
In a data flow pushing data to a Snowflake database table, configure the
            PutDatabaseRecord processor to move data into the Snowflake database
        table. To do this, launch the processor configuration window and provide the configurations
        appropriate for your use case.

Configure PutDatabaseRecord Processor. See Related
                    Information for complete details on this Apache NiFi processor. 


Right-click PutDatabaseRecord and click Configure
                        Processor.

In the Record Reader field, specify the CSV Reader
                    controller service you created in the earlier step.

In the Statement Type field, select
                        INSERT to insert data into the remote database table.
                

In the Database Connection Pooling Service field, select
                    the DBCP Connection Pool controller service you created previously.

In the Table Name field, specify the name of your remote
                    Snowflake database table. In this example, it is NIFITEST

(Optional) Depending on your requirements, you may want to auto-terminate the
                    success relationship of the processor, and have a self-connecting loop for the
                    failure relationship. 


After you have configured your target processor, proceed to confirming your data flow
                success.
