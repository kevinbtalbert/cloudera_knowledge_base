Confirming your data flow success 
Confirm that you have successfully built a data flow to push data into Snowflake
        database tables by starting your data flow and verifying that data is moving through
        it.

Select the data flow components you want to start.

Click the Start icon in the
                        Actions toolbar.
Alternatively, right-click a single component and choose
                        Start from the context menu.

Go to the Snowflake web interface and confirm that data is correctly ingested
                    into your target table.
