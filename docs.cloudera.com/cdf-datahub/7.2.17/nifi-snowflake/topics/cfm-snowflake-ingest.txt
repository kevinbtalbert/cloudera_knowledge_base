Pushing data into Snowflake
You can create a NiFi data flow to push data into a Snowflake database table. To do
  this, you must meet certain prerequisites, configure your controller services, build the dataflow,
  and configure your source and target processors.


Before you beginBefore setting up a NiFi dataflow to push data to a Snowflake database table, you must   meet certain minimum prerequisites.Adding Snowflake CA certificates to NiFi truststoreYou must ensure that NiFi can communicate securely with Snowflake. To do this,         configure NiFi to trust the Snowflake Certificate Authority (CA) by merging the default         Snowflake JDK truststore content into the NiFi             truststore.Building your dataflowSet up the elements of your NiFi data flow that enables you to move data into         Snowflake using Apache NiFi. This involves opening NiFi, adding processors to your NiFi         canvas, and connecting the processors.Configuring your Controller ServicesYou can add Controller Services that can provide shared services to be used by the   processors in your data flow. Create them after you build the NiFi dataflow and before you   configure the processors, so that they are available when you configure your NiFi   processors.Configure your source processorYou can set up a data flow to push data into Snowflake database tables from many         different locations. To do this, start by configuring the processor for your data source by         launching the Configure Processor window and specifying the necessary         configurations. Configuring your target processorIn a data flow pushing data to a Snowflake database table, configure the             PutDatabaseRecord processor to move data into the Snowflake database         table. To do this, launch the processor configuration window and provide the configurations         appropriate for your use case.Confirming your data flow successConfirm that you have successfully built a data flow to push data into Snowflake         database tables by starting your data flow and verifying that data is moving through         it.
