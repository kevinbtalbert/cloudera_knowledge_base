Build the data flow
Learn how you can create an ingest data flow to move data from Apache Kafka to Apache
    Solr. This involves adding processors and other data flow elements to the NiFi canvas,
    configuring them, and connecting the elements to create the data flow.

Use the PutSolrRecord processor to build your Solr ingest data
        flow.


Open NiFi  in  CDP Public Cloud.


To access the NiFi service in your Flow Management cluster, navigate to
                  Management Console > Data Hub
                  Clusters. 
Click the tile representing the Flow Management  cluster you want to work
              with.
Click NiFi in the Services
              section of the cluster overview page to access the NiFi UI.



You will be logged into NiFi automatically with your CDP
          credentials.Add the NiFi processors to your canvas.
Select the processor icon from the Cloudera Flow
                Management actions pane, and drag it to the canvas.
Use the Add Processor filter box to search for the
              processors you want to add.
Select the following processor and click Add.

ConsumeKafkaRecord_2_0
PutSolrRecord


Connect the two processors to create the data flow.
Click the connection icon in the first processor, and drag it to the second
              processor.
You can see the Create Connection dialog with two tabs:
                  Details and Settings. You can
                configure the connection's name, flowfile expiration time period, thresholds for
                back pressure, load balance strategy, and prioritization.

Click Add to close the dialog box and add the
              connection to your flow.
Optional: You can add success and failure funnels to your data
              flow, which helps you to see where flow files are routed when your data flow is
              running.
For more information about working with funnels, see the Apache NiFi
                  Documentation.


Your data flow may look similar to the following:
Create a controller service for your data flow. You will need this service later as
      you configure your data flow target processor.
