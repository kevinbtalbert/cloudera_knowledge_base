Create controller services for your data flow
Learn how you can create and configure controller services to provide shared services
    for the processors in your Solr ingest data flow. You will use these controller services later
    when you configure your processors.

noteYou must define the controller services for the processors in your data flow in the
        configuration of the root process group where they will be used.
