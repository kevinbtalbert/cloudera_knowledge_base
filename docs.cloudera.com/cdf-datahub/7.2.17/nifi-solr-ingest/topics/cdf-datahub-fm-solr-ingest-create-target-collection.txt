Create Solr target collection
Learn how you can create collections in Solr. Data is stored in collections, which
    are single indexes distributed across multiple servers.
Before you can ingest data into Apache Solr, you need a target
      Solr collection prepared to receive the data. For more information about Solr, see the
        Cloudera Search Overview.
Navigate to your Data Discovery and Exploration (DDE)
          cluster and click Hue in the Services
          section of the DDE cluster overview page.On the Hue web UI, select Indexes > +
              Create index.From the Type drop-down, select
            Manually and click Next.Provide a collection name under Destination.In
          this example, we named the collection solr-nifi-demo.Add the following fields, using + Add Field.


Name
Type

text_general


initial_release_date

Click Submit.To check that the collection has been created, go to the Solr web UI by clicking
          the Solr Server shortcut in the Services
          section of the DDE cluster overview page.

Execute the collection query.
Click the Collections sidebar option or click
                Select an option.In the drop-down you will find
              the collection you have just created. In our example it is
              solr-nifi-demo.
Click the name of the collection.
Click Query > Execute
                  Query.The query output should look like this:
                {
  "responseHeader":{
    "zkConnected":true,
    "status":0,
    "QTime":0,
    "params":{
      "q":"*:*",
      "doAs":"<querying user>",
      "_forwardedCount":"1",
      "_":"1599835760799"}},
  "response":{"numFound":0,"start":0,"docs":[]
}}
