Learn about the different options on what you can do once you have moved data into Solr
    in CDP Public Cloud.
This example data flow shows a basic setup, but it also offers endless
      opportunities to implement more complex solutions for moving and processing data in Solr. You
      can explore different data ingest and indexing options where Cloudera Data Platform (CDP)
      components collaborate with each other, while still being resource isolated and managed
      separately.
