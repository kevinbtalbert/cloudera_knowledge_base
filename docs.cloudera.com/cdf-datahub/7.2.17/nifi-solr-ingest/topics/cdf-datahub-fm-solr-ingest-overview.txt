Ingesting data into Solr
You can use an Apache NiFi data flow to ingest data into Apache Solr in the CDP Public
    Cloud following these steps.
Understand the use caseLearn how you can use Apache NiFi to move data to Apache Solr in your Data Discovery and     Exploration (DDE) cluster in CDP Public Cloud.Meet the prerequisitesUse this checklist to make sure that you meet all the requirements before you start     building your data flow.Create Solr target collectionLearn how you can create collections in Solr. Data is stored in collections, which     are single indexes distributed across multiple servers.Build the data flowLearn how you can create an ingest data flow to move data from Apache Kafka to Apache     Solr. This involves adding processors and other data flow elements to the NiFi canvas,     configuring them, and connecting the elements to create the data flow.Create controller services for your data flowLearn how you can create and configure controller services to provide shared services     for the processors in your Solr ingest data flow. You will use these controller services later     when you configure your processors.Configure the processor for your data sourceYou can set up a data flow to move data to Apache Solr from many different locations.     This example assumes that you are transferring data from Kafka using the       ConsumeKafkaRecord_2_0 processor.Configure the processor for your data targetYou can set up a data flow to move data to many locations. This example assumes that     you are moving data to Apache Solr in a Data Discovery and Exploration cluster in CDP Public     Cloud, using the PutSolrRecord processor.Start the data flowWhen you have built and configured your data flow, you can begin ingesting data into     Solr. Learn how to start your Solr ingest data flow.Verify data flow operationOnce you have configured and started your data flow, you can verify that you can     write data to Solr. There are a number of ways you can check that data is running through the     flow and it actually appears in Solr.
