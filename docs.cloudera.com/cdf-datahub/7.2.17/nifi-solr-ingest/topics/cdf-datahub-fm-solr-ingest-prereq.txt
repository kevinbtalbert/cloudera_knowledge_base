Use this checklist to make sure that you meet all the requirements before you start
    building your data flow.


You have a CDP Public Cloud environment.


You have a workload service account with its username and password set to access Data Hub
          clusters. 
The predefined resource role of this service account is at least EnvironmentUser.
          This resource role provides the ability to view Data Hub clusters and set the FreeIPA
          password for the environment.


Your user is synchronized to the CDP Public Cloud environment.


You have a Flow Management cluster in your CDP Public Cloud environment running Apache
          NiFi.


Your CDP user has been added to the appropriate pre-defined Ranger access policies to
          allow access to the NiFi UI.


You have a Data Discovery and Exploration cluster running Solr and Hue. This cluster must
          be in the same CDP environment as the Flow Management cluster.
