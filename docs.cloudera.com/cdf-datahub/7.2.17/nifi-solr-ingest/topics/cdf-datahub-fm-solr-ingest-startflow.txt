Start the data flow
When you have built and configured your data flow, you can begin ingesting data into
    Solr. Learn how to start your Solr ingest data flow.

Select all the data flow components you want to start.Click the Start icon in the Actions 
          toolbar.Alternatively, right-click a single component and choose
            Start from the context menu.
Data is being read from Kafka and it is written to the Solr target collection you
      have created.
It is useful to check that data is running through the flow without any
      issues.
