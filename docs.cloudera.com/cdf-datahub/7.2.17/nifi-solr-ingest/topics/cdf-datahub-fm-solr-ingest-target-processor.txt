Configure the processor for your data target
You can set up a data flow to move data to many locations. This example assumes that
    you are moving data to Apache Solr in a Data Discovery and Exploration cluster in CDP Public
    Cloud, using the PutSolrRecord processor.
Create a machine user in CDP User Management and synchronize
      this user to your CDP environment.

Launch the Configure Processor window by right clicking the
            PutSolrRecord processor and selecting
            Configure.You can see a configuration dialog with the
          following tabs: Settings, Scheduling,
            Properties, Comments.Configure the processor according to the behavior you expect in your data
          flow.
Click the Properties tab.
Configure PutSolrRecord with the required
              values.The following table includes a description and example values for
              the properties required for this Kafka to Solr ingest data flow. For a complete list
              of PutSolrRecord options, see the processor documentation in
                Getting Started with Apache NiFi.

Property
Description
Value for example Solr ingest data flow



Solr Type
Provide the type of Solr instance. It can be Cloud or
                          Standard.
Cloud


Solr Location
Specify the Solr URL for a StandardSolr type.For
                            example:http://localhost:8984/solr/gettingstartedSpecify
                          the ZooKeeper hosts for a Cloud Solr type.For example:
                            localhost:9983).You can find this value on the
                          dashboard of the Solr web UI as the zkHost parameter
                          value.
zookeeper1.cloudera.site:2181,zookeeper2.cloudera.site:2181,zookeeper3.cloudera.site:2181/solr-dde


Collection
Specify the name of the Solr collection.
solr-nifi-demo


Solr Update Path
Provide the path in Solr where flowfile records are posted.
/update


Kerberos Principal
Specify the CDP user name you are using to perform this
                        workflow.
Provide the CDP user name you created and synced with your CDP
                        environment in Meet the prerequisites.


Kerberos Password
Specify the password for the CDP user you are using to perform this
                        workflow.
Password1!



RecordReader
Specify the service for reading records from incoming
                        flowfiles.
AvroReader


SSL Context Service
Specify the controller service to use to obtain an SSL context. This
                        property must be set when communicating with Solr over https. Reference the
                        default SSL context service that has been created for you.
In this example the value is: Default NiFi SSL Context
                        Service



Make sure that you set all required properties, as you cannot start the processor until
            all mandatory properties have been configured.
When you have finished configuring the options you need, save the changes by
          clicking Apply.
 If you want to move data between other locations, see Getting Started with Apache
              NiFi for general information about how to build a data flow and about other data
            consumption processor options. You can also check the other CDP Public Cloud
              ingest use cases for more information.

Your data flow is ready to ingest data into Solr. Start the data flow.
