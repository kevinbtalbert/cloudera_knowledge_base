Understand the use case
Learn how you can use Apache NiFi to move data to Apache Solr in your Data Discovery and
    Exploration (DDE) cluster in CDP Public Cloud.
Time series use cases analyze data obtained during specified intervals and can
      improve performance based on available data. These require that you store your documents
      efficiently in your search engine. You can use Apache NiFi to move data from a range of
      locations to the Solr service in your Data Discovery and Exploration (DDE) cluster in CDP
      Public Cloud.
DDE clusters provide an efficient way to have Apache Solr up and running to store
      and index documents that can be queried by external applications. Beyond search queries, this
      also allows for building insight applications or exploration services based on text or other
      unstructured data. For more information on how to use DDE templates in CDP Public Cloud, see
      the Discover and Explore Data Faster with the CDP DDE Template blog post.
This data ingest use case walks you through the steps associated with creating a
      data flow that moves data from Kafka in a Streams Messaging cluster in CDP Public Cloud into
      Solr in a DDE cluster, in the same CDP Public Cloud environment. This gets you started with
      creating an ingest data flow into Solr. If you want to move data from a location other than
      Kafka, review the Getting Started with Apache NiFi for general information about
      how to build a data flow and about additional data ingest processor options. You can also
      check the other CDP Public Cloud ingest use cases.
