Edge Management cluster definitions
In the Technical Preview, there are three Edge Management cluster definitions available
  to deploy Edge Flow Manager in CDP Public Cloud:

Edge Flow Management Light Duty for AWS
Edge Flow Management Light Duty for Azure
Edge Flow Management Light Duty for GCP

These cluster definitions support installing Edge Flow Management clusters running
   Edge Flow Manager (EFM). During Technical Preview, EFM is delivered as a 1-node deployment, and
   no heavy duty/clustered deployment is available. Cloudera will provide heavy duty templates with
   a 3-node EFM cluster in a later release of CDP Public Cloud.
