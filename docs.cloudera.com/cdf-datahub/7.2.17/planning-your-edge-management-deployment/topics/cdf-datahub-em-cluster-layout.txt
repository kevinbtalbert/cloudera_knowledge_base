 Learn about the layout, capacity, and components of the Edge Management cluster
    definitions in Technical Preview.
The Data Hub service includes a default cluster definition called Edge Flow
      Management Light Duty. The cluster definition is available for AWS, Azure, and GCP. You can
      use it in development, testing, or proof of concept scenarios.
The light duty cluster has the following specifications:
Single node with a single component: Edge Flow Manager (EFM) is co-located
          with Cloudera Manager, running on the management node
Instance types for the single node:
AWS: m5.2xlarge
Azure: D8_v3
GCE: e2-standard-8

Storage requirements:
AWS: 100 GB EBS
Azure 100 GB Standard_LRS
GCE: 100 GB PD-Standard


noteWhen you create an Edge Flow Management Light Duty cluster, a non-HA
      PostgreSQL RDS instance is provisioned and is used by EFM.
