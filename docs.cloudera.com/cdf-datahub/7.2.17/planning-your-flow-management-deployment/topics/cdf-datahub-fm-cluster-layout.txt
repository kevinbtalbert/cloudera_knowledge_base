Flow Management cluster layout
 The Data Hub service includes two default Flow Management cluster definitions. These
    are the Flow Management: Light Duty and Flow Management: Heavy Duty  definitions. Learn about
    the layout, capacity, and components of these definitions.
Flow Management: Light Duty cluster layout
You can use a Flow Management: Light Duty cluster definition in development,
        testing, or proof of concept scenarios. Light duty clusters include the following nodes and
        components (services):




noteWhen you create a Flow Management: Light Duty cluster, a non-HA
          external RDS instance is provisioned and used by NiFi Registry and Schema Registry.

Each of the cluster nodes includes:


NiFi and ZooKeeper co-located on all instances


For each node hosting NiFi and ZooKeeper:
AWS: m5.2xlarge
Azure: D8_v3
GCP: e2-standard-8



Storage requirements per NiFi node:
AWS: 4 x 500 GB EBS ST1
Azure 4 x 500 GB Standard SSD
GCP: 4 x 500 GB PD-Standard



Each NiFi node hosts the following repositories
FlowFile repository
Content repository
Provenance repository
Log and Database repository



For more information, see the Instance types and Storage
          information specific to your cloud provider.

Flow Management: Heavy Duty cluster layout
You can use the Flow Management: Heavy Duty cluster definition in production
        scenarios. Heavy duty clusters include the following nodes and components (services):




noteWhen you create a Flow Management: Heavy Duty cluster, an HA
          external RDS instance is provisioned and used by NiFi Registry and Schema Registry.

The cluster definition includes:


NiFi and ZooKeeper on separate nodes


NiFi nodes scale independently of ZooKeeper


For each ZooKeeper node:
AWS – m5.2xlarge
Azure – D8_v3
GCP: e2-standard-8



For each NiFi node:
AWS – m5.2xlarge
Azure – F16sv2
GCP: e2-standard-8



Storage requirements per NiFi node:
AWS – 4 x 1 TB EBS GP2
Azure – 4 x 1 TB Premium SSD
GCP: 4 x 1 TB PD-SSD



Each NiFi node hosts the following repositories
FlowFile repository
Content repository
Provenance repository
Log and Database repository
