Streaming Analytics cluster layout
The Light and Heavy Duty layouts differ from each other based on the volume of storage.
    You need to choose between the two options based on your operational objectives and application
    specifications.
Streaming Analytics: Light Duty cluster layout
You can use a Streaming Analytics: Light Duty cluster definition in development and testing
        scenarios. The Light Duty cluster definition can also be used in production for stateless
        Flink jobs or for Flink jobs with minimal state. The Light Duty cluster has the following
          specifications:
Flink, SQL Stream Builder, HDFS, YARN, Zookeeper and Kafka are co-located on all
            instances
For each node hosting Flink, SQL Stream Builder, HDFS, YARN, Zookeeper and Kafka
AWS: m5.2xlarge
Azure: Standard_D8_v3
GCP: e2-standard-8


For more information, see your cloud provider-specific information about instance types and
    storage information.

Streaming Analytics: Heavy Duty cluster layout
You can use a Streaming Analytics: Heavy Duty cluster definition in production for Flink
        jobs with large state with RockDB as state backend. The Heavy Duty cluster has the following
          specifications:
Flink, SQL Stream Builder, HDFS, YARN, Zookeeper and Kafka are co-located on all
            instances
For each node hosting Flink, SQL Stream Builder, HDFS, YARN, Zookeeper and Kafka
AWS: m5.2xlarge
Azure: Standard_D8_v3
GCP: e2-standard-8

For worker nodes:
Storage type: SSD
Volume size: 1000 GB


For more information, see your cloud provider-specific information about instance types and
        storage information.


importantIn the Streaming Analytics cluster templates, Kafka service is
          included by default to serve as a background service only for the websocket ouput and
          sampling feature of SQL Stream Builder. The Kafka service in the Streaming Analytics
          cluster template cannot be used for production, you need to use the Streams Messaging
          cluster template when Kafka is needed for your deployment.
