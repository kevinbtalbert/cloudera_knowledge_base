Streams Messaging provides advanced messaging and real-time processing on streaming data using
            Apache Kafka, centralized schema management using Schema Registry, management and
            monitoring capabilities powered by Streams Messaging Manager, as well as cross-cluster
            Kafka topic replication using Streams Replication Manger and Kafka partition rebalancing
            with Cruise Control.
These templates set up fault-tolerant standalone deployments of Apache Kafka and
            supporting Cloudera components (Schema Registry. Streams Messaging Manager, Streams
            Replication Manager and Cruise Control), which can be used for Kafka workloads in the
            cloud or as a disaster recovery instance for on-premises Kafka clusters.
