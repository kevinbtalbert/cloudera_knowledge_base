Streams Messaging cluster layout
 The Data Hub service includes three default Streams Messaging cluster definitions.
        These are the Streams Messaging: Light Duty, Streams Messaging: Heavy Duty cluster, and
        Streams Messaging: High Availability definitions. Learn about the layout, capacity, and
        components of these definitions.
noteKafka KRaft is available in this version of CDP but
        is not ready for production deployment. Cloudera encourages you to explore this technical
        preview feature in non-production environments and provide feedback on your experiences
        through the Cloudera Community Forums. For more information regarding KRaft limitations and
        unsupported features, see Unsupported Streams Messaging features. 


Streams Messaging: Light Duty cluster layout
Learn about the layout, capacity, and components of the Streams Messaging: Light Duty
  cluster definition.
You can use a Streams Messaging: Light Duty cluster definition in development, testing, or
   proof of concept scenarios. Light Duty clusters include the following nodes and components
   (services):



Non-default nodes and scaling
Broker and KRaft nodes are not provisioned by default. You have the option to manually set how
    many of these nodes are created when provisioning the cluster. After the cluster is provisioned,
    the number of Broker and KRaft nodes can be changed by scaling your cluster. For more
    information about scaling KRaft and Broker Nodes, see Scaling Streams Messaging
     Clusters.

KRaft and Zookeeper
By default, Kafka uses Zookeeper as its metadata store. If you provision KRaft nodes in the
    cluster, Kafka runs in KRaft mode and uses KRaft as its metadata store. In this case, ZooKeeper
    instances are still provisioned. However, ZooKeeper is not used by Kafka to store and manage
    metadata. If required, ZooKeeper can be removed from the cluster after the provisioning is
    finished. ZooKeeper can be removed in Cloudera Manager. For more information, see Deleting
     ZooKeeper from Streams Messaging clusters
You can only provision an odd number of KRaft nodes. This is required so that KRaft can hold a
    majority election for leadership. While it is possible to run Kafka in KRaft mode with a single
    KRaft node, Cloudera recommends that you provision a minimum of three to avoid having a single
    point of failure. Cluster provisioning fails if an even number of KRaft nodes are
    provisioned.

Broker and Core Broker volume per instance count
By default, the volume per instance count for Broker and Core Broker nodes is identical. If
    you customize your cluster during provisioning, Cloudera recommends that Attached
     Volume per Instances is set to the same value for both node types. Alternatively,
    if you want to provision a cluster where the number of volumes is not identical, ensure that you
    complete Configure data directories for clusters with custom disk configurations
    after the cluster is provisioned. Otherwise, Kafka does not utilize all available volumes.
    Additionally, scaling the cluster might not be possible.

Default instance and storage configuration
The following table collects the default instance type and storage configuration of the
    various nodes deployed with the Streams Messaging: Light Duty cluster. For more information
    about the cloud provider-specific instance and storage types, see the Related
     Information section.

Streams Messaging: Heavy Duty cluster layout
Learn about the layout, capacity, and components of the Streams Messaging: Heavy Duty
  cluster definition.
You can use the Streams Messaging: Heavy Duty cluster definition in production scenarios. Heavy
   Duty clusters include the following nodes and components (services):



Non-default nodes and scaling
SRM, Broker, Connect, and KRaft nodes are not provisioned by default. If you want to have any
    of these services provisioned, you must manually set the instance count of the appropriate host
    group to at least one during cluster provisioning. Otherwise, the host group and its nodes are
    not provisioned. After a cluster is provisioned, you also have the option to scale these nodes.
    For more information on scaling, see Scaling Streams Messaging Clusters.

Streams Messaging: High Availability cluster layout
Learn about the layout, capacity, and components of the Streams Messaging: High
  Availability cluster definition.
importantMulti-AZ deployments are not supported for Azure or
   Google Cloud. As a result, the Streams Messaging High Availability cluster definitions for Azure
   and Google Cloud are in technical preview. Clusters provisioned with these definitions can only
   be deployed in a single availability zone.
You can use the Streams Messaging: High Availability cluster definition in production scenarios
   where having a highly available cluster spanning multiple Availability Zones (multi-AZ) is
   required. High Availability clusters include the following nodes and components (services):



Non-default nodes and scaling
SRM, Broker, Connect, and KRaft nodes are not provisioned by default. If you want to have any
    of these services provisioned, you must manually set the instance count of the appropriate host
    group to at least one during cluster provisioning. Otherwise, the host group and its nodes are
    not provisioned. After a cluster is provisioned, you also have the option to scale these nodes.
    For more information on scaling, see Scaling Streams Messaging Clusters.

Use multiple subnets for high availability
When using the Streams Messaging High Availability definition, ensure that you select multiple
    subnets when provisioning the cluster. Otherwise, your cluster will not be highly available.

KRaft and Zookeeper
By default, Kafka uses Zookeeper as its metadata store. If you provision KRaft nodes in the
    cluster, Kafka runs in KRaft mode and uses KRaft as its metadata store. In this case, ZooKeeper
    instances are still provisioned. However, ZooKeeper is not used by Kafka to store and manage
