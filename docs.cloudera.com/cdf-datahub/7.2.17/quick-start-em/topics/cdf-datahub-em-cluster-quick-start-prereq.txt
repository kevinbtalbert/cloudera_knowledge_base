Before you start creating your Edge Flow Management Data Hub Cluster, you need to
    ensure that you have set up the environment properly and have all the necessary accesses to use
    CDP Public Cloud. Use this checklist to verify that you meet all the requirements before you
    start creating the cluster.


You have CDP login credentials.

You have an available CDP environment. 
When you register your environment, make sure that the correct security access settings
            are configured. You need to enable SSH access and specify SSH key so that you can
            generate certificates for the agents. For more information on creating a CDP
            environment, see: 
Working with AWS environments
Working with Azure environments
Working with GCP environments


You have a running Data Lake. For more information on the Data Lake service in CDP
            environment, see Introduction to Data Lakes.
importantMake sure that the Runtime version of the
            Data Lake cluster matches the Runtime version of the Data Hub cluster that you are about
            to create. If these versions do not match, you may encounter warnings and/or
            errors.

You have a CDP username and the predefined resource role of this user is
              EnvironmentAdmin.

Your CDP user is synchronized to the CDP Public Cloud environment.


If you need more information about CDP basics, see Getting started as a user.
