Creating your cluster
Once you have met the prerequisites, you are ready to create a managed and secured
    Flow Management cluster in CDP Public Cloud by using one of the prescriptive flow management
    cluster definitions. You can select the cluster definition that matches your cloud provider and
    choose from the light and heavy duty options available.

You can create your Flow Management  cluster using the CDP UI or CDP CLI. The UI offers a
        graphical interface that simplifies the cluster creation process. You can select the desired
        configurations for your cluster easily.
When you create a new cluster through the UI, Java 8 is used as the default JDK. The
        ability to deploy a new Flow Management cluster with Java 11 is available only using the
        CLI. The CDP command-line interface also allows you to leverage scripting and automation
        capabilities to create clusters programmatically or perform bulk operations.

Steps

Log into the CDP web interface.
Navigate to Management Console  > Environments, and select the environment where you would like to create a
              cluster.
Click Create Data Hub.The Provision Data
                  Hub page is displayed:


Select Cluster Definition.
Select the appropriate Flow Management cluster definition from the
                Cluster Definition dropdown depending on your operational
                objectives.There are six template options available:
Flow Management Light Duty for AWS
Flow Management Heavy Duty for AWS
Flow Management Light Duty for Azure
Flow Management Heavy Duty for Azure
Flow Management Light Duty for GCP
Flow Management Heavy Duty for GCP
For more information on templates, see Flow Management deployment
                  scenarios.The list of services is automatically shown below
                the selected cluster definition name.
Give the cluster a name and add any tags you might need.You can define tags that
                will be applied to your cluster-related resources on your cloud provider account.
                For more information about tags, see Tags.
Optional: Use the Configure Advanced Options section
              to customize the infrastructure settings.noteIf you want to
                deploy your Flow Management Data Hub cluster across multiple availability zones (use
                multi-AZ support), go to the Network And Availability section
                and select all desired subnets from the available options. NiFi nodes will be
                provisioned across the selected subnets. Currently, Multi-AZ support is only
                available in Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments.
Click Provision Cluster.

Result
You will be redirected to the Data Hub cluster dashboard, and a new tile representing
            your cluster will appear at the top of the page.

Before you begin
You have installed and configured CDP CLI. For more information about setting up the
            CLI client, see CDP CLI.
Steps
Use the create-<cloud_provider>-cluster command and include the
              --java-version parameter to create your Flow Management cluster.
Valid inputs for the --java-version parameter are 8
            and 11.
Example

cdp datahub create-aws-cluster \
  --cluster-name nifi-cluster \
  --environment-name example-sandbox-aws \
  --cluster-template-name "7.2.17 - Flow Management Light Duty with Apache NiFi, Apache NiFi Registry, Schema Registry" \
  --instance-groups nodeCount=3,instanceGroupName=nifi,instanceGroupType=CORE,instanceType=m5.2xlarge,rootVolumeSize=150,attachedVolumeConfiguration=\[\{volumeSize=500,volumeCount=4,volumeType=standard\}\],recoveryMode=MANUAL nodeCount=1,instanceGroupName=management,instanceGroupType=GATEWAY,instanceType=m5.2xlarge,rootVolumeSize=100,attachedVolumeConfiguration=\[\{volumeSize=100,volumeCount=1,volumeType=standard\}\],recoveryMode=MANUAL nodeCount=0,instanceGroupName=nifi_scaling,instanceGroupType=CORE,instanceType=m5.2xlarge,rootVolumeSize=150,attachedVolumeConfiguration=\[\{volumeSize=500,volumeCount=4,volumeType=standard\}\],recoveryMode=MANUAL \
  --image id=6e038b51-0aea-43ce-873a-a0aa438b54f9,catalogName=cdp-default \
  --datahub-database NON_HA \
  --java-version 11 \
  --no-enable-load-balancer


After you finish
After you have created your Flow Managament Data Hub cluster, you are ready to build your
        first data flow in CDP Public Cloud.
