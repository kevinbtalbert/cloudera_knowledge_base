Giving access to your cluster
As an EnvironmentAdmin, you need provide users access to your environment and
        to the new Flow Management cluster by assigning user roles and adding users to Ranger
        policies.
The cluster you have created using the Flow Management cluster
      definition is kerberized and secured with SSL. Users can access cluster UIs and endpoints
      through a secure gateway powered by Apache Knox. Before you can begin developing data flows,
      you must give users access to the Flow Management cluster components.

Assign the EnvironmentUser role to the users to grant access to the CDP
          environment and the Flow Management cluster.Sync the updated user permissions to the Data Lake (Ranger) using
              Actions > Synchronize Users to
              FreeIPA.This synchronizes the user to the
          FreeIPA identity management system to enable SSO.Add the user to the appropriate pre-defined Ranger policies.To access
          the NiFi canvas and view or manage NiFi resources, the user must be assigned to at
            least:
Flow
Root Process Group
If needed, you can also create a custom Ranger access policy and add the user to
          it.For more information, see Flow Management security overview.
