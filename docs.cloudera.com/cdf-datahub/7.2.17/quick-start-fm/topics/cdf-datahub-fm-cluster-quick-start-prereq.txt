Checking prerequisites
 Before you start creating your Flow Management Data Hub Cluster, you need to ensure
    that you have set up the environment properly and have all the necessary accesses to use CDP
    Public Cloud. Use this checklist to check that you meet all the requirements before you start
    creating the cluster. If you need more information about CDP basics, see Getting started as a user.

You have CDP login credentials.

You have an available CDP environment.note
If you want to deploy your Flow Management Data Hub cluster on multiple availability
              zones (use multi-AZ support), make sure that multiple subnets have been selected
              during environment creation. In the Network section of the
                Region, Networking and Security page, select as many subnets
              as needed.

            the Runtime version of the Data Lake cluster matches the Runtime version of the Data Hub
            cluster that you are about to create. If these versions do not match, you may encounter
            warnings and/or errors.
For more information on the Data Lake service in CDP environment, see Introduction to Data Lakes.
