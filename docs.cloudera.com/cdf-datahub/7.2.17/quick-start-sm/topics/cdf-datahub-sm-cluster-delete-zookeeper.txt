Deleting ZooKeeper from Streams Messaging clusters
The ZooKeeper instances deployed in Streams Messaging clusters can be manually
        deleted if the cluster uses KRaft for metadata management. Learn how to delete ZooKeeper
        from a Streams Messaging cluster.

If you use the default cluster definitions to deploy a Streams Messaging cluster, you
                have the option to provision the cluster with KRaft nodes. If KRaft nodes are
                deployed in a cluster, Kafka runs in KRaft mode and uses KRaft for metadata
                management instead of ZooKeeper. By default, clusters like this still include
                ZooKeeper instances. However, the ZooKeeper instances are not required and can be
                deleted. The ZooKeeper instances can be removed using Cloudera Manager.


warningEnsure that your cluster is provisioned with
                KRaft nodes. If you complete the following steps in a cluster that does not include
                KRaft nodes, the cluster will fail.

Ensure that the cluster, its hosts, and all its services are healthy.
Deleting the service does not remove the service data from your hosts. It only
                    removes the service from management by Cloudera Manager. All role groups under
                    the service are removed from host templates.



Access the Cloudera Manager instance managing the cluster.

Remove ZooKeeper service dependencies:


On the Cloudera Manager Home page, go to Configuration  > Service Dependencies.


Locate and clear the ZooKeeper Service
                            property.


Click Save Changes.



Go to Clusters and select the ZooKeeper service.

Stop the ZooKeeper service:


Select Actions > Stop.


Click Stop to confirm the action.


Click Close after the process is finished.



Delete the ZooKeeper service:


Select Actions > Delete.


Click Delete to confirm the action.



The ZooKeeper service is deleted from the cluster.


If you configured Attached Volume per Instances and the
                    volume count is not identical for the Broker and
                        Core_brokers host groups, continue with
                        Configuring data directories for clusters with custom disk
                        configurations.
If you did not customize Attached Volume per Instances,
                    or customized it in a way that the volume count remained identical for the
                        Brokers and Core_brokers host
                    groups, continue with Give users access to your cluster.
