Giving access to your cluster
As an EnvironmentAdmin, you need provide the users access to your environment
    and to the new Streams Messaging cluster by assigning user roles and adding users to Ranger
    policies.
The cluster you have created using the Streams Messaging
      cluster definition is kerberized and secured with SSL. Users can access cluster UIs and
      endpoints through a secure gateway powered by Apache Knox. Before you can begin working with
      Kafka, Schema Registry, Streams Messaging Manager, and Streams Replication Manager, you must
      give users access to the Streams Messaging cluster components.

Assign the EnvironmentUser role to the users to grant access to the CDP
          environment and the Streams Messaging cluster.Sync the updated user permissions to the Data Lake (Ranger) using
              Actions > Synchronize Users to
              FreeIPA.This synchronizes the user to the
          FreeIPA identity management system to enable SSO.Add the user to the appropriate pre-defined Ranger policies.These
          policies are specified within the Ranger instance that provides authorization to the Kafka
          service in your Streams Messaging cluster.If needed, you can also create a
          custom Ranger access policy and add the user to it.
After you have created your Streams Messaging Data Hub
      cluster, you are ready to start working with Kafka workloads in CDP Public Cloud.
