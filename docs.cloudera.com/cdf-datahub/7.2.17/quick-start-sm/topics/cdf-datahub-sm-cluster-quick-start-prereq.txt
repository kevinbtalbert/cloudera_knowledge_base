 Before you start creating your first Streams Messaging Data Hub Cluster, you need to
    ensure that you have set up the environment properly and have all the necessary accesses to use
    CDP Public Cloud. Use this checklist to make sure that you meet all the requirements before you
    start creating your first cluster.

You have CDP login credentials.
You have an available CDP environment.
You have a running Data Lake.
You have a CDP username and the predefined resource role of this user
        is EnvironmentAdmin.
Your CDP user is synchronized to the CDP Public Cloud
        environment.
Your CDP user has the correct permissions set up in Ranger allowing
        access to Kafka, Streams Messaging Manager and Schema Registry.

importantMake sure that the Runtime version of the Data Lake cluster matches the
      Runtime version of the Data Hub cluster that you are about to create. If these versions do not
      match, you may encounter warnings and/or errors.
