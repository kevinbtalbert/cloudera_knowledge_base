Connecting to NiFi Registry with NiFi Toolkit CLI
In CDP Public Cloud, access from outside the cluster should go through the clusterâ€™s
        Knox gateway. Knox provides basic authentication to its API topologies, allowing you to
        authenticate with your CDP workload username and password.
 Knox has two ports that can be accessed, 443 and 8443.
            This procedure shows you how to connect to the 8443 port of the Knox Gateway Server from
            outside the Flow Management Data Hub cluster (for example, from a local machine). This
            port is secured by Cloudera Manager AutoTLS. If you want to use the 443 port, you can
            use this procedure as a template and modify it for your production certs.

You have a Flow Management Data Hub cluster in your CDP Public
                    Cloud environment.You have the necessary permissions to create a NiFi Registry CLI
                    properties file.


Confirm or set your CDP workload username and password.

To use non-SSO interfaces, each user and machine user must set a workload
                        password. You can manage your workload password from your user profile page
                        under User Management in the CDP
                            Management Console. For instructions, see Setting the
                            workload password.
You will need to reference your workload username and password in
                        the basic authentication parameters (basicAuthUsername, basicAuthPassword)
                        in Step 4.


Identify the Knox Gateway Server in your Flow Management Data Hub
                    cluster.

You can find the hostname of the Knox Gateway Server in Cloudera Manager by
                        checking the hostname in Clusters > Knox > Instances.
Example hostname:
                            flow-management-azure-management0.dataflow.xcu2-8y8x.dev.cldr.work
noteYou can also find the Knox Gateway Server hostname
                        on the Hardware tab of the Flow Management cluster
                        overview page. It is the FQDN of the Management node.


Transfer the truststore JKS file
                        (cm-auto-global_truststore.jks) from one of your CDP
                    Data Hub nodes to your local machine.


Connect to one of your NiFi nodes.


Locate the truststore file.
You can find it in the following directory:
                                    /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/XYZ-nifi-NIFI_NODE/


Get the truststore password with grep PASSWORD
                                proc.json.


Copy the cm-auto-global_truststore.jks file to
                            your local machine.



Create a NiFi Registry CLI properties file referring to:


Knox Gateway Server (specifically pointing to port 8443)
Truststore JKS file
User and workload password using Basic Authentication

You can use this properties file to store all your settings/default
                        values for the Registry related CLI commands, so you do not need to specify
                        the baseUrl and other arguments for every command.
Example properties file
                        datahub-registry-8443.properties:
baseUrl=https://flow-management-azure-management0.dataflow.xcu2-8y8x.dev.cldr.work/flow-management-azure/cdp-proxy/nifi-registry-app
truststore=/Users/john.doe/Downloads/nifi-toolkit-1.13.2/bin/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks
truststoreType=jks
truststorePasswd=password
basicAuthUsername=jdoe156
basicAuthPassword=password1
noteIf you want to use the 443 port, you can use this
                        procedure as a template and modify it for your production certs.


Check that the 8443 port is open.

If the port is not open, configure the security policy in your given cloud
                        provider to allow external traffic to reach port 8443.


Set your CLI session to refer to the NiFi Registry CLI properties file you
                    created.

john.doe@john bin % ./cli.sh session set nifi.reg.props datahub-registry-8443.properties


List the Registry buckets as a quick test for your connection.
You get the list of available buckets in the NiFi Registry.In this example,
                        the Registry has two buckets, TestProject and
                        OtherProject:john.doe@john bin % ./cli.sh registry list-buckets

# Name          Id                                      Description
- ---------     ------------------------------------    -----------
