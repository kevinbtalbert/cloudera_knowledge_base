Exporting a flow from NiFi Registry
This procedure shows you how to use the NiFi Toolkit CLI to export a versioned flow
        from a Registry instance.

You have established a connection to the 8443 port of the
                    Knox Gateway Server from outside the Flow Management Data Hub cluster.You have a flow in the Registry that you want to
                    export.


List the flows in the bucket that you want to explore.
You get the list of the flows in the chosen bucket.In this example, the
                        flows of the TestProject bucket are
                        listed:john.doe@john bin % ./cli.sh registry list-flows -bucketIdentifier 2a5566b5-7380-46b8-9598-328e092e8899

# Name      Id                                      Description
- -------   ------------------------------------    -----------
1 BaseFlow  06acb207-d2f1-447f-85ed-9b8672fe6d30    First flow.
2 TestFlow  ce2fdaf9-bf81-43fa-846f-f38f6891be95    Second flow.


Export a flow from the Registry to a defined location using the flow ID.

In this example, you export TestFlow as a JSON file called
                            mytestflow.json to the tmp
                        folder:john.doe@john bin % ./cli.sh registry export-flow-version -f
          ce2fdaf9-bf81-43fa-846f-f38f6891be95 -o /tmp/mytestflow.json -ot json
where -f specifies the flow ID,
                            -o specifies the name of the output file, and
                            -ot specifies the output type.noteThe output types supported are
                                json and simple. NiFi and NiFi
                            Registry support flow definitions in JSON format.


The flow is exported as a JSON file, so you have a NiFi flow definition on your
            local machine that you can import and deploy, for example in a different NiFi
            instance.
