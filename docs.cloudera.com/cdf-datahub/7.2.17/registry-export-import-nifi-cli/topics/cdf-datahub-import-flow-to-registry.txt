Importing a new flow into NiFi Registry
This procedure shows you how to import a brand new flow or a new version of a flow
        into a Registry instance.

Create a new one or update the NiFi Registry CLI properties file that refers to
                    the Registry of interest. Set your CLI session to refer to this NiFi Registry
                    CLI properties file.
For instructions, see Steps 4-6 in Connecting to NiFi Registry with NiFi Toolkit
                        CLI.

Create a new flow.

john.doe@john bin % ./cli.sh registry create-flow -b 699ac53c-7be7-4082-8711-f9fff823826c -fd "This is the flow description" -fn "This is the flow name"

b748827f-565f-4a69-8ce0-7218fcab35f4

where -b specifies the bucket ID in the Registry where you
                        want to add the new flow, -fd specifies the description of
                        the flow, and -fn specifies the name of the flow.
This generates a flow ID for an empty flow with an initial version
                        of 0.


Import a flow definition to the Registry as version 1.

john.doe@john bin % ./cli.sh registry import-flow-version -f b748827f-565f-4a69-8ce0-7218fcab35f4 -i dh_export_test.json
1

where -f specifies the flow ID and
                            -i specifies the name of the input file.
noteIf a flow already exists in the Registry, and you
                        want to import a new version of the flow into Registry, you just need to
                        reference the existing flow ID in the import command and the Registry will
                        increment it as the next version.
For
                        example:john.doe@john bin % ./cli.sh registry import-flow-version -f 7ce2fdaf9-bf81-43fa-846f-f38f6891be95 -i mytestflow.json
