Overview
NiFi CLI is a command line utility included in the NiFi Toolkit. You can use it to
  interact with NiFi and NiFi Registry instances to deploy versioned flows or manage process groups.
  You can also use it to export flows from or import flows to the NiFi Registry.
In this use case, you can see how to connect the NiFi CLI to a NiFi Registry running in a Flow
   Management Data Hub cluster using basic authentication, how to use the NiFi CLI to export a
   versioned flow from this Registry instance, and on how to import it into a different one.
