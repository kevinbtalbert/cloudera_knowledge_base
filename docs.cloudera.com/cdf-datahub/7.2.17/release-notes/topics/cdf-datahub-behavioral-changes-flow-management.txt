Behavioral changes in Flow Management
Review the list of Flow Management behavioral changes in Cloudera DataFlow for Data Hub
      7.2.17.

Summary:
The Neo4JCypher3ClientService Controller Service has been completely removed in favor of
          the Neo4JCypherClientService controller service, which uses a more recent version of the
          underlying library.

Summary:

As part of NIFI-11614 and to ensure better security, some restrictions around the
            JndiJmsConnectionFactoryProvider controller service have been implemented.

New behavior:

The default validation for the JNDI Provider URL property only allows the following URL
              schemes:
file
jgroups
ssl
t3
t3s
tcp
udp
vm

If an additional URL scheme is required to interact with a specific JMS
            solution, a NiFi admin has to configure the following Java system property in the
            application bootstrap.conf file to override the default list:
              java.arg.jndiJmsUrlSchemesAllowed=-Dorg.apache.nifi.jms.cf.jndi.provider.url.schemes.allowed=ssl
              tcpnoteThe property must contain a space-separated
              list of URL schemes.
