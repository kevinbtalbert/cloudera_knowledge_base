CVE-2023-34212
Potential Deserialization of Untrusted Data with JNDI in JMS Components. The
     JndiJmsConnectionFactoryProvider controller service along with the ConsumeJMS and PublishJMS
     processors, in Apache NiFi from 1.8.0 through 1.21.0 allow an authenticated and authorized user
     to configure URL and library properties that enable deserialization of untrusted data from a
     remote location. The resolution validates the JNDI URL and restricts locations to a set of
     allowed schemes. For more information, see Behavioral changes.
