CEM-2563: EFM behind proxy - support for generated download URLs
As a DataHub deployment EFM is behind proxy (Knox) and there are URL rewrite rules in
          place so user facing URLs that are generated by EFM are broken. Currently, this only
          affects the debug bundle download.

The generated download debug bundle URL is similar to this:
              https://log-coll-2-management0.cysec-en.a465-9q4k.cloudera.site/efm/api/transfer/3267dcbb-9341-4f30-bbb9-7b2a93de2725
It needs to be adjusted to be proxy aware by including the deployment name
              /cdp-proxy-api/efm-api mapping. The correct URL should be something
            like this:
              https://log-coll-2-management0.cysec-en.a465-9q4k.cloudera.site/log-coll-2/cdp-proxy-api/efm-api/transfer/3267dcbb-9341-4f30-bbb9-7b2a93de2725.
            Using the adjusted URL downloads the debug bundle.
