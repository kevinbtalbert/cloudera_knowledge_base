NiFi UI becomes unavailable when a bulletin is generated at Flow Controller level
When a bulletin is generated at the Flow Controller level, such as for reporting tasks
            or a disconnected node, the NiFi UI becomes unavailable and gets stuck with a loading
            spinner. The UI remains inaccessible until the bulletin at the Flow Controller level is
            cleared (a bulletin persists for 5 minutes after being generated). The issue is a
              result of NIFI-11433 and is fixed in NIFI-11560. The fix is not included in this
            release.

To address the issue until CDP 7.2.17.100 becomes available, upgrade your Data Hub
              cluster using the CDP CLI and utilize an image containing the fix. For instructions on
              how to use the upgrade-cluster CLI command, see https://cloudera.github.io/cdp-dev-docs/cli-docs/datahub/upgrade-cluster.html.

Incomplete Ranger policy for NiFi metrics in Cloudera
            Manager
To have Cloudera Manager properly reflect the NiFi metrics for the NiFi service, the
              Flow NiFi access policies in Ranger needs to be updated to include the "nifi"
            group.


KafkaRecordSink puts multiple records in one message
All the records are sent as a single Kafka message containing an
            array of records.For more information, see NIFI-8326.
There is no workaround for this issue.


NiFi Atlas reporting task does not work after data lake upgrade
            from light to medium
After you upgrade your data lake from light to medium scale, the
            data lake machine hostname and IP address will change. As the Atlas reporting task uses
            Atlas and Kafka server hostnames, after the upgrade the wrong hostnames will prevent
            NiFi to report into Atlas.

Update the configuration of the ReportLineageToAtlas reporting
              task:

Open the Global menu on the NiFi UI.
Click Controller settings.
Select the Reporting tasks tab in the dialog box.
Stop the ReportLineageToAtlas reporting task and update the
                  configuration:
Replace the hostname value in the Atlas Urls
                    configuration with the new Atlas hostname.
Replace the hostnames value in the Kafka Bootstrap
                      servers configuration with the new Kafka bootstrap server
                    hostnames.

Start the ReportLineageToAtlas reporting task.




InferAvroSchema may fail when inferring schema for JSON
            data
In Apache NiFi 1.17, the dependency on Apache Avro has been
            upgraded to 1.11.0. However, the InferAvroSchema processor depends on the
            hadoop-libraries NAR from which the Avro version comes from, causing a NoSuchMethodError
            exception. importantThis processor is not supported
              by Cloudera and its use is highly discouraged as inferring a schema from the data is
              not recommended in production data flows.Having well defined schemas ensures
            consistent behavior, allows for proper schema versioning and prevents downstream systems
            to generate errors because of unexpected schema changes. Besides, schema inference may
            not always be 100% accurate and can be an expensive operation in terms of
            performances.
Use the ConvertRecord processor and have the Record Writer
            write the schema as a FlowFile attribute.
