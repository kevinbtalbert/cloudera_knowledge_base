Known Issues


The offsets.topic.replication.factor property
            must be less than or equal to the number of live brokers
The offsets.topic.replication.factor broker
            configuration is now enforced upon auto topic creation. Internal auto topic creation
            will fail with a GROUP_COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE error until the
            cluster size meets this replication factor requirement.
None


Requests fail when sending to a nonexistent topic with
              auto.create.topics.enable set to true
The first few produce requests fail when
            sending to a nonexistent topic with auto.create.topics.enable set to
            true.
Increase the number of retries in the producer
            configuration setting retries.


KAFKA-2561: Performance degradation when SSL Is enabled
In some configuration scenarios, significant performance
            degradation can occur when SSL is enabled. The impact varies depending on your CPU, JVM
            version, Kafka configuration, and message size. Consumers are typically more affected
            than producers.
Configure brokers and clients with
              ssl.secure.random.implementation = SHA1PRNG. It often reduces this
            degradation drastically, but its effect is CPU and JVM dependent.


OPSAPS-43236: Kafka garbage collection logs are written to the
            process directory
By default Kafka garbage collection logs are written to the
            agent process directory. Changing the default path for these log files is currently
            unsupported.
None


CDPD-45183: Kafka Connect active topics might be visible to
            unauthorised users
The Kafka Connect active topics endpoint
                (/connectors/[***CONNECTOR NAME***]/topics) and
            the Connect Cluster page on the SMM UI disregard the user permissions configured for the
            Kafka service in Ranger. As a result, all active topics of connectors might become
            visible to users who do not have permissions to view them. Note that user permission
            configured for Kafka Connect in Ranger are not affected by this issue and are correctly
            applied.
None.


RANGER-3809: Idempotent Kafka producer fails to initialize due
            to an authorization failure
 Kafka producers that have idempotence enabled require the
            Idempotent Write permission to be set on the cluster resource in Ranger. If permission
            is not given, the client fails to initialize and an error similar to the following is
            thrown:
            org.apache.kafka.common.KafkaException: Cannot execute transactional method because we are in an error state
    at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.TransactionManager.maybeFailWithError(TransactionManager.java:1125)
    at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.TransactionManager.maybeAddPartition(TransactionManager.java:442)
    at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer.doSend(KafkaProducer.java:1000)
    at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer.send(KafkaProducer.java:914)
    at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer.send(KafkaProducer.java:800)
    .
    .
    .
Caused by: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.ClusterAuthorizationException: Cluster authorization failed.
Idempotence
            is enabled by default for clients in Kafka 3.0.1, 3.1.1, and any version after 3.1.1.
            This means that any client updated to 3.0.1, 3.1.1, or any version after 3.1.1 is
            affected by this issue.
This issue has two workarounds, do either of the following:
Explicitly disable idempotence for the producers. This can be done by setting
                  enable.idempotence to false.
Update your policies in Ranger and ensure that producers have Idempotent Write
                permission on the cluster resource.



CDPD-49304: AvroConverter does not support composite default
            values
AvroConverter cannot handle schemas containing a
              STRUCT type default value.
None.


DBZ-4990: The Debezium Db2 Source connector does not support
            schema evolution
The Debezium Db2 Source connector does not support the evolution
            (updates) of schemas. In addition, schema change events are not emitted to the schema
            change topic if there is a change in the schema of a table that is in capture mode. For
            more information, see DBZ-4990.
None.


Limitations


Collection of Partition Level Metrics May Cause Cloudera
            Managerâ€™s Performance to Degrade

If the Kafka service operates with a large number of partitions, collection of
              partition level metrics may cause Cloudera Manager's performance to degrade.
If you are observing performance degradation and your cluster is operating with a
              high number of partitions, you can choose to disable the collection of partition level
              metrics. important If you are using SMM to monitor Kafka or Cruise
                Control for rebalancing Kafka partitions, be aware that both SMM and Cruise Control
                rely on partition level metrics. If partition level metric collection is disabled,
                SMM will not be able to display information about partitions. In addition, Cruise
                Control will not operate properly. 
Complete the following steps to turn off the collection of partition level metrics:
Obtain the Kafka service name:
In Cloudera Manager, Select the Kafka service.
Select any available chart, and select Open in Chart Builder
                      from the configuration icon drop-down.
Find $SERVICENAME= near the top of the display.The
                        Kafka service name is the value of $SERVICENAME.

Turn off the collection of partition level metrics:
Go to Hosts > Hosts
                          Configuration.
Find and configure the Cloudera Manager Agent Monitoring Advanced
                        Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) configuration
                        property.Enter the following to turn off the collection of partition
                        level
                        metrics:[KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME]_feature_send_broker_topic_partition_entity_update_enabled=false
Replace
                          [KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME] with the service name of Kafka
                        obtained in step 1. The service name should always be in lower
                      case.

Schema Registry
Learn about the known issues and limitations in Schema Registry in this release:


CDPD-49304: AvroConverter does not support composite default
            values
AvroConverter cannot handle schemas containing a
              STRUCT type default value.
None.


CDPD-58265: Schema Registry Client incorrectly applies SSL
            configuration
The Cloudera distributed Schema Registry Java client might fail
            to apply the SSL configurations correctly with concurrent access in Jersey clients due
            to a Jersey issue related to JDK.
Before using HttpsURLConnection in any
            form concurrently, call
              javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultSSLSocketFactory() once in
            the custom client application.


CDPD-55381: Schema Registry issues authentication cookie for the
            authorized user, not for the authenticated one
When the authenticated user is different from the authorized
            user, which can happen when Schema Registry is used behind Knox, authorization issues
            can occur for subsequent requests as the authentication cookie in Schema Registry stores
            the authorized user.
Access Schema Registry directly, without using Knox, if
            possible. If not, ensure that the name of the end user that tries to connect does not
            begin with knox.



Streams Messaging Manager

CDPD-39313: Some numbers are not rendered properly in SMM
              UI
Very large numbers can be imprecisely represented on the UI.
              For example, bytes larger than 8 petabytes would lose precision.
None.


CDPD-45183: Kafka Connect active topics might be visible to
              unauthorised users
The Kafka Connect active topics endpoint
                  (/connectors/[***CONNECTOR NAME***]/topics)
              and the Connect Cluster page on the SMM UI disregard the user permissions configured
              for the Kafka service in Ranger. As a result, all active topics of connectors might
              become visible to users who do not have permissions to view them. Note that user
              permission configured for Kafka Connect in Ranger are not affected by this issue and
              are correctly applied.
None.


OPSAPS-59553: SMM's bootstrap server config should be updated
              based on Kafka's listeners
SMM does not show any metrics for Kafka or Kafka Connect when
              multiple listeners are set in Kafka.
SMM cannot identify multiple listeners and still points
              to bootstrap server using the default broker port (9093 for SASL_SSL). You would have
              to override bootstrap server URL (hostname:port as set in the listeners for broker).
              Add the bootstrap server details in SMM safety valve in the following path:
Cloudera Manager >  SMM >  Configuration > Streams Messaging Manager Rest Admin Server Advanced Configuration
                  Snippet (Safety Valve) for streams-messaging-manager.yaml >  Add the following value for bootstrap servers > Save Changes >  Restart SMM:
streams.messaging.manager.kafka.bootstrap.servers=<comma-separated list of brokers>



OPSAPS-59597: SMM UI logs are not supported by Cloudera
              Manager
Cloudera Manager does not support the log type used by SMM
              UI.
View the SMM UI logs on the host.


Limitations


CDPD-36422: 1MB flow.snapshot freezes safari
Importing large connector configurations/ flow.snapshots reduces
            the usability of the Streams Messaging Manager's Connector page when using Safari
            browser.
Use a different browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge).

Known Issues

CDPD-22089: SRM does not sync re-created source topics until
              the offsets have caught up with target topic
Messages written to topics that were deleted and re-created
              are not replicated until the source topic reaches the same offset as the target topic.
              For example, if at the time of deletion and re-creation there are a 100 messages on
              the source and target clusters, new messages will only get replicated once the
              re-created source topic has 100 messages. This leads to messages being lost.
None


CDPD-30275: SRM may automatically re-create deleted topics on
              target clusters
If auto.create.topics.enable is enabled,
              deleted topics might get automatically re-created on target clusters. This is a timing
              issue. It only occurs if remote topics are deleted while the replication of the topic
              is still ongoing.


Remove the topic from the topic allowlist with srm-control. For
                  example:srm-control topics --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --target [TARGET_CLUSTER] --remove [TOPIC1]
Wait until SRM is no longer replicating the topic.
Delete the remote topic in the target cluster.




CDPD-60426: Configuration changes are lost following a rolling
              restart of the service
In certain cases, SRM might fail to apply configuration
              updates if the service is restarted with a rolling restart. In a case like this,
              configuration changes are ignored without any warning or indication. This issue also
              affects rolling upgrades.
When restarting the service, use Actions >  > Restart instead of Actions >  > Rolling Restart after making configuration changes. When upgrading a cluster, ensure
              that SRM is not restarted with a rolling restart. 


Limitations

SRM cannot replicate Ranger authorization policies to or from
              Kafka clusters
Due to a limitation in the Kafka-Ranger plugin, SRM cannot
              replicate Ranger policies to or from clusters that are configured to use Ranger for
              authorization. If you are using SRM to replicate data to or from a cluster that uses
              Ranger, disable authorization policy synchronization in SRM. This can be achieved by
              clearing the Sync Topic Acls Enabled
                (sync.topic.acls.enabled) checkbox.



Cruise Control
Learn about the known issues and limitations in Cruise Control in this release:


Rebalancing with Cruise Control does not work due to the metric
            reporter failing to report the CPU usage metric
On the Kafka broker, the Cruise control metric reporter plugin
            may fail to report the CPU usage metric.If the CPU usage metric is not reported, the
              numValidWindows in Cruise Control will be 0 and proposal generation as well as
              partition rebalancing will not work. If this issue is present, the following message
              will be included in the Kafka
              logs:WARN com.linkedin.kafka.cruisecontrol.metricsreporter.CruiseControlMetricsReporter:
          [CruiseControlMetricsReporterRunner]: Failed reporting CPU util.java.io.IOException: Java Virtual Machine recent CPU usage is not
        available.This
              issue is only known to affect Kafka broker hosts that have the following
                specifications:
CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2699 v4 @ 2.20GHz
OS: Linux 4.18.5-1.el7.elrepo.x86_64 #1 SMP Fri Aug 24 11:35:05 EDT 2018
                  x86_64
Java version: 8-18

Move the broker to a different machine where the CPU is
            different. This can be done by performing a manual repair on the affected nodes. For
            more information, see the Data Hub documentation. noteCluster nodes
              affected by this issue are not displayed as unhealthy.


CDPD-47616: Unable to initiate rebalance, number of valid
            windows (NumValidWindows) is zero
If a Cruise Control rebalance is initiated with the
              rebalance_disk parameter and Cruise Control is configured to fetch
            metrics from Cloudera Manager (Metric Reporter is set to
              CM metrics reporter), Cruise Control stops collecting metrics
            from the partitions that are moved. This is because Cloudera Manager does not collect
            metrics from moved partitions due to an issue in Kafka (KAFKA-10320).If the metrics
              are not available, the partition is considered invalid by Cruise Control. This results
              in Cruise Control blocking rebalance operations and proposal generation.
Configure Cruise Control to use to use the Cruise Control
            metrics reporter (default). This issue is not present if this metric reporter is used.
In Cloudera Manager, select the Cruise Control service.
Go to Configuration.
Find the Metric Reporter property.
Select the Cruise Control metrics reporter option.
Restart the Cruise Control service.



OPSAPS-68148: Cruise Control rack aware goal upgrade
            handler
The goal sets in Cruise Control, which include the default,
            supported, hard, self-healing and anomaly detection goals, might be overridden to their
            default value after a cluster upgrade if the goals have been customized.
Create a copy from the values of the goal lists before
            upgrading your cluster, and add the copied values to the goal lists after upgrading the
            cluster. Furthermore, you must rename any mentioning of
              com.linkedin.kafka.cruisecontrol.analyzer.goals.RackAwareGoal to
              com.linkedin.kafka.cruisecontrol.analyzer.goals.RackAwareDistributionGoal
            as Cruise Control will not be able to start otherwise.
