As the CDF for Data Hub cluster templates are running in the CDP Public Cloud environment
      powered by Runtime, Cloudera encourages users to upgrade their CDP services running Runtime
      versions from 7.2.7 so that they include the latest hotfixes. You can update your existing
      Data Lake and Data Hubs by doing a maintenance upgrade. For more information, see the Data Lake upgrade and Data Hub upgrade documentation.
noteMaintenance upgrades are not supported for RAZ-enabled
      environments.
If you are running a version of Runtime lower than 7.2.7, contact Cloudera Support
      for details on how to upgrade Runtime.
