Supported NiFi reporting tasks
This release ships with Apache NiFi 1.21.0 and includes a set of reporting tasks, most
  of which are supported by Cloudera. You should be familiar with the available supported reporting
  tasks, and avoid using any unsupported reporting tasks in production environments.
Additional reporting tasks are developed and tested by the Cloudera community but are not
   officially supported by Cloudera. Reporting tasks are excluded for a variety of reasons,
   including insufficient reliability or incomplete test case coverage, declaration of
   non-production readiness by the community at large, and feature deviation from Cloudera best
   practices. Do not use these features in your production environments.
