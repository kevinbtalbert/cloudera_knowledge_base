Unsupported Streams Messaging features
Some Streams Messaging features exist in Cloudera DataFlow for Data Hub 7.2.17, but are not supported by Cloudera. 
Kafka


The following Kafka features are not ready for production deployment. Cloudera
    encourages you to explore these features in non-production environments and provide feedback on
    your experiences through the Cloudera Community Forums.

Only Java and .Net based clients are supported. Clients developed with C, C++, Python,
          and other languages are currently not supported.
The Kafka default authorizer is not supported. This includes setting ACLs and all
          related APIs, broker functionality, and command-line tools.
Kafka KRaft in this release of Cloudera Runtime is in technical preview and does not
          support the following:
Deployments with multiple log directories. This includes deployments that use JBOD
              for storage.
Delegation token based authentication.
Migrating an already running Kafka service from ZooKeeper to KRaft.
