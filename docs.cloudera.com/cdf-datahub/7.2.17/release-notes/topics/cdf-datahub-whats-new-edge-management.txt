                definitions introduced in CDP Public Cloud 7.2.17.
The new templates include Edge Flow Manager (EFM) and they work out of
                        the box in a secure environment on CDP Public Cloud. Light Duty clusters
                        provide management, control, and monitoring functionalities for existing
                        agents to collect data from the edge devices and push intelligence back to
                        the edge.
For more information about this edge management solution, see the Cloudera Edge Management
                                documentation.
