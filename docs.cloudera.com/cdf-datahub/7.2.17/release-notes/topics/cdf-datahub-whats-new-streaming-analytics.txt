Iceberg V2 Support

                        documentation.
Built-in Data Visualization tool
The built-in data visualization tool in SQL Stream Builder (SSB) enables you
                        to present the sampling data and the results of the Materialized View query
                        using widgets on Streaming SQL Console. As the widgets are integrated into
                        SSB, the visualization tool works out of the box without any dependencies,
                        which offers easy access to the underlying, running jobs as data
                        sources.
For more information, see the Using widgets for data
                            visualization documentation.
Schema Handling
Cloudera Schema Registry catalog can now handle key schemas as well based on
                        the provided key (and value) schema name suffix for custom naming
                        convention.
For more information, see the Adding Catalogs
                        documentation.
