Defining your CDP Public Cloud data flow
To move data between cloud environments using NiFi site-to-site communication, you
        require a data flow in CDP Public Cloud that can receive data from the CDP Private Cloud Base data flow. To create this data flow, configure
        a process group, and both an input and output
        port.

You have prepared you clusters, set up your network configurations, and configured
                your truststores.


From your CDP Public Cloud NiFi cluster, create a Process Group to perform the
                    operations you want to complete on the data received from and returned to the
                        CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.

Drag an Input Port onto the NiFi canvas.
You must use this port for receiving data from NiFi's CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.

Drag an Output Port onto the NiFi canvas.
You must use this port to make data available for download to the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.

Connect your CDP Public Cloud data flow components.

Ensure that you have specified the public endpoints of your NiFi nodes in the
                        CDP Public Cloud cluster. 


Start your data flow and ensure that both the input and output ports are
                    running.







When you have completed your CDP Public Cloud data flow, proceed by configuring
                Apache Ranger to allow NiFi's site-to-site transmission.
