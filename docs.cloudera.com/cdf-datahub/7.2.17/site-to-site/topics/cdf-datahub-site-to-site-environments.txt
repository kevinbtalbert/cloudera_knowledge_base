Preparing your clusters
The first step in preparing to move data from a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster to a CDP Public Cloud cluster is to ensure that
  you have each cluster set up correctly. 
Requirements for your CDP Private Cloud Base cluster:



CFM running on CDP Private Cloud Base


Three-node NiFi compute cluster, secured with AutoTLS and configured with Apache
            Ranger



For details on deploying your CFM cluster on CDP Private Cloud Base, see
    CFM Deployment to CDP Private Cloud Base.

Requirements for your CDP Public Cloud Flow Management cluster:



Flow Management clusters running on CDP Public Cloud


Three-node NiFi compute cluster, secured with AutoTLS and configured with Apache
            Ranger



For details on deploying your CFM cluster on CDP Public Cloud, see Setting up your Flow
    Management cluster.
