Setting up your network configuration
You can use NiFi's site-to-site capabilities over a RAW TCP or over an HTTP network
    configuration. For
    this use case, you must configure site-to-site using HTTP over TLS.
    This
    has the advantage of using the NiFi port, which is also used to access the NiFi UI and
    APIs.
For the purpose of this use case, set up your site-to-site network configurations
   with the following assumptions:

You are not using site-to-site through any proxy configuration
You have a direct connection on port 8443 between NiFi nodes on your CDP Private Cloud Base and CDP Private Cloud clusters

Set up your network configuration according to your architecture and requirements.
      For more information, see your Cloud provider documentation. 
In this use case, NiFi on CDP Private Cloud Base is responsible
      for initiating the site-to-site connection between the two environments to push and pull data
      to and from the NiFi cluster in Public Cloud. The NiFi nodes in CDP Public Cloud must be
      reachable on port 8443 from the NiFi nodes in CDP Private Cloud Base,
      but not necessarily the other way around. 
tip
The site-to-site connection is bi-directional and depending on the cluster
        initiating the site-to-site connection, you will be in a push or pull model.
