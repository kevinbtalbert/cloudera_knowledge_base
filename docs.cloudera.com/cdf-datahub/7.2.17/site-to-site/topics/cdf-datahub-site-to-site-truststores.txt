Configuring your truststores
You must configure your truststores so that each cluster is aware of and trusts the
        other cluster, to support the two-way TLS that is used to initiate the site-to-site
        communication between clusters. To do this, you need to download and merge the truststores
        for NiFi in CDP Private Cloud Base and CDP Public Cloud.


You have set up a CDP Private Cloud Base and CDP Public
                    Cloud cluster, and have the necessary network configurations established.

You have the necessary administrative permissions to manipulate the
                        truststore files. You require root access, and this is typically done by an
                        Environment Administrator.


You have the passwords for the Java Keystore (JKS) files available. 




Download the truststore from the clusters.


Create a temporary directory in which you can edit the truststore
                            files.


$ mkdir s2s-temp && cd s2s-temp




Download the JKS truststore file for CA used by NiFi in your CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.

$ scp -i <key>  
root@<nifi_node>:/var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks 
privatecloud_cm-auto-global_truststore.jks




Download the JKS truststore file for CA used by NiFi in your CDP Public
                            Cloud cluster. 


$ scp -i <key>  
cloudbreak@<nifi_node_public_cloud>:/var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks 
publiccloud_cm-auto-global_truststore.jks





Merge the truststores. 


Make a copy of the CDP Private Cloud Base
                            JKS:
$ cp privatecloud_cm-auto-global_truststore.jks 
privatecloud_cm-auto-global_truststore.jks.bak

Merge the CDP Public Cloud JKS into the CDP Private Cloud Base JKS and rename the entries
                            alias to prevent conflict:
$ keytool 
-importkeystore 
-srckeystore publiccloud_cm-auto-global_truststore.jks 
-destkeystore privatecloud_cm-auto-global_truststore.jks 
The result will be similar to:
Importing keystore publiccloud_cm-auto-global_truststore.jks to privatecloud_cm-auto-global_truststore.jks...
Enter destination keystore password:  
Enter source keystore password:  
Entry for alias imported-ca-b379e6601f5ecfbbee2fefc4eb2efd4a successfully imported.
[...]
Entry for alias imported-ca-5945bad341623ae14991e09ffe851725 successfully imported.
Entry for alias cmrootca-1 successfully imported.
Existing entry alias cmrootca-0 exists, overwrite? [no]:  no
Enter new alias name	(RETURN to cancel import for this entry):  cmrootca-1-bis
Entry for alias cmrootca-0 successfully imported.
Entry for alias imported-ca-10c56ecc972802e53d1b7287ac2d1c6c successfully imported.
[...]
Entry for alias imported-ca-840644351dd523125493ff4c28e694f7 successfully imported.
Import command completed:  140 entries successfully imported, 0 entries failed or cancelled

Use the copy you made to merge the CDP Private Cloud Base JKS into the CDP Public
                            Cloud JKS and rename the entries alias to prevent
                                conflict:
$ keytool 
-importkeystore 
-srckeystore privatecloud_cm-auto-global_truststore.jks.bak 
-destkeystore publiccloud_cm-auto-global_truststore.jks 
The result will be similar to: 
Importing keystore privatecloud_cm-auto-global_truststore.jks.bak to publiccloud_cm-auto-global_truststore.jks...
Enter destination keystore password:  
Enter source keystore password:  
Existing entry alias cmrootca-0 exists, overwrite? [no]:  no
Enter new alias name	(RETURN to cancel import for this entry):  cmrootca-0-bis
Entry for alias cmrootca-0 successfully imported.
Import command completed:  1 entries successfully imported, 0 entries failed or cancelled




Deploy the truststores.

Deploy the modified CDP Private Cloud Base and CDP
                        Public Cloud JKS files on each NiFi node of the respective clusters. 
note
Do not change the permissions and owners of the file
                                (chmod/chown).



Restart your CDP Private Cloud Base and CDP Public Cloud
                    clusters. 


After you have configured your truststores, proceed by defining your data flow in
                your CDP Public Cloud cluster.
