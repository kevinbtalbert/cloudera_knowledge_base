Understanding the use case
You can use the Apache NiFi site-to-site functionality to move data  between a Public
  Cloud and a CDP Private Cloud Base environment. To do this, set up a cluster
  in each environment, prepare your network and truststore configurations, and then define your CDP Private Cloud Base and CDP Public Cloud data flows and Apache Ranger
  configuration for site-to-site functionality.
  
Moving data between CDP Public Cloud and CDP Private Cloud Base
   clusters is a common use case when there is a need for a lot of temporary compute resources that
   can be quickly provisioned in the cloud. 
Imagine you have a large dataset on-premises and you wish to perform heavy
   computations on the dataset. You can use the following workflow to design a data flow that:


Moves the dataset from your CDP Private Cloud Base environment to your
     CDP Public Cloud environment
Pushes the data to the appropriate destination
Triggers the workload that processes the data while leveraging the auto-scaling capabilities
     that CDP Public Cloud provides
Returns the results in your CDP Private Cloud Base environment 


All of this is powered by CDP Private Cloud Base and CDP Public
   Cloud distributions, while ensuring consistent security policies at a fine-grained level with
   Apache Ranger, and data management and data lineage with Apache Atlas across the
   environments.
