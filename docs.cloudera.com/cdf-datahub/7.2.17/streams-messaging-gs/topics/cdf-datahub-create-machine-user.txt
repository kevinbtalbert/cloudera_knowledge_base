Creating Machine User
You must create a dedicated service account called Machine User to use in the
        production environment. You create a Machine User in the Management Console with a unique
        name.
You must have created a Kafka cluster on CDP Public
            Cloud.

You can use your personal user account to connect to CDP for all the examples in this
                tutorial. However, in a production environment, you must create a dedicated service
                account to use ingestion processes or pipelines. So, instead of using your own
                account, this tutorial takes you through creating a service account.
Machine User is the CDP nomenclature for a service account. For more information on
                Machine User, see CDP machine user.


Navigate to Management Console > User Management.

Click Actions > Create Machine user.

Enter a unique name for the user and click Create.
After you create a machine user, you see a page like the following one
                    with the user details. 
noteThe Workload User Name (srv_kafka-client, in the example below) is
                            different from the actual user name (kafka-client). The Workload User
                            Name is the identifier you use to configure the access for your workload
                            or application later.





Click Set Workload Password and
            follow the prompts to set a password for the Machine User. You can leave the
                Environment field empty.
