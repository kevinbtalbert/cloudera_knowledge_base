Defining Schema Registry access policies
You must grant your application certain privileges to use the Schema Registry by
        creating the appropriate policies in Ranger. Learn how to define access policies and
        permissions for using Schema Registry.
In this example, you want to allow the application to
            create and manage schemas in Schema Registry. You can adjust the permissions granted to
            the applications in your environment to avoid granting privileges that are not necessary
            for each use case.
You must have gathered configuration information for using
            Schema Registry.

Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where your Kafka cluster is
                    running.

Click the Ranger icon () on the top pane, to open the Ranger web UI.

On the Ranger UI, click Access Manager > Resource Based Policies.

Under the SCHEMA REGISTRY group, select the policy
                    associated to your Schema Registry service.
To select it, click on the policy name, not on the icons. You should see the
                    list of predefined policies for your Schema Registry.

Create a policy to allow access to the schema metadata.


Click Add New Policy, to create a new one, and
                            enter the following details:
