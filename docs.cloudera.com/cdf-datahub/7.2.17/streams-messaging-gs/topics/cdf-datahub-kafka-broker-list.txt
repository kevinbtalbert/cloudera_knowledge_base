Finding list of brokers
Learn how to find the list of brokers in your Kafka cluster from the Brokers page in
        the Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) UI.

Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where your Kafka cluster is
                    running.

On the Data Hubs tab of your environment, select the
                    Kafka cluster you created.

Click Streams Messaging Manager on the services pane to open the SMM web
                    UI.

Click the Brokers tab ().

Take note of the broker endpoints (host and port) listed in the Brokers
                    page.






noteIf your cluster contains more than three brokers, you need to select a few
                        to provide to the client. Pick only three of them.
