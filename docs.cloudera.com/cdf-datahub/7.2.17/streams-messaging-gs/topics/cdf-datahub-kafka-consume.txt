Consuming data from Kafka topic
After you produce data to a Kafka topic, you can consume data from the Kafka
        topic.
The configuration that you used previously to produce data
            to Kafka topics is the same that you use to consume data from Kafka topics. You need to
            verify that the data was written correctly to the Kafka topic and can also be read by
            the client.
You must have produced data to your Kafka topic.

Run the following command to consume the data produced previously:

kafka-console-consumer \
  --bootstrap-server $BROKER_HOST:9093 \
  --consumer.config client-ldap.properties \
  --topic machine-data \
  --group machine-data-1 \
  --from-beginning



You see the following output, which tells you that the client successfully read it
                from the topic:
Hello, Kafka!
note
If you rerun the same command, reusing the consumer group name
                        (machine-data-1 in the previous example), the data is not
                    shown because the client continues from where it left off in the previous
                    execution. To read the data again, change the group name to something else (for
                    example, machine-data-2).
