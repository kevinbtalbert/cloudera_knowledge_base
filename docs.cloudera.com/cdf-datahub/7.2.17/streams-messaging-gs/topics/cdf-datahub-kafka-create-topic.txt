Creating Kafka topic
After you create a Kafka cluster, you can create Kafka topics. You create Kafka
        topics in the environment where your Kafka cluster is running by using the Streams Messaging
        Manager (SMM) web UI.
You must have created a Kafka cluster and a Machine User
            account, and granted environment access to the Machine User.

You create two Kafka topics in the tutorial:


machine-data
Topic containing machine usage data in plain text format.


machine-data-avro
Topic containing machine usage data in Avro format.




Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where your Kafka cluster is
                    running.

On the Data Hubs tab of your environment, select the
                    Kafka cluster you created.

Click Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) on the
                        Services pane to open the SMM web UI.

SMM is CDPâ€™s tool to monitor and manage Kafka. You use it to create the
                        topics you need.


In the SMM web UI, click the topics icon () on the left-hand bar.

Click Add New.

Enter the following details and click Save:



Topic name: machine-data


Partitions: 10


Availability: Maximum


Cleanup Policy: delete




Click Add New to add a second topic.

Enter the following details for the new topic and click
                        Save:



Topic name: machine-data-avro


Partitions: 10


Availability: Maximum


Cleanup Policy: delete





In the SMM Topics page, type machine in the
                search field to filter the topics. You must see both topics you created.
