Connecting to Kafka host
Learn how to connect to a Kafka host from the Management Console. You need to select
        the Kafka cluster you created, select a Kafka broker, and then connect to the broker
        host.
You must have created a Machine User account, granted
            environment access to the Machine User, created Kafka topics, and created Ranger
            policies.

Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where your Kafka cluster is
                    running.

On the Data Hubs tab of your environment, select the
                    Kafka cluster you created.

On the Kafka cluster page, click Hardware and select one
                    of the Kafka brokers to run your producer test.
Select and copy the full hostname of the broker.






Using the SSH client of your preference, connect to the broker host using your
                    CDP user and your workload password for authentication.
For example, if connecting from a terminal, you can use:

ssh [***YOUR_USER_NAME***]@[***BROKER_HOST_NAME***]
