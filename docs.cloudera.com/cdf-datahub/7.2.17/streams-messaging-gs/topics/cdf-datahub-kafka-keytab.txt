Kerberos authentication using a keytab
You can configure Kerberos authentication using a keytab. To do so, you download the
        keytab from the environment where your Kafka cluster is running, copy the keytab to your
        broker host, create a configuration file with required properties, and connect to
        Kafka.
As mentioned previously, instead of using a ticket from
            the ticket cache you can also authenticate using a keytab.
You must have produced data to a Kafka topic and consumed
            data from the Kafka topic.

Navigate to Management Console > User Management.

Select the Machine User.

Click Actions > Get Keytab.

On the Get Keytab dialog box, select the environment
                    where the Kafka cluster is running and click
                    Download.

Copy the keytab that was downloaded on your computer to the broker host you were connected to.

The keytab file contains sensitive information. Ensure that its permissions are
                    set restrictively:

chmod 400 ./kafka-client.keytab


Create the jaas-keytab.conf file with the following
                    content:

KafkaClient {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  useKeyTab=true
  keyTab="./kafka-client.keytab"
  principal="srv_kafka-client@XYZ.SITE";
};
Where the value of the keyTab property is the path of the
                        keytab copied to the host and the value of the principal
                        property is the Kerberos principal name of the Machine User account. You can
                        find the principal name by listing the content of the keytab, as shown in
                        the following example:
$ klist -kt ./kafka-client.keytab
Keytab name: FILE:kafka-client.keytab
KVNO Timestamp           Principal
---- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
   0 05/07/2020 03:32:01 srv_kafka-client@XYZ.SITE
   0 05/07/2020 03:32:01 srv_kafka-client@XYZ.SITE


Run the following commands to connect to Kafka, authenticating with the
                    Kerberos keytab.

BROKER_HOST=$(hostname -f)

export KAFKA_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=./jaas-keytab.conf"

kafka-console-consumer \
  --bootstrap-server $BROKER_HOST:9093 \
  --consumer.config client-kerberos.properties \
  --topic machine-data \
  --group machine-data-$RANDOM \
  --from-beginning

The KAFKA_OPTS environment variable is used to communicate the location of the
                    the jaas-keytab.conf configuration file to
                        kafka-console-consumer command.


You see the content of the machine-data topic as follows:
Hello, Kafka!
