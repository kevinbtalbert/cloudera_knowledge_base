Producing data to Kafka topic
To produce data to Kafka topics, you create a property file, ensure that its
        permissions are set restrictively, list all the topics that the Machine User has access to,
        and produce a text message to the Kafka topic.
Here, you produce data to a Kafka topic on your SSH
            session.
You must have created a Kafka cluster, created a Machine
            User, granted environment access to the Machine User, created Kafka topics, and created
            Ranger policies.

Create a new client-ldap.properties file with the following
                    content:

security.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
ssl.truststore.location=/var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks
sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="srv_kafka-client" password="SuperSecretPassword";
noteReplace the values of the username and password to match with the machine
                        user credentials that you created.


The client-ldap.properties file contains sensitive
                    information. Ensure its permissions are set restrictively.

chmod 400 client-ldap.properties

With this configuration you can start running Kafka client applications.
                

Run the following command to list all the topics that the Machine User has
                    access to.

BROKER_HOST=$(hostname -f)

kafka-topics \
  --bootstrap-server $BROKER_HOST:9093 \
  --command-config client-ldap.properties \
  --list
The output include a number of INFO lines, with the two
                        topics you created at the end of the output:
machine-data
machine-data-avro
If you do not see them, go back and review the previous steps.


Run the following command to produce a simple text message to the Kafka topic
                    by using the kafka-console-producer command.

echo 'Hello, Kafka!' | kafka-console-producer \
  --broker-list $BROKER_HOST:9093 \
  --producer.config client-ldap.properties \
  --topic machine-data



If the output of the command above contains only INFO lines and no
                    ERROR lines, it indicates that data was produced correctly to
                the Kafka topic.


In the next section, you use the kafka-console-consumer command to
                verify the contents of the Kafka topic.
