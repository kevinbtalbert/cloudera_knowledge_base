Produce data to Kafka topic
Learn how to produce data to a Kafka topic. To do this, you need to set the workload
  password, connect to a Kafka host, provide LDAP authentication, and finally produce data to a
  Kafka topic.

The applications that produce data to or consume data from Kafka can run on any of the servers
    in your network, provided they have connectivity to the Kafka cluster in CDP. These applications
    should not be executed on the hosts of the Kafka cluster, because this could affect the Kafka
    operation.
To produce data to a Kafka topic, you use the kafka-console-producer command
    line application because the command line application is already installed on the Kafka hosts
    and helps you to understand the application configuration without having to build an
    application. In a later step you configure and run an application on a separate host to connect
    to the cluster.


Setting workload passwordLearn how to set your personal workload password.Connecting to Kafka hostLearn how to connect to a Kafka host from the Management Console. You need to select         the Kafka cluster you created, select a Kafka broker, and then connect to the broker         host.Configuring LDAP authenticationAll the Kafka clusters created in CDP are secure because TLS is enabled to encrypt         communications between clients and the cluster, and strong authentication is enforced,         requiring clients to authenticate either through Kerberos or LDAP.Producing data to Kafka topicTo produce data to Kafka topics, you create a property file, ensure that its         permissions are set restrictively, list all the topics that the Machine User has access to,         and produce a text message to the Kafka topic.
