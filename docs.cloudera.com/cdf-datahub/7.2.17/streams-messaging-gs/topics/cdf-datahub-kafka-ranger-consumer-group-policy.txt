Create consumer group policy
Learn how to grant privileges to a Machine User for using consumer groups to consume
        data from the Kafka topics by using the Ranger UI. You create a new policy, select the
        Machine User, and add permissions for the Machine User.
You must have created a Machine User, granted environment
            access to the Machine User, and created two Kafka topics.

Click Add New Policy, to create a new one, and enter the
                    following details:


Policy Name: Machine Data consumer groups
Consumer group: machine-data*
Description: All consumer groups prefixed with
                                machine-data



Below the Allow Conditions section, click on the empty
                        Select User box and select the Machine User you had
                    created.
You can type the name of the user to filter the list of users. Also note that
                    the user name appears with the srv_ prefix, indicating that it
                    is a Machine User.

Click Add Permissions, select the
                        Consume and Describe
                    permissions and then click the tick mark.






Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Add to save
                    the policy.

Now you should see your new policies listed in Ranger. Your
            Machine User is ready for use.
You can start producing data to the Kafka topic.
