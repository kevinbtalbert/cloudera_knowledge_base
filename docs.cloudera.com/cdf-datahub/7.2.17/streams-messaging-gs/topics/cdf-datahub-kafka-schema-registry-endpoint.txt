Finding Schema Registry endpoint
You can find the Schema Registry endpoints by selecting the Kafka cluster, you
        created, from the Management Console.
You must have created a  list of brokers in your Kafka
            cluster.

Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where your Kafka cluster is
                    running.

On the Data Hubs tab of your environment, select the
                    Kafka cluster you created.

Click the Endpoints tab and make a note of the Schema
                    Registry endpoint.
