Creating TLS truststore
You can create a TLS truststore that the Kafka client needs to successfully connect
        to the secure Kafka cluster. You need to go to the environment where your Kafka cluster is
        running, download the FreeIPA certificate file, and create the TLS truststore by using the
        certificate file.

Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where your Kafka cluster is
                    running.

Click the Summary tab, scroll to the
                        FreeIPA section, and then click Actions >  Get FreeIPA Certificate.
This downloads the FreeIPA certificate file
                        (<environment_name>.crt) to your computer.

Run the following command to create the truststore:

keytool \
    -importcert \
    -noprompt \
    -storetype JKS \
    -keystore truststore.jks \
    -storepass changeit \
    -alias freeipa-ca \
    -file /path/to/ca.crt
