Enabling end-to-end latency monitoring
Learn how to enable end-to-end latency monitoring of Kafka topics using Streams
        Messaging Manager (SMM). You need to edit the consumer.property and
            producer.property files, start the producer in one terminal and the
        consumer on another, and then open the SMM web UI for monitoring end-to-end
        latency.

To enable the application  start logging end-to-end latency metrics you use an
                interceptor for the Kafka client, which can be set through the configuration
                file.
Perform the following steps to enable the monitoring for the sample Java application
                and verify the latency in SMM.

You must have set Ranger authorization policies.

Edit the consumer.properties file and uncomment the following
                    line:

interceptor.classes=com.hortonworks.smm.kafka.monitoring.interceptors
.MonitoringConsumerInterceptor


Edit the producer.properties file and uncomment the following
                    line:

interceptor.classes=com.hortonworks.smm.kafka.monitoring.interceptors
.MonitoringProducerInterceptor


Start the producer on one terminal window with the following command:

java \
  -cp ./target/kafka-client-avro-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  com.cloudera.examples.MachineDataProducer \
  ./producer.properties \
  ./src/main/avro/MachineData.v1.avsc


Start the consumer on another terminal window with the following command:

java \
  -cp ./target/kafka-client-avro-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  com.cloudera.examples.MachineDataConsumer \
  ./consumer.properties


Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where your Kafka cluster is
                    running.

On the Data Hubs tab of your environment, select the
                    Kafka cluster you created.

Click Streams Messaging Manager on the Services pane to
                    open the SMM web UI.

On the SMM UI, click Overview ().

Click on the profile icon () for the machine-data-avro topic
                    to open the topic page.
You see data in the charts Messages Consumed and
                        End-to-end latency. You may have to wait a few seconds
                    until the charts appear. 






Refresh the page after some time to view the updated
            data.
