Configuring LDAP authentication
All the Kafka clusters created in CDP are secure because TLS is enabled to encrypt
        communications between clients and the cluster, and strong authentication is enforced,
        requiring clients to authenticate either through Kerberos or LDAP.

In this example, you use LDAP authentication. LDAP authentication is not enabled by
                default. 


You must have connected to the Kafka host.


Provide the client with the security.protocol and
                        sasl.mechanism information to indicate the security
                    protocol and authentication mechanism to use.

Provide the client with the ssl.truststore.location
                    information which is required for the client to trust the brokers'
                    certificates.
All the Kafka hosts deployed by CDP have a valid truststore deployed at
                        /var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks.
                    You need to use this truststore. Later you look at how to create a truststore
                    from scratch.

Provide the client with the sasl.jaas.config information which
                    is the LDAP credentials to use for authentication.
