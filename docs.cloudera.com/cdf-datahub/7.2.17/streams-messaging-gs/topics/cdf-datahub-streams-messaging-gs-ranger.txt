Create Ranger policies for Machine User account
To read data from or write data to Kafka topics, you must grant certain privileges to
    your Machine User. To do this, you create new access policies for the Kafka topics in Ranger.
    You create one Topic policy and one Consumer Group policy.
Because your personal user is an environment administrator, you already have privileges to
      access and modify Kafka topics. This is not the case, though, with the Machine User account
      you created.
Authorization policies in CDP are maintained and enforced by Apache Ranger. To learn more about
   Apache Ranger authorization policies, see Using Ranger to Provide Authorization in
    CDP.
To allow the Machine User account to read from and write data to the Kafka topics you created,
   it is necessary that you define new access policies for those topics in Ranger. You need to
   create the following policies:
Topic policy to grant access to the two Kafka topics.
Consumer Group policy to define which consumer groups the Machine User can
          use to consumedata from the Kafka topics.
