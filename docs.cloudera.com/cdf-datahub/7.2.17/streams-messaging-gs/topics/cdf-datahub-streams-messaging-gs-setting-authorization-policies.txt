Setting up authorization policies
For Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) to show end-to-end latency data for an
        application, configure the application to generate additional metrics and enable monitoring.
        This includes sending metadata to internal SMM Kafka topics.

To do this in a secure Kafka cluster you must grant permissions on those topics
                through Ranger. Perform the following steps to grant the permissions to the Machine
                User account you are using:


Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where your Kafka cluster is
                    running.

Click the Ranger icon () on the top pane, to open the Ranger web UI.

On the Ranger UI, click Access Manager > Resource Based Policies.

Under the KAFKA group, select the policy of your Kafka
                    cluster.
To select it, click on the policy name, and not on the icons.

Click Add New Policy, to create a new one, and enter the
                    following details:


Policy Name: SMM Metrics topics
Topic: __smm_consumer_metrics and
                                __smm_producer_metrics
Description: SMM topics for end-to-end latency monitoring



Under the Allow Conditions section, click on the empty
                        Select Users box and select the Machine User you
                    created previously.

Click Add Permissions, select the
                        Publish and Describe permissions, and
                    click the tick mark.






Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Add to save
                    the policy.
