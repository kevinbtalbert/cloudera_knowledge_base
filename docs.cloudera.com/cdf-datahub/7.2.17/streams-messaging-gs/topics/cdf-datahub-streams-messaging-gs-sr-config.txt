Gather configuration information 
To produce data to and consume data from Kafka topics using schemas stored in the Schema
  Registry, you need to collect some configuration information such as the list of brokers and
  Schema Registry endpoint. You must also create TLS truststore.
Besides the Machine User name and password that you used in previous examples, you also need
   the following additional information to configure the client application:


Broker list
Because the Kafka client application is a remote application running on your computer, you
     need to configure it with a list of brokers to which the application can connect.


Schema Registry endpoint
You need to provide the application with the Schema Registry endpoint so that the application
     can store and retrieve schemas from it.


TLS truststore
Because this is a remote application connecting to a secure CDP cluster, for which TLS
     encryption is enabled, you need to provide the client with a truststore that can be used to
     validate the cluster certificates to establish secure communication channels.



Finding list of brokersLearn how to find the list of brokers in your Kafka cluster from the Brokers page in         the Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) UI.Finding Schema Registry endpointYou can find the Schema Registry endpoints by selecting the Kafka cluster, you         created, from the Management Console.Creating TLS truststoreYou can create a TLS truststore that the Kafka client needs to successfully connect         to the secure Kafka cluster. You need to go to the environment where your Kafka cluster is         running, download the FreeIPA certificate file, and create the TLS truststore by using the         certificate file.Parent topic: Use Schema Registry
