Introducing streams messaging cluster on CDP Public Cloud
You can create a streams messaging cluster in CDP Public Cloud and produce data to and
  consume data from an Apache Kafka topic by using that cluster. The concepts and usage of streams
  messaging cluster on CDP Public Cloud are explained using a simple workflow.
In this example you use a simple application (vmstat) to generate some raw
   text data and a kafka-console-producer command to send the data to a Kafka
   topic. You then use a kafka-console-consumer command to read data from that
   Kafka topic. After you have the producer and consumer running, you use Stream Messaging Manager
   (SMM), which is also available on CDP Public Cloud, to monitor the functionality of the workflow
   that you create.
Alternately, you can also structure the data in an object format and send it to Kafka in Avro
   format. To do this, you store a schema in CDPâ€™s Schema Registry and understand how to use a
   simple Java Kafka client to send and read data using that schema.
You can also update your schema to fit your requirements, and reconfigure the consumer and
   producer to use the latest schema.
The complete workflow consists of the following tasks:
Meeting the prerequisites
Creating a Machine User
Granting Machine User access to environment
Creating a Kafka topic
Creating Ranger policies
Producing data to Kafka topic
Consuming data from Kafka topic
Using Kerberos authentication
Monitoring Kafka activity in SMM
Using Schema Registry
Monitoring end-to-end latency in SMM
Evolving your schema
