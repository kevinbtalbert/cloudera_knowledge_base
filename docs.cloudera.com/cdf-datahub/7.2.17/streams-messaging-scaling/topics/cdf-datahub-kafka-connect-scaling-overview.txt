Scaling Kafka Connect
Kafka Connect provisioned with the Light and Heavy duty versions of the Streams
    Messaging cluster definitions can be scaled. However, there are differences between how scaling
    is performed in each of the templates. Cloudera recommends that you review the following notes
    and recommendations before you scale Kafka Connect.
Light Duty
In the Light duty cluster template, Kafka Connect roles are deployed in the
          Broker and Core_broker host groups. The
          Core_boker host group has a default instance count of 3, the
          Broker host group has a default instance count of 0. This means that
        by default all Light Duty clusters will a have a minimum of three Kafka Connect roles. To
        scale Kafka Connect in a Light Duty cluster, you resize the Broker host
        group. The Core_broker host group is not scalable. When scaling the
          Broker host group all other service roles are also scaled. Scaling
        Kafka Connect on its own in Light Duty clusters is not possible.

Heavy Duty
In the Heavy Duty cluster template, Kafka Connect roles are deployed in a dedicated host
        group named Connect. To scale Kafka Connect in a Heavy Duty cluster,
        you resize the Connect host group. The instance count of this host
        group is set to 0 by default. This means that unless specifically provisioned, no Kafka
        Connect roles are deployed in Heavy Duty clusters.

          Messaging cluster layout.
