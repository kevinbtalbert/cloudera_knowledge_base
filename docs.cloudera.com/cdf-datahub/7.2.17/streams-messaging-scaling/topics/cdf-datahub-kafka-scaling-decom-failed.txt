The downscale operation fails with decommission failed

Condition
The downscale operation fails with the Decommission failed error.


Cause
This issue can be caused by either of the following:

The broker is not available.
Cruise Control is reporting unhealthy partitions
A manually initiated rebalance is running.
An insufficient amount of brokers would remain after the downscale operation to host
            all replicas.This only affects deployments where there is a topic with at least
              four-way replication set up.


Solution
Optional: 
Back up the data disks of the failed node.This can be done by creating
              a backup of /hadoopfs/fs[***DATA VOL
                NUMBER***]/kafka.Access the Cloudera Manager instance managing the nodes that you want to
              decommission. Select the Kafka service and go to
            Instances.Select the Kafka broker you want to decommission. Click Actions for
                  Selected > Recommission and
              start.Wait until the process is finished and the cluster is in a healthy (green)
              state.In Management Console, navigate to the Data Hub cluster containing the node.
            Go to Hardware. Select the node and click the Repair (wrench) icon next
              to the host group. 
importantDo not select the Repair action from the
                upper right hand Actions dropdown. This action attempts to
                repair all unhealthy nodes in the selected host group. Under certain circumstances,
                the node that you want to repair might not be recognized as unhealthy. As a result,
                the repair operation might not be carried out on the affected node. Ensure that you
                initiate a repair on the affected nodes using the Repair
                (wrench) icon.
