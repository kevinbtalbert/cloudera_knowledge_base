Adding a new Registry Client
Learn how to add and configure the DF Catalog client as a new Registry
        Client.

Open the NiFi UI.

Click the Global menu and select Controller
                        Settings.






Switch to the Registry Clients tab.






Add a new client.


Select the type and give it a name.







Configure the client by providing the information related to your
                            Machine User.

noteYou will have to create a
                                StandardWebClientServiceProvider controller service and start it
                                with its default configuration.







When properly configured, you are ready to use the DataFlow Catalog to either
            version control your flows or check out flow definitions from the Catalog into
            NiFi.
You can now start using the new client to version or check out flows from the
            DataFlow Catalog.
