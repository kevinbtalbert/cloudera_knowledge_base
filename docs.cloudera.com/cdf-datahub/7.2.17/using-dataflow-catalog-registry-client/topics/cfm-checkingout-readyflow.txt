Checking out a ReadyFlow
Learn how to check out a ReadyFlow from the DataFlow Catalog.
ReadyFlows are predefined, out-of-the-box data flows,
            which can be deployed by providing a small set of required parameters. They are
            read-only by default so you would not be able to commit any change made to them. With
            the Registry Client in NiFi connecting to Cloudera DataFlow Catalog, you can check out a
            ReadyFlow from the Catalog and edit it as a custom flow.

Drag and drop a process group onto the canvas and click Import from
                        Registry.






In the drop-down list, select the Registry Client configured to access your
                    DataFlow Catalog.






Select the ReadyFlows bucket.
You have two buckets - one for the ReadyFlows (which is read-only) and one for
                    your own flows that are stored in the Catalog.



Select the ReadyFlow that you want to check out in NiFi by clicking the
                    selected version and then clicking Import.





Optional: 
ReadyFlows are read-only so you would not be able to change flow. If you want
                    to edit the flow: 


Right-click the process group, select Version
                            and click Stop version control.


 Make the changes you want. 


Version the flow as a custom flow in your Catalog: right-click the
                            process group, select Version and click
                                Start version control.
