You are a Cloudera customer for CDP Public Cloud.

Log in to the CDP Public Cloud web interface.

Navigate to Management Console > User Management to create a Machine User that will be used by NiFi to interact
                    with the DataFlow Catalog.

Select Create Machine User from the
                        Actions menu on the Users
                    tab.






Give the user a meaningful name and give it the proper roles:


DFCatalogViewer
It gives read-only access to the DataFlow Catalog. This is enough if
                                you just want to check out existing flows from the Catalog.
DFCatalogAdmin
It gives read-write access to the DataFlow Catalog. This would allow
                                you to version and control flows from NiFi into the Catalog, and to
                                check out existing flows from the Catalog.






Go to the Access Keys tab and generate credentials for
                    your user.




noteMake sure to keep track of the Access Key ID and the
                        Private Key as you will need these credentials to configure the Registry
                        Client in NiFi.


You can now create and configure the DF Catalog client with the available
            credentials.
