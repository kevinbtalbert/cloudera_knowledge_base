Versioning a flow in the Catalog
Learn how to use the DataFlow Catalog to version your flows.
Follow the below steps if you have a process group that you want to version as a
            completely new flow in the Catalog.

Right-click the process group and select Version > Start version control.






Select the Registry that you want to use.

Select Custom flows for the bucket and give your flow a name, a description,
                    and a comment for the first version.






Click Save.

The flow is now available in the DataFlow Catalog. noteAll
                commits will be associated with the Machine User you configured when creating the
                Registry client.
