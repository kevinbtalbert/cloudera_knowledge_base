Creating an SSH key pair
 

OpenSSH is installed on your machine. 
You checked for a pre-existing key pair as described in "Registering SSH keys" above, and found none.


Open a terminal window, and on the command line, type the key generation command: ssh-keygen
$ ssh-keygen

Accept the default location for the keys ~/.ssh (recommended) and file name id_rsa or specify another location and name.

At the passphrase prompt, create a password for the key pair.

Follow steps in "Registering SSH keys" above to register the keys in CDP.
