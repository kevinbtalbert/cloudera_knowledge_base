Registering SSH keys
You learn how to register an existing Secure Shell (SSH) key pair. Registering the key pair of a user allows the user to access the cluster from the command line.  RSA or ED25519 keys are supported.
    
 You must have one of the following roles to complete this task: 
EnvironmentAdmin
DataSteward
PowerUser


Go to the root directory on your computer. 
               
For example, on Linux enter the change directory command:
                    $ cd


List hidden directories and files and look for the .ssh directory.
For example, on Linux enter the following command:
                   
                   $ ls -ailg
                   

If you find an .ssh directory, list the files in it.
$ cd .ssh
$ ls
Output might include a private and public key pair, such as the following
                    pair: id_rsa
id_rsa.pub


If you do not find a .ssh directory, skip the next step, and perform steps in the next topic, “Creating a new key pair”.
               

Copy your SSH public key to the clipboard.
               
For example, on Linux, enter the following command:
                   pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

In CDP One, click Profile. 






In Users, on the SSH tab, click Add SSH key.




In Add SSH Public Key, click the SSH public key text box, and paste the contents of your clipboard.




Click Save.

Synchronize users to the environment.
