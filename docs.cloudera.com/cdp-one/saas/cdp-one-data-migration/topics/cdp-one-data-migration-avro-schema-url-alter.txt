Adjust AVRO table schema URLs
If any of your Hive tables are in AVRO format, before migration already created the
        AVRO schema on the CDP object store. After migration, you must change the URLs in table
        properties to point to the CDP location.

On the destination CDP cluster, correct the path of AVRO schema URL table
                    property.

ALTER TABLE my_table SET TBLPROPERTIES('avro.schema.url'='S3a:///mybucket/mypath/my_table.avsc');
