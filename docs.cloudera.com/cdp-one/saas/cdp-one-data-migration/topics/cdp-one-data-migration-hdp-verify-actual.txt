Verifying actual Hive data migration
After running the DistCp to migrate Hive data from HDP to CDP One, you take
        a look at the migrated data on the CDP One cluster. 

From a JDBC client, such as DBeaver, create a connection to the CDP cluster. 

Generate a passcode token to connect to the CDP cluster.

Run SQL SELECT queries and check the output to verify that the external table
                    data is migrated.
For
                    example:SELECT * FROM migrate_db.external_table_1;






Run SELECT queries and check the output to verify that managed data is
                    migrated.

SELECT * FROM migrate_db.managed_table_3;
