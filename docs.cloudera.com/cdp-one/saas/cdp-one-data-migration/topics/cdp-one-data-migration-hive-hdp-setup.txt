Migration prerequisites
Migrating Hive metadata to CDP One requires setup tasks, some of which are
    related to security.
In addition to the step-by-step set up tasks listed below, put the SSL certificate on the HDP
      cluster edge node.You need to migrate Ranger policies from HDP to CDP, set up AVRO table
      migration if you have Hive tables in AVRO format. You need to setup Hive JDBC standalone JARS
      for connecting the HDP and CDP clusters.
After performing the following setup tasks, you simply run the HMS Mirror command to migrate
   the data.

Setting up Hive JDBC standalone JARSYou must have the Hive JDBC standalone jar compatible with your HDP version  and the latest Hive JDBC standalone jar compatible with CDP One on the  edge node between the HDP and CDP One cluster.                  Saving Hive metastore on HDP by dumpingYou must dump the Hive metastore metadata immediately before upgrading or migrating.         Dumping the metastore data to a file is critical to prevent data loss. Taking a mandatory snapshot of HDP tablesTaking a snapshot of Hive tables is mandatory before upgrading or migrating. You also         need to keep track of how many tables you have before and after for comparison. Setting up security You need to turn off Kerberos and provide an authentication certificate on         respective clusters before running HMS Mirror.Installing and configuring HMS MirrorYou can perform the migration when HMS Mirror is installed on the HDP cluster. Sample YAML configuration fileYou customize a YAML file generated by the HMS Mirror dry run for your migration by     looking at an example YAML.Testing the YAML and the cluster connectionIt makes sense to test the YAML and cluster connection before starting the migration         using HMS Mirror.  Connection troubleshooting is easier before, rather than after, running         HMS Mirror.Parent topic: Migrating Hive data from HDP 2.x or HDP 3.x to CDP One
