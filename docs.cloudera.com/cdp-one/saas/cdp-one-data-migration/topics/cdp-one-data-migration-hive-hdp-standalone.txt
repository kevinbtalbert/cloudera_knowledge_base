Setting up Hive JDBC standalone JARS
You must have the Hive JDBC standalone jar compatible with your HDP version  and the latest Hive JDBC standalone jar compatible with CDP One on the  edge node between the HDP and CDP One cluster. 
        
       

On the HDP cluster, navigate to /usr/hdp/current/hive-client/lib check that the
                    Apache Hive standalone JAR was installed by HDP on your cluster.
For example, on HDP 2.6.5 you find a JAR having a name something like
                        hive-jdbc-1.2.1000.2.6.5.5000-33-standalone.jar.On HDP
                        3.1.5, you find a JAR having a name something like
                        hive-jdbc-3.1.0-315.133-2-standalone.jar. importantHive 3 jars do not work on an HDP
                        2.x cluster.

If the JAR is not on the cluster, using the version number of the JAR in
                    /usr/hdp/current/hive-client/lib, search for and download the Apache Hive JDBC
                    driver hive-jdbc from the driver archive.

On the CDP cluster, navigate to
                        /opt/cloudera/parcels/<version>/jars/hive-jdbc-3<version>,
                    and check that the Apache Hive standalone JAR is on the cluster. 

If the JAR is not on the cluster,  download the latest Hive JDBC driver from
                    the Cloudera Downloads page.

Make a note of the path to the JAR to connect the HDP and CDP clusters
                    later.
