HMS Mirror generated files
You use generated scripts, reports, and other files as you migrate the table metadata
    and data. Reports generated by HMS Mirror include information about HMS Mirror configurations. A
    list of tables on left HDP and translated tables on right CDP cluster are also
    generated.
The following files are generated by a dry run of HMS Mirror:

<dbname>_1_distcp_source.txt A list of source cluster table file locations.
<dbname>_LEFT_execute.sql A list of commands for creation of databases and tables
          under the database for the HDP cluster.
<dbname>_LEFT_action.sql Actions that may be required on the HDP cluster to achieve
          the optimum state for migration.
<dbname>_RIGHT_execute.sql A list of commands for creation of databases and tables
          under the database for the CDP SaaS cluster.
<dbname>_RIGHT_action.sql Actions that may be required on the CDP SaaS cluster to
          achieve the optimum state for migration.
<dbname>_hms-mirror.md Options you use for the hms-mirror command, config yaml,
        database and tables present on left cluster, translated tables on right cluster in an md
        file. You can use any markdown file viewer to view this file.
<dbname>_hms-mirror.html â€” This is the html version of the above md file.
distcp_script.sh The distcp commands needed to migrate actual table data from HDP to S3
          location. Moving HDFS data from the HDP to the S3 object store for the CDP cluster is
          fully documented in Migrating data from HDP to CDP One.
distcp_workbook.md Shows the HDP source and CDP One destination locations that
          we need to migrate to.

This information can help you build a transfer job to specify multiple sources
          using distcp -f.
