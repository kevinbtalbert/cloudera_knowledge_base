Testing the YAML and the cluster connection
It makes sense to test the YAML and cluster connection before starting the migration
        using HMS Mirror.  Connection troubleshooting is easier before, rather than after, running
        HMS Mirror.

Using a Hive client, such as DBeaver, beeline, or Tableau, connect the left
                    cluster to the right cluster, and then vice versa. 

If you use ZooKeeper Service Discovery on the HDP source cluster, use a plain
                    URL in your connection string.
For example:jdbc:hive2://<hive-server2-hostname>:10000/
