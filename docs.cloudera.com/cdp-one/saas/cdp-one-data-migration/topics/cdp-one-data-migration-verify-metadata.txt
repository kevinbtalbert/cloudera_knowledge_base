Verifying metadata migration
After running the HMS Mirror tool to migrate Hive metadata from HDP
        to CDP One, you take a look at the migrated metadata on the CDP One cluster.    



From a JDBC client, such as DBeaver, create a connection to the CDP cluster. 

Generate a passcode token to connect to the CDP cluster.

Run SQL queries and check the output to verify that the databases
               and tables are migrated.
For
                    example:SHOW DATABASES;
USE migrate_db;
SHOW TABLES;
