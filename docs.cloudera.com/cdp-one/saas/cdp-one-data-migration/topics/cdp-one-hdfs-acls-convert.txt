Converting HDFS native permissions into Ranger HDFS policies
Learn how to convert the extracted HDFS native permissions into Ranger HDFS service
        policies, which can then be transformed into Ranger S3 policies.


The source and target migration clusters must be running the following supported
                        versions:
Source cluster: HDP 2.6.5, HDP 3.1.5, CDH 5.16, CDH 6.3
Target cluster: CDP 7.2.15 or higher

You must have copied the extracted HDFS native permissions
                        (.csv file) into the migration cluster node.
You must have copied the Ranger policy migration utility,
                        ranger-<version>-policymigration.tar.gz file to the
                    migration cluster node.
Log in to the migration cluster's node (or a Data Lake node of a cloud
                            cluster) where the ranger-admin binaries are
                            available. For example,
                                /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/ranger-admin
Copy
                                /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/ranger-admin/policymigration/ranger-<version>-policymigration.tar.gz
                            to some location of the migration cluster machine from where you want to
                            run the Ranger policy migration utility.

You must have read, write, and execute permissions on the directory where the
                    Ranger policy migration utility is copied.
You must have SUDO or ROOT access to perform the migration process.



Log in to the migration cluster node where you have copied the
                        ranger-<version>-policymigration.tar.gz file. Untar
                    the file and navigate to the
                        ranger-<version>-policymigration directory.

Update the “Transform” part of the env.sh file with the
                    right set of values according to your environment.
For more information, see Supported Input parameters for Transform
                    operation.

Run the transform.sh script with the convert
                    command to convert the extracted HDFS native permissions to Ranger HDFS policy
                    format.

Syntax:
./transform.sh convert $native_hdfs_permissions_csv_file_path


Example:
./transform.sh convert /tmp/HDFS_Permissions_Export_<timestamp>.csv


The command generates a
                HDFS_Permissions_Export_<timestamp>_convert.json file, which
            is then transformed into the required Ranger S3 policies. If you encounter any errors,
            see the logs/ranger-policymigration.log file.
Transform the converted Ranger HDFS policies into Ranger
            S3 policies.
