Transforming Ranger HDFS policies into Ranger S3 policies
Learn how to transform Ranger HDFS service policies into Ranger AWS S3 policies,
        which can then be imported into the CDP cluster Ranger.


You must have converted the extracted Ranger HDFS native permissions
                        (.csv file) into Ranger HDFS policies
                        (.json file) using the transform.sh
                        convert command.
You must have copied the Ranger policy migration utility,
                        ranger-<version>-policymigration.tar.gz file to the
                    migration cluster node.
Log in to the migration cluster's node (or a Data Lake node of a cloud
                            cluster) where the ranger-admin binaries are
                            available. For example,
                                /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/ranger-admin
Copy
                                /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/ranger-admin/policymigration/ranger-<version>-policymigration.tar.gz
                            to some location of the migration cluster machine from where you want to
                            run the Ranger policy migration utility.

You must have read, write, and execute permissions on the directory where the
                    Ranger policy migration utility is copied.
You must have SUDO or ROOT access to perform the migration process.



Log in to the migration cluster node where you have copied the
                        ranger-<version>-policymigration.tar.gz file. Untar
                    the file and navigate to
                        ranger-<version>-policymigration directory.

Update the "Transform" part of the env.sh file by updating
                    the following parameters or as required for your environment.


S3_BUCKET_NAME
SERVICE_NAME_FOR_NATIVE_POLICIES

noteIf the usernames in the target cluster are different
                        from the usernames in the source cluster, provide a user mapping file as an
                        input by updating the
                            RANGER_POLICYMIGRATION_USERS_MAPPING_FILE parameter in
                        the env.sh file.

                        operation.


Run the transform.sh script with the
                        transform command to convert the Ranger HDFS policies to
                    Ranger AWS S3 policy format.

Syntax:
./transform.sh transform $converted_ranger_policies_file_path


Example:
./transform.sh transform /tmp/HDFS_Permissions_Export_<timestamp>_convert.json


The command generates a
                HDFS_Permissions_Export_<timestamp>_convert_transform.json
            file, which can then be imported using the Authzmigrator utility into the AWS S3 service
            of the target CDP cluster. If you encounter any errors, see the
                logs/ranger-policymigration.log file.
Import the transformed HDFS native permissions into the
            Ranger AWS S3 service of the target CDP cluster using the Authzmigrator tool.
