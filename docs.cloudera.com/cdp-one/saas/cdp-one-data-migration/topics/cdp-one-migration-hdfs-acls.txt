Migrating HDFS native permissions to CDP One
If you have HDFS native permissions in your CDH or HDP clusters, you learn how to
  convert the native permissions into Ranger policy format and import the policies to CDP One. You can choose to ignore this migration process if you do
  not have any HDFS native native permissions.
Migrating HDFS native permissions from CDH or HDP to CDP One
   involves a combination of Extract >  Convert >  Transform >  Import operations.
The HDFS native permissions are first extracted as a file in a specific format, which are then
   converted and transformed into Ranger AWS S3 policies using the Ranger policy migration utility.
   The transformed Ranger policies are finally imported into CDP One
   using the authzmigrator tool.

Extracting HDFS native permissionsLearn how to use the HDFS Permissions Export utility to extract HDFS native POSIX         permissions from a source cluster running CDH or HDP. The extracted HDFS permissions are         then used to create Ranger S3 policies that can be used in CDP One.Converting HDFS native permissions into Ranger HDFS policiesLearn how to convert the extracted HDFS native permissions into Ranger HDFS service         policies, which can then be transformed into Ranger S3 policies.Transforming Ranger HDFS policies into Ranger S3 policiesLearn how to transform Ranger HDFS service policies into Ranger AWS S3 policies,         which can then be imported into the CDP cluster Ranger.Importing Ranger AWS S3 policiesLearn how to import the transformed HDFS native permissions into the Ranger AWS S3         service of the target CDP cluster using the Authzmigrator tool.Parent topic: Migrating data from CDH to CDP OneParent topic: Migrating data from HDP to CDP One
