About DistCp tool
DistCp (distributed copy) is a tool used for large inter/intra-cluster
        copying.
DistCp uses MapReduce to enable its distribution, error handling and recovery,
            and reporting. It expands a list of files and directories into input to map tasks, each
            of which will copy a partition of the files specified in the source list.
