About Migrating Oozie workloads
The Oozie database on the source CDH cluster is automatically configured to purge
        data that is older than 30 days. If you need to retain this data, Cloudera recommends that
        you back up the data and make it available for running simple SQL queries. See Back Up the Databases.
Oozie workflows, query history, and saved query are some of the workloads that
            get migrated to CDP One.
Most Oozie workloads and configurations will need to be migrated manually to
            the destination cluster. Although you can copy the XML and property files from the
            source cluster, these files require extensive modifications before they can be used in
            the destination cluster. Cloudera Professional Services can assist you with these
            migrations.
