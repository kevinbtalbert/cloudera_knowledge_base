About Migrating Ranger policies
Migrating Ranger policies involves export and transform operations.
Firstly, the Ranger policies available in the source HDP clusters are exported
            and copied to the target cluster, followed by the transform and import operations. The
            export and transform operations are performed using the policy migration utility. 
The Ranger Policy Migration utility files in the directory 
ranger-<version>-policymigration consists of the following
            scripts:


env.sh


exportPolicy.sh


transform.sh


The contents of the policy migration utility would be copied to the source HDP
            cluster from which the Ranger policies are to be migrated. The output file from the
            transform process would be transitioned to the import operations. The import process
            consists of the import utility (Authzmigrator tool). 

noteCurrently, the migration process does not support migrating Group / Role name
                transformation.
