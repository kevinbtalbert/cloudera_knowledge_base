About Migrating Sentry policies
Migrating Sentry policies to CDP One is a two step
        process.
Export the Sentry policies from the CDH cluster and copy the generated output
            file(s) to the target environment. Later, the import utility (Authzmigrator tool)
            performs the Transform and Import operations to complete the Sentry migration process.
            Export operation is performed using the CDH cluster. 
The following policy migrations are included as part of the migration
            process:


Kafka and Hive Sentry permissions


URL transformation to the AWS S3 endpoint


Default AWS S3 policy creation for Hive Warehouse location
