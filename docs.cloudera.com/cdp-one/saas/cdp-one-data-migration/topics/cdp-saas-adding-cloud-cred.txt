Adding cloud credentials
You can perform the following tasks on the Cloud Credentials
        page to manage cloud credentials.
You can add cloud credentials to migrate data to the cloud.Unregistered credentials can impact the replication process. Credentials associated
                with a cluster node that do not have updated credentials are called unregistered
                credentials. For example, if a node is down when the credentials are changed on a
                bucket or when the node is brought up that has the old credentials.

Log into CDP public cloud Management Console >
                        Replication Manager.

                        Add.
