Before migrating
Before you commence to migrate HDFS data from HDP clusters, you must note about some
        of the underlying requirements.
To run the Hadoop DistCp tool to copy the HDFS data from the
            source HDP cluster to the CDP One S3 bucket, the
            following additional details must be met:

The access key, secret key pair of the specified S3 bucket must be
                available. 
Before you run the DistCp tool on your on-premises cluster, you
                        must have valid cloud credentials to access and use AWS. Create a Support
                        JIRA that states the time period for the migration.
The AWS access secret key will be disabled when the migration time
                        expires.


SSM-KMS is enabled on the S3 bucket, the KMS key is also required.


Perform the appropriate kinit to the Hadoop DistCp tool for
                    authentication by the Kerberos system.


For hdfs user, use the kinit command with hdfs userâ€™s
                            keytab file. (Look for keytab in
                            /etc/security/keytabs)
