Working with cloud credentials
The Cloud Credentials page shows the registered cloud credentials for Replication
        Manager. To replicate data to a storage cloud account, you must register the cloud
        credentials, so that the Replication Manager can access your cloud account. The supported
        cloud storage accounts are Amazon S3. 
On the Cloud Credentials page, you can add, update, or delete cloud credentials. Before
            you register an Amazon S3 cloud account, ensure the cloud bucket requirements are met.
