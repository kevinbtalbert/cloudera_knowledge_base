Copying Policy Migration utility to the source cluster
Policy migration utility must be available on the source cluster.
You must copy the contents of the policy migration tool to the source
            cluster.

Sign-in to the Migration clusterâ€™s node (or a Data Lake node of the cloud
                    cluster) where the ranger-admin binaries are available. 
For example:
                    /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/ranger-admin

Copy
                        /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/ranger-admin/policymigration/ranger-<version>-policymigration.tar.gz
                    to the source HDP cluster machine from where you want to export the HDP Ranger
                    policies. 
Additionally, copy the same file to some other location of the migration
                    cluster machine (or a Data Lake node of the cloud cluster) from where you want
                    to execute the Ranger policy migration utility to transform Ranger
                    policies.

Login to the HDP source cluster where you have copied the
                        ranger-<version>-policymigration.tar.gz file. Untar the
                    file and navigate to ranger-<version>-policymigration
                    directory.
