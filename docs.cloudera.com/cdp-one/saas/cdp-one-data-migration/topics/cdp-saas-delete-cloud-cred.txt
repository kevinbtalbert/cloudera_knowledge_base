Delete cloud credentials
You can delete unwanted credentials from the Replication Manager. 
When you delete cloud credentials, the replication policies that use the deleted cloud
            credentials might fail. To avoid failures, delete the Replication Manager cloud policies
            associated with the deleted credentials and recreate the policies with the new
            credentials. You can view a list of policies associated with specific credentials on the
            Cloud Credentials page.
To delete a cloud credential, click Actions >
                Delete option.
