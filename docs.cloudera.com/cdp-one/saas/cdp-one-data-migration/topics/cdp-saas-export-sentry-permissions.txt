Exporting Sentry permissions
You must export the Sentry policies from CDH cluster to CDP cluster
        Ranger.

SSH to the Sentry host of the source cluster.

Copy the file located here to the Sentry host and extract it to a suitable
                    location.
tar -xvf authz_export.tar.gz Later, a directory named
                            authzmigrator is created which contains the following
                            files:
Jars
Config
Authz_export.sh 




Verify the SENTRY_SERVER process path
ps -ef | grep SENTRY_SERVER

Replace sentry-site.xml and core-site.xml in the extracted file with config
                    files from Sentry-run directory.  For example, 

cp
                            /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/<process-id>-sentry-SENTRY_SERVER/sentry-site.xml
                            authzmigrator/config/
cp
                            /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/<process-id>-sentry-SENTRY_SERVER/core-site.xml
                            authzmigrator/config/



Update ‘Sentry.store.jdbc.user’ and sentry.store.jdbc.password in
                        sentry-site.xml.
The mandatory values are the Sentry "database user" and "database user
                    password" in clear text.

Remove the property hadoop.security.credential.provider.path in
                        sentry-site.xml.

Update the value for the property fs.defaultFS to file:/// in
                        core-site.xml.

Make sure that the following configurations are updated in 
authorization-migration-site.xml present in the
                        authzmigrator/config/



authorization.migration.export.target_services=
                                    HIVE,KAFKA should have a list of services for which
                                permissions are needed to export the Sentry permissions. Valid
                                values: HIVE, KAFKA
authorization.migration.export.output_file=<path>
                                should be updated to the absolute location of the file where
                                permissions should be exported




To set up role based permissions, you must add the following
                        properties:
<property>

                            <name>authorization.migration.role.permissions</name>
 <value>true</value>
</property>


An example property file:




Export  JAVA_HOME variable

Run the script:
cd authzmigrator/sh
                            authz_export.sh
Exporting the permissions is completed.

SCP the exported JSON to the target cluster. For more information about logging
                    into CDP One clusters, see Using SSH to access the cluster.
scp <exported json> root@<target_clustert>:/root
