HDFS data migration from CDH to CDP One
To create a HDFS replication policy from on-premises to the cloud account, you must
        register your cloud account credentials with Replication Manager service, so that
        Replication Manager can access your cloud storage.

Before performing HDFS replication using CDH clusters, see Working with cloud credentials.
Replication Manager supports replication of HDFS data from cluster to cloud storage. The
            replication policy runs on the cluster and pushes the data from cloud storage. The
            cluster can be an on-premises or IaaS cluster with data on local HDFS. The cluster
            requires HDFS, YARN, Ranger, and Knox services to perform replication.
You can schedule taking HDFS snapshots for replication in the Replication Manager. HDFS
            snapshots are read-only point-in-time copies of the filesystem. You can enable snapshots
            on the entire filesystem, or on a subtree of the filesystem. In Replication Manager, you
            take snapshots at a dataset level. Understanding how snapshots work and some of the
            benefits and costs involved can help you to decide whether or not to enable
            snapshots.
For more information, see HDFS snapshots.

Creating a HDFS replication policyYou can use a HDFS replication policy to replicate data from on-premises to cloud.     Before you create a new replication policy, you must register a cloud account with the     Replication Manager service. Verifying HDFS data migrationPost-migration process, you must check if the migration process is completed         successfully by verifying the data on the AWS S3 endpoint.Parent topic: Migrating HDFS and Hive data from CDH to CDP One
