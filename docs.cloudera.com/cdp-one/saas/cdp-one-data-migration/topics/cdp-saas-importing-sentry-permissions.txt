Importing Sentry permissions into RangerCloudera Docs
Importing Sentry permissions into Ranger
You must import the Sentry permissions to CDP cluster Ranger.

Login to the RANGER_ADMIN portal with administrator user
                    credentials or user privileges as ADMIN


Under Settings >
                                Users/Groups/Roles > Search for the
                                ranger user.
Click on the ranger user and change its role to Admin and
                            save the changes.



You must log into the CDP One environment. For more information about logging
                    into CDP One clusters, see Using SSH to access the
                        cluster.

Download and copy authz-ingest.zip to the
                        /opt directory of the migration node.
For example: CDP Data Lake or any relevant target cluster.

Unzip the authz-ingest.zip into the
                        /opt  directory, which contains the following files:

note/opt is referred to as an example directory.



config-files
scripts



The config-files contains the following:
authorization-migration-site.xml
ranger-hive-security.xml
ranger-kafka-security.xml
ranger-plugin-policymgr-ssl.xml
notecm-auto-global_truststore.jks is directly not available.
                        If you have an SSL/TLS enabled cluster, you must manually add
                            cm-auto-global_truststore.jks.


Ranger is TLS/SSL enabled using Cloudera Manager AUTO-TLS. From the Ranger
                    admin host, copy cm-auto-global_truststore.jks (from the
                    Ranger-admin process directory) to the following location: 
/opt/authz-ingest/config-files/ of the migration tool
                    host.
Steps to find the ranger admin process directory:



Execute the below command to get the RANGER_ADMIN
                                            process.ps -ef | grep
                                            proc_rangeradmin

Search for -cp option from the above command output and look
                                        for
                                        "/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/<ID>-ranger-RANGER_ADMIN"

If you have done SSL setup manually or in a different method,
                                copy the filename which you created for truststores.For example:
                                cp /path/to/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks
                                /opt/authz-ingest/config-files/



Export the following variables:


JAVA_HOME - Java home path used on the cluster
RANGER_ADMIN_URL - Ranger Admin portal url
RANGER_ADMIN_SSL_ENABLED - either true or false
RANGER_ADMIN_TRUSTORE_PASSWORD - If Ranger is TLS/SSL
                            enabled using Cloudera Manager AUTO-TLS, then the password can be found
                            on the Ranger host /etc/hadoop/conf/ssl-client.xml
                            property 'ssl.client.truststore.password'




EXAMPLE:
export
                        JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_232-cloudera/
export RANGER_ADMIN_URL=<ranger admin url with
                            port>
export RANGER_ADMIN_SSL_ENABLED=<true or
                        false>
export
                            RANGER_ADMIN_TRUSTORE_PASSWORD=<ssl.client.truststore.password>


For the Kerberos-based authentication, use the following process:


Find the Ranger admin keytab location and provide it in the following
                                command:export
                                    RANGER_ADMIN_KEYTAB_PATH=/path/to/rangeradmin.keytabIn the CDEP cluster ranger keytab shall be available in
                                the “/cdep/keytabs/rangeradmin.keytab” or under the
                                ranger admin process directory
                                    “/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/<ranger-process-number>-ranger-RANGER_ADMIN”
                                location.Steps to find the ranger admin process
                                directory:
Execute the below command to get the RANGER_ADMIN
                                    process.
ps -ef | grep proc_rangeradmin

Search for -cp option from the
                                        above command output and look for
                                            "/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/<ID>-ranger-RANGER_ADMIN"

If your ranger node and migration node are different, copy the
                                ranger keytab to the migration node.On the
                                migration node run the following klist command to
                                fetch a list of principals available in ${RANGER_ADMIN_KEYTAB_PATH}klist -kt
                                ${RANGER_ADMIN_KEYTAB_PATH}Run the following
                                    kinitcommand
                                    using${RANGER_ADMIN_KEYTAB_PATH} with
                                    rangeradmin/_HOST@REALM principle. Update _HOST and REALM using the following
                                    command:kinit -kt ${RANGER_ADMIN_KEYTAB_PATH}
                                    rangeradmin/_HOST@REALM



Go to location /opt/authz-ingest/config-files  and open the
                    file authorization-migration-site.xml 

Add below property and provide the path of the sentry
                        permissions.json file which needs to be imported.

<property>

                            <name>authorization.migration.export.output_file</name>

                            <value>file:///root/permissions.json</value>
</property>
noteIf you have permission which is role-based, you have to set this
                            property<property>
                                <name>authorization.migration.role.permissions</name> <value>true</value></property> 


Set the following properties to create AWS S3 policy for Hive Warehouse
                    location: 

<property>

                            <name>authorization.migration.create.s3.policy</name>
<value>true</value>
</property>
<property>

                            <name>authorization.migration.target.s3.bucket.name</name>
<value>bucket_name</value>
</property>


Set the following properties which ensures that URI/URL policies are
                    appropriately converted into AWS S3 URL Hive policy:
<property><name>authorization.migration.translate.url.privileges</name><value>true</value></property><property><name>authorization.migration.migrate.url.privileges</name><value>true</value></property><property><name>authorization.migration.destination.location.prefix</name><value>s3a://mybucket</value></property>

(Optional) Transforming old user name into new user name requires you to set
                    the following properties:

<property>
 <name>authorization.migration.translate.user</name>
<value>true</value>
 </property>
<property>
 <name>authorization.migration.usermap.file.path</name>
<value>file:///root/UserMapping.json</value>
</property>


Use the following information to provide the valid user mapping:
Format:
=> For the JSON file format we can have multiple users also in the
                        JSON object formatted like :
{“testuser1”:”testuser1@host.com”, “testuser2”:”testuser2@host.com”}
=> And with the CSV format, it's pipe-delimited with one entry per
                        line.
testuser1,testuser1@host.com
testuser2,testuser2@host.com
noteIf user mapping is provided in CSV format, set the following property<property>
                            <name>authorization.migration.usermap.separator</name><value>,</value></property>


A flag-based new functionality is added in Authzmigrator, which skips
                        {OWNER} policy while migrating from Sentry to Ranger. You must add
                    the below property in authorization-migration-site.xml to enable this
                    feature. 
By default, this feature is disabled by setting the below value to
                        false.<property>
    <name>authorization.migration.skip.owner.policy</name>
    <value>true</value>
 		 </property>


Save the file and exit

Run the script:

cd authz-ingest/scripts
sh authz-import.sh
A confirmation message appears.
"Ingesting Ranger policies finished successfully"
"Ingesting of permissions to Ranger service is complete"
