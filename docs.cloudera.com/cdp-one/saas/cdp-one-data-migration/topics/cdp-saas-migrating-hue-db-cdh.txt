Migrating Hue databases from CDH to CDP One
You must migrate Hue data from the CDH cluster to CDP One.

On your CDH environment enabled with Hue cluster migrate the
                Hue database:


In the Hue Web UI, click the home icon to view the
                    documents that you plan to migrate.

In Cloudera Manager, stop the Hue service. Go to Hue and
                    select Actions > Stop. 

noteRefresh the web page to confirm that the Hue service is stopped. 


From Cloudera Manager -> Hue
                        -> Select Actions > Dump
                        Database and click Dump Database.
This exports a JSON file that is database-agnostic. The file is written to
                        /tmp/hue_database_dump.json on the host running the
                        Hue service.

Log on to the host of the Hue server in a command-line terminal. You can
                    find the hostname on the Dump Database window and at
                        Hue > Hosts.

Remove the following lines from the hue_database_dump.json
                    file.
ALERT: This appears to be a CM Managed environmentALERT: HUE_CONF_DIR must be set when running hue commands in CM
                            Managed environmentALERT: Please run 'hue
                            <command> --cm-managed'
On your CDP environment:


In Cloudera Manager for the CDP environment that is, DataHub Cloudera
                            Manager (not Data Lake Cloudera Manager), set up the database for Hue. 
Synchronize: Select
                                Actions > Synchronize
                                Database and click Synchronize
                                Database.
Truncate all the records in the Hue tables available under the Hue
                            database. noteMust be performed directly on the Hue database; there
                                are no Hue commands or options in the UI to perform this
                                task.



Additionally, on the CDP environment: As no
                        information is stored in the Hue database yet:



Copy the hue_database_dump.json from the CDH cluster to
                            the CDP cluster.
Place the JSON file taken out from the legacy CDH Hue Cluster and place
                            it in /tmp on the new CDP Hue server host.noteThe
                                import process can only be run from one Hue server. Pick one to run
                                the import process on and temporarily turn off the other Hue server
                                instances. noteThe file name should not be
                                changed from hue_database_dump.json.You must load
                                the Hue dump using the CLI method and must NOT
                                use the UI option via Hue Server.
Stop the Hue Service.
Run the following commands:cd
                                    /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hue./build/env/bin/hue loaddata --ignorenonexistent
                                    /tmp/<HUE_DATABASE_JSON_FILE>
                                    --cm-managed
Start the Hue service.
From Cloudera Manager -> Hue
                                -> Select Actions ->
                                Synchronize: Select
                                Actions > Synchronize Database
                            and click Synchronize Database.
Start the Hue Service.
