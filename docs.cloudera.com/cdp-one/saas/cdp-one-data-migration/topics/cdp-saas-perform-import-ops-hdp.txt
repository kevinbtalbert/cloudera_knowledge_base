Performing Import operation


note If the users that are defined within the policy do not exist on the target
                cluster / storage, they are auto-created, import operation succeeds, and no further
                user action is required.

You must import the Ranger policies to CDP cluster Ranger.

Login to the RANGER_ADMIN portal with administrator user
                    credentials or user privileges as ADMIN.


Under Settings > Users/Groups/Roles >
                            Search for the ranger user.
Click on the ranger user and change its role to
                                Admin and save the changes.



Download and copy the file authz-ingest.zip to the
                        /opt directory of migration node (target data lake Ranger
                    node).

For example: CDP Data Lake or any relevant target cluster.


Unzip the authz-ingest.zip file into the
                        /opt directory which contains the following files:


config-files
scripts



The config-files contains the following:


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>

    <name>authorization.migration.export.target_services</name>
    <value>HIVE,KAFKA</value>

    <value>true</value>
  </property>
</configuration>



noteWhile using permissions.json file, you
                        might encounter an error or a warning message while using the default
                        configuration. You can ignore this and continue with the process.


If Ranger is TLS/SSL enabled using Cloudera Manager AUTO-TLS, you must then
                    from the Ranger admin host, copy cm-auto-global_truststore.jks
                    (from the Ranger-admin process directory). 

noteIn CDP One or CDP Public Cloud environment TLS is always enabled by
                        default.

For example:
                            /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/<ranger-process-ID>-ranger-RANGER_ADMIN)
                        to the location /opt/authz-ingest/config-files/ of the
                        migration tool host.Follow these steps to find the Ranger admin
                        process directory:

Execute the below command to get to the RANGER_ADMIN process:

ps -ef | grep proc_rangeradmin

Search for -cp option from the above command output
                                and look for 
"/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/<ID>-ranger-RANGER_ADMIN"

If you have done SSL setup manually or in a different method, copy the
                        filename which you created for truststores.For example:
                        cp /path/to/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks
                        /opt/authz-ingest/config-files/

Export the following variables to the target Ranger:




JAVA_HOME - Java home path used on
                                    the cluster
RANGER_ADMIN_URL - Ranger Admin
                                    portal url
RANGER_ADMIN_SSL_ENABLED - either
                                    true or false
RANGER_ADMIN_TRUSTORE_PASSWORD - If Ranger is
                                    TLS/SSL enabled using Cloudera Manager AUTO-TLS, then the
                                    password can be found on the Ranger host
                                        /etc/hadoop/conf/ssl-client.xml property
                                        'ssl.client.truststore.password'





Go to the location /opt/authz-ingest/config-files and open the
                    file authorization-migration-site.xml

Locate the property
                            “authorization.migration.ranger.import.input_file” and
                        provide the location of the transformed output file generated from Running the transform operation.
noteIf the property is not available then you must add this property in
                            the file.
Example:
                            file:///tmp/exportedRangerPolicies_transform.json<property><name>authorization.migration.ranger.import.input_file</name><value>file:///tmp/exportedRangerPolicies_transform.json</value></property>

For the Kerberos-based authentication (or in a non CDP-SaaS environment) use
                    the following process
 If the KDC server is not installed in your environment or
                        imported without the Kerberos authentication, you can skip this procedure
                        and use the process provided for non-Kerberos authentication. Also if PAM
                        auth is enabled in the target cluster then Kerberos authentication is
                        recommended to import Ranger policies quickly.
Find the Ranger admin keytab location and provide it in the following
                            command:
export
                            RANGER_ADMIN_KEYTAB_PATH=/path/to/ranger.keytabIn the
                        CDEP cluster, Ranger keytab shall be available in the Ranger host location
                            “/cdep/keytabs/rangeradmin.keytab” or under the Ranger
                        admin process directory
                            “/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/<ranger-process-ID>-ranger-RANGER_ADMIN”
                        location.Steps to find the Ranger admin process directory:
Execute the following command to get to the RANGER_ADMIN
                            process.
ps -ef | grep proc_rangeradmin
Search for -cp option from the above command
                            output and look for
                                "/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/<ID>-ranger-RANGER_ADMIN"

If your Ranger node and migration node (target data lake Ranger node)
                            are different, copy the Ranger keytab to the migration node (target data
                            lake Ranger node).
Run the below klist command on the migration node (target data lake
                            Ranger node) to get the list of principals available in
                                ${RANGER_ADMIN_KEYTAB_PATH}
klist -kt ${RANGER_ADMIN_KEYTAB_PATH}
Run the below kinit command using the
                                ${RANGER_ADMIN_KEYTAB_PATH} with
                                rangeradmin/_HOST@REALM principle. 
Update the _HOST and the REALM correctly using the below command.
kinit -kt ${RANGER_ADMIN_KEYTAB_PATH}
                            rangeradmin/_HOST@REALM

For non-Kerberos authentication, add the following properties and provide
                    relevant values. After providing the values to configurations, save, and close
                    the file.

<property>
    <name>ranger.admin.username</name>
    <value>admin</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>authorization.migration.kerberos.authentication</name>
<value>false</value>
</property>



Run the migration script:
cd authz-ingest/scriptssh
                        authz-import.sh

noteIf import operation fails, locate for details in the output of the command
                        printed on the terminal window or refer to the target Ranger admin log
                        files.


After execution, the authMigrator utility shall print total policies count,
                    skipped policies count and the failed policy counts on the same console window.
                    Users should refer to the console output logs to ensure policies have been
                    imported or not.
