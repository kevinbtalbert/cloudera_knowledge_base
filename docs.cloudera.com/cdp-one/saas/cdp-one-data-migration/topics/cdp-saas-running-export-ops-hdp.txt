Running the export operation
You must export the Ranger policies.

Update the “export” part of the env.sh file with the right set
                    of values as per your environment. 

Run the exportPolicy.sh file.
Running sh.exportPolicy.sh could throw an error because
                        env.sh file is not available. You can resolve this
                    condition by running the script file with the following usage:
                        ./exportPolicy.sh

Verify if the exported Ranger policies file was created or not.

Verify if the exported Ranger services file was created or not.

If any error refers to the source ranger-admin logs.


Copy the exported Ranger policies JSON file and exported Ranger services JSON
                    file to the migration cluster node (or a Data Lake node of cloud cluster).
