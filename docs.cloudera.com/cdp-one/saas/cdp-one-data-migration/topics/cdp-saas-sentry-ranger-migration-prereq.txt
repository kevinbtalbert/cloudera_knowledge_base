Migration prerequisites
You need to know the prerequisites for migrating Sentry policies from CDH to CDP One. 
You must meet the following general prerequisites before starting the migration
            process:

AWS is your Cloud provider. Migrating to Azure / GCP is currently not
                supported.
The source and target migration clusters must be running the following
                supported versions:
Source cluster: CDH 5.16, CDH 6.3
Target cluster: CDP 7.2.15 or higher

You can log in as the admin user to Cloudera Manager in the CDH
                cluster.
You must have SUDO or ROOT access to perform the
                migration process.
CDH clusters must have been created using Cloudera Manager. Clusters that
                are not managed by Cloudera Manager cannot be registered to CDP.
Create an external account on the CDH cluster that has non-expiring access
                credentials and secret key pair.
Your source cluster supports compatible versions of Cloudera Manager and Cloudera
                Runtime shown in the following table:

Source cluster
Earliest supported Cloudera Manager
Earliest supported Cloudera Runtime



CDH 5
6.3.0
5.1.0


CDH 6
6.3.0
6.1.0


CDH 6
7.3.1
6.3.3



Specifically note that:

Your CDH cluster is registered on the CDP Management Console. For more
                information, see Adding a CDH cluster.
Open communication ports between the source CDH
                cluster and CDP list.
When you create databases, you must assign valid roles for tables and grant adequate
                permissions as well. And the same applies to Kafka.


Setting up an external accountAs CDH Administrator, you need to create an External Account on the CDH cluster that         has an access key and secret key pair for accessing the cloud storage used in the CDP One environment. Parent topic: About Migrating Sentry policies
