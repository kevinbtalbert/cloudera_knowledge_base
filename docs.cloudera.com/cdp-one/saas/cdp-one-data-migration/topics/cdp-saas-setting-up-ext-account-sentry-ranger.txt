Setting up an external account
As CDH Administrator, you need to create an External Account on the CDH cluster that
        has an access key and secret key pair for accessing the cloud storage used in the CDP One environment. 
Using the external account along with the cloud storage path, administrators can
            migrate the Sentry policies from the CDH cluster to the cloud storage used in the CDP One environment.You must have valid Amazon S3
            credentials to access cloud storage for migrating data.You must raise a support case
                with Cloudera to provide the key pair.You must
                have valid Amazon S3 credentials to access cloud storage for migrating data. You add
                the access key / secret key pair to the account to access CDP cloud storage
                    s3a://<data lake bucket path>. The access key / secret key
                pair ensures that the external account configured on CDH can successfully access the
                S3 buckets used by Data Lake.
