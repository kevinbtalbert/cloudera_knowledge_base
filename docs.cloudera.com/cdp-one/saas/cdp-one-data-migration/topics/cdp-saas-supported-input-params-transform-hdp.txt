        must make sure to configure the env.sh file for the supported input values
        accordingly.

Description



PYTHON_COMMAND_INVOKER

This configuration is for the python command name or
                                    path to the python command file. Python 2.x and 3.x both
                                    versions are supported. If python version 3.X command is not
                                    aliased with python then python3 must be entered here. If python
                                    2 is installed then python or python2 must be provided as a
                                    value to this config.
Default : python
Mandatory: Yes



RANGER_POLICYMIGRATION_EXCLUDE_SERVICE_TYPES

This configuration is to exclude the Ranger policies of
                                    given Ranger service types during the transformation process.
                                    Ranger policies of given service-types will not be added in the
                                    transformed output file.

noteCurrently “tag” migration is not supported, hence it is
                                        recommended that users must add "tag" to exclude service
                                        types.

Example: storm,tag
Default : storm,tag
Mandatory: No



SOURCE_DESTINATION_RANGER_SERVICE_TYPE_MAPPING

This config is to tell the utility the mapping of
                                    source and target Ranger service type. Based on the given source
                                    service type, Ranger policies will be transformed to a given
                                    target service type. Source and target service type are
                                    separated by colon (:)
At present, Only Ranger hdfs service policies can be
                                    converted to s3 only.
Example: {hdfs:s3}
Default : {hdfs:s3}
Mandatory: No



SOURCE_DESTINATION_RANGER_SERVICE_NAME_MAPPING

This configuration is to provide the mapping of source
                                    and target Ranger service names to the utility. Based on the
                                    given service name mapping, during transformation service names
                                    of given Ranger policies will be replaced with the target
                                    service names. 
Source and target service names are separated by colon
                                    (:). Multiple entries are allowed and need to be separated by
                                    comma(,) character. If no mapping is provided then service names
                                    will remain the same even after the transformation process. 
Example: {cm_hdfs:cm_s3,c1_yarn:cm_yarn}
Default : empty string
Mandatory: No



SOURCE_DESTINATION_RANGER_ZONE_NAME_MAPPING

This configuration is to provide the mapping of source
                                    and target Ranger zone names to the utility. Based on the given
                                    zone name mapping, during transformation, zone names of given
                                    Ranger policies will be replaced with the target zone names. 
Source and target zone names are separated by colon
                                    (:). Multiple entries are allowed and need to be separated by
                                    comma(,) character. If no mapping is provided then zone names
                                    will remain the same even after the transformation process. 
Example: {oldzone1:newzone1}
Default : empty string
Mandatory: No



RANGER_POLICYMIGRATION_RESOURCE_MAPPING_FILE

This configuration is to provide the source and target
                                    service resource mappings to the utility. Based on the given
                                    resources mapping, during transformation resources of given
                                    Ranger policies will be replaced with the target resources. If
                                    no mapping is provided then the resource string will remain the
                                    same even after the transformation process. 
File format is CSV. Local filesystem path is supported
                                    only.
Example value: /path to
                                    /resourceMappings.csv
Default : empty string
Mandatory: No
Resource mapping for hdfs policy resource path=>
                                    For the JSON file format we can have multiple resource also in
                                    the JSON object formatted like :
Sample resource mapping entries for a json file:

{"/srcdir1/srcfile1":"/tardir1/tarfile1",
          "/srcdir2/srcfile2":"/tardir2/tarfile2"}

=> And with the CSV format, it's pipe-delimited with
                                    one entry per line.
Sample resource mapping entries for a csv file:
/srcdir1/srcfile1|/tardir1/tarfile1
/srcdir2/srcfile1|/tardir2/tarfile1

This config is to provide the source and target HIVE
                                    service URL policy resource mappings to the utility. Based on

                                    given Ranger Hive URL policies will be replaced with the target
                                    URL value. If no mapping is provided then the resource string
                                    will remain the same even after the transformation process.
                                    File format is CSV. Local filesystem path is

                                    the given Ranger policies will be replaced with the target user
                                    names. If no mapping is provided then user names will remain the

If a directory path is given then the suffix
                                    “transform” will be added in the input file name. If path
                                    contains file name also then utility shall create/overwrite the

This configuration is to assign a service name to the
                                    HDFS Ranger policies. These Ranger policies are those Ranger
