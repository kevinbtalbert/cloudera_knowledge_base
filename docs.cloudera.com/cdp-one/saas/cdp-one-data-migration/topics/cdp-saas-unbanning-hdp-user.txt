Unbanning hdfs user in HDP cluster
The hdfs user must be unbanned and allowed full access to the HDP
        cluster.
Procedure to unban the hdfs user.

Remove the hdfs entry from the following file, from line
                        banned.users on the ambari-server host.

/var/lib/ambari-server/resources/common-services/YARN/2.1.0.2.0/package/templates/container-executor.cfg.j2

The
                        updated file contents are as follows
yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs={{nm_local_dirs}}
yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs={{nm_log_dirs}}
yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.group={{yarn_executor_container_group}}
banned.users=yarn,mapred,bin
min.user.id={{min_user_id}}


Check the YARN service configuration on Ambari UI for
                        ‘container-executor configuration template’ configuration.
                    Ensure that the hdfs user is not mentioned in the
                        banned.users on the ambari-server host. If it is
                    still present, remove it from the configuration, save the changes and restart
                    stale services.

Restart ambari-server. On the ambari-server host, execute the following
                    command:
service ambari-server restart

Restart ambari-agent. On each ambari-agent host of the cluster, execute the
                    following command:
service ambari-agent restart

Add hdfs user in YARN ACLs configuration by editing
yarn.admin.acl

Allow hdfs user to submit YARN jobs by editing the following
                    configuration
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.acl_submit_applications

Restart the YARN service in the Ambari UI.
