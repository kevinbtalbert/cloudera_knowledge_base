Update cloud credentials
You can update the cloud credentials based on various factors. 
When the bucket configuration such as secret or access keys, bucket name or endpoint, and
            encryption type is changed, it can affect the Replication Manager replication policy run
            and might require an update to the Replication Manager cloud credentials.
Credential changes are picked up by the next run of the policy. When you change
            the credentials, the in-progress policy runs might fail but the succeeding runs pick up
            the changes.
To update a cloud credential, click Actions >
                Update option.
