Using the DistCp tool
Use DistCp to copy files between various clusters.
The most common use of DistCp is an inter-cluster copy:
hadoop distcp hdfs://nn1:8020/source
                hdfs://nn2:8020/destination
Where hdfs://nn1:8020/source is the data source, and
                hdfs://nn2:8020/ destination is the destination. 
This will expand the name space under /source on NameNode "nn1" into a
            temporary file, partition its contents among a set of map tasks, and start copying from
            "nn1" to "nn2". Note that DistCp requires absolute paths.
You can also specify multiple source directories:

hadoop distcp hdfs://nn1:8020/source/a hdfs://nn1:8020/source/b hdfs://
          nn2:8020/destination

Or specify multiple source directories from a file with the -f option:


hadoop distcp -f hdfs://nn1:8020/srclist hdfs://nn2:8020/destination

Where srclist contains:
hdfs://nn1:8020/source/a
hdfs://nn1:8020/source/b
noteThe DistCp tool is also used to migrate data to the cloud storage (AWS S3, Microsoft
            Azure, and Google Cloud).
