Verifying HDFS data migration
Post-migration process, you must check if the migration process is completed
        successfully by verifying the data on the AWS S3 endpoint.
There are two ways to verify the HDFS data replication:

Verification from Replication Manager App.Once the
                    replication policy is created and scheduled, go to CDP public cloud -> choose
                        replication manager -> click Replication
                        Policies on the left pane. You can view the
                    number of replication policies that was created and the replication jobs status
                    as seen from the following image:


The green check mark indicates successful replication jobs. The red
                    escalation mark indicates the failed replication jobs.
Verifying from the AWS S3 Console.Log into AWS S3 > click
                        Buckets on left pane -> search the bucket name in the search box of
                    right pane. After accessing the target bucket, search the path
                    name where the HDFS data is migrated. View if the HDFS data in source CDH
                    cluster is replicated in the target S3 bucket path
