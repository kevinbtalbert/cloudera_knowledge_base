Verifying Hive data migration
After the replication policy runs successfully, you can view the replication job
        status on the Replication Policies page.
An administrator can verify whether the job starts and runs as expected using
            the following steps:

For HDFS data replication, check the cloud storage path (S3 bucket path)
                to verify whether the data was successfully copied in the specified bucket.
For Hive metadata replication, verify whether the specified source
                database, along with tables, partitions, UDFs, and column stats are available in the
                Data Lake HMS instance. For this, the administrator can use a Data Hub cluster and
                run the corresponding queries using Hue or beeline.
For Ranger policies, query the Ranger policies to ensure that the Sentry
                policies are properly mapped as Ranger policies for the right users and groups.


noteIf the CDH source database contains functions, you must explicitly run the
                    reload function command to view the migrated replication
                functions in the target location. You can perform and monitor various tasks after
                running a replication policy. You can view the job progress, notifications, and
                replication logs. You can use the advanced options to optimize a job run. You can
                suspend a job and also activate a suspended job. You can edit the replication policy
                as necessary.
