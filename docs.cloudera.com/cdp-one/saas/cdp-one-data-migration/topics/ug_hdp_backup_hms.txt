Saving Hive metastore on HDP by dumping
You must dump the Hive metastore metadata immediately before upgrading or migrating.
        Dumping the metastore data to a file is critical to prevent data loss. 

On the node where the database you use for Hive Metastore resides, dump Hive
                    Metastore metadata before upgrading/migrating to HDP. 
For example, in MySQL, dump each database as
                    follows:mysqldump <hive_db_schema_name> > </path/to/dump_file>
                    In Postgres, dump each database as follows:
                    pg_dump --opt <metastore_db_name> > /path/to/dump_file


Proceed to upgrade/migrate  HDP, assuming no Hive update, delete, or merge
                    occurred after compaction; otherwise, repeat the compaction and Hive Metastore
                    dump procedures, and then upgrade/migrate from HDP.
