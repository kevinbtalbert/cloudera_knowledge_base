Taking a mandatory snapshot of HDP tables
Taking a snapshot of Hive tables is mandatory before upgrading or migrating. You also
        need to keep track of how many tables you have before and after for comparison. 

In Ambari, go to Services/Hive/Configs, and check the value of
                   hive.metastore.warehouse.dir to determine the location of the Hive
                   warehouse, /apps/hive/warehouse by default.

On any node in the cluster, as the HDFS superuser, enable snapshots. 
                   
$ sudo su - hdfs
$ hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot /apps/hive/warehouse

Allowing snapshot on /apps/hive/warehouse succeeded

Create a snapshot of the Hive warehouse.

$ hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /apps/hive/warehouse
Output includes the name and location of the snapshot.
                    Created snapshot /apps/hive/warehouse/.snapshot/s20181204-164645.898

Start Hive as a user who has SELECT privileges on the tables. 

$ beeline 
beeline> !connect jdbc:hive2:// 
Enter username for jdbc:hive2://: hive
Enter password for jdbc:hive2://: *********

Connected to: Apache Hive (version 1.2.1000.2.6.5.0-292)
Driver: Hive JDBC (version 1.2.1000.2.6.5.0-292)

Identify all tables outside /apps/hive/warehouse/.

hive> USE my_database;
hive> SHOW TABLES;

Determine the location of each table using the DESCRIBE command. For
                    example:

hive> DESCRIBE FORMATTED my_table partition (dt='20181130');


Create a snapshot of the directory shown in the location section of the output.

Repeat steps 5-7 for each database and its tables outside
                        /apps/hive/warehouse/.
