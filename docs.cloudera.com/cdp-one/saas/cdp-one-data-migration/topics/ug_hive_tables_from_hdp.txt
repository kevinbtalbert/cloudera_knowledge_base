Changes to HDP Hive tables
You need to locate and use your Apache Hive 3 tables after moving to CDP. You also need
    to understand the changes that occur during the process.
Managed, ACID tables that are not owned by the hive user remain managed
      tables in CDP, but hive becomes the owner.
In CDP, the format of a Hive table is the same as it was in HDP. For example, native or
      non-native tables remain native or non-native, respectively.
In CDP, the location of managed tables or partitions do not change under any one of the
      following conditions:

The old HDP 2.x table or partition directory was not in its default location
          /apps/hive/warehouse before the upgrade.
The old table or partition is in a different file system than the new warehouse
       directory.
The old table or partition directory is in a different encryption zone than the new
       warehouse directory.

Otherwise, in CDP managed files reside in the Hive warehouse
        /warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive. The location of external files in CDP
      does not change. By default, Hive places any new external tables you create in
        /warehouse/tablespace/external/hive. In CDP, the
        hive.metastore.warehouse.dir property is set to this location, designating
      it the Hive warehouse location.
Changes to table references using dot notation
Upgrading to CDP includes the Hive-16907 bug fix, which rejects `db.table` in SQL queries.
        The dot (.) is not allowed in table names. To reference the database and table in a table
        name, both must be enclosed in backticks as follows: `db`.`table`.

Changes to ACID properties
Hive 3.x supports transactional and non-transactional tables. Transactional tables have
        atomic, consistent, isolation, and durable (ACID) properties. In Hive 2.x, the initial
        version of ACID transaction processing was ACID v1. In Hive 3.x, the mature version of ACID
        is ACID v2, which is the default table type in CDP.

Native and non-native storage formats
Storage formats are a factor in changes to table types. Hive 2.x and 3.x support the
        following native and non-native storage formats: 

Native: Tables with built-in support in Hive, such as those in the following file
            formats:
Text
Sequence File
RC File
AVRO File
ORC File
Parquet File

Non-native: Tables that use a storage handler, such as the DruidStorageHandler or
          HBaseStorageHandler


Changes to HDP table types
The following table compares Hive table types and ACID operations from HDP 2.x to CDP. The
        ownership of the Hive table file is a factor in determining table types and ACID operations
        in CDP. Table 1. HDP 2.x and CDP Table Type Comparison
