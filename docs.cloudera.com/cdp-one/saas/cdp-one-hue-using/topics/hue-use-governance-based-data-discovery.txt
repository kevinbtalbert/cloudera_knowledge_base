Using governance-based data discovery
Hue can use the metadata tagging, indexing, and search features available in Apache
    Atlas data management. After integrating Hue with Atlas,  classifications and indexed entities
    can be accessed and viewed in Hue. This topic shows you how to
    use metadata classifications in Hue.
Integration between Hue and Atlas is enabled by default, but if your administrator has
      disabled it, it must be re-enabled before you can use governance-based data discovery.
You can create tags to classify your data both from Atlas and Hue.

Defining metadata tagsThe first step to access and use metadata that is stored in Atlas is to define     metadata tags in Hue. Then you can use the search and indexing capabilities from Atlas in Hue     and add metadata to Atlas without leaving the Hue UI.Searching metadata tagsThe SQL Editor in Hue provides a search text box where you can search on the metadata     tags or classifications that are associated with your databases, tables, and     columns.
