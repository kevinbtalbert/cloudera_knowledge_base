(tracking_url)

STRING
FALSE
The MapReduce application tracking URL.



Uberized Job
(uberized)

BOOLEAN
FALSE
Whether this MapReduce job is uberized - running
                  completely in the ApplicationMaster. Called 'uberized' in searches. Available only
                  for running jobs.



Unused Memory Seconds
(unused_memory_seconds)

NUMBER
TRUE
The amount of memory the application has allocated but
                  not used (megabyte-seconds). This metric is calculated hourly if container usage
                  metric aggregation is enabled. Called 'unused_memory_seconds' in searches.



Unused VCore Seconds
(unused_vcore_seconds)

NUMBER
TRUE
The amount of CPU resources the application has
                  allocated but not used (virtual core-seconds). This metric is calculated hourly if
                  container usage metric aggregation is enabled. Called 'unused_vcore_seconds' in
                  searches.



Used Memory Max
(used_memory_max)

NUMBER
TRUE
The maximum container memory usage
                  for a YARN application. This metric is calculated hourly if
                  container usage metric aggregation is enabled and a Cloudera
                  Manager Container Usage Metrics Directory is specified.  



User
(user)

STRING
TRUE
The user who ran the YARN application. Called 'user'
                  in searches.



Virtual Memory
(virtual_memory_bytes)

BYTES
TRUE
Virtual memory. Called 'virtual_memory_bytes' in
                  searches.



Work CPU Time
(cm_cpu_milliseconds)

MILLISECONDS
TRUE
Attribute measuring the sum of CPU time used by all
                  threads of the query, in milliseconds. Called 'work_cpu_time' in searches. For
                  Impala queries, CPU time is calculated based on the 'TotalCpuTime' metric. For
                  YARN MapReduce applications, this is calculated from the 'cpu_milliseconds'
                  metric.




Examples
Consider the following filter expressions: user = "root", rowsProduced > 0, fileFormats RLIKE ".TEXT.*", and executing = true. In the examples:

The filter attributes are user, rowsProduced, fileFormats, and executing.
The operators are =, >, and RLIKE.
The filter values are root, 0, .TEXT.*, and true.
