Filter Expressions
Filter expressions specify which entries should display when you run the
    filter.
The simplest expression consists of three components:

Attribute - Query language name of the attribute.

Operator - Type of comparison between the attribute and
          the attribute value. Cloudera Manager supports the standard comparator operators =, !=, >, <, >=, <=, and RLIKE. (RLIKE performs regular expression
          matching as specified in the Java Pattern class documentation.) Numeric values can be
          compared with all operators. String values can be compared with =, !=, and RLIKE. Boolean values
          can be compared with = and !=.

Value - The value of the attribute. The value depends on
          the type of the attribute. For a Boolean value, specify either true or false. When specifying a string value, enclose the value in double
          quotes.


You create compound filter expressions using the AND and OR operators.
      When more than one operator is used in an expression, AND is evaluated first, then OR. To
      change the order of evaluation, enclose subexpressions in parentheses.
Compound Expressions
To find all the queries issued by the root user that produced over 100
        rows, use the
        expression:user = "root" AND rowsProduced > 100

To find all the executing queries issued by users Jack or Jill, use the
        expression:executing = true AND (user = "Jack" OR user = "Jill")
