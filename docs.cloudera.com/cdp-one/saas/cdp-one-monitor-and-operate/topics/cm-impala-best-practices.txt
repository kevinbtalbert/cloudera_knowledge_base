Impala Best Practices
The  Impala Best Practices page contains charts that include
    description of each best practice and how to determine if it is being followed. 
To open
      the Impala Best Practices page, click the Best
        Practices tab on the Impala service page. See the Impala documentation for more
      detail on each best practice and for additional best practices.
Adjust the time range to see data on queries run at different times.
        Click the charts to get more detail on individual queries. Use the
        filter box at the top right of the Best Practices page to adjust which
        data is shown on the page. For example, to see just the queries that
        took more than ten seconds, make the filter query_duration >
          10s.
Create a trigger based on any best practice by choosing
          Create Trigger from the individual chart
        drop-down menu.
