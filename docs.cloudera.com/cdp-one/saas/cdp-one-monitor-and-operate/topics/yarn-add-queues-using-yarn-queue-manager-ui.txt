Adding queues using YARN Queue Manager UI
You can add queues to the predefined queue called root from the Yarn Queue
    Manager UI. The Capacity Scheduler has a predefined queue called root. All queues in the system
    are children of the root queue. Each child queue is tied to its parent queue, but children
    queues do not inherit properties directly from the parent queue unless otherwise
    specified.

In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Clusters >  YARN Queue Manager UI. 






Click on the three vertical dots on the root and select the Add Child
          Queue option. 


Enter the information based on the Relative or Absolute or Weight allocation
          mode.

Absolute allocation mode: Enter the name of the queue and
              units of memory in MiB in the Memory tab. Enter the number of
              cores in the vCores tab.


noteWhen decreasing a queue's configured resource capacity to
                allocate resources for the new sibling queue you must update resource capacities
                starting from the lowest queue level. This is because a parent queueâ€™s capacity
                cannot be decreased until the total resource capacity of all of its child queues is
                reduced. You might have to change both the minimum and maximum values.
Relative allocation mode: Enter the name of the
                queue, Configured Capacity, and Maximum
                Capacity values for the queue.


Weight allocation mode: Enter the name of the queue and the
              fraction of the resource of the resource in the  Configured
                Weight for the queue.





Click Save.

You can continue to add more parent and child queues by following the same steps.
