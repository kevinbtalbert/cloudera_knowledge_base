Using the YARN CLI to
      viewlogs for applications
Use the YARN CLI to view logs for running application. Configure the log aggregation
      to aggregate and write out logs for all containers belonging to a single Application grouped
      by NodeManagers to single log files at a configured location in the file system.  
You can access container log
         files using the YARN ResourceManager web UI, but more options are available when you use
         the yarn logs CLI command.
View all log files for an application
Use the following command format to view all logs for an
            application:yarn logs -applicationId <Application ID>

View a specific log type for an application
Use the following command format to view all logs of a particular type for an
            application:
            yarn logs -applicationId <Application ID> -log_files <log_file_type>
For example, to view only the stderr error
            logs:yarn logs -applicationId <Application ID> -log_files stderr
The -logFiles option also supports Java regular expressions, so the
            following format would return all types of log files:
yarn logs -applicationId <Application ID> -log_files .* 

View ApplicationMaster log files
Use the following command format to view all ApplicationMaster container log files for
            an
            application:yarn logs -applicationId <Application ID> -am ALL
Use the following command format to view only the first ApplicationMaster container log
            files:yarn logs -applicationId <Application ID> -am 1

List container IDs
Use the following command format to list all container IDs for an application:
yarn logs -applicationId <Application ID> -show_application_log_info

View log files for one container
Once you have the container IDs, you can use the following command format to list the
            log files for a particular
            container:yarn logs -applicationId <Application ID> -containerId <Container ID>

Show container log file information
Use the following command format to list all of the container log file names (types) for
            an
            application:yarn logs -applicationId <Application ID> -show_container_log_infoYou
            can then use the -logFiles option to view a particular log type.

View a portion of the log files for one container
For large container log files, you can use the following command format to list only a
            portion of the log files for a particular
            container:yarn logs -applicationId <Application ID> -containerId <Container ID> -size <bytes>
To view the first 1000
            bytes:yarn logs -applicationId <Application ID> -containerId <Container ID> -size 1000
To view the last 1000
            bytes:yarn logs -applicationId <Application ID> -containerId <Container ID> -size -1000

Download logs for an application
Use the following command format to download logs to a local
            folder:yarn logs -applicationId <Application ID> -out <path_to_local_folder>
The container log files are organized in parent folders labeled with the applicable node
            ID.

Display help for YARN logs
To display Help for yarn logs, run the following
            command:yarn logs -help
