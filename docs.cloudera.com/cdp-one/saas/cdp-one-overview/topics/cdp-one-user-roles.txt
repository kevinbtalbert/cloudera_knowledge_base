CDP One user roles
Your available CDP One services depend on what has been
  provisioned for you as part of your CDP One subscription, as well
  as your assigned user groups. 
CDP One roles and permissions


Data Analyst (data_analyst) – Access to data and endpoints are driven by
      Ranger policies. By default any user in this group only has access to their home directory and
      the default database.




System Administrator (system_admin) – Full access to CDP One capabilities, including access to data, service
      administration, and service consumption.




User Administrator (user_admin) – User Administrators can manage user and
      groups in CDP One, including data policies enforced by
      Ranger.


Data Analyst is a generic group that is supplanted by specific groups originating
    from the customer's identity provider (IdP). It is generally insufficient to have a single user
    group that caters to all data policies. Any additional groups must be forwarded to Support so
    that these groups can be seeded with the basic permissions assigned to the Data Analyst default
    group. All further privileges can then be configured for that specific group(s) by the User
    Administrator via data access policies in Ranger.
