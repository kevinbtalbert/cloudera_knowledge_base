Configuring gateway nodes
This guide describes how to configure gateway nodes to be compatible with CDP One automation.

Gateway nodes are the primary mechanism to interact with the command line
                utilities for CDP One endpoints. The command line
                utilities are most commonly used when automating processes. They are commonly used
                for orchestration purposes.
CDP One automation controls gateway nodes.
                It is important that the gateway nodes are used in a manner that does not interfere
                with this automation. 
Cloudera strongly recommends that Gateway Nodes are not used for any data
                persistence. All data should be persisted to one of the core storage mechanisms that
                support redundancy and resilience.

Installing .cer certs
Copy certs to /opt/apps/customer/certs, and run the
                    import_customer_certs command to add the cert to the default
                truststore. Any .cer files in this location are preserved by automation. After
                upgrades, automation automatically imports all .cer files from this location to the
                default truststore.

Installing additional OS packages
There are orchestration scenarios that require additional OS packages to be
                installed to enable an orchestration process. In these scenarios;


Install packages using yum, and be sure to record the package
                        information (name and version) in the
                            /opt/apps/customer/meta/yum_packages.txt** file. 


After upgrades, automation reads this metadata file and reinstalls
                        all of the listed packages.



Installing Python packages



Use venv to create a virtual environment under the
                                /opt/apps/customer/ directory, then install Python
                            packages in this virtual environment.


For more information about venv, see Installing packages using pip and
                                    virtual environments.




Storing data files
Use the /opt/apps/, /home, or
                    /data directories to store data files. Data stored outside
                these locations will not be persisted through the upgrade process.

Using a DNS configuration file
Configure DNS forwarders using
                /etc/unbound/conf.d/customer_dns.conf. Automated backup and restore
                ensures that this file is backed up before running the CDP OS upgrade, and restored
                after upgrade.

Using a sudoers configuration file
Configure customer sudoers groups using
                    /etc/sudoers.d/customer_sudoers. Automated backup and restore
                ensures that this file is backed up before running the CDP OS upgrade, and restored
                after upgrade.
