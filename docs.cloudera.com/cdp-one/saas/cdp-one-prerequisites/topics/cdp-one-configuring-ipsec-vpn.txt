Configuring a site-to-site IPSec VPN to CDP One
This guide describes how to establish a site-to-site IPSec VPN (Virtual Private
        Network) connection from your firewall to CDP One. These
        steps are written for generic firewall configuration, so the concepts apply to all
        firewalls, but the configuration may vary depending on your exact firewall. 

This configuration consists of a single tunnel using static routes. If you have any
                issues with the settings below, please create a case with Cloudera Support.

IPSec Tunnel Configuration

Internet Key Exchange (IKE) ConfigurationConfigure the IKE SA as
                        follows:
IKE version: IKEv2
Authentication Method: Pre-Shared Key
Pre-Shared Key: <xxxx >
Authentication Algorithm: sha256
Encryption Algorithm: aes-256-cbc
Lifetime: 24 hours
Phase 1 Negotiation Mode: main
Diffie-Hellman: Group 14

IPSec Configuration Configure the IPSec SA as follows:
Protocol: esp
Authentication Algorithm: sha256
Encryption Algorithm: aes-256-cbc or aes-256-gcm
Lifetime: 8 hours
Mode: tunnel
Perfect Forward Secrecy: Diffie-Hellman Group 14

Tunnel Interface ConfigurationOutside IP Addresses:
Cloudera VPN Gateway: <x.x.x.x>
Customer Gateway: (customer provided)

Routing Configuration Static routes will be used within the tunnel
                        to send traffic between CDP One and your
                        firewall.


 Create a Security Policy Rule Set

Outbound Rule – This will allow customer enterprise access to CDP One.
Create a new policy, and for the following services:
Knox: Proxy gateway for access to cluster services (TCP 443) 
SSH: (TCP 22)

Add a second outbound Policy for ping (testing only).

Inbound Rule (optional) – This will allow CDP One to access specific enterprise resources. 
Create a new Security Policy and add services to allow CDP One to access specific enterprise
                            data endpoints for providing data into the service, or for the service
                            to push data into.
