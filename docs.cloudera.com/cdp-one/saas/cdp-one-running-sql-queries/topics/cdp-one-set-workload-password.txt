Setting a workload password
You can use your user profile page to set a workload password. Your workload password
        is used as the SSH password when accessing the gateway node CLI. You must perform a user
        sync after setting a workload password. 

On the CDP One console, move the pointer over
                    the user icon at the top right of the page, then click
                        Profile.






On your user profile page, click Set Workload
                    Password.






On the Workload Password page, type in and confirm a workload password, then
                    click Set Workload Password.


The password must be a minimum of eight characters, and must include at
                            least one upper case character, one lowercase character, one number, and
                            one special character. Supported special characters are "#", "&",
                            "*", "$", "%", "@", "^", ".", "_", and "!".




Click User Management, then select Actions >
                        Synchronize Users. 






On the Synchronize Users page, all environments are selected by default. You
                    can synchronize users in all environments, or select a specific environment.
                    Click Synchronize Users to synchronize users in the
                    specified environments.
