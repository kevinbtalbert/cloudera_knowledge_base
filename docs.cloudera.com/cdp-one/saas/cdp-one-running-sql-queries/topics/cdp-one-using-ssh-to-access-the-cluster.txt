Using SSH to access gateway nodes
You can use SSH to connect to CDP One gateway nodes.
        This enables you to access the command line utilities of the analytic components in your CDP
        cluster and perform client tasks, such as querying Hive or Impala remotely from the command
        line. You use the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol to connect to a node from a terminal utility.
        Using SSH, you log into the node using a key pair for authentication instead of a user name
        and password. 


Set a workload password. See Setting a workload password.
Register your SSH key pair for authentication. See Registering SSH keys. 

noteYou can only SSH into gateway nodes. 


Log into CDP One.

In the Environment drop-down list, accept the default environment or select
                    another environment.






Click All Services.

Under Command Line in the UI, click SSH for
                    Gateway.






Copy the SSH command.






Open a terminal, and paste the command.
                
$ ssh myname@cdpsaasdemo-edge-edge0.cdpsaasd.eu55-rsdu.cloudera.site

At the password prompt, enter your workload password.
                    
                
The connection to the gateway succeeds. The output looks something like
                    this:
