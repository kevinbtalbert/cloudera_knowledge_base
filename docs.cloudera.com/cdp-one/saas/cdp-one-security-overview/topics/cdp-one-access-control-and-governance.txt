Access Control and Governance

CDP One access control and governance is managed by a shared
        set of security services. You must have the Security Admin role in order to access the CDP
        One security services. 
Ranger access control and auditing
Ranger manages access control through a user interface that ensures
                consistent policy administration across cluster services. 
Security administrators can define security policies at the database,
                table, column, and file levels, and can administer permissions for groups or
                individual users. Rules based on dynamic conditions such as time or geolocation can
                also be added to an existing policy rule. Ranger security zones enable you to
                organize service resources into multiple security zones.
Ranger also provides a centralized framework for collecting access audit history and reporting data, 
                including filtering on various parameters.

Atlas metadata management and governance
Atlas provides a set of metadata management and governance services that
                enable you to manage cluster assets. 

Search and Proscriptive Lineage – facilitates pre-defined and ad hoc
                    exploration of data and metadata, while maintaining a history of data sources
                    and how specific data was generated.
Ranger plugin for metadata-driven data access control.
Flexible modeling of both business and operational data.
Data Classification – helps you understand the nature of the data
                    within Hadoop and classify it based on external and internal sources.
