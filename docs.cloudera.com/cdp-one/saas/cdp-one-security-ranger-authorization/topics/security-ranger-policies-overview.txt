Ranger Policies Overview
Ranger has two types of policies: resource-based and tag-based.
Resource-based policies
Ranger enables you to configure resource-based services (HDFS, HBase, Hive, etc.) and
            add access policies to those services.

Tag-based policies
Ranger enables you to create tag-based services and add access policies to those
            services.


Ranger tag-based policiesRanger enables you to create tag-based services and add access policies to those         services.Tags and policy evaluationWhen authorizing an access request, an Apache Ranger plugin evaluates applicable         Ranger policies for the resource being accessed. The following diagram shows the details of         the policy evaluation flow. More details on the steps in this workflow are provided in the         subsequent sections.Ranger access conditionsThe Apache Ranger access policy model consists of two major components: specification       of the resources a policy is applied to, such as HDFS files and directories, Hive databases.       tables. and columns, HBase tables, column-families, and columns, and so on; and the       specification of access conditions for specific users and groups
