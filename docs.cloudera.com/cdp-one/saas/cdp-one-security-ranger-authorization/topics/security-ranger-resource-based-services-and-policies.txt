Resource-based Services and Policies
Ranger enables you to configure resource-based services for Hadoop components (e.g.
        HBase, Kafka, Storm, etc.) and add access policies to those services.
Configuring resource-based servicesThe Service Manager for Resource Based Policies page is displayed when you log in to       the Ranger Console. You can also access this page by selecting Access Manager > Resource       Based Policies. You can use this page to create services for Hadoop resources (HDFS, HBase,       Hive, etc.) and add access policies to those resources.Configuring resource-based policiesTo view the policies associated with a service, click the service name on the Resource       Based Policies Service Manager page. The policies for that service will be displayed in a       list, along with a search box.Preloaded resource-based services and policiesApache Ranger includes preloaded resource-based services and policies. Importing and exporting resource-based policiesYou can export and import policies from the Ranger Admin UI for cluster resiliency       (backups), during recovery operations, or when moving policies from test clusters to       production clusters. You can export/import a specific subset of policies (such as those that       pertain to specific resources or user/groups) or clone the entire repository (or multiple       repositories) via Ranger Admin UI.Row-level filtering and column masking in HiveYou can use Apache Ranger row-level filters to set access policies for rows in Hive       tables. You can also use Ranger column masking to set policies that mask data in Hive columns,       for example to show only the first or last four characters of column data.
