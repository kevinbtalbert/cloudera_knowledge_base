Configure a resource-based storage handler policy: HadoopSQL
How to configure a policy that allows authorized users to create data tables using
        storage-handlers.

Ranger includes “storage-type” and “storage-url” resources in HadoopSQL Service that
                support only the permission “RW Storage ” permission. Ranger authorizes a user that
                creates or alters a table against this resource policy. A user having the required
                “RW Storage” permission on the resource representing the storage-type and
                storage-url, is allowed to create/alter the table in the respective storage.


On the Service Manager page, select HadoopSQL service.

The List of Policies HadoopSQL page appears. note
                            Service_name remains cm_hive. Display name is HadoopSQL.


To create a new policy, click Add New Policy.


On Create Policy click
                                storage-type as shown in the following
                            example:







Complete the required* fields.


In Allow Conditions, select users, then add the
                            RW Storage permission, as shown in the preceeding example.


Scroll to the bottom of Create Policy, then
                            click Add.



To configure an existing policy named all - storage-type, storage-url,  click
                        Edit.

The Edit Policy page appears.





Complete the Edit Policy page as follows:

Table 1. Policy Details

Field
Description



Policy Name
Enter an appropriate policy name. This name cannot be
                                        duplicated across the system. This field is mandatory. The
                                        policy is enabled by default. 


normal/override
Enables you to specify an override policy. When
                                            override is selected, the access permissions in
                                        the policy override the access permissions in existing
                                        policies. This feature can be used with Add Validity Period
                                        to create temporary access policies that override existing
                                        policies. 


Policy Label
Specify a label for this policy. You can search reports
                                        and filter policies based on these labels.


 storage-type

* allows athorizes users to create any table in
                                            the spcified storage type..



storage url 

Type in the applicable storage URL.

* allows athorizes users to create any table in

Table 2. Allow Conditions




Label






Description






Select User

Specify the users to which this policy applies. 
To designate a user as an Administrator, select the
                                                Delegate Admin check box. Administrators can
                                            edit or delete the policy, and can also create child
                                            policies based on the original policy.



Permissions

Add or edit permissions: RW Storage, You can assign read
                                            and select permissions to rangerlookup user.



Delegate Admin

                                        policy. Administrators can edit or delete the policy, and
                                        can also create child policies based on the original
                                        policy.




Example StorageHandler Policy Definitions:
HBase StorageHandler policy:
Storage Type: hbase
Storage URL: hbase-cluster:port/hbase-table

Phoenix StorageHandler policy:
Storage Type: phoenix
Storage URL: phoenix-cluster:port/table-name

 Kafka StorageHandler policy:
Storage Type: kafka
Storage URL: bootstrap-server:port/kafka-topic 
 JDBC StorageHandler policy:
Storage Type: jdbc:mysql 
Storage URL: mysql-host:port/DBname/Table , or
Sorage URL: mysql-host:port/DBname/*note
Policy and table definitions must be in sync regarding the port
                                definition, even for default port numbers. For example, if port
                                number 3306 is defined in the policy for mysql and this port number
                                is left out from the URL as default value for the JDBC Driver, you
                                must use the same reference as defined in the policy when creating
                                the external table.
Using an explicit table name allows only to reference that specific
                                table with hive.sql.table while using * allows not only to reference
                                any tables from the database but also allows you to write a custom
                                query against this database, for example using hive.sql.query.
