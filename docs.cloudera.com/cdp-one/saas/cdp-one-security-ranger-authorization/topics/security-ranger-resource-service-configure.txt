Configuring resource-based services
The Service Manager for Resource Based Policies page is displayed when you log in to
      the Ranger Console. You can also access this page by selecting Access Manager > Resource
      Based Policies. You can use this page to create services for Hadoop resources (HDFS, HBase,
      Hive, etc.) and add access policies to those resources.



To add a new resource-based service, click the Add
               icon () in the applicable box on the Service Manager page. Enter the
            required configuration settings, then click Add.



To edit a resource-based service, click the Edit
               icon () at the right of the service. Edit the service settings, then click
              Save to save your changes.



To delete a resource-based service, click the
               Delete icon () at the right of the service. Deleting a service also deletes all
            of the policies for that service.
