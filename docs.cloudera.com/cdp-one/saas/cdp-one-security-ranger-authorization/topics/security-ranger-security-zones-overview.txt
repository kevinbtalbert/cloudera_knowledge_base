Ranger Security Zones overview.

What is a Security Zone?
Lets you organize resource and tag-based services and policies into separate security
                zones. You can assign one or more administrators for each security zone. Security
                zone administrators can then create and update policies for their security zone. 
For example, let us consider two security zones: "finance" and "sales": 


Security zone "finance" includes all content in a "finance" Hive
                        database.
Security zone "sales" includes all content in a "sales" Hive database.
Sets of users and groups are designated as administrators in each security
                        zone.
Users are allowed to set up policies only in security zones in which they
                        are administrators. 
Policies defined in a security zone are applicable only for resources of
                        that zone.
 A zone can be extended to include resources from multiple services such as
                        HDFS, Hive, HBase, Kafka, etc., allowing administrators of a zone to set up
                        policies for resources owned by their organization across multiple services.
                    



Zone: finance
 service: prod_hdfs; path=/finance/*, /taxes/*
 service: prod_hive; database=finance
 service: prod_kafka; topic=FIN_*
 service: test_hadoop; path=/finance/*, /taxes/*
Zone: sales
 service: prod_hdfs; path=/sales/*
 service: prod_hive; database=sales
 service: prod_kafka; topic=SALES_*



As shown above, resources can be specified using wildcards (FIN_*, SALES_*). 
A resource is not mappable to more than one security zone. Ranger does not
                        allow creation of security zones that specify resources that match resources
                        in another zone. For example, an attempt to update the "finance" zone above
                        with the HDFS path /sales/finance/* is not be permitted, as this conflicts
                        with the HDFS path /sales/* specified in the "sales" zone. 
A set of users and groups can be designated as administrators of a security
                        zone. Administrators can create, update, and delete security policies for
                        the resources in the security zone. 
A set of users and groups can be authorized to view audit logs of access to
                        a security zoneâ€™s resources. Other users are not allowed to view
                        access-audit logs of the security zone resources. 


Security Zone Administration


Security zones can only be created, updated, or deleted by a user with the
                        ROLE_SYS_ADMIN role in Ranger.
Users can view, retrieve, and update policies only in security zones in
                        which they have administrator privileges.


How are Security Zones Used in Authorization? 
When a Ranger authorization plugin authorizes a resource access request, it first
                determines the zone in which the accessed resource resides. If the resource matches
                a security zone, only the policies of that security zone are used to authorize the
                access. If resource does not match any security zone, the policies in the default
                (unnamed) security zone are used to authorize the access. 
Tag-based Policies in Security Zones
In a given service, each security zone can be configured to use tag-based policies
                from a specific security zone in a tag-service. This enables tag-based authorization
                policies to be used based on the security zone of the resource. 
Audit Logs

Audit logs generated by Ranger include the name of the security zone in which the
                accessed resource resides. Only users who have been assigned as an Admin or Auditor
                for the security zone are allowed to view the audit logs.
