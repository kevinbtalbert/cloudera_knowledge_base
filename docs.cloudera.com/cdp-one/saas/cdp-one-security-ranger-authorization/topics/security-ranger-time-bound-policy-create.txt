Create a time-bound policy
Ranger policy validity periods enable you to configure a policy to be effective for a
        specified time range. You can add a validity period to both resource-based and tag-based
        policies.

Time-bound policy use-case examples:
To restrict access to sensitive financial information until the earnings
                        release date.
To block a certain user for a specific time period (e.g., a compromised user
                        account being investigated needs to be put on "hold" from accessing
                        resources in Hadoop services).
To block a certain group for a specific time (e.g., excluding temporary
                        employees from writing on resources during the holiday season).

noteThe following procedure shows how to create a time-bound resource-based policy. The
                procedure is essentially the same for a tag-based resource policy. 


On the Ranger Service Manger page, select a service, then click Add New
                        Policy.

Complete the fields on the Create Policy page.

Click Add Validity Period.

On the Policy Validity Period pop-up, specify a start
                    time, end time, and time zone. To add additional validity periods, click the
                        + symbol. Click Save to save the specified validity
                    periods.






If you would like the policy to override all other policies during its validity
                    period, select override. 






Click Add.
