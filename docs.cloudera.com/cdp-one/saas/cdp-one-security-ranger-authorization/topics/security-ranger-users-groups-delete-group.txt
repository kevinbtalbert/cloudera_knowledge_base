How to delete a group in Ranger.
Only users with the "admin" role can delete a group. 
Select Settings > Users/Groups/Roles, then click the
                  Groups tab.
The Groups page appears. 



Select the check box of the group you want to delete, then click the Delete icon
                  () at the right of the Group List menu
               bar.






Click OK on the confirmation pop-up.
Users in a deleted group will be reassigned to no group. You can edit these users and reassign
            them to other groups.
