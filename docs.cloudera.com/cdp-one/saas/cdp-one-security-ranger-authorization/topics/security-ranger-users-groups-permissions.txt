Administering Ranger Users, Groups, Roles, and Permissions
To view a list of the users, groups, and roles that can access the Ranger portal or
      its services, select Settings > Users/Groups/Roles from the Ranger top
      menu.
What is a Role ?
A role is a set of permissions that you assign to a user, group, or another role. You
            assign a role by adding a user, group or role to it. By adding multiple roles, you create a
            role hierarchy in which you manage permission sets at the role level. For example, your
            workflow to create a role hierarchy: 
Create a new role.
Add permissions to the role. For example, in Hadoop SQL, create a policy for a table
                  that provides necessary permissions and add the role in the
                  Role selector of Allow.
Repeat #2 until you have assigned all permissions.
Add users, groups, or other roles to the new role, which assigns the permission
                  set to that role.

Benefits that roles provide in a large environment:
A role may include many permissions, all of which may be granted or revoked to a
               user or group using a single command.
Adding or revoking a single permission to or from a role requires a single command,
               which also applies to all users and groups with that role.
Roles allow for some documentation about why a permission is granted or
               revoked.

In other words, a role is a collection of permissions. A group is a collection of users.
            You create a role and add permissions to it. Then, you grant that role to a group. Roles
            present an easier way to manage a set of permissions based on specific access
            criteria.

Example Ranger Role hierarchy
A simple example of a role heirarchy follows:
FinReadOnly role, which gives read permission on all tables in the Finance
                  database and is defined by a Ranger policy that grants read on database:Finance,
                  table:* to the FinReadOnly role.
FinWrite role, which gives write permission on all tables in the Finance database
                  and is defined by a Ranger policy that grants write on database:Finance, table:*
                  to the FinWrite role.
FinReadWrite role, which role is granted both the FinRead and FinWrite roles and
                  thereby inherites read and write permisssion to all tables in the Finance
                  database.
FinReporting group whose users require only read permission to the Finance
                  tables. FinReporting group is added to FinReadOnly role in Ranger.
FinDataPrep group whose users require only write permission to the Finance
                  tables. FinDataPrep group is added to the FinWrite role in Ranger.
FinPowerUser group whose users require read and write permission to all Finance
                  tables. FinPowerUsers group is added to the FinReadWrite role in Ranger. 


Overview of the Ranger Roles feature
The Users/Groups/Roles page lists:


Internal users who can log in to the Ranger portal; created by the Ranger console
                  Service Manager.


External users who can access services controlled by the Ranger portal; created at
                  other systems such as Active Directory, LDAP, or UNIX, and synched with those
                  systems.


Admin users who are the only users with permission to create users and services, run
                  reports, and perform other administrative tasks. Admin users can also create child
                  policies based on the original policy (base policy).

On the Groups page, you can click the people icons in the Users column to view the
               members of the applicable group.
On the Roles page, you can view the roles that have been mapped to users and groups. Roles are
                  application-managed and are easier to apply changes than users and groups.
