Example: Running SparkPi on YARN
 These examples demonstrate how to use
      spark-submit to submit the SparkPi Spark example
    application with various options. In the examples, the argument passed after
    the JAR controls how close to pi the approximation should be. 
 In a CDP deployment, SPARK_HOME defaults to
          /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/spark. The shells are
        also available from /bin. 

Running SparkPi in YARN Cluster Mode
 To run SparkPi in cluster mode:
spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi --master yarn \
--deploy-mode cluster /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/jars/spark-examples*.jar 10
 The command prints status until the job finishes or you press
          control-C. Terminating the
          spark-submit process in cluster mode does not
        terminate the Spark application as it does in client mode. To monitor
        the status of the running application, run yarn application
          -list. 

Running SparkPi in YARN Client Mode
 To run SparkPi in client mode:
spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi --master yarn \
--deploy-mode client SPARK_HOME/lib/spark-examples.jar 10

Running Python SparkPi in YARN Cluster Mode

 Unpack the Python examples archive:
          sudo su gunzip SPARK_HOME/lib/python.tar.gz
sudo su tar xvf SPARK_HOME/lib/python.tar

 Run the pi.py file:
          spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster SPARK_HOME/lib/pi.py 10
