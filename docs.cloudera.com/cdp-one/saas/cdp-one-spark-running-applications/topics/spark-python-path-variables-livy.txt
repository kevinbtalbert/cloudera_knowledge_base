Setting Python path variables for Livy

To change the Python executable used by a Livy session, follow the instructions for your
            version of Python.
pyspark
Livy reads the path from the PYSPARK_PYTHON environment variable (this
            is the same as PySpark).


If Livy is running in local mode, simply set the environment
                  variable (this is the same as PySpark).


If the Livy session is running in yarn-cluster mode,
                     setspark.yarn.appMasterEnv.PYSPARK_PYTHON in the
                     SparkConf file, so that the environment variable is passed to
                  the driver.


pyspark3
Livy reads the path from environment variable PYSPARK3_PYTHON.


If Livy is running in local mode, simply set the environment
                  variable.


If the Livy session is running in yarn-cluster mode,
                     setspark.yarn.appMasterEnv.PYSPARK3_PYTHON in
                     SparkConf file, so that the environment variable is passed to
                  the driver.
