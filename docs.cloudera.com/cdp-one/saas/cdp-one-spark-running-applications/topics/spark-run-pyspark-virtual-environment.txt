Running PySpark in a virtual environment

For many PySpark applications, it is sufficient to use --py-files to
        specify dependencies. However, there are times when --py-files is
        inconvenient, such as the following scenarios:


A large PySpark application has many dependencies, including transitive
            dependencies.


A large application needs a Python package that requires C code to be compiled before
            installation.


You want to run different versions of Python for different applications.


For these situations, you can create a virtual environment as an
        isolated Python runtime environment. CDP supports VirtualEnv for PySpark
        in both local and distributed environments, easing the transition from a
        local environment to a distributed environment.
note
This feature is currently only supported in YARN mode.
