Running Spark applications on YARN

 When Spark applications run on a YARN cluster manager, resource
      management, scheduling, and security are controlled by YARN. 

Spark on YARN deployment modesIn YARN, each application instance has an ApplicationMaster     process, which is the first container started for that application. The     application is responsible for requesting resources from the     ResourceManager. Once the resources are allocated, the application instructs     NodeManagers to start containers on its behalf. ApplicationMasters eliminate     the need for an active client: the process starting the application can     terminate, and coordination continues from a process managed by YARN running     on the cluster. Submitting Spark Applications to YARNMonitoring and Debugging Spark ApplicationsExample: Running SparkPi on YARN These examples demonstrate how to use       spark-submit to submit the SparkPi Spark example     application with various options. In the examples, the argument passed after     the JAR controls how close to pi the approximation should be. Configuring Spark on YARN ApplicationsDynamic allocation
