Using Livy with
      Spark


Scala Support

Livy supports Scala versions 2.10 and 2.11.
For default Scala builds, Spark 2.0 with Scala 2.11, Livy automatically detects the
            correct Scala version and associated jar files.
If you require a different Spark-Scala combination, such as Spark 2.0 with Scala 2.10,
            set livy.spark.scalaVersion to the desired version so that Livy uses
            the right jar files.
