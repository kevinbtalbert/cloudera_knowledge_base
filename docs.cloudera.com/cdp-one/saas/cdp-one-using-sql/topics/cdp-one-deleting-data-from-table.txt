Deleting data from a table
You use the DELETE statement to delete data already written to an ACID table from Hive. Impala does not support deletions of ACID data.    

            Use the following syntax to delete data from a Hive table. DELETE FROM tablename [WHERE expression];
            


Delete any rows of data from the students table if the gpa column has a value of 1 or 0.
Hive example:
                    DELETE FROM students WHERE gpa <= 1,0;
