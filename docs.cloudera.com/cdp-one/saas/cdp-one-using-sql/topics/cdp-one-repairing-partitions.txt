Repairing Hive or Impala partitions
Under certain conditions, you must manually repair metadata about Hive or Impala
        partitions. You learn when and how to do this.

Partition information in the metadata gets stale under the following
                    circumstances:
Hive: The dynamic partition refresh is disabled.
Impala: Data files are removed by a non-Impala mechanism, and the table
                        metadata is not updated
You must manually refresh metastore partition information when these conditions
                exist.
This task assumes you created a partitioned external table named
                students_part that stores partitions outside the warehouse. You remove one of the
                partition directories on the object store. This action renders the metastore
                inconsistent with S3. You repair the discrepancy manually to synchronize the
                metastore with S3 as follows;

HiveTo repair partition metadata, you run the MSCK (metastore consistency
                        check) Hive command to manually add partitions that are added to or removed
                        from the object store, but are not present in the Hive metastore.


ImpalaTo repair partition metadata, you run ALTER TABLE with
                        the RECOVER PARTITIONS clause to to find any new partition
                        directories and the data files.



Remove a partition directory, called engineering for example, from S3. 

In Hive or Impala, look at the students_part table partitions.
SHOW students_part PARTITIONS;The list of partitions
                    is stale in the metadata because it still includes the major=engineering
                    partition, so you must run MSCK to repair the
                    metadata.+-------------------+
|       major       |
+-------------------+
| major=engineering |
| major=humanities  |
| major=mathematics |
+-------------------+

Repair the partition.
Hive example:MSCK REPAIR TABLE students_part DROP PARTITIONS;
                Impala example: ALTER TABLE students_part RECOVER PARTITIONS;


Show that the repair succeeded.
SHOW PARTITIONS students_part;
The repair was successful. The sales partition no longer
                    appears.+-------------------+
|       major       |
+-------------------+
| major=humanities  |
| major=mathematics |
