Overview
CDP One provides two SQL engines for querying your
        data: Hive and Impala. For running simple queries, these SQL engines are very similar. You
        can quickly master using either engine if you are familiar with SQL. You see the minor
        differences in query examples, and can easily choose the one that suits your
        needs.
You can start Hive or Impala from the command line of the cluster or Hue to run queries.
