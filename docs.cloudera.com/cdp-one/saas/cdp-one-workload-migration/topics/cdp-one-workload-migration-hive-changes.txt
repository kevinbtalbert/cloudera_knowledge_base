Hive 1 and 2 to Hive 3 changes
A description of the change, the type of change, and the
      required refactoring provide the information you need for migrating from Hive 1 or 2 to Hive 3. 
In addition to the topics in this section that describe Hive changes, see the following documentation about changes applicable to CDH and HDP to prepare the workloads.


Hive Configuration Changes Requiring Consent


Unsupported Interfaces and Features



Reserved keywordsReserved words (also called keywords) have a predefined meaning and syntax in Hive.   These keywords have to be used to develop programming instructions. Reserved words cannot be used   as identifiers for other programming elements, such as the name of variable or   function.Spark-client JAR requires prefixThe Spark-client JAR should be prefixed with hive- to make sure the jar name is consistent across all Hive jars.  Hive warehouse directoryHive stores table files by default in the Hive Warehouse directory.Replace Hive CLI with BeelineBeeline is the new default command line SQL interface for Hive3.PARTIALSCANYou need to identify and apply configuration-level changes, including removing the   PARTIALSCAN optionConcatenation of an external tableIf the table or partition contains many small RCFiles or ORC files, then ALTER TABLE   table_name [PARTITION (partition_key = 'partition_value' [, ...])] CONCATENATE will merge them   into larger files. In the case of RCFile the merge happens at block level whereas for ORC files   the merge happens at stripe level thereby avoiding the overhead of decompressing and decoding the   dataINSERT OVERWRITEINSERT OVERWRITE from a source with UNION ALL is not all for some tables.Managed to external tableIn Hive1/2, a managed table can be converted to an external table by setting the   external property of the table as true. In Hive3 this is restricted.Parent topic: Migrating Hive and Impala workloads to CDP One
