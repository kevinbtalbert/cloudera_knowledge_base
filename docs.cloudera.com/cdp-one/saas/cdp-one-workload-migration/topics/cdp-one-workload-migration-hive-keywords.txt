Reserved keywords
Reserved words (also called keywords) have a predefined meaning and syntax in Hive.
  These keywords have to be used to develop programming instructions. Reserved words cannot be used
  as identifiers for other programming elements, such as the name of variable or
  function.
Hive 1 and 2
TIME, NUMERIC, SYNC are not reserved keywords.
Hive 3
TIME, NUMERIC, SYNC are reserved keywords.
Action Required
Reserved keywords are permitted as identifiers if you quote them. As an example, if in
   scripts there are identifiers like TIME, NUMERIC, SYNC use backtick `` to quote it like,
    `TIME`, `NUMERIC`, `SYNC`.
Distribution Affected
