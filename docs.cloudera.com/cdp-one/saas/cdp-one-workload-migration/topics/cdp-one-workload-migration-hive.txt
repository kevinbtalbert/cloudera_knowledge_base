Migrating Hive and Impala workloads to CDP One
You learn how to accelerate the migration process, to refactor Hive applications, and to
  handle semantic changes from Hive 1/2 to Hive 3. You get pointers to Impala documentation about
  workload migration and application refactoring.


Handling prerequisitesYou must perform a number of tasks before refactoring workloads.Hive 1 and 2 to Hive 3 changesA description of the change, the type of change, and the       required refactoring provide the information you need for migrating from Hive 1 or 2 to Hive 3. Property changes affecting ordered or sorted subqueries and viewsOrder by/sort by without limit in subqueries is not supported in Hive 3.Runtime configuration changesThere are a number of runtime configurations that Hive 3 does not support.Prepare Hive tables for migrationImpala changes from CDH to CDPCloudera documentation provides details about changes in Impala when migrating from    CDH 5.13-5.16 or CDH 6.1 or later to CDP.Impala configuration differences in CDH and CDPThere are some configuration differences related to Impala in CDH and CDP. These   differences are due to the changes made in CDP for the optimal interoperability between Hive and   Impala and an improved user experience.
