Impala changes in CDP:This document lists down the
    syntax, service, property and configuration changes that affect Impala after upgrade from CDH

       document explains the impact on Hive warehouse directory location for Impala managed and
       external tables.
     

Set Storage Engine ACLs : This document
       describes the steps to set ACLs for Impala to allow Impala to write to the Hive Warehouse
       Directory.
     

Automatic Invalidation/Refresh of Metadata: In
       CDP, HMS and file system metadata is automatically refreshed. This document provides the
       details of change in behavior for invalidation and refresh of metadata between CDH and
       CDP.
     

Metadata Improvements: In CDP, all

       properties in CDP that can be customized for better performance and scalability.
     

Default Managed Tables: In CDP, managed

       describes modifying file systems on a managed table in CDP and the methods to switch to the
       old CDH behavior.
     

Automatic Refresh of Tables on Impala Clusters:
       In CDP tables or partitions are refreshed automatically on other impala clusters, this
       document describes the property that enables this behavior.
     

Interoperability between Hive and Impala:This
       document describes the changes made in CDP for the optimal interoperability between Hive and
       Impala.
     

ORC Support Disabled for Full-Transactional
        Tables: In CDP 7.1.0 and earlier versions, ORC table support is disabled for
       Impala queries. However, you have an option to switch to the CDH behavior by using the
       command line argument ENABLE_ORC_SCANNER.
