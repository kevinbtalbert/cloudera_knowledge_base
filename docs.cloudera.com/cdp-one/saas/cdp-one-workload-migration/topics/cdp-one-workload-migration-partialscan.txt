PARTIALSCAN
You need to identify and apply configuration-level changes, including removing the
  PARTIALSCAN option
Hive 1 and 2
ANALYZE TABLE ... COMPUTE STATISTICS supports the PARTIALSCAN option.
Hive 3
ANALYZE TABLE ... COMPUTE STATISTICS does not support PARTIALSCAN, which is retired and throws error.
   
For example:
   ANALYZE TABLE test_groupby COMPUTE STATISTICS PARTIALSCAN;
Error: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: ParseException line 1:46 extraneous input 'PARTIALSCAN' expecting EOF near '<EOF>' (state=42000,code=40000)

Action Required
 Remove statements containing ALTER TABLE ... COMPUTE STATISTICS PARTIALSCAN. For example:
   ANALYZE TABLE test_groupby COMPUTE STATISTICS PARTIALSCAN;
Error: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: ParseException line 1:46 extraneous input 'PARTIALSCAN' expecting EOF near '<EOF>' (state=42000,code=40000) Distribution Affected
CDH5, CDH6, HDP2.
