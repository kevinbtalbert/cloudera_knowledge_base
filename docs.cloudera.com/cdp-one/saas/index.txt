Release Notes


CDP One is an all-in-one data lakehouse software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering that enables fast and easy self-service analytics and exploratory data science on any type of data.
A simple yet powerful cloud service, CDP One has built-in enterprise security and machine learning (ML) that requires zero cloud, security, or monitoring operations staff for lower TCO and reduced risk.
Designed to make both data practitioners and expert developers more productive, CDP One helps you achieve faster time to business insights to drive innovation and stay ahead of the competition.
CDP One provides you with dedicated, private, and secure CDP environments, so you can focus on building your data applications and not on setting up and maintaining your infrastructure.
Legacy CDH and HDP customers can migrate their on-prem workloads to CDP One to take advantage of cloud features and benefits, while avoiding cloud provider lock-in. New customers can also take advantage of the data management and analytic features of the cloud-agnostic CDP One services.
