You can produce messages to and consume messages from a Kafka cluster using the command
    line. For most cases however, running Kafka producers and consumers using shell scripts and
    Kafkaâ€™s command line scripts cannot be used in practice. In these cases, built-in Kafka client
    development is the generally accepted option. Review these code example to better understand how
    you can develop your own clients using the Cloudera .Net client library.
