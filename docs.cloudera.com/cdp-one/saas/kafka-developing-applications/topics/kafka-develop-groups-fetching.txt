Groups and fetching
Learn more about  how consumer groups fetch messages.
Kafka consumers are usually assigned to a group. This happens statically by setting the
        group.id configuration property in the consumer configuration. Consuming
      with groups will result in the consumers balancing the load in the group. That means each
      consumer will have their fair share of partitions. Also it can never be more consumers than
      partitions as that way there would be idling consumers. 
As shown in the figure below, both consumer groups share the partitions and each partition
      multicasts messages to both consumer groups. The consumers pull messages from the broker
      instead of the broker periodically pushing what is available. This helps the consumer as it
      won’t be overloaded and it can query the broker at its own speed. Furthermore, to avoid tight
      looping, it uses a so called “long-poll”. The consumer sends a fetch request to poll for data
      and receives a reply only when enough data accumulates on the broker.
