Retries
Learn more about retries and how they are constrained.
 In Kafka retries typically happen  only for certain kinds of errors. When a retriable error
      is returned, the clients are constrained by two facts: the timeout period and the backoff
      period. 
The timeout period tells how long the consumer can retry the operation. The backoff period
      how often the consumer should retry. There is no generic approach for "number of retries."
      Number of retries are usually controlled by timeout periods.
