Learn how to modify Kafka topics by using Streams Messaging Manager (SMM)
        UI.
You can modify Kafka topic properties by navigating to the

                Configs tab of the topic
            Profile.

Navigate to the Topics page and select the topic you
                    want to modify.

Select the Profile icon.

You may update the Cleanup Policy or click
                        Advanced to modify the configuration
                    parameters.

Click Save when you have completed your updateds.
