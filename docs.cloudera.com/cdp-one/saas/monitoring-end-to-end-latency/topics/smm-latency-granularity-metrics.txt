Granularity of metrics for end-to-end latency
Learn how often Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) queries and retrieves latency metrics
  data from the REST API server.
SMM uses the REST API to display metrics. All the metrics are available for querying at two
   different granularities: 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The metrics are pre-aggregated for the
   defined buckets. Depending on how long the data is queried, granularity and varying dimensions of
   the topic, partition, consumer group ID and client ID, the data is calculated and rendered as
   JSON. Go through the following details before you start monitoring latency using SMM:
When you select a period newer than current time by 24 hours, the data is retrieved from
     REST server with metrics granularity of 30 seconds.
When you select a period older than current time by 24 hours, the data is retrieved from
     REST server with metrics granularity of 15 minutes.
SMM UI polls the API for updates periodically (every 30 seconds if the selected period is
     newer than current time by 24 hours and every 15 minutes otherwise).
By default, the 30 seconds granularity metrics are stored for 24 hours and the 15 minutes
     granularity metrics are stored for 2 weeks.

For information on REST APIs used in SMM, see the REST API Reference guide.
