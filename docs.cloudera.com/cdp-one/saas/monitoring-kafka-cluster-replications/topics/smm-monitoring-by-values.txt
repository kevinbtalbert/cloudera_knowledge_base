Monitoring replication throughput and latency by values
Learn how to fetch the average, maximum, and minimum values for throughput, replication
    latency, and checkpoint latency of a Kafka cluster replication in Streams Messaging Manager
    (SMM).
You can do this at the following levels:
Cluster Replication LevelClick the AVG, MAX, or MIN buttons, as shown in the following
            image, to fetch average, maximum, or minimum values of throughput, replication latency,
            and checkpoint latency for cluster replications.


Topic LevelClick the AVG, MAX, or MIN buttons, as shown in the following image, to fetch
            average, maximum, or minimum values of throughput, replication latency, and checkpoint
            latency for topics.
