Monitoring checkpoint latency for cluster replication
Learn how to monitor the checkpoint latency of a Kafka cluster replication in Streams
        Messaging Manager (SMM). You can monitor average, maximum, and minimum checkpoint latency of
        a cluster replication. You can also monitor the checkpoint latency of a cluster replication
        graphically.
Checkpoint latency is defined as the amount of time taken for a message of a topic to
      checkpoint on the target cluster after the message is committed on the source cluster.
      Checkpoint latency is measured in milliseconds.


In the image, you can see the average checkpoint latency for the CDFCluster to CDFClusterDR
      replication is 4.6 milliseconds. You can fetch the maximum or minimum replication latency for
      the replication by clicking the MAX or MIN button located above the cluster
        replication.noteIf the checkpoint latency for a cluster replication or a topic appears as
        Not Available, then that means there are no consumer groups defined.
