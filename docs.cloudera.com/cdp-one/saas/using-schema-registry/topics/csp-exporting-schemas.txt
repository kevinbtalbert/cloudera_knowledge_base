Exporting schemas using Schema Registry API
One of the methods of exporting schemas registered in Schema Registry into a JSON
        file is using the Schema Registry API. The file that you export can be used to import the
        exported schemas into a different Schema Registry. You can also export schemas using
            curl through the command line.

The following steps walk you through how you can export schemas by using the Schema
                Registry Swagger UI. 




Ensure that the cluster, its hosts, and all its services are healthy.
Ensure that Schema Registry is commissioned and running.
Ensure that you have access to all credentials that are required to access
                        and use Schema Registry.
If you are using the Swagger UI on a Kerberos enabled
                        Schema Registry service, ensure that the browser you are using is configured
                        to use Kerberos.
Ensure that you are logged in as a user with
                        access to the CDP environment containing the cluster with Schema
                        Registry.




In Management Console, go to Data Hub clusters.

Find and select the Data Hub cluster you want to export schemas from.

Under Services, click Schema
                        Registry.
The Schema Registry web UI opens in a new tab.

In the tab that has the Schema Registry web UI open, replace
                        /ui/# at the end of the URL with
                    /swagger.

Select GET
                    /api/v1/schemaregistry/schemas/aggregated.

Click Try it out.

Click Execute.

Click Download found at the bottom right of the
                        Response body pane to download the exported
                    schemas.

All schemas stored in the Schema Registry server are exported to a JSON
            file.
