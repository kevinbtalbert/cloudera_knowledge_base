Setting a Schema Registry ID range
Learn how to set an ID range for schemas in Schema Registry using Cloudera
        Manager.

An ID range that is unique to a Schema Registry instance can be set in Cloudera
                Manager on the Schema Registry serviceâ€™s configuration page. Configuring an ID range
                does not alter already existing schemas.




Ensure that the cluster, its hosts, and all its services are healthy.
Ensure that Schema Registry is commissioned and running.
Ensure that you have access to all credentials that are required to access
                        and use Schema Registry.
Plan ahead and designate ID ranges for each Schema Registry instance. Ensure
                        that the planned ranges do not overlap.
Ensure that the ID range you plan to configure has enough IDs. Base the size
                        of your range on the approximate number of schemas you expect to have. 




In Cloudera Manager, select the Schema Registry service.

Go to Configuration.

Find and configure the following properties:


ID Offset Range Minimum
ID Offset Range Maximum



Configure the properties according to your planned ID ranges. For example, if
                        you want to have an ID range of 1-100, set ID Offset Range
                            Minimum to 1 and ID Offset Range
                            Maximum to 100.


Click Save Changes.

Restart Schema Registry.

When new schemas are added, either through the UI or the API, the schema IDs are
            allocated from the configured range.
