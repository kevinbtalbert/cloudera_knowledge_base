Use the HBase REST server
You can use the Apache HBase REST server to interact with the Apache HBase. This is a
        very good alternative if you do not want to use the Java API. Interactions happen using URLs
        and the REST API. REST uses HTTP to perform various actions, and this makes it easy to
        interface with the operational database using a wide array of programming
        languages.
You can use the REST server to create, delete tables, and perform other operations that
            have the REST end-points. You can configure SSL for encryption between the client and
            the REST server. This helps you to ensure that your operations are secure during data
            transmission.
Using the REST server enables you access your data across different network boundaries.
            For example, if you have an CDP operational database Data Hub cluster running inside a
            private network and don’t want to expose it to your company’s public network, the REST
            server can work as a gateway between the private and public networks.

Installing the REST Server using Cloudera ManagerYou can use the HBase REST API to interact with HBase services, tables, and regions         using HTTP endpoints. You must manually install the REST Server only in a CDP Private Cloud Base          deployment. The REST Server service is automatically added to the Data Hub cluster in a CDP         Public Cloud deployment. Using the REST APIThe HBase REST Server exposes endpoints that provide CRUD (create, read, update,       delete) operations for each HBase process, as well as tables, regions, and namespaces. Using the REST proxy APIAfter configuring and starting HBase on your cluster, you can use the HBase REST Proxy     API to stream data into HBase, from within another application or shell script, or by using an     HTTP client such as wget or curl.
