Using the Apache HBase Hive integration
You can use the HBase Hive integration to create HBase tables and modify Apache HBase
        tables from Apache Hive.
HBase Hive integration enables you to READ and WRITE to existing HBase tables. Before you
            can access your data stored in HBase using Hive, ensure that you have completed the
            configuration that enables Apache Hive to interact with Apache HBase.
