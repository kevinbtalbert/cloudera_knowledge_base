Installing the REST Server using Cloudera Manager
You can use the HBase REST API to interact with HBase services, tables, and regions
        using HTTP endpoints. You must manually install the REST Server only in a CDP Private Cloud Base 
        deployment. The REST Server service is automatically added to the Data Hub cluster in a CDP
        Public Cloud deployment. 

Install the REST Server using Cloudera Manager in your CDP Private Cloud Base
