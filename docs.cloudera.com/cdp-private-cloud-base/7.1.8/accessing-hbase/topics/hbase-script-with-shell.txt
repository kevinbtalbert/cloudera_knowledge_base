Script with HBase Shell
You can use HBase shell in your scripts. You can also write Ruby scripts for use with
    HBase Shell. Example Ruby scripts are included in the
      hbase-examples/src/main/ruby/ directory. The non-interactive mode allows you to use HBase Shell in scripts, and allow the script to access
      the exit status of the HBase Shell commands. To invoke non-interactive mode, use the
        -n or --non-interactive switch. This small example script
      shows how to use HBase Shell in a Bash script.#!/bin/bash
echo 'list' | hbase shell -n
status=$?
if [$status -ne 0]; then
  echo "The command may have failed."
fiSuccessful HBase Shell commands return an exit status of 0. However, an
        exit status other than 0 does not necessarily indicate a failure, but
        should be interpreted as unknown. For example, a command may succeed,
        but while waiting for the response, the client may lose connectivity. In
        that case, the client has no way to know the outcome of the command. In
        the case of a non-zero exit status, your script should check to be sure
        the command actually failed before taking further action.You can use the get_splits command, which returns the split points for a
      given
      table:hbase> get_splits 't2'
Total number of splits = 5

=> ["", "10", "20", "30", "40"]
