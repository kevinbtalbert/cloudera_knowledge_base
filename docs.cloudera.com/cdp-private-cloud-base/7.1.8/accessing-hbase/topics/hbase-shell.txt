Use the HBase shell
You can use the HBase Shell from the command line interface to communicate with HBase.
    In CDP, you can create a namespace and manage it using the HBase shell. Namespaces contain
    collections of tables and permissions, replication settings, and resource isolation.
In CDP, you need to SSH into an HBase node before you can use the HBase Shell. For example,
      to SSH into an HBase node with the IP address 10.10.10.10, you must use the command:
      ssh <username>@10.10.10.10 
noteYou must use your IPA password for authentication. After you have started HBase,
      you can access the database in an interactive way by using the HBase Shell, which is a command
      interpreter for HBase which is written in Ruby. Always run HBase administrative commands such
      as the HBase Shell, hbck, or bulk-load commands as the HBase user (typically
        hbase).
hbase shell
You can use the following commands to get started with the HBase shell: 
To get help and to see all available commands, use the help
          command.
To get help on a specific command, use help "command". For
          example: hbase> help "create"
To remove an attribute from a table or column family or reset it to its default value,
          set its value to nil. For example, use the following command to remove
          the KEEP_DELETED_CELLS attribute from the f1 column of
          the users
          table:hbase> alter 'users', { NAME => 'f1', KEEP_DELETED_CELLS => nil }
To exit the HBase Shell, type quit.


Virtual machine options for HBase ShellYou can set variables for the virtual machine running HBase Shell, by using the     HBASE_SHELL_OPTS environment variable. This example sets several options in the virtual     machine.Script with HBase ShellYou can use HBase shell in your scripts. You can also write Ruby scripts for use with     HBase Shell. Example Ruby scripts are included in the       hbase-examples/src/main/ruby/ directory.
