Property
Default value (secured)
Default value (unsecured)
Description



hbase.thrift.support.proxyuser
true
true
Use this to allow proxy users on the thrift gateway, which is mainly needed
                  for doAs functionality.


hbase.regionserver.thrift.framed
true
true
Use framed transport. When using the THsHaServer or
                    TNonblockingServer, framed transport is always used
                  irrespective of this configuration value.


hbase.regionserver.thrift.compact
true
true
Use the TCompactProtocol instead of the default
                    TBinaryProtocol. TCompactProtocol is a
                  binary protocol that is more compact than the default and typically more
                  efficient.


hbase.regionserver.thrift.http
true
true
Use this to enable HTTP server usage on thrift, which is mainly needed for
                    doAs functionality.


hbase.thrift.security.qop
auth_conf
none
If this is set, HBase Thrift Server authenticates its clients. HBase Proxy
                  User Hosts and Groups must be configured to allow specific users to access HBase
                  through Thrift Server.


hbase.thrift.ssl.enabled 
true
false
Encrypt communication between clients and HBase Thrift Server over HTTP using
                  Transport Layer Security (TLS) (formerly known as Secure Socket Layer
                  (SSL)).
