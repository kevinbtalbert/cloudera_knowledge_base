Configure HBase-Spark connector using Cloudera Manager
You can use HBase-Spark connector on your secure cluster to perform READ and WRITE
        operations. The HBase-Spark Connector bridges the gap between the simple HBase Key Value
        store and complex relational SQL queries and enables users to perform complex data analytics
        on top of HBase using Spark. 
An HBase DataFrame is a standard Spark DataFrame, and is able to interact with
            any other data sources such as Hive, ORC, Parquet, or JSON.
