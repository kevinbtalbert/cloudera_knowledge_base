Using the REST proxy API
After configuring and starting HBase on your cluster, you can use the HBase REST Proxy
    API to stream data into HBase, from within another application or shell script, or by using an
    HTTP client such as wget or curl. The REST Proxy API is slower than the Java API and may have fewer features. This approach
      is simple and does not require advanced development experience to implement. However, like the
      Java and Thrift Proxy APIs, it uses the full write path and can cause compactions and region
      splits.Specified addresses without existing data create new values. Specified addresses
        with existing data create new versions, overwriting an existing version
        if the row, column:qualifier, and timestamp all match that of the
        existing value.curl -H "Content-Type: text/xml" http://localhost:8000/test/testrow/test:testcolumnThe REST Proxy API does not support writing to HBase clusters that are secured
        using Kerberos.For full documentation and more examples, see the
        REST
        Proxy API documentation.
