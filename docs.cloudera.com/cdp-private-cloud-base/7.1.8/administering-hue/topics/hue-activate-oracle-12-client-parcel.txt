        distribution does not contain the Oracle Instant Client parcel. You must download the Oracle
        Instant Client library 19.16 (both basic and SDK clients) from the Oracle
        website.

noteHue on CDP 7.1.8 and higher supports Oracle Database Server versions 12.2 and
                higher.


SSH into the Hue server host as a root user.

Change directory to /usr/share/oracle.

Decompress the downloaded basic and SDK files as follows:

unzip /tmp/instantclient-basiclite-linux.x64-19.16.0.0.0dbru.zip -d .
unzip /tmp/instantclient-sdk-linux.x64-19.16.0.0.0dbru.zip -d .


Set the ORACLE_HOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables as follows:

export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/share/oracle/instantclient;
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/share/oracle/instantclient:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;
