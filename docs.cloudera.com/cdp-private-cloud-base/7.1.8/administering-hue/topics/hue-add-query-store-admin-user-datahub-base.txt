Adding Query Processor Administrator
            users and groups on Private Cloud Base clusters
Query Processor Administrators have special privileges that enable them to view and
        monitor queries from all users, including the ones that are submitted from query interfaces,
        such as Beeline, Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC), Tableau, and so on.
This task is applicable only if you are running Hive queries.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Query Processor > Configuration and enter the list of users in the Extra Auth
                        Options field as follows:
"adminUsers": "hive, [***USER-1***],
                    [***USER-2***]"
You can also add a list of admin groups as follows:
"adminGroups": "admin-group, [***GROUP-1***],
                        [***GROUP-2***]"

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Query Processor service.
