(Optional) Configuring the character set
AL16UTF16 is the default value of the National Character Set (NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET)
        for the Oracle database. Cloudera recommends that you use the default
        NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET. However, if needed, you can configure the National Character Set to
        UTF-8.

Log in as the oracle user:

su - oracle


Start the listener control (as user oracle):

$ORACLE_HOME/bin/lsnrctl start


Log in to SQL*Plus:

sqlplus / as sysdba


Check whether the character set is AL32UTF8 and national character set is
                    UTF8:

SELECT * FROM v$nls_parameters where parameter like '%CHARACTERSET';

To update, quit the shell and run these commands in a SQL*Plus script:
                    vi alter_charset.ddl## Save in alter_charset.ddl (script takes 2-3 minutes)
CONNECT / as sysdba
SHUTDOWN immediate
STARTUP mount
ALTER SYSTEM ENABLE RESTRICTED SESSION;
ALTER SYSTEM SET JOB_QUEUE_PROCESSES=0 SCOPE = MEMORY;
ALTER SYSTEM SET AQ_TM_PROCESSES=0 SCOPE = MEMORY;
ALTER DATABASE OPEN;
ALTER DATABASE CHARACTER SET AL32UTF8;
ALTER DATABASE NATIONAL CHARACTER SET INTERNAL_USE UTF8;
SHUTDOWN immediate
STARTUP

sqlplus /nolog < alter_charset.ddl
