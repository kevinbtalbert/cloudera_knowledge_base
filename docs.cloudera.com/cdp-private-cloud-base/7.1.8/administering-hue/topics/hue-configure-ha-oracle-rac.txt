You must have Oracle RAC installed on your CDP cluster.
You must have configured Oracle as Hue’s backend database.



Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue > Configuration > Category > Database.
The database configurations are displayed.

Specify the database name in the following format in the Hue
                        Database Name field:

(DESCRIPTION=(LOAD_BALANCE=off)(FAILOVER=on)(CONNECT_TIMEOUT=5)(TRANSPORT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=3)(RETRY_COUNT=3)(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=[***HOSTNAME-OR-SCAN-IP***])(PORT=[***PORT***]))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=[***SERVICE-NAME***])))


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
