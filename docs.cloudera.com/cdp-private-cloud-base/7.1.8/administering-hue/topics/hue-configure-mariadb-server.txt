Configuring MariaDB server
You can custom configure the MariaDB database by configuring the MariaDB server with
        the option files. The default MariaDB option file is called my.cnf on Unix-like operating
        systems.

SSH into the database server host as a root user.

Open the my.cnf file for editing in an editor such as vi or
                    nano:
On RHEL/CentOS/SLES:vi /etc/my.cnf
On Debian/Ubuntu:vi /etc/mysql/my.cnf

Ensure that the bind-address property is set to
                        0.0.0.0 or is commented out in case of a default
                    value.

bind-address=0.0.0.0


Ensure that the default-storage-engine property is set to
                        innodb.

[mysqld]
default-storage-engine=innodb


Ensure that the sql_mode property is set to
                        STRICT_ALL_TABLES to avoid columns being truncated during
                    migration.

sql_mode=STRICT_ALL_TABLES


Save the file and exit.

Restart the database server.

Enable the database server to automatically start on system boot:
On RHEL/CentOS:sudo systemctl enable mariadb
On SLES:sudo systemctl enable mariadb
On Ubuntu, MariaDB starts automatically after installation. Run the following
                    command to check the
                    status:sudo systemctl status mariadb
On Debian, MariaDB starts automatically after installation. Run the following
                    command to check the
                    status:sudo systemctl status mariadb
