Configuring MySQL server
The MySQL server, mysqld, has many command options and system variables that can be
        set at
        startup
        to configure its operation. The configurations are stored in the my.cnf file.

SSH into the database server host as a root user.

Open the my.cnf file for editing in an editor such as vi or
                    nano:
On RHEL/CentOS/SLES:vi /etc/my.cnf
On Debian/Ubuntu:vi /etc/mysql/my.cnf

Ensure that the bind-address property is set to
                        0.0.0.0 or is commented out
                    if
                    case of a default value.

bind-address=0.0.0.0


Ensure that the default-storage-engine property is set to
                        innodb, which is the default
                    storage
                    engine in
                    MySQL
                    versions 5.5 and higher.

default-storage-engine=innodb


Ensure that the sql_mode property is set to
                        STRICT_ALL_TABLES to avoid columns being truncated during
                    migration.

sql_mode=STRICT_ALL_TABLES


Save the file and exit.

Restart the database server.

Enable the server to automatically start on boot:
On RHEL/CentOS:sudo chkconfig mysqld on
On
                    SLES:sudo chkconfig mysql on
sudo rcmysql status
On Ubuntu, MySQL starts automatically after installation. Run the following
                    command to check the
                    status:sudo service mysql status
On Debian, MySQL starts automatically after installation. Run the following
                    command to check the
                    status:sudo service mysql status
