Configuring Oracle as backend database for Hue
You can configure Oracle as the backend database for Hue after you have downloaded,
        distributed, activated the Oracle Instant Client parcel either using Oracle Service Name or
        SID.

Log into Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Category > Database.
All the database configurations for Hue are displayed.

Select Oracle as the Hue Database
                        Type.

Specify the host on which you have installed the Oracle database in the
                        Hue Database Hostname field.

Enter 1521 in the Hue Database
                        Port field.

Enter user name and password in Hue Database Username
                    and Hue Database Password fields.

Specify the database name in the Hue Database Name
                    field.
If you are using Oracle Service Name instead of SID, then specify the database
                    name in the following format:
                    [***HUE-DB-HOST***]:1521/[***SERVICE-NAME***]
You can also configure additional parameters by entering the following in the
                        Hue Database Name field:
                    (DESCRIPTION=(LOAD_BALANCE=off)(FAILOVER=on)(CONNECT_TIMEOUT=5)(TRANSPORT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=3)(RETRY_COUNT=3)(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=[***HUE-DB-HOST***])(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=[***SERVICE-NAME***])))

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Service Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                            Valve) and add the following parameters:
Key: LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Value:
                        /opt/cloudera/parcels/ORACLE_INSTANT_CLIENT/[***INSTANT-CLIENT-WITH-VERSION***]
Key: ORACLE_HOME
Value:
                        /opt/cloudera/parcels/ORACLE_INSTANT_CLIENT/[***INSTANT-CLIENT-WITH-VERSION***]
For example:
                        /opt/cloudera/parcels/ORACLE_INSTANT_CLIENT/instantclient_12_2
You can obtain the value of the Instant Client version by running the
                    following command from the Cloudera Manager server terminal
                        /opt/cloudera/parcels/ directory:
                    ls -al ORACLE_INSTANT_CLIENT/
If you have manually set the values for LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
                        ORACLE_HOME, then specify those.

Add support for a multi-threaded environment by adding the following lines in
                    the Hue Service Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                        Valve) field under the [desktop] section:

[desktop]
[[database]]
options={"threaded":true}

A multi-threaded environment is recommended for using the Oracle
                    database.
If you are using Oracle Service Name instead of SID, then add the following
                    line under the [desktop] section in the Hue Service
                        Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        hue_safety_valve.ini field:
                    [desktop]
[[database]]
port=0

Click Save Changes and restart the Hue service.

If the database setup is successful and Hue starts without
            errors, then you should be able to log into the Hue web interface and view the
            database/tables.
