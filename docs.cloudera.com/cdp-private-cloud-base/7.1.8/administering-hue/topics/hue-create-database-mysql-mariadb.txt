Creating the Hue database
Hue requires a SQL database to store small amounts of data, including user account
        information as well as the history of queries and sharing permissions. You must create a
        database for Hue with UTF-8 character set and grant user
        privileges.

SSH into the database server host as the root user.

Create a database for Hue with UTF-8 collation and grant user privileges:

CREATE DATABASE [***HUE-DATABASE-NAME***] DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
GRANT ALL ON [***HUE-DATABASE-NAME***].* TO '[***HUE-DATABASE-NAME***]'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '[***PASSWORD***]';

Replace [***HUE-DATABASE-NAME***] with the actual Hue database name such as
                    "hue".
Ensure Hue uses UTF-8 collation and character
                    set.# To create (use utf8_general_ci or utf8mb4_general_ci):
CREATE DATABASE [***HUE-DATABASE-NAME***] COLLATE = 'utf8_general_ci';

# To view default_character_set_name and default_collation_name
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA;

# To alter if not created with UTF8 collation
ALTER DATABASE [***HUE-DATABASE-NAME***] COLLATE = 'utf8_general_ci';

Verify the connection to the Hue database by running the following
                    command:

mysql -u [***HUE-DATABASE-NAME***] -p
Enter password: [***PASSWORD***]
