Creating Hue Schema in Oracle database
Hue requires a SQL database to store small amounts of data, including user account
        information as well as the history of queries and sharing permissions. Ensure that tables in
        the Hue schema are not compressed.

Due to a known bug in the Oracle database (12c and higher), you cannot alter a table
                if it is compressed. If you have compressed tables in the Hue schema, then you may
                see the “ORA-39726: unsupported add/drop column operation on compressed tables”
                error. Even if you uncompress an existing table, you may not be allowed to alter the
                columns. To resolve this, follow the below steps: 
Create a new uncompressed table with the same structure as the compressed
                        table.
Copy the data from the compressed table to the new uncompressed table.
Rename or delete the compressed table.
Rename the uncompressed table with the name of the original compressed
                        table.



Create the Hue schema, set quotas, and grant select permissions (do not grant
                    all).

noteOracle 12c users must ALTER session set to avoid
                        creating a common user with the prefix,
                        c##.


vi create_hue_database.ddl
Save in create_hue_database.ddl
## Change huepassword to something more secure
CONNECT / as sysdba
ALTER session set "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=true;

DROP user hue cascade;
CREATE user hue identified by huepassword;
ALTER user hue quota 1000m on users;
ALTER user hue quota 100m on system;
GRANT create sequence to hue;
GRANT create session to hue;
GRANT create table to hue;
GRANT create view to hue;
GRANT create procedure to hue;
GRANT create trigger to hue;
GRANT execute on sys.dbms_crypto to hue;
GRANT execute on sys.dbms_lob to hue;
sqlplus /nolog < create_hue_database.ddl


Verify that you can connect to Hue by running the following command:

sqlplus hue/[***HUE-PASSWORD***]


Clean all Hue user tables. Create a script to spool delete statements into a
                    new file.

delete_from_tables.ddl
vi spool_statements.ddl
## Save in spool_statements.ddl (which generates delete_from_tables.ddl)
spool delete_from_tables.ddl
set pagesize 100;
SELECT 'DELETE FROM ' || table_name || ';' FROM user_tables;
commit;
spool off
quit
## Create delete_from_tables.ddl
sqlplus hue/[***HUE-PASSWORD***] < spool_statements.ddl

## Run delete_from_tables.ddl
sqlplus hue/[***HUE-PASSWORD***] < delete_from_tables.ddl
