Backing up the Hue database
Cloudera Manager provides you (the Hue service administrator) an option to easily
        back up your database without the need to engage your database administrators or perform
        this operation
        manually.

You may have the need to back up the Hue database before upgrading or migrating to a
                new database, or for any other purposes. You can do so from Cloudera Manager as
                follows:


Log in to Cloudera Manager as Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service.

Stop the Hue service by clicking Actions > Stop.

After the Hue service has successfully stopped, click Actions > Dump Databse.

On the Dump Database popup, click Dump
                        Databse to confirm the operation.
The database dump is written to the
                        /tmp/hue_database_dump.json file on the Hue server
                    host.

Start the Hue service by clicking Actions > Start.
