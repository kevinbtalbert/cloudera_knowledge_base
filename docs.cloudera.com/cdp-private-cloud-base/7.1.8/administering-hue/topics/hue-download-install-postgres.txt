Download and install PostgreSQL
RHEL and CentOS 7 include PostgreSQL version 9.2. However, on these OS versions, Hue
        is compatible only with PostgreSQL versions 10, 11.x, 12, 13 and 14. Therefore, you must
        download and install the PostgreSQL distribution separately.
For supported PostgreSQL versions and compatibility
            information, see https://supportmatrix.cloudera.com/.

Download the PostgreSQL distribution from https://www.postgresql.org/download/
                    based on your OS version.

Install the PostgreSQL server using the following command:

sudo yum install postgresql-server
