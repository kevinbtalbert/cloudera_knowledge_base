Enabling DEBUG
DEBUG is available for the Hue Django logs in /var/log/hue. By default, the Hue
        service writes INFO level messages and keeps a small buffer of log messages at all levels in
        memory.

In the debug mode, Django displays a detailed traceback when an exception occurs.
                Debugging information may contain sensitive data.
noteDjango logs every SQL query it executes in the debug mode. This could rapidly
                increase memory consumption.
You can enable DEBUG messages for all the logs in
                    var/log/hue from Cloudera Manager or from the Hue web
                UI.
