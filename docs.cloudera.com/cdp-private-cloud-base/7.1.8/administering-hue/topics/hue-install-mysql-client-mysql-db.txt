Installing MySQL client for MySQL databases
CDP uses Python version 3.8. To use MySQL as a backend database for Hue, you must
  install the MySQL client and other required dependencies on all the Hue hosts based on your
  operating system.
noteThe version 2.2.0 of the MySQL client requires that
   you set the values of the MYSQLCLIENT_CFLAGS and
    MYSQLCLIENT_LDFLAGS environment variables, as
    follows:$ export MYSQLCLIENT_CFLAGS=`pkg-config mysqlclient --cflags`
$ export MYSQLCLIENT_LDFLAGS=`pkg-config mysqlclient --libs`The version 2.2.0 of
    the MySQL client also requires you to install the Python 3 and MySQL development headers and
    libraries, as follows on Debian or Ubuntu operating
    systems:sudo apt-get install python3-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev build-essentialor
    as follows on CentOS and RHEL operating
    systems:sudo yum install python3-devel mysql-develAlternatively,
    you can install and use the version 2.1.1 of the MySQL client, as follows, which does not have
    this
    requirement:pip3 install mysqlclient=2.1.1
