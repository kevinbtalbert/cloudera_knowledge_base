Hue logs
Cloudera Manager generates standard stream logs when each Hue role instance starts and
   stops. The Hue service, which is built on the Django framework, generates log4j logs when the service is running.
Standard stream logsCloudera Manager logs the start and stop of each supervised Hue process in standard   stream logs (stdout.log, stderr.log).Hue service Django logsWhen the Hue service is running, Hue generates logs in /var/log/hue using log4j. Load   balancer logs are in /var/run/httpd. You can view these logs in Hue at   http://hueserver:port/logs.Enabling DEBUGDEBUG is available for the Hue Django logs in /var/log/hue. By default, the Hue         service writes INFO level messages and keeps a small buffer of log messages at all levels in         memory.Enabling httpd log rotation for HueSeveral log files, such as access logs and error logs, are produced by the Apache         HTTP server. Over time, these files can grow in size and can cause disk issues. You can         prevent this problem by using Apache's rotatelogs utility and defining when to rotate logs â€“         either based on a time interval or maximum size of the log.
