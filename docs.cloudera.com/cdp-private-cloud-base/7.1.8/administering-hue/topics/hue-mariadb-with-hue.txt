Using MariaDB database with Hue
Hue is packaged with a lightweight embedded PostgreSQL database for proof-of-concept
  deployments with one Hue server. However, you can install and use a custom MariaDB database as the
  backend database to store Hue metadata, job and query history, and account
  information.
MariaDB is a fork of the MySQL relational database. Refer to the MariaDB documentation for
   information on how to install the database.
