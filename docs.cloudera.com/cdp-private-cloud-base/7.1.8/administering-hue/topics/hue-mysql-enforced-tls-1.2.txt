Configuring MySQL server enforced with TLS 1.2 or higher to connect to
        Hue
If
        your MySQL server is configured to use TLS version 1.2 or higher for an encrypted connection
        with Hue, then you may not be able to start the Hue server and the Kerberos ticket renewer.
        One solution to fix this problem is to upgrade the MySQL client to version
        8.

One of the errors you may see while connecting to Hue if your MySQL server is
                configured with TLS 1.2 or higher is: “The health test result for
                HUE_SERVER_SCM_HEALTH has become bad: This role's process failed to start.” The
                error might be because the MySQL-Python module for Hue that is shipped with CDP uses
                an older libmysqlclient library which does not support TLS 1.2 and higher.
importantYou must install MySQL database version 8.x to use TLS
                1.2-enforced MySQL server with Hue because it uses a newer libmysqlclient library,
                which supports TLS 1.2 and higher.


SSH into the Hue server host as a root user.

Change directory to /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/ and take a
                    backup of the config.ini file.

Run the following command to get a list of all the installed MySQL
                    packages:

rpm -qa | grep -i mysql*

Save the list of all the installed MySQL packages for future reference.

Remove all MySQL Community RPM packages and the Cloudera Manager agent:

yum erase mysql-community*|cloudera-manager-agent

Uninstalling the Cloudera Manager agent also uninstalls the MySQL-python
                    library. Save the list of all the MySQL packages that are uninstalled for future
                    reference.

Reinstall the Cloudera Manager agent as follows:

yum -y install cloudera-manager-agent

Remove the existing _mysql.so file:

rm -rf /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-[***7.x-VERSION***]/lib/hue/build/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/_mysql.so


Change directory to /usr/include/mysql and check whether
                    the my_config.h file is present.
If the my_config.h file is present, then move to the next
                    step.
If the my_config.h file is not present, then:


Go to https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/latest/my__config_8h_source.html
                            and copy the contents of the my_config.h file.


Create a new my_config.h file using the following
                            command:

vi /usr/include/mysql/my_config.h



Paste the content that you copied earlier in the
                                /usr/include/mysql/my_config.h file and save
                            it.



Install the MySQL Python library as follows:

/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hue/build/env/bin/pip install MySQL-python --force-reinstall --ignore-installed


Copy the _mysql.so (MySQL client library) to Cloudera’s local
                    parcel directory:


Locate the _mysql.so file:
locate _mysql.so
Output:
                                /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/_mysql.so


Copy the _mysql.so file to Cloudera’s local parcel
                            directory:

cp /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/_mysql.so /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-[***7.x-VERSION***]/lib/hue/build/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/MySQL_python-1.2.5-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg/_mysql.so




Log in to Cloudera Manager and restart the Hue service.
