Using PostgreSQL database with Hue
Hue is packaged with a lightweight embedded PostgreSQL database for proof-of-concept
        deployments with one Hue server. In production environments, you can install and use a
        custom PostgreSQL database as the backend database to store Hue metadata, job and query
        history, and account information.
noteIn 7.1.8, the Query Processor service requires the backend PostgreSQL database
                        to not be SSL-enabled.

Download and install PostgreSQLRHEL and CentOS 7 include PostgreSQL version 9.2. However, on these OS versions, Hue         is compatible only with PostgreSQL versions 10, 11.x, 12, 13 and 14. Therefore, you must         download and install the PostgreSQL distribution separately.Configure the PostgreSQL serverBy default, PostgreSQL only accepts connections on the loopback interface. You must         reconfigure PostgreSQL to accept connections from the fully qualified domain names (FQDN) of         the hosts hosting the services for which you are configuring databases. If you do not make         these changes, the services cannot connect and use the database on which they         depend.Configure PostgreSQL as the backend database for HueAfter installing and configuring the PostgreSQL database, you can configure Hue to         use it as its backend database.
