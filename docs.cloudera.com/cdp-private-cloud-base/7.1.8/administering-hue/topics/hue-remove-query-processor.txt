Removing Query Processor service from cluster
You can remove the Query Processor service using Cloudera Manager when you no longer
        need it.

Because Hue has a dependency on the Query Processor service, deselect the
                    Query Processor Service option in the Hue configurations
                before proceeding to remove service dependencies.


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Query Processor service >  > Delete.
If you have not removed the service dependencies before deleting the Query
                    Processor, then a Remove Service Dependencies dialog box is
                    displayed.


Click Configure Service Dependency.


Deselect the Query Processor Service option on
                            the Configuration page and click Save
                                Changes.


Go to Clusters > Query Processor service >  > Delete.
