Atlas Server Operations
When you perform server related tasks, audit entries are logged.
When the Atlas server is started, an audit entry is logged. Also, when the server is
            started in the Active mode using High Availability (HA), an audit entry is logged. For
            more information, see About Atlas High Availability.
