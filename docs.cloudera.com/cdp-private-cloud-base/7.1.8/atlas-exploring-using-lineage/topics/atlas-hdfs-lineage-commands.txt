HDFS lineage commands
You must run the following commands to complete the HDFS lineage extraction into
        Atlas.
The name of the HDFS lineage capture script is called
                    hdfs-lineage.sh. The extractor script is located in the
                extractors/bin directory in $ATLAS_HOME. The
            default location path is:
                /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/atlas/extractors/bin/hdfs-lineage.sh

note Any HDFS lineage commands that are run outside of the script
                does not capture the lineage in Atlas.

As noted previously in earlier about the way HDFS lineage extraction is performed, the
            HDFS shell script commands are used to extract lineage in Atlas. The commands are run in
            the order of extraction.
