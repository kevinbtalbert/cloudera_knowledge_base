Inclusion and exclusion operation for HDFS files
The content or the files available in HDFS are either captured or ignored as lineage
        in Atlas. This scenario is achieved by including and excluding files and folders that Atlas
        checks for creating a lineage.
The hdfs.conf file contains the configuration for inclusion and
            exclusion options as described in Prerequisites for HDFS lineage extraction.
Some use cases where the including and excluding of HDFS files can be achieved
            are as follows

When a simple file is created in the “whitelist” folder, a lineage
                is created in Atlas.

./hdfs-lineage.sh -put ~/sample.txt
            /tmp/whitelist/sample2.txt

Similarly, when you try to create a file in the “blacklist” folder,
                Atlas does not create a lineage.

./hdfs-lineage.sh -put ~/sample.txt
            /tmp/blacklist/sample3.txt

If a folder is not listed for any specific operation (Whitelist or
                Blacklist), Atlas does not capture the lineage.

./hdfs-lineage.sh -put ~/sample.txt
                /tmp/non/folder1/folder1file.txt

noteAtlas does not capture the lineage even if the parent folder is included but the
                sub-folder / directories are excluded.

For example: 
./hdfs-lineage.sh -put ~/sample.txt
                /tmp/whitelist/blacklist/blacklistfile.txt

Atlas captures the lineage of the sub-folder if the parent directory or
                folder is included.

./hdfs-lineage.sh -put ~/sample.txt
                /tmp/whitelist/whitesub/whitelistsubfile.txt

Atlas does not create a lineage to an excluded folder but a lineage is
                created to the same excluded folder if there is an included path available.

./hdfs-lineage.sh -put ~/sample.txt
            /tmp/blacklist/blToWl.txt
./hdfs-lineage.sh -cp  /tmp/blacklist/blToWl.txt
                /tmp/whitelist/blToWl.txt
Atlas captures the lineage when folder(s) are included and later the lineage is
            captured from the excluded entity. 
importantThe included folder takes precedence over the excluded
                folder, always.The included folder takes precedence over the excluded folder,
            always.
./hdfs-lineage.sh -put ~/sample.txt
            /tmp/whitelist/wlToBl.txt
./hdfs-lineage.sh -cp  /tmp/whitelist/wlToBl.txt
                /tmp/blacklist/wlToBl.txt
