Lineage overview
Atlas lineage helps you understand the source and impact of data
    and changes to data over time and across all your data.
Lineage information helps you understand the origin of data and the transformations it may 
      have gone through before arriving in a file or table. In Atlas, if transformations occurred in 
      services that provide process metadata, a lineage graph shows how data in a given column 
      was generated. When a column appears in the output of a process, Atlas reads the content 
      of the process and links the input column or columns to the output asset. This relationship is
      stored as a vertex in Atlasâ€™s graph database. It is displayed as a lineage graph in the details of 
      each entity.

By default, Atlas can collect lineage information from the
          following sources:

HiveServer
Impala
Spark

The lineage metadata produced by these sources may refer to
          additional asset entities. For example, when a Hive operation moves
          data from a Hive table to an HBase table or an HDFS file, Atlas
          includes an entity to represent the HBase table or HDFS file, and the
          entity is connected to the Hive table through lineage. The following
          sources may appear in lineage graphs when referenced:

HBase
HDFS
S3

Data flow lineage from Cloudera Flow 
      Management (NiFi) can be included as well by configuring the appropriate
      reporting task.
