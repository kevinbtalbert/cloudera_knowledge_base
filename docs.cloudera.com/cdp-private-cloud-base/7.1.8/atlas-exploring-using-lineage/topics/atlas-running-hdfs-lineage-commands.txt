Running HDFS lineage commands
To support HDFS lineage extraction, you must execute the lineage shell script
        commands.
Running the HDFS commands:Running the
                    -put command:./hdfs-lineage.sh -put
                    ~/csvfolder/ /tmp/whitelist/demo/cpfol/cp1Log
                    file for HDFS Extraction is /var/log/atlas/hdfs-extractor/log
Hdfs dfs -put /root/csvfolder/ /tmp/whitelist/demo/cpfol/cp1 command was
          successful
HDFS Meta Data extracted successfully!!!You must verify if the specific folder is moved to Atlas.



Running the -cp command:./hdfs-lineage.sh -cp /tmp/whitelist/demo/cpfol/cp1
                    /tmp/whitelist/demo/cpfol/cp2Log file for HDFS
                    Extraction is /var/log/atlas/hdfs-extractor/logHdfs dfs -cp /tmp/whitelist/demo/cpfol/cp1
                    /tmp/whitelist/demo/cpfol/cp2 command was successfulHDFS Meta Data extracted successfully!!!You
                must verify if the contents of the folder is moved to another folder.

Similarly, you can move the contents of the copied folder to another
                folder../hdfs-lineage.sh -cp /tmp/whitelist/demo/cpfol/cp2
                    /tmp/whitelist/demo/cpfol/cp3Log file for HDFS
                    Extraction is /var/log/atlas/hdfs-extractor/logHdfs dfs -cp /tmp/whitelist/demo/cpfol/cp2
                    /tmp/whitelist/demo/cpfol/cp3 command was           successfulHDFS Meta Data extracted successfully!!!

You must create an External Hive table on top of the HDFS location.
                For example, a Hive table on top of the HDFS location: cp3create external table if not exists countries_table_11 (CountryID int, CountryName string, Capital string, Population
                    string)comment 'List of
                Countries'row format delimitedfields terminated by ','stored
                    as textfilelocation
                    '/tmp/whitelist/demo/cpfol/cp3';

Running the mv command:./hdfs-lineage.sh -put ~/csvfolder/
                    /tmp/whitelist/demo/mvfol/mv1Log file for HDFS
                    Extraction is /var/log/atlas/hdfs-extractor/log
Hdfs dfs -put /root/csvfolder/ /tmp/whitelist/demo/mvfol/mv1 command was
          successful
HDFS Meta Data extracted successfully!!!A single node is generated in the Atlas UI

You can move the contents of the folder mv1 to mv2./hdfs-lineage.sh -mv /tmp/whitelist/demo/mvfol/mv1
                    /tmp/whitelist/demo/mvfol/mv2 Log file for
                    HDFS Extraction is /var/log/atlas/hdfs-extractor/logHdfs dfs -mv /tmp/whitelist/demo/mvfol/mv1
                    /tmp/whitelist/demo/mvfol/mv2 command was           successfulHDFS Meta Data extracted successfully!!!In Atlas UI, you can view the contents of mv1 being moved to mv2 and
                the old entity is deleted (grayed out in the image) and likewise it continues for
                every operation where the previously created entity is deleted.

You must create an External Hive table on top of the HDFS location.
                For example, a Hive table on top of the HDFS location: mv3create external table if not exists countries_table_12 (CountryID int, CountryName string, Capital string, Population
                    string)comment 'List of
                Countries'row format delimitedfields terminated by ','stored
                    as textfilelocation
                    '/tmp/whitelist/demo/mvfol/mv3';

Running the rm command:Create a
                sample file in HDFS./hdfs-lineage.sh -put ~/sample.txt
                    /tmp/whitelist/rmtest.txtLog file for HDFS
                    Extraction is /var/log/atlas/hdfs-extractor/logHdfs dfs -put /root/sample.txt /tmp/whitelist/rmtest.txt command was
                    successfulHDFS Meta Data extracted
                    successfully!!!Use the rm command
                to delete the rmtest.txt file../hdfs-lineage.sh -rm -skipTrash
                /tmp/whitelist/rmtest.txtLog file for HDFS
                    Extraction is /var/log/atlas/hdfs-extractor/logHdfs dfs -rm -skipTrash /tmp/whitelist/rmtest.txt command was
                    successfulHDFS Meta Data extracted
                    successfully!!!noteIf a folder contains multiple sub-folders and
                if the parent folder is deleted, all the contents of the parent folder are deleted.
            
./hdfs-lineage.sh -rm -r -skipTrash
            /tmp/whitelist/demo/delfol
