Supported HDFS entities and their hierarchies
When you perform basic search with the sub-type "hdfs_path" through
        Atlas UI or API, the search results include other HDFS types like
            "hdfs_path_v2", "hdfs_path_namenode", and other
        related entities.
The following HDFS lineage types are available when you perform the search using
                hdfs_path:


hdfs_path_v2-  hdfs_container - hdfs_contained -
                        hdfs_path_namenode -
                    hdfs_process

hdfs_path_v2 is subtype of  - hdfs_path  - hdfs_container  -
                        hdfs_contained


hdfs_path_namenode is subtype of  - hdfs_path  -
                    hdfs_container



noteSearching for the entity hdfs_path renders results for
                    hdfs_path_v2 and hdfs_path_namenode. When the
                'Exclude subtypes' option is selected, only the hdfs_path results
                are available.
