Name
Description and Actions




Data Set entity

Represents a column, table, view, file, database, or other
                physical or logical data asset. 
While all data set entities are shown as a blue hexagon, the
                icon may vary based on the type of data asset and the source
                system.




Process entity
Represents a query, job, or other process that applied to
              data assets. While all process entities are shown as a green
              hexagon, the icon may vary based on the type of process and the
              source system.



Current entity
A red circle indicates the current entity in the lineage
              graph.



Selected entity
A blue circle indicates the entity selected in the lineage
              graph.



Lineage
Connects the current entity with entities that provided input
              data. Entities connected with yellow lines are ancestors of the
              current entity.



Impact
Connects the current entity with entities that could have an
              impact if data or schema information is changed in the current
              entity. Entities connected with red lines are descendants of the
              current entity.
