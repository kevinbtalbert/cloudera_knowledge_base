Prerequisites for setting up Atlas HA
You must ensure that the following prerequisites are met before you set up High
        Availability (HA) on Atlas:


You must have a cluster with more than one node. 
You must have a CDP Private Cloud Base on-premise cluster.
Atlas service must be up and running on that cluster.
Apache ZooKeeper must be running on a cluster of machines. A minimum of three
                    servers is recommended for the production environment.
You must select two or more physical nodes for running the Atlas Web Service
                    instances. These nodes define a server ensemble for Atlas.
