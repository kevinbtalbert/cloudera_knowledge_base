About Apache Ozone integration with Apache Atlas
When you integrate Ozone with Atlas, entities like Hive, Spark process, and NiFi
        flows, when created with Ozone path, results in Atlas creating Ozone path
        entities.
Integration supports the Ozone location of Ozone-backed Hive set-up. The event
            which triggers an Ozone entity to be created in Atlas is a DDL query in Hive which is
            backed by Apache Ozone. 
To learn more about Apache Ozone, see Apache Ozone documentation.
Currently, integrating Atlas with Ozone enables creation of specific Ozone
            entities in Atlas. Apache Ozone is an object store for Hadoop Data Lake Workloads,
            similar to HDFS, Microsoft ABFS, and Amazon S3.
Ozone provides three main abstractions: 

Volumes: Volumes are similar to a home directory.
                Volumes are used to store buckets. Only administrators can create or delete volumes.
                Once a volume is created, users can create as many buckets as needed.
Buckets: Buckets are similar to directories. A
                bucket can contain any number of keys, but buckets cannot contain other buckets.
                Ozone stores data as keys which live inside these buckets.
Keys: Keys are similar to files.

Previously, in Atlas for CDP, Hive entities created with Ozone path resulted in
            the creation of HDFS path entities. 
When a Hive external entity was created with a Ozone path, for example:
            ofs://ozone1/volume1/bucket1/file. It results in file creation
            at the HDFS path in Atlas.
