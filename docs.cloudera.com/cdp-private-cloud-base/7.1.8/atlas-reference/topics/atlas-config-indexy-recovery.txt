Configuring index recovery
To enable index recovery, you must configure some of the underlying
        entities.

Enable write-ahead logs of JanusGraph by configuring root.tx.log-tx graph
                    property. As this is considered as a GLOBAL property, it can be configured only
                    through the JanusGraphManagement setting. 
: The graph property file must be reopened for the new changes to take
                    effect.

Start new service, IndexRecoveryService, at Atlas
                    startup to handle index recovery and continuously monitor Solr (Index Client)
                    health for every retryTime milliseconds. 
This service should exit if the write-ahead transaction log is not enabled.
If Solr is healthy and recovery start time is available:


Commence transaction recovery with available recovery start time (which
                        is noted when Solr became unhealthy)
Persist current recovery time as previous which can be used later by
                        passing as custom recovery time to start index recovery, if
                        required.
Reset current recovery start time.



If Solr is unhealthy and no recovery start time is available:



Shutdown the existing transaction recovery process.
Note down the time which should be the next recovery start time and
                        persist in the graph.


Continue with Solr health checkup.

Configurations used for index recovery
The configuration properties that must be set in <?>
You must note and set the following properties for you
                to recover the index.
atlas.index.recovery.enable: To enable or disable index
                        recovery. Based on this property you must configure JanusGraph write-ahead
                        logs property root.tx.log-tx.Example:
                            atlas.ndex.recovery.enable=truenoteBy default index recovery is
                            enabled on Atlas startup.
atlas.graph.index.status.check.frequency: To configure as
                        to how frequently SOLR health check must be done. It takes input as time in
                        milliseconds. By default SOLR health checkup takes effect every 30
                            secondsExample:
                                atlas.graph.index.status.check.frequency=5000.

atlas.graph.index.recovery.start.time: To start index recovery by custom
                        recovery time as provided by the user. This property consumes the input as a
                        timestamp in milliseconds.noteIf Solr is restarted frequently or if Solr
                            is down, setting the start time configuration works and in turn provides
                            additional clarity. Example:
                                atlas.graph.index.recovery.start.time=1630478608000.
write.ahead.log.ttl.in.hours: To configure the life of write-ahead
                        transaction log. This property consumes the input as a number of
                            hours.noteBy default, write-ahead logs live upto 7 days as per
                            JanusGraph default settings.Example:
                                write.ahead.log.ttl.in.hours=36.




Index recovery time
Index recovery time persists in a single graph vertex.

Index recovery vertex has the following properties:

Property-1: Key as “__idxRecovery_name” and with
                        constant value as ”__solrIndexRecoveryInfo”.
Property-2: Key as “__idxrecovery_startTime” and
                        holds the current recovery time.
Property-3: Key as “__idxrecovery_prevTime” andit
                        holds the previous recovery time.

Whenever Solr becomes unhealthy the upcoming recovery time is logged in
                    Atlas application log as “Upcoming index recovery should start
                        from:<timestamp>”
When Solr becomes <term>Active</term> again it
                    gets logged in Atlas application log as “Index recovery starts from :
                        <timestamp>”, and then current recovery time is assigned to
                    previous recovery time and reset to null.
