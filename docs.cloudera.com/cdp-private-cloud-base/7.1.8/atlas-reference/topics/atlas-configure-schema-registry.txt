Configuring Atlas and Schema Registry
You must configure the settings in your Cloudera Manager instance

Navigate to the Configuration tab of the Schema Registry
                    in your Cloudera Manager instance and enter “Atlas”.

Check the Atlas Service checkbox.

Click Save Changes and restart Schema Registry.


Once Atlas integration is enabled, you can create new schemas which show up
                in Atlas. Note that the process which mirrors schemas from Schema Registry to Atlas
                is asynchronous and runs once every minute. A schema which is created does not show
                up immediately, but only after one minute. 




note If a Kafka topic exists with the same name as the schema, then a relationship
                    is created between them in Atlas. If no such topic exists, only the schema is
                    created.
