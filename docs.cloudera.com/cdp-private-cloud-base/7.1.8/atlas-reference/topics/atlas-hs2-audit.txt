HiveServer audit entries
Atlas lists changes to metadata entities in the Audit tab in the
    Dashboard.
Atlas tracks the lifecycle of each Hive entity, including its creation, update, and deletion. 
      User access and actions that affect the data content of the source asset are not included in the audit.
