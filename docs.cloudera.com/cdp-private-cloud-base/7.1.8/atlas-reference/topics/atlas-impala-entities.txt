Impala entities created in AtlasCloudera Docs
Impala entities created in Atlas
Each Impala entity in Atlas includes detailed metadata
    for Impala queries.
The following diagrams show a summary of the entities created in Atlas
      for Impala operations. The supertypes that contribute attributes
      to the entity types are shaded.
Figure 1. Atlas Entity Types for Impala
      Operations

The metadata collected for each entity type is as follows:
Impala Process


Identifier
Example content


typeName
impala_process

guid
System generated ID. This value is used to identify the
                entity in the Atlas Dashboard URL.

qualifiedName

<database>.<target
                    table>@<clustername>:<generated ID>
The generated ID is distinct from the GUID. 


name
Text of the query.

inputs
List of the input tables or views, including each entity’s
                type name and the qualified name.

outputs
List of the output objects, including each entity’s type
                name and the qualified name.

recentQueries
Last query executed (duplicated in
                  process_execution).

operationType
One of the operations that triggers metadata
                collection.

queryPlan
Reserved for future use.
startTimeMost recent query start
                time.endTimeMost recent
                query end time. 

Relationship: Process Execution
One process to one or more process executions.
                  impala_process_process_execution


Relationship: Column Lineage
One process to one or more column lineages.
                  impala_process_column_lineage


Impala Process Execution


Identifier
Example Content



typeName
impala_process_execution


guid
System generated ID. This value is used to
                    identify the entity in the Atlas Dashboard URL.


qualifiedName
<database>.<target
                    table>@<clustername>:<ID from process qualified
                    name>:<ID from the process execution name>:<generated
                    ID for this process execution>


name
Text of the query with a system-generated ID
                    added to the end.


queryText
Text of the query.


queryPlan
Reserved for future use.


queryId
impala_<date as
                    yyyymmddhhmmss>_<generated id>


startTime
Query start time.


endTime
Query end time. 


userName
The user who ran the query.


Relationship: Process
One process to one or more process executions.
                  impala_process_process_execution



Impala Column Lineage


Identifier
Example Content



typeName
impala_column_lineage


dependencyType
The type of relationship between the input and output
                columns; one of SIMPLE, EXPRESSION, or SCRIPT.


name
<database>.<table>@<clustername>:<generated
                  ID>:<output_column>


inputs

List of 0 or more hive_column entities that
                  contributed to the output columns. This is a legacy model
                  component: the more current model uses a relationship
                  attribute.



outputs
This is a legacy model component: the more current model
                uses a relationship attribute.


qualifiedName
Same as name.


query
Name of the impala_process entity that
                produced this lineage. This is a legacy model component: the
                more current model uses a relationship attribute.


Relationship: Process
Name of the impala_process entity that
                produced this lineage.
                  impala_process_column_lineage


Relationship: inputToProcesses
List of 0 or more hive_column entities
                that contributed to the output columns.


Relationship: outputFromProcesses
List of 0 or more hive_column entities
                that were produced in the process.
