Kafka lineage
Using the Lineage tab, Atlas collects metadata from Kafka to
        represent the lineage among data assets.
The Atlas lineage graph shows the input and output processes that the current entity
            participated in, specifically those relationships modeled as “inputToProcesses” and
            “outputFromProcesses.” Entities are included if they were inputs to processes that lead
            to the current entity or they are output from processes for which the current entity was
            an input. Kafka processes follow this pattern.
