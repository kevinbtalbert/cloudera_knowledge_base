Spark entity metadata migration
Spark metadata entities are fully migrated from Navigator to Atlas.
The following sections describe how metadata is mapped from Navigator to
      Atlas; if Atlas requires metadata that wasn't available in Navigator, the
      migration notes describe how the Atlas metadata values are generated.
Migrated entities include: 
Spark Process
Spark Process Execution

For entity metadata that is common to all entities, see System metadata migration.
Spark Process
Navigator spark_operation entities are migrated to Atlas
          spark_process entities. noteThe metadata for
          the principal from Navigator is not migrated to Atlas.
