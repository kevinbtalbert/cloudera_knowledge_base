Atlas NiFi audit entries
Atlas lists changes to metadata entities in the Audits tab in the
        Dashboard.





Atlas tracks the lifecycle of each NiFi entity, including its creation and
            updation. User access and actions that affect the data content of the source asset are
            not included in the audit.
Note: If the data is active while the entity is created, it displays
            some additional information. You must be aware that after the entity is created, the
            flow files do not create an event, unless the processor is listed.
