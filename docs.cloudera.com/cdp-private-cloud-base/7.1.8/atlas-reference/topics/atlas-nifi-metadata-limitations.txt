Limitations of Atlas-NiFi integration
Some limitations of this integration.


Requires Atlas 0.8-incubating or later. The reporting task requires Atlas REST
                    API version 2, which is introduced in Atlas 0.8-incubating. Older versions of
                    Atlas are not supported.


Supports limited datasets and Processors. To report lineage to Atlas,
                    the reporting task should be familiar with what a given processor does with a
                    certain dataset. Later, create an 'Atlas Object Id' for a dataset which uniquely
                    identifies an entity in Atlas. Atlas Object ID has a unique properties map, and
                    mostly 'qualifiedName' is set in the unique properties map to identify an
                    entity. The format of a qualifiedName depends on each dataset. To create this
                    Atlas Object ID, you must implement Processor-specific code that analyzes
                    configured properties. 




Requires restart of NiFi to update some ReportingTask properties. As
                    the underlying Atlas client library caches configurations when it runs the first
                    time, some properties of this reporting task can not be updated by stopping,
                    configuring, and restarting the reporting task. The NiFi process needs to be
                    restarted in such cases.
