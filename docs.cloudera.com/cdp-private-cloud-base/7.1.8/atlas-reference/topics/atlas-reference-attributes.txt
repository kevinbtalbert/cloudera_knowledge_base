Apache Atlas metadata attributes
Attributes are the key-value pairs that hold metadata details for
    entities and classifications.
Different types of attributes are populated with values differently. 
Technical Attributes
These attributes are the entity fields that contain technical
            metadata defined in entity models. For the built-in entity types,
            Atlas collects this information from services on the cluster. These
            attributes are read-only in the UI but can be updated using the
            Atlas API. All entity types share basic metadata such as names and
            qualified names; however, the rest of the technical metadata is
            specific to the entity type.
System Attributes
These attributes are populated by Atlas when it creates an entity
            instance. They include: 

System Attribute
Description
Identifier in Advanced Search



Type
The Atlas entity type. 
__typeName


Status
The entity status in Atlas: this field
                indicates if a data asset has been deleted; Atlas maintains the
                entity information after the asset no longer exists on the
                cluster.
__state


Created By User
The Atlas user who created this
                entity. Typically this is the Atlas system user. If an
                entity was created by an API call or created manually by users, the active user account
                would be included in this attribute.
__createdBy


Last Modified User
The Atlas user who last updated the
                entity, whether through Atlas metadata collection from a cluster
                service, an Atlas API, or a change through the Atlas UI.
__modifiedBy


Created timestamp
The date Atlas created the entity.
                Note that this field is different from the technical attribute
                for the creation date of the original data asset or
                operation.
__timestamp


Last Modified timestamp
The date when an entity was
                last updated in Atlas. Note that this field is different from
                the technical attribute for the last modification date of the
                actual data asset or operation on the cluster.
__modificationTimestamp


GUID
A unique identifier generated by Atlas. This is
                the 32-digit code found in the browser URL for an
                entity.
__guid


Labels
Label metadata added to an entity.
__labels


User-Defined Properties
Key-value pair metadata added to an entity.
__customAttributes


Classifications
Classifications added to an entity.
__classificationNames


Propagated Classifications
Classifications added to entities downstream from an
                entity where the classification was added by a
                user.
__propagatedClassificationNames


—
A concatenated string of classification names and
                attributes for an entity. This attribute is not available
                through the Atlas UI.
__classificationsText


IsIncomplete
A system indicator that entities were created because
                they were referenced in the metadata collected by a
                service other than the source type associated with the
                entity type. An entity is typically marked "isIncomplete"
                when Atlas receives metadata out of order from when the
                events occurred. If IsIncomplete entities remain
                “incomplete” for a long time, it may indicate that the
                original messages for entity metadata have not
                arrived.
__isIncomplete

 When
            defining new models, you can take advantage of the
              isAppendOnPartialUpdate option in attribute
            definitions. This option allows array or map type attribute values
            to be updated by appending rather than replacing the entire set. For
            example, to represent a list of key-value pairs that can be
            augmented over time, you might define an attribute
              metadata as a map with the
            option isAppendOnPartialUpdate set to true:

{
   "name": "metadata",
   "typeName": "map<string,string>",
   "isOptional": true,
   "cardinality": "SINGLE",
   "valuesMinCount": 0,
   "valuesMaxCount": 1,
   "isUnique": false,
   "isIndexable": false,
   "includeInNotification": false,
   "description": "Contains key-value pairs that provide metadata",
   "searchWeight": -1,
   "options": {
   "isAppendOnPartialUpdate": "true"
}
Classifications, labels, and user-defined properties are included
              as system attributes in the context of search. They are modeled as
              entity attributes so that when you access an entity (through the
              UI or API), you get all these entity-specific metadata.

Business Metadata Attributes
These attributes are populated in the Atlas UI or through API
            calls. They provide a way to extend the metadata stored for entity
            instances. You can define Business Metadata attributes to apply to a
            specific entity type or to many entity types. Administrators can
            control the users or groups who can set values for these attributes
            by creating a Ranger policy against the Business Metadata collection
            that contains the attribute.
Classification Attributes
These attributes are populated in the Atlas UI or through API
            calls. They provide a way to enrich the worth of a classification
            for searching, for access policies in Ranger, and for organizing
            cluster data assets. Classifications can also be assigned to
              entities through lineage: if the classification is defined to
              allow lineage propagation, a classification assigned to an entity
              is also assigned to all entities that have output relationships to
              the classified entity. The propagation applies to all further
              generations of the lineage. Note that Atlas distinguishes between
              classifications that were specifically assigned to an entity and
              classifications that were assigned through lineage
              propagation.
User-defined Properties
These attributes are populated in the Atlas UI or through API
            calls. They allow users to add metadata in the form of key-value
            pairs to any entity instance. Values are limited to strings. Both
            key and value are included in searches. They are not centrally
            managed like classifications or Business Metadata attributes. They
            are not accessible through Ranger for specifying access policies.
              


Defining attributes
Attribute names can include letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens;
      they must start with a letter or number. All attributes can have values
      one of the following Java data types: 
string
Boolean
byte
short
int
float
double
long
date
enumeration
 Where enumeration type values are strings from pre-defined
      enumeration defined using the Atlas API.
noteThe Atlas Free-text search only works with attributes with string
          values.
When you define an attribute, you an indicate that the value can include
      more than one entry. Atlas records multiple values in a comma-separated
      list. Thus, when searching on attributes with multiple values, users
      should use the logical operator "Contains" rather than "=" so the search
      matches on a single value rather than the whole list.
