POST /admin/audit/ API
The POST /admin/audit/ API endpoint can be used to retrieve the
    entity purge operations that have occurred in a given time
    period.
To report what entities were purged, use the POST method on the
        /admin/audit/ endpoint with a payload containing a
      JSON-formated query for purged entities:POST /api/atlas/admin/audit/ 

where the parameters include:


Parameter
Format / Value
Description



body: auditFilters
JSON-formatted query including:
username (required)
purge operation (required)
start time
end time
The results can further be controlled with:
limit
offset
sort by (required)
sort order

The payload describes a query that returns PURGE operations
              performed by a specific user. The query can include a filter for a
              specific time range, where the start and end times are specified
              in UNIX epoch time. The query results can also be paged using a
              result count (limit) and offset so multiple calls can be made to
              retrieve unique result sets. 


header: content type
application/json
Atlas expects the payload of the call to be in JSON
                format.


header: authorization
Per your environment
Atlas requires authentication, which you can provide with a
              username and password as a parameter in a cURL call (-u
                username:password) or using cookies or other generated
              methods to pass appropriate credentials. The user must have Atlas
              administrator privileges.


The audit filter in this call uses the same syntax as Atlas' search
      filters. Here are some guidelines that are useful for using this interface
      for purge auditing:

Valid operators for the time criteria include less than
          (lt), greater than (gt), less than
        or equal to (lte), greater than or equal to
          (gte), equal to (eq), and not equal
        to (neq).
Valid operators for the string criteria include like,
          startsWith, endsWith,
          contains, isNull,
          notNull, and equals (eq).
The sortOrder can be ASCENDING or
          DESCENDING.

The response from a POST /admin/audit call is a JSON-formatted list of
      the purge operations that occurred in the specified time range. The
      content includes the parameters passed in the purge call and the list of
      GUIDs for the entities that were successfully purged.  If no entities are
      purged, the response is an empty list [].
For example, a cURL command to return the most recent 10 purge operations
      might look like the following where the authorization is passed in the
      call as a username and clear-text
      password:curl -X POST 'http://host3.acme.com:31000/api/atlas/admin/audit/' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
