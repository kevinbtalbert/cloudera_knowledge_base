PUT /admin/purge/ API
The PUT /admin/purge/ API endpoint allows you to remove a list of
    deleted entities from Atlas.
To purge deleted entities, use the PUT method on the
        /admin/purge/ endpoint with a payload containing a JSON
      list of Atlas GUIDs:PUT /api/atlas/admin/purge/ 
      This call takes a list of GUIDs for Atlas entities; each entity in the
      list is purged from Atlas if the entity is already marked as deleted. This
      call requires a user account with Atlas administrator privileges. The
      successfully purged entities are listed in the audit log, referenced by
      their GUIDs. 
The parameters include:


Parameter
Format / Value
Description



body
JSON list:["GUID", "GUID",
                ...]
One or more Atlas entity GUIDs for deleted entities that
                you want to purge from Atlas. If the list includes an entity
                that is not already marked as deleted, the entity will be
                ignored and Atlas will process the remaining entities in the
                list. Entity GUIDs appear on the URL for the entity detail
                  page and in the metadata returned from an API search call such
                  as GET /search/dsl or POST
                    /search/basic. 


header: content type
application/json
Atlas expects the payload of the call to be in JSON
                format.


header: authorization
Per your environment
Atlas requires authentication, which you can provide with
              username and password as a parameter in a cURL call (-u
                username:password) or using cookies or other generated
              methods to pass appropriate credentials. The user must have Atlas
              administrator privileges.


The response from a PUT /admin/purge call is a JSON-formatted list of the
      entities that were successfully purged. The content includes the GUID and
      qualified name of each entity, its status ("DELETED"), and lists of
      classifications, terms, labels, and related entities that were associated
      with the purged entity. If no entities are purged, the response is an
      empty list {}.
Note that the number of entities provided in the request may not match
      the number of entities included in the response. When Atlas purges an
      entity, it also purges all additional entities dependent on the indicated
      entity. Thus if you request to purge a single Hive table, the response
      includes an entry for the Hive table and entries for each of the table's
      columns, its DDL, and its storage description. 
For example, a cURL command to purge two Hive tables might look like the
      following, where the authorization is passed in the call as an encrypted
      string:curl -X PUT 'http://host3.acme.com:31000/api/atlas/admin/purge/' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' \
-d '["b9355eab-bbf5-4cd6-b711-12f85a3e9d01", "9fed31f5-0a27-40dc-ba97-96d153fc297b"]'
The response would include each table, its DDL, its storage description,
      and all its
      columns:{
