Apache Atlas Statistics reference
Atlas collects statistics on the metadata it processes. Use this
    information to help troubleshoot problems and to gauge performance.
To view statistics, click the graph button in the top right
          corner:

The statistics available are categorized into Entity
          Statistics and Server Statistics:
Entity Statistics
The distribution of entity across their types. A second column gives
        the number of these entities that have been marked as deleted.


Classification Statistics
A list of classifications assigned to entities and the count of
        entities marked with that classification. The count for
        each classification is a hyperlink that runs a search for entities
        marked with the classification. 

Server Statistics
Server statistics reflect the
        current server session and the metadata collection messages that Atlas
        reads from a dedicated Kafka topic.

startTimeStampThe
The timestamp of the most recent start of the Atlas server.
activeTimeStamp
Same as the startTimeStamp unless Atlas was disabled.
upTime
The amount of time between startTimeStamp and the current time
            when the server was running.
statusBackendStore
The status of the Atlas server connection to the HBase namespace
            where entity metadata is stored.
statusIndexStore
The status of the Atlas server connection to the Solr collection
            where entity metadata is indexed.
collectionTime
The last time metrics were calculated.
lastMessageProcessedTime
The timestamp of the last message Atlas recorded from the Kafka
            topic where services publish metadata.

Notification Details: Message Statistics
Period
The interval that the statistic applies to, including the total

            when the period started.
Count
The number of messages processed by Atlas during the period.
Avg Time (ms)
The average duration between the time that a hook published a
            message to the Kafka topic to the time entities where successfully

Creates
The number of entities produced from the messages processed during
            the period.
Updates
The number of entities updated based on the messages processed
