Schema Registry audit entries
Atlas lists changes to metadata entities in the Audits tab in
        the Dashboard.
Atlas tracks the lifecycle of each Schema Registry entity, including its
            creation and update. User access and actions that affect the data content of the source
            asset are not included in the audit.
