Spark actions that produce Atlas entities
Spark jobs create Spark application and process entities and
    create, update, or delete the data assets affected by those operations will
    affect Atlas entities; operations that only affect data do not show up in
    Atlas.
The following table lists the Spark actions that produce or update
      metadata in Atlas.


This Action in Spark...
...Produces metadata for these Atlas
              entities




CREATE TABLE USINGCREATE TABLE AS SELECT, CREATE TABLE USING ... AS SELECT

spark_application, spark_column_lineage, spark_process,
              hive_table, hive_column, hive_storagedesc


CREATE VIEW AS SELECT,
spark_application, spark_process, hive_table, hive_column,
              hive_storagedesc


INSERT INTO (SELECT),LOAD DATA [LOCAL] INPATH
spark_application, spark_process


Notable actions in Spark that do NOT produce process entities in Atlas,
      meaning that no lineage is produced for these operations:

LOAD DATA INPATH (when not coming from a local file
                source)
            
CREATE TABLE (hive_table metadata produced by HMS) 
ALTER VIEW (hive_table metadata produced by HMS) 
SELECT or other queries that donâ€™t change table metadata
