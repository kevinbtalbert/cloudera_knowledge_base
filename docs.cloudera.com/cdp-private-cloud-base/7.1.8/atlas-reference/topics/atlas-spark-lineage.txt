Spark lineage
Atlas collects metadata from Spark to represent the lineage among
    data assets.
The Atlas lineage graph shows the input and output processes that the
      current entity participated in, specifically those relationships modeled
      as “inputToProcesses” and “outputFromProcesses.” Entities are included if
      they were inputs to processes that lead to the current entity or they are
      output from processes for which the current entity was an input. In the
      context of Spark, a Spark job is modeled as a
        spark_application entity. Each application entity
      includes relationships to one or more processes that were executed in the
      job. The spark_process entities are automatically named
        "execution-n" where n is an
      integer incremented sequentially.

It is possible to have two spark process entities with the same name in a
      lineage graph; be sure to check the qualified name to make sure you are
      looking at the appropriate process.
