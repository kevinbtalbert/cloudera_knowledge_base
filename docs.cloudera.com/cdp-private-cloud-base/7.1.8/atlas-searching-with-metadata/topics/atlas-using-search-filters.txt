Using Search filters
The Basic Search panel includes filter icons that allow you to
    search for entities based on one or more attribute values. 
In a filter row, the attribute data type determines which of the following operators can be
      used to define your search criteria:

Strings
Dates
Enumerations Boolean
Numerics

All classification attributes are string values;
      numerics include byte, short,
        int, float, double,
      and long attribute data types.
noteIf the attribute you are searching for could include multiple
      values, use "contains" rather than "=" to make sure the search finds the
      individual value out of the list.


To search on values for more than one attribute, add another filter row
      to the search filter (click Add filter). The search
      can find entities matching either filter criteria (logical OR) or matching
      both criteria (logical AND). Set the logic using the
        AND / OR buttons at the
      top-left of the filter rows.
You can combine logical AND and OR criteria using filter groups. The
      logic is the same within a filter group; use more than one filter group to
      produce both AND and OR logic. For example, the following Classification
      attribute filter searches for entities that are at "new" or "acknowledged"
      stages in their processing and are owned by the Finance business team.
If you wanted to further limit the search results to the entities that
      were created in Atlas in the last 24 hours, you would open the attribute
      filter for Search by Entity Type and set the system attribute "Created
      Timestamp" less than 24 hours. To open the Search by Entity Type filter,
      you would need to select an entity type or "_ALL_ENTITY_TYPES".
