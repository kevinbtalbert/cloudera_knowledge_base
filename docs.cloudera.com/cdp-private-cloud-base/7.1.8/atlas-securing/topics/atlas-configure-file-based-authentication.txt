Configure Atlas file-based authentication
How to manage Atlas user authentication when using user credentials
    from a file.
noteIn CDP Cloud, identity management is provided by FreeIPA and
      configured using the Management Console. Therefore for CDP Cloud, you
      should leave the Admin Authentication Method set to Kerberos
      authentication settings. For more
      information, see "Managing user access and authorization" in the CDP Cloud
      Management Console documentation.
warningAtlas file-based authentication is intended as a
      convenience for managing authentication in a development environment. Do
      not use file-based authentication in a production environment.
Two of the most likely tasks you would perform related to file-based
      authentication for Atlas:

Enable or disable file-based authorization when 
        transitioning among authentication methods
Add to the list of authorized users for use in a
        non-production environment

To enable or disable file-based authentication

In Cloudera Manager, select the Atlas service, then open the
          Configuration tab.
Display the authentication settings by typing "file" in the Search
          box.
Check or uncheck the option Enable File
            Authentication.


If you are enabling file-based authentication, review the location
          of the file that contains user credentials as specified in
            Path to Credentials for File-based
            Login.The default directory location indicated by
              ATLAS_USER_CREDENTIALS_CONF_PATH is the Atlas
            configuration directory in the Cloudera Runtime installation
            location, typically
            /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-version/etc/atlas/conf.distIf
            you need to change the location, specify an absolute path on the
            Atlas host. Alternatively you can reset the location for
              users-credentials.properties by setting the
              atlas.authentication.method.file.filename
            property in the Atlas Server Advanced Configuration
              Snippet (Safety Valve) for
              conf/atlas-application.properties. You can find the
            hostname where the Atlas service is running on the
              Instances tab in Cloudera Manager.
Configure the list of users as described in step 6 in To add to the users list:.
Click Save Changes. 
Restart the Atlas service.


To add to the users list:
This procedure requires that you restart the Atlas service.

In Cloudera Manager, select the Atlas service, then open the
          Instances tab. 
Note the Hostname where the Atlas service is
          running. You'll need to be able to SSH into that host
          to update the user list.


Open the Configuration tab. 
Type "file" in the search box to filter the property list.
Find the user file. Look for the location of the
              users-credentials.properties file as set in the
              Path to Credentials for File-based Login
            property. The default directory location indicated by
              ATLAS_USER_CREDENTIALS_CONF_PATH is the Atlas
            configuration directory in the Cloudera Runtime installation
            location, typically
            /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-version/etc/atlas/conf.dist
            If you need to reset the location of the
              users-credentials.properties file, see Moving the Atlas user credentials file.
Update the user list.
              SSH into the Atlas host. Edit the users file
            to include additional users in the following format:
            username=group::password-hash
            where the username is the string used in the
            login page, the group is one of
              ADMIN, DATA_STEWARD, or
              DATA_SCIENTIST. The
              password-hash is the password encoded using
            salting. To generate an encoded password, use the python
              cputil.py script provided in the Atlas
            installation,
            typically:/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-version/lib/atlas/binRun
            the command as follows, making sure that variables used in the
            script are
            available:$ export ATLAS_HOME=/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-version/lib/atlas
$ export ATLAS_CONF=<Atlas installation location>
$ /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-version/lib/atlas/bin/cputil.py -g -u <username> -p <new secure password> -sThe
              -s option ensures that the output includes only
            the hash value. The Atlas installation location is typically
                /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-version/etc/atlas/.

Restart the Atlas service.


Moving the Atlas user credentials file
If you find you need to point Atlas to a different location for the
          users-credentials.properties file, you can reset the
        location using a property in an Atlas advanced configuration
        snippet.

In Cloudera Manager, select the Atlas service, then open the
          Configuration tab.
Display the advanced configuration settings by typing "safety" in
          the Search box.
In the Atlas Server Advanced Configuration Snippet
            (Safety Valve) for conf/atlas-application.properties
          property, add the following property and set it to the absolute path
          to the users-credentials.properties file on the Atlas
          host. This path must be accessible to the Atlas service user (defaults
          to
          atlas).atlas.authentication.method.file.filename=/some/secure/location
Restart the Atlas service.
