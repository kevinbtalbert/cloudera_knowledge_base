Adding self-healing goals to Cruise Control in Cloudera Manager
As self-healing is enabled by default for Cruise Control, you only need to specify
        the actions Cruise Control should take when detecting anomaly types by providing
        self-healing goals in Cloudera Manager.

Access Cloudera Manager for the Cruise Control configurations.


Go to your cluster in Cloudera Manager.


Select Cruise Control from the list of Services.


Click on Configuration tab.



Search for Self-Healing Goals.

Add the required self-healing goals to the corresponding field.

Click Save changes.

Click on Action > Restart next to the Cruise Control service name to restart Cruise
                    Control.
