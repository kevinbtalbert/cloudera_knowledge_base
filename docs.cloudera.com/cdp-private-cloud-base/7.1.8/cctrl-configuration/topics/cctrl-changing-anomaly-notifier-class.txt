Changing the Anomaly Notifier Class value to self-healing
You need to change the default anomaly notifier class to self-healing to enable the
        internal notification in Cruise Control that triggers the automatic
        self-healing.

Go to your cluster in Cloudera Manager.

Select Cruise Control from the list of Services.

Click on Configuration tab.

Search for the Cruise Control Server Advanced Configuration Snippet
                        (Safety Valve) for cruisecontrol.properties setting.

Add the following parameter to the Safety Valve
                    field:

anomaly.notifier.class=com.linkedin.kafka.cruisecontrol.detector.notifier.SelfHealingNotifier


Click Save changes.

Click on Action > Restart next to the Cruise Control service name to restart Cruise
                    Control.
