Enabling self-healing for all or individual anomaly types
Self-healing is disabled for Cruise Control by default. You can enable self-healing in
  Cloudera Manager using the cruisecontrol.properties configuration, or with a curl POST request and
  the corresponding anomaly type.
Enabling self-healing in Cloudera Manager


Go to your cluster in Cloudera Manager.
Select Cruise Control from the list of
      Services.
Click on Configuration tab.
Search for the Cruise Control Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
       Valve) for cruisecontrol.properties setting.
Choose to enable self-healing for all or only specific anomaly types, and add the
      corresponding parameter to the Safety Valve field based on your requirements.

For all anomaly types
For specific anomaly types



self.healing.enabled=true
self.healing.broker.failure.enabled=true


self.healing.goal.violation.enabled=true


self.healing.disk.failure.enabled=true


self.healing.topic.anomaly.enabled=true


self.healing.slow.broker.removal.enabled=true


Click Save changes.
Click on Action > Restart next to the Cruise Control service name to restart Cruise Control.



Enabling self-healing using REST API


Open a command line tool.
Use ssh and connect to your cluster running Cruise
       Control.ssh root@<your_hostname>You will be
       prompted to provide your password.
Enable self-healing for the required anomaly types using the following POST
       command:POST /kafkacruisecontrol/admin?enable_self_healing_for=[anomaly_type]The
       following parameters must be used for anomaly_type:
GOAL_VIOLATION
BROKER_FAILURE
METRIC_ANOMALY
DISK_FAILURE
TOPIC_ANOMALY

noteIn case you do not want to enable self-healing for certain anomaly types, you can
        disable them by using the following
        command:POST /kafkacruisecontrol/admin?disable_self_healing_for=[anomaly_type]

Check which anomalies are currently in use, and which are detected with the following GET
      command:GET /kafkacruisecontrol/state


When reviewing the state of Cruise Control, you can check the status of Anomaly Detector at
    the following parameters:
selfHealingEnabled - Anomaly type for which self-healing is enabled
selfHealingDisabled - Anomaly type for which self healing is disabled
recentGoalViolations - Recently detected goal violations
recentBrokerFailures - Recently detected broker failures
recentDiskFailures - Recently detected disk failures
recentMetricAnomalies - Recently detected metric anomalies
