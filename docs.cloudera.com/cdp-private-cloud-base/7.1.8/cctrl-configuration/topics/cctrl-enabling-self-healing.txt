To enable Cruise Control self-healing, you need to set the Anomaly Notifier Class,
  enable the self-healing for the anomaly types using the REST API and add self-healing goals in
  Cloudera Manager.

You can enable self-healing in   Cloudera Manager using the cruisecontrol.properties configuration, or with a curl POST request and   the corresponding anomaly type.
