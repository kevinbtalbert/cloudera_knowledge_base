Adding Cruise Control as a service
You need to use the Add Service wizard in Cloudera Manager to have Cruise Control
        service on your cluster. After selecting the host you want to add the Cruise Control role
        to, you need to review the default configurations. These configurations can also be set
        later after adding Cruise Control as a service.


noteIt is recommended to add Cruise Control on the same CDP cluster as
                    Kafka.



Open Cloudera Manager.

Select the drop-down menu to the right of your cluster on the Home
                    screen.

Select Add Service.
The Add Service wizard starts.

Select Cruise Control as the type of service from the
                    list of services, then click Continue.

Assign roles to Cruise Control, then click
                    Continue.

Check the default and suggested settings for configuration parameters on the
                    Review Changes page, and set if needed.

Click Continue and wait until the first run of the Cruise Control
                    service is completed.

Click Continue and then Finish.


You have added Cruise Control as a service in Cloudera Manager.
