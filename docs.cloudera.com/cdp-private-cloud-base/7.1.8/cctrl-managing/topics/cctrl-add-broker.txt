Rebalance after adding Kafka broker
When your application requires more Kafka brokers, you can add new ones without
        interfering with the rebalancing process using the command line.

Open Cloudera Manager.

Add a new Kafka broker.

In the command line, check the status of the Kafka cluster with the
                        /kafka_cluster_state command.

Check the status of Cruise Control with /state command to make
                    sure that everything is set before adding the broker.

Call the /add_broker command.
See the REST API reference document for the needed endpoint parameter.
Cruise Control displays the rebalancing plan.

Check the status of the Kafka cluster with the
                        /kafka_cluster_state command.

Check the status of Cruise Control with the /state
                    command.

The new broker is added to the cluster.
