Rebalance after demoting Kafka broker
When a broker needs maintenance during the rebalance process, you can demote the
        Kafka broker using the command line. After the maintenance is completed, the rebalancing
        process can be continued.

When a broker must undergo maintenance, demoting can be used for removing partition
                leadership from the given broker.


In the command line, check the status of the Kafka cluster with the
                        /kafka_cluster_state command. 

Check the status of Cruise Control with /state command to make
                    sure that everything is set before demoting the broker.

Run the /demote_broker command.
See the REST API reference document for the needed endpoint parameter.noteIf
                        there is one replica of a partition, the partition leadership cannot be
                        moved by demoting. Demoting only moves leaders.
Cruise Control displays the cluster load after the demoting
                    operation.

Check the status of the Kafka cluster with the
                        /kafka_cluster_state command.

Check the status of Cruise Control with the /state
                    command.

The demoted broker does not contain any partition leaders.
