Rebalancing with Cruise Control
The rebalancing process of Cruise Control works in the
            background. You do not need to adjust or set anything during the process. You can use
            the REST endpoints to communicate with Cruise Control in the command line.
The default rebalance command for Cruise Control is
                /rebalance?dryrun=true. It is recommended to use the default value
            of dryrun when running the rebalancing command for the first time, and then changing the
            value to false when running the Cruise Control rebalancing process
            later.
For the list of REST endpoints, see the Cruise Control API reference
                document.noteIf the rebalancing process does not start, then Cruise Control
                might not have enough metric information to start the process. In this case, you
                need to set the resources and restart the metrics fetching process.

Rebalance after adding Kafka brokerWhen your application requires more Kafka brokers, you can add new ones without         interfering with the rebalancing process using the command line.Rebalance after demoting Kafka brokerWhen a broker needs maintenance during the rebalance process, you can demote the         Kafka broker using the command line. After the maintenance is completed, the rebalancing         process can be continued.Rebalance after removing Kafka brokerWhen your application requires that you remove certain Kafka brokers, you can do so         using the command line, and continue the rebalancing process with the remaining         ones.
