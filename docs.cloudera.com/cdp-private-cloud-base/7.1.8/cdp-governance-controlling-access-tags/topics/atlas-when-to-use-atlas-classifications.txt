When to use Atlas classifications for access control
Resource-based and tag-based policies are useful in different
    ways.
Ranger provides resource-based policies and tag-based policies. The following table provides 
      some examples of when you would choose one type of policy over the other:
    

Resource-based Policies
Tag-based Policies


          Control access to data assets per service type (multiple policies for each data asset)
        
Control access to data assets across all service types


          Control access to entire databases
        
Control access to columns in source tables that users can copy or transform 
          to other tables


          Control access to long-lived tables
        

          Control access to data until it is reviewed/classified by setting an
          validity date
        


          Control access to well-known columns in specific tables, which don't
          change over time
