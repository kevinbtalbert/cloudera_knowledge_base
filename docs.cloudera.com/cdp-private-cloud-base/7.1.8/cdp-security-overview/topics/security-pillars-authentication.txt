Authentication
Authentication is a basic security requirement in a digital environment. 
Users, processes, and services must verify their identity using credentials known by
   the authenticator in order to access a system. Credentials can include something you know such as
   a password or PIN; something you have such as a badge or RSA token; or something you are such as
   biometrics including fingerprints, facial features, or iris patterns. 
The components of CDP that provide authentication solutions to your cluster are
   Apache Knox and Kerberos. Apache Knox provides perimeter security so that the enterprise can
   extend access to new users while also maintaining compliance with security policies. Kerberos is
   a network authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for client/server
   applications by using secret-key cryptography.
An iPhone user can unlock their device by using the facial
   recognition scan or inputting their PIN.
