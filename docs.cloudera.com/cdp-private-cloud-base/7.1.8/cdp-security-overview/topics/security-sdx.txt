SDX
Shared Data Experience (SDX) ensures your information is secure by design.
What is SDX?
SDX is Clouderaâ€™s design architecture that we incorporate into all of our products.
    It ensures your information is secure by design, so an integrated set of security and governance
    technologies protect your data. These technologies are built using metadata, which SDX collects
    to implement security policies.
SDX contains a combination of tools such as Ranger, Atlas, Knox, Hive Metastore,
    Data Catalog, Replication Manager, and Workload Manager. 

SDX and Security
SDX provides consistent policy, schema, and metadata on the backend. It is effectively a
    single pane of glass for viewing metadata, schema, and policy within your digital environment to
    reduce security risks and operational costs.
