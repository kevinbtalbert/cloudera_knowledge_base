CDS 3.3 Powered by Apache Spark Requirements
The following sections describe software requirements for CDS 3.3 Powered by Apache Spark.
CDP Versions
important
CDS 3.3 Powered by Apache Spark is an add-on service for CDP Private
    Cloud Base, and is only supported with Cloudera Runtime 7.1.8 and higher. Spark 2 is included in
    CDP, and does not require a separate parcel. 
 Supported versions of CDP are described below. 


 CDS Powered by Apache Spark Version 
 Supported CDP Versions 



3.3.0.3.3.7180.0-274
 CDP Private Cloud Base with Cloudera Runtime 7.1.8 and higher


 A Spark 2 service (included in CDP) can co-exist on the same cluster as Spark 3 (installed as
    a separate parcel). The two services are configured to not conflict, and both run on the same
    YARN service. Spark 3 installs and uses its own external shuffle service. 
 Although Spark 2 and Spark 3 can coexist in the same CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, you
    cannot use multiple Spark 3 versions simultaneously. All clusters managed by the same Cloudera
    Manager Server must use exactly the same version of CDS Powered by Apache Spark. 

Software requirements
CDS 3.3CDS for GPUs
Each cluster host must have the following software installed:

Java
JDK 8 or JDK 11. Cloudera recommends using JDK 8, as most testing has been done with JDK
        8. Remove other JDK versions from all cluster and gateway hosts to ensure proper operation.
       
Python
Python 3.7 and higher


Each cluster host with a GPU must have the following software installed:

Java
JDK 8 or JDK 11. Cloudera recommends using JDK 8, as most testing has been done with JDK
        8. Remove other JDK versions from all cluster and gateway hosts to ensure proper operation.
       
Python
Python 3.7 and higher
GPU drivers and CUDA toolkit

GPU driver v450.80.02 or higher
CUDA version 11.0 or higher
Download and install the CUDA Toolkit for your operating system. The toolkit installer also
         provides the option to install the GPU driver.

NVIDIA Library
NVIDIA RAPIDS version 22.06. For more information, see  NVIDIA Release Notes
UCX (Optional) 

Clusters with Infiniband or RoCE networking can leverage Unified Communication
          X (UCX) to enable the RAPIDS Shuffle Manager. For information on UCX
         native libraries support, see (Optional) Installing UCX native libraries.




Hardware requirements
CDS 3.3CDS for GPUs 
CDS 3.3 Powered by Apache Spark has no specific hardware
      requirements on top of what is required for Cloudera Runtime deployments.

CDS 3.3 with GPU Support requires cluster hosts with NVIDIA Pascalâ„¢or better GPUs, with a compute capability rating of 6.0 or higher.
For more information, see Getting Started at the RAPIDS website.
Cloudera and NVIDIA recommend using NVIDIA-certified systems. For more information, see
       NVIDIA-Certified Systems in the NVIDIA GPU Cloud
      documentation.
