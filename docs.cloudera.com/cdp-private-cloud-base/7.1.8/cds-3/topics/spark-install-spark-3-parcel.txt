Installing CDS 3.3 Powered by Apache Spark

CDS 3.3 Powered by Apache Spark (CDS 3.3) is distributed as a parcel. The custom
    service descriptor (CSD) file for CDS 3.3 is
    available in Cloudera Manager for CDP 7.1.8, both
    of which must be installed on the cluster. 
note
      Due to the potential for confusion between CDS Powered by Apache
      Spark and the initialism CSD, references to the custom service
      descriptor (CSD) file in this documentation use the term service
      descriptor.
    
Install CDS 3.3 Powered by Apache Spark
note
 Although Spark 2 and Spark 3 can coexist in the same CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, you
          cannot use multiple Spark 3 versions simultaneously. All clusters managed by the same
          Cloudera Manager Server must use exactly the same version of CDS 3.3 Powered by Apache Spark. 

 Follow these steps to install CDS 3.3: 

 Check that all the software prerequisites are satisfied. If not, you might
          need to upgrade or install other software components first. 
 In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, add the CDS parcel repository to the Remote
          Parcel Repository URLs in Parcel Settings as described in Parcel Configuration Settings. note If your
            Cloudera Manager Server does not have Internet access, you can use the CDS Powered by
            Apache Spark parcel files: put them into a new parcel repository, and then configure the
            Cloudera Manager Server to target this newly created repository. 
 Download the CDS 3.3 parcel, distribute
          the parcel to the hosts in your cluster, and activate the parcel. For instructions, see
            Managing Parcels. 
 Add the Spark 3 service to your cluster. 
 In step 1, select any optional dependencies, such as HBase and Hive, or select
                No Optional Dependencies. 
 In step 2, when customizing the role assignments, add a gateway role to every host. 
 On the Review Changes page, you can enable TLS for the Spark
              History Server. 
 Note that the History Server port is 18089 instead of the usual 18088. 
 Complete the remaining steps in the wizard. 


          Return to the Home page by clicking the
          Cloudera Manager logo in the upper left corner.
        

          Click the stale configuration icon to launch the Stale Configuration
          wizard and restart the necessary services.
        


Install the Livy for Spark 3 Service Descriptor
CDS 3 supports Apache Livy, but it cannot use the included Livy
        service, which is compatible with only Spark 2. To add and manage a Livy
        service compatible with Spark 3, you must install a service descriptor
        for the Livy for Spark 3 service.

 In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, add the CDS 3 parcel repository to the Remote
          Parcel Repository URLs in Parcel Settings as described in Parcel Configuration Settings. note If your
            Cloudera Manager Server does not have Internet access, you can use the Livy parcel
            files: put them into a new parcel repository, and then configure the Cloudera Manager
            Server to target this newly created repository. 
 Download the CDS 3.3 parcel, distribute
          the parcel to the hosts in your cluster, and activate the parcel. For instructions, see
            Managing Parcels. 
 Add the Livy for Spark 3 service to your cluster. 
 Note that the Livy port is 28998 instead of the usual 8998. 
 Complete the remaining steps in the wizard. 

 Return to the Home page by clicking the
          Cloudera Manager logo in the upper left corner. 
 Click the stale configuration icon to launch the Stale
          Configuration wizard and restart the necessary services. 

If you want to activate the CDS 3.3 with GPU Support feature, Set up a Yarn role group to enable GPU usage and optionally Configure NVIDIA RAPIDS Shuffle Manager
