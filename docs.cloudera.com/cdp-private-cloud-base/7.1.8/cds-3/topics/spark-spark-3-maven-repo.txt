Using the CDS 3.3 Powered by Apache Spark Maven Repository

important
CDS 3.3 Powered by Apache Spark (CDS 3.3) does not include an assembly JAR. When
      you build an application JAR, do not include Cloudera Runtime or CDS JARs, because they
      are already provided. If you do, upgrading Cloudera Runtime or CDS can break your application.
      To avoid this situation, set the Maven dependency scope to
        provided. If you have already built applications which include the Cloudera
      Runtime or CDS JARs, update the dependency to set scope to
        provided and recompile. 
 If you want to build applications or tools for use with CDS 3.3, and you are using Maven or Ivy for
      dependency management, you can pull the CDS artifacts from the Cloudera Maven repository. The
      repository is available at https://repository.cloudera.com/artifactory/cloudera-repos/.
