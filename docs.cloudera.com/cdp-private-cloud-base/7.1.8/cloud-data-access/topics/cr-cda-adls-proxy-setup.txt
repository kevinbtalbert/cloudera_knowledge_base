ADLS Proxy Setup
The ADLS connector uses the JVM proxy settings to control its proxy
        setup.
The Oracle Java documentation covers the options to set.

As the ADLS connector uses HTTPS, the https.proxy options are those which
        must be configured. See DistCp and Proxy Settings
            for the specifics of how to set these proxy settings in DistCp (or indeed, any MapReduce
            job).
