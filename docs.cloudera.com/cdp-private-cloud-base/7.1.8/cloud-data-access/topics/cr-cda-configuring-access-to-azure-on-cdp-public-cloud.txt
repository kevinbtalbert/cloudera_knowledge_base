Configuring Access to Azure on CDP Public Cloud
IDBroker is a REST API built as part of Apache Knox’s authentication services. It allows an authenticated user to exchange a set of credentials or 
    a token for cloud vendor access tokens. IDBroker manages mapping LDAP users to FreeIPA cloud identities for data access. It performs identity mapping 
    for access to object stores.
For information on how IDBroker works in CDP, see ADLS Gen2 and managed identities in the
        Management Console documentation.
