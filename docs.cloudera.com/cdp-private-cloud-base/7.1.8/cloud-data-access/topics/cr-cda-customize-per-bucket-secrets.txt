Customizing Per-Bucket Secrets Held in Credential Files
JCEKs credential files support the same per-bucket settings as those in XML files. To
        provide different credentials for different buckets, simply create par-bucket entries in the
        JCEKS file with the relevant secrets.
Example


Set base properties for fs.s3a.secret.key and
                            fs.s3a.access.key in the JCEKS file. These will be the
                        default.
Set all non-security properties per-bucket for a bucket called "frankfurt-1"
                        in the core-site.xml. These will override the base
                        properties when talking to the bucket "frankfurt-1".
For the AWS authentication secrets, set the
                            fs.s3a.frankfurt-1.access.key and
                            fs.s3a.frankfurt-1.secret.key properties in the JCEKS
                        file.
