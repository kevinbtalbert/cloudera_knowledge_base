Enabling SSE-KMS
To enable SSE-KMS, the property
      fs.s3a.server-side-encryption-algorithm must be set to SSE-KMS in
      core-site.xml.
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.server-side-encryption-algorithm</name>
  <value>SSE-KMS</value>
</property>

The ID of the specific key used to encrypt the data should also be set in the property
        fs.s3a.server-side-encryption.key:
<property>
<name>fs.s3a.server-side-encryption.key</name>
<value>arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:360379543683:key/071a86ff-8881-4ba0-9230-95af6d01ca01</value>
</property>

If your account is set up set up with a default KMS key and
        fs.s3a.server-side-encryption.key is unset, the default key will be
      used.
Alternatively, organizations may define a default key in the Amazon KMS; if a default key is
      set, then it will be used whenever SSE-KMS encryption is chosen and the value of
      fs.s3a.server-side-encryption.key is empty.noteAWS Key Management Service (KMS) is pay-per-use,
        working with data encrypted via KMS keys incurs extra charges during data I/O.
To learn more, refer to Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys
        (SSE-KMS) in the AWS documentation.noteThe AWS KMS key used must be in the same
        region as the S3 Bucket where the data is being encrypted.noteThe KMS key specified
        is only used when writing new data, or when renaming objects. When reading an existing
        object, whichever KMS key was used to encrypt the data is reused to decrypt it.
