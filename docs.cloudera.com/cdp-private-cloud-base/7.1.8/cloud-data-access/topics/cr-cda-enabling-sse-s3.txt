Enabling SSE-S3
To write S3-SSE encrypted files, the value of
      fs.s3a.server-side-encryption-algorithm must be set to that of the encryption
    mechanism used in core-site.xml; currently only AES256 is
    supported.
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.server-side-encryption-algorithm</name>
  <value>AES256</value>
</property>
Once set, all new data will be uploaded encrypted. There is no need to set this
          property when downloading data â€” the data will be automatically decrypted when read
          using the Amazon S3-managed key.
To learn more, refer to Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys
          (SSE-S3) in AWS documentation.
noteWhen encrypted files are renamed, they are de-encrypted and then re-encrypted with the
      encryption settings algorithm of the client application performing the rename. If a client
        with encryption disabled renames an encrypted file, the new file will be
      unencrypted.
