Importing a Bucket into S3Guard
The hadoop s3guard import command can list and import a bucket's
    metadata into a S3Guard table. This is harmless if the contents are already
    imported.
hadoop s3guard import s3a://guarded-table/

2019-07-31 21:32:54,600 [main] INFO s3guard.S3GuardTool (S3GuardTool.java:initMetadataStore(321)) - Metadata store DynamoDBMetadataStore{region=eu-west-2, tableName=guarded-table, tableArn=arn:aws:dynamodb:eu-west-2:980678866538:table/guarded-table} is initialized.
Inserted 2 items into Metadata Store
You do not need to issue this command after creating a table; the data is added as
    listings of S3 paths find new entries. It merely saves by proactively building up the
    database.
