Improving Performance for S3A
You can consider various options for improving performance when working with data
    stored in Amazon S3.
The bandwidth between the CDP cluster and Amazon S3 is the upper limit to how fast data can
      be copied into S3. The further the CDP cluster is from the Amazon S3 installation, or the
      narrower the network connection is, the longer the operation will take. Even a CDP cluster
      deployed within Amazon's own infrastructure may encounter network delays from throttled VM
      network connections.
Network bandwidth limits notwithstanding, there are some options which can be used to tune
      the performance of an upload:

Configuring and tuning S3A block upload


Working with S3 buckets in the same AWS regionA foundational step to getting good performance is working with buckets close to     the Hadoop cluster, where "close" is measured in network terms.Configuring and tuning S3A block uploadBecause of the nature of the S3 object store, data written to an S3A       OutputStream is not written incrementally â€” instead, by default, it is     buffered to disk until the stream is closed in its close() method. This can     make output slow because the execution time for OutputStream.close() is     proportional to the amount of data buffered and inversely proportional to the bandwidth between     the host to S3; that is O(data/bandwidth). Optimizing S3A read performance for different file typesThe S3A filesystem client supports the notion of input policies, similar to that of     the POSIX fadvise() API call. This tunes the behavior of the S3A client to     optimize HTTP GET requests for reading different filetypes. To optimize HTTP GET requests, you     can take advantage of the S3A input policy option       fs.s3a.experimental.input.fadvise.S3 Performance ChecklistThere are various types of checklists that you can use to ensure optimal performance     when working with data in S3.Parent topic: Working with Amazon S3
