Monitoring and Maintaining S3Guard
The DynamoDB console on AWS allows you to monitor the workload on
    DynamoDB.

If you are not using auto scaling, the AWS console allows you to adjust the read/write
        capacities of the table. The command hadoop s3guard set-capacity can also
        be used to alter these values.
