Performance Impact of Encryption
Server Side encryption slightly slows down performance when reading data from S3,
    both in the reading of data during the execution of a query, and in scanning the files prior to
    the actual scheduling of work.
Amazon throttles reads and writes of S3-SSE data, which results in a
      significantly lower throughput than normal S3 IO requests. The default rate, 600
      requests/minute, means that at most ten objects per second can be read or written using
      SSE-KMS per second — across an entire hadoop cluster (or the entire customer account).
      The default limits may be suitable during development — but in large scale production
      applications the limits may rapidly be reached. Contact Amazon to increase capacity.
