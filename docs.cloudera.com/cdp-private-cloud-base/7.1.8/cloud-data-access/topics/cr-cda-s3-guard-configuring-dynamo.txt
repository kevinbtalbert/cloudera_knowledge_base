Choosing a DynamoDB Table and IO Capacity
When using DynamoDB, you must pay for the IO as well as the data storage: reads,
            writes and queries. 
You can do this in two ways:

Provisioned Capacity - You configure the DynamoDB table for a maximum
                        number of reads and writes a second. You are then billed for this capacity
                        for the life of the database, even when not using S3Guard. You are also
                        limited to the maximum IO throughput of that provisioned capacity. This was
                        originally the only billing mechanism for DynamoDB. Choosing an IO capacity
                        was hard, as you needed to balance maximum throughput (usually Hive query
                        planning) with the costs that would entail.
On demand- When a table is created as an On demand
                              table, you pay per IO operation. There is no monthly fee for
                        pre-provisioned IO capacity, and your throughput is not limited to that
                        prepaid capacity. You are, however, billed slightly more for each individual
                        IO Operation.

For Cloudera applications, an on demand billing mechanism is needed.
                  When a bucket and its S3Guard table is unused, the sole dynamo DB costs are for
                  storing the file metadata, not for any unused IO. Only when an application work
                  with a S3Guard table, the caller is billed.
In CDP environments, S3Guard tables are always configured for on-demand billing. If
                  you want to switch to provisioned IO capacity, you can configure using the AWS DynamoDB console.
