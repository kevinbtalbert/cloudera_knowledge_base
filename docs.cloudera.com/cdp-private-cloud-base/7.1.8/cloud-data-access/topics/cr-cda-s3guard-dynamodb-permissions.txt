Creating DynamoDB Access Policy 
In order to configure S3Guard, you must provide read and write permissions for the
            DynamoDB table that S3Guard will create and use.
To do this, you must add a DynamoDB access
            policy to your IAM role using the following
                  steps:


Log in to your AWS account and navigate to the Identity and Access Management (IAM)
                        console.


In the IAM console, select Roles from the left
                        pane.


Search for an IAM role that you want to update:





Click on the role.


In the Permissions tab, click Create Role
                        Policy:





Click Select next to the Policy Generator:





Enter the following:

Click Add Statement.


Click Next Step.


On the Review Policy page, review your new policy and
                              then click Apply Policy:





Now the policy will be attached to your IAM role and your cluster will be able to talk
            to DynamoDB, including creating a table for S3 metadata when S3Guard is configured.
You must also configure S3Guard in
            Cloudera Manager.
