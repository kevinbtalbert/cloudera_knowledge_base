SSE-C: Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Encryption Keys
In SSE-C, the client supplies the secret key needed to read and write
    data.
The same SSE-C key must be used on all clients reading or writing the data; this must be set
      client-side, in the hadoop configuration.
For hadoop applications to work reliably, SSE-C with a common key must be used
      exclusively within a bucket if it is to be used at all. This is the only way to ensure that
      path and directory listings do not fail with "Bad Request" errors.
Enabling SSE-CTo use SSE-C, the configuration option       fs.s3a.server-side-encryption-algorithm must be set to     SSE-C, and a base-64 encoding of the key placed in       fs.s3a.server-side-encryption.key.Parent topic: Encrypting Data on S3
