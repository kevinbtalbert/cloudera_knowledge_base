SSE-S3: Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys
In SSE-S3, all keys and secrets are managed inside S3. This is the simplest
    encryption mechanism.Enabling SSE-S3To write S3-SSE encrypted files, the value of       fs.s3a.server-side-encryption-algorithm must be set to that of the encryption     mechanism used in core-site.xml; currently only AES256 is     supported.Parent topic: Encrypting Data on S3
