Using EC2 Instance Metadata to Authenticate
If your cluster is running on EC2, the standard way to manage access is via Amazon Identity and Access
      Management (IAM),which allows you to create users, groups, and roles to control access
    to services such as Amazon S3 via attached policies. 
A role does not have any credentials such as password or access keys associated with it.
      Instead, if a user is assigned to a role, access keys are generated dynamically and provided
      to the user when needed. For more information, refer to IAM Roles for Amazon EC2 in Amazon
      documentation.
When launching your cluster on EC2, specify an IAM role that you want to use; if you are
      planning to use S3 with your cluster, make sure that the role associated with the cluster
      includes a policy that grants access to S3. For more information, refer to Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to Applications
        Running on Amazon EC2 InstancesÂ in Amazon documentation. No additional configuration
      is required.noteYou can use IAM Roles to control access to keys stored in Amazon's KMS Key
        Management service. For more information, refer to Overview of Managing Access to Your AWS KMS
          Resources in Amazon documentation.
