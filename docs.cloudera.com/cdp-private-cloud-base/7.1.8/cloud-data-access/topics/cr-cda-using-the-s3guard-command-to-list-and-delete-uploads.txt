Using the S3Guard Command to List and Delete Uploads
The hadoop s3guard uploads command can also be used to list all
    outstanding uploads under a path, and delete them. 
hadoop s3guard uploads s3a://guarded-bucket/
tests3ascale/scale/hugefile nB3gctgP34ZSpzJ5_o2AVb7kKRiicXfbkBqIflA0y.IH7CimH1O0VUzohRCj3QfFstoQIdcge478ZidXu764yN0vuGI1j5kcOV3rDhsrc.RBZ5skZ93jVCN9g2c21QgB
