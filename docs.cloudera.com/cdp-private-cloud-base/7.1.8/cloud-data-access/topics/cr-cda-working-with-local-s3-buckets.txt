Working with S3 buckets in the same AWS region
A foundational step to getting good performance is working with buckets close to
    the Hadoop cluster, where "close" is measured in network terms.
Maximum performance is achieved from working with S3 buckets in the same AWS region as
          the cluster. For example, if your cluster is in North Virginia ("US East"), you will
          achieve best performance if your S3 bucket is in the same region.
In addition to improving performance, working with local buckets ensures that no bills
          are incurred for reading from the bucket.
