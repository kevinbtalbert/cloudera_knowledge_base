Cloudera Manager for Private Cloud


Cloudera Manager is an application you use to manage, configure, and
monitor CDP Private Cloud Base clusters and Cloudera Runtime services.
The Cloudera Manager server runs on a host in your CDP Private Cloud
Base deployment and manages one or more clusters using Cloudera Manager
Agents that run on each host in the cluster.
The Cloudera Manager Admin Console is a web application administrators
and others can use to manage CDP Private Cloud Base deployments. Using
the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, you can start and stop the cluster
and individual services, configure and add new services, manage
security, and upgrade the cluster. You can also use the Cloudera Manager
API to programmatically perform management tasks.
