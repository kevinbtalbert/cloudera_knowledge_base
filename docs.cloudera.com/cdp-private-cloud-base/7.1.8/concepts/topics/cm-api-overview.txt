Cloudera Manager API
The Cloudera Manager API provides configuration and service
    lifecycle management, service health information and metrics, and allows you
    to configure Cloudera Manager itself. 
The Cloudera Manager API is served on the same host and
      port as the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, and does not require an extra
      process or extra configuration. The API supports HTTP Basic
      Authentication, accepting the same users and credentials as the Cloudera
      Manager Admin Console.
You can also access the Cloudera Manager Swagger API user interface from
      the Cloudera Manager Admin Console. Go to
          Support > API
          Explorer to open Swagger.
You can view the Cloudera Manager REST API documentation from the Cloudera
      Manager Admin Console:
Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
Select Support > API Documentation
