Host Management
Cloudera Manager provides several features to manage the hosts in
    your clusters
The first time you run Cloudera Manager Admin Console
      you can search for hosts to add to the cluster and once the hosts are
      selected you can map the assignment of roles to hosts. Cloudera Manager
      automatically deploys all software required to participate as a managed
      host in a cluster: JDK, Cloudera Manager Agent, Impala, Solr, and so on to
      the hosts.
Once the
      services are deployed and running, the Hosts area within the Admin Console shows the overall
      status of the managed hosts in your cluster. The information provided includes the version of
      Cloudera Runtime running on the host, the cluster to which the host belongs, and the number of
      roles running on the host. Cloudera Manager provides operations to manage the lifecycle of the
      participating hosts and to add and delete hosts. The Cloudera Management Service Host Monitor
      role performs health tests and collects host metrics to allow you to monitor the health and
      performance of the hosts.
