Process Management
Starting and stopping processes using Cloudera
    Manager.
In a Cloudera Manager managed
      cluster, you can only start or stop role instance processes using Cloudera
      Manager. Cloudera Manager uses an open source process management tool
      called supervisord, that
      starts processes, takes care of redirecting log files, notifying of
      process failure, setting the effective user ID of the calling process to
      the right user, and so on. Cloudera Manager supports automatically
      restarting a crashed process. It will also flag a role instance with a bad
      health flag if its process crashes repeatedly right after start up.
Stopping the Cloudera Manager Server and the Cloudera Manager Agents
        will not bring down your services; any running role instances keep
        running.
The Agent is started by init.d at start-up. It, in turn,
        contacts the Cloudera Manager Server and determines which processes should be running. The
        Agent is monitored as part of Cloudera Manager's host monitoring. If the Agent stops
        heartbeating, the host is marked as having bad health.
One of the Agent's main responsibilities is to start
        and stop processes. When the Agent detects a new process from the Server
        heartbeat, the Agent creates a directory for it in
          /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent and unpacks the
        configuration. It then contacts supervisord, which
        starts the process. 
These actions reinforce an important point: a Cloudera Manager process
        never travels alone. In other words, a process is more than just the
        arguments to exec()â€”it also includes configuration
        files, directories that need to be created, and other information.
