Virtual Private Clusters and Cloudera SDX
A Virtual Private Cluster uses the Cloudera Shared Data Experience
    (SDX) to simplify deployment of both on-premise and cloud-based applications
    and enable workloads running in different clusters to securely and flexibly
    share data. 
The architecture of a Virtual Private Cluster provides many advantages
      for deploying workloads and sharing data among applications, including a
      shared catalog, unified security, consistent governance, and data
      lifecycle management. 
In traditional cluster deployments, a Regular cluster contains
      storage nodes, compute nodes, and other services such as metadata services
      and security services that are collocated in a single cluster. This
      traditional architecture provides many advantages where computational
      services such as Impala and YARN can access collocated data sources such
      as HDFS or Hive.
With Virtual Private Clusters and the SDX framework, a new type of
      cluster is available in Cloudera Manager called a Compute cluster. 
      A Compute cluster runs computational services such as Hive Execution
      Service, Spark, or YARN but you configure these services to access data
      hosted in another Regular cluster, called the Base cluster. Using
      this architecture, you can separate compute and storage resources in a
      variety of ways to flexibly maximize resources.

Advantages of Separating Compute and Data ResourcesSeparating compute and data resources in a Virtual Private Cluster     has important advantages for many workloads.ArchitectureIf you are creating Virtual Private Clusters, it is important to     understand the architecture of compute clusters and how they related to Data     contexts. Performance Trade OffsLearning about the types of workloads appropriate for Virtual     Private Clusters can help you decide if this architecture is appropriate for     your needs.
