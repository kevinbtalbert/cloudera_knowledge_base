Advantages of Separating Compute and Data Resources
Separating compute and data resources in a Virtual Private Cluster
    has important advantages for many workloads.
Architectures that separate compute resources from data resources can
      provide many advantages for a CDP deployment:

More options for deploying computational and storage resources
You can selectively deploy resources using on-premise servers,
            containers, virtual machines, or cloud resources that are tailored
            for the workload. When you configure a Compute cluster, you can
            provision hardware that is more appropriate for computational
            workloads while the Base cluster can use hardware that emphasizes
            storage capacity. Cloudera recommends that each cluster use similar
            hardware.
Software resources can be optimized to best use computational and
            storage resources.


Ephemeral clusters 
When deploying clusters on cloud infrastructure, having separate
          clusters for compute and storage allows you to temporarily shut down
          the compute clusters and avoid unnecessary expense -- while still
          leaving the data available to other applications.

Workload Isolation
Compute clusters can help to resolve resource conflicts among
            users accessing the cluster. Longer running or resource intensive
            workloads can be isolated to run in dedicated compute clusters that
            do not interfere with other workloads.
Resources can be grouped into clusters that allow IT to allocate
            costs to the teams that use the resources.
