User Management
Access to Cloudera Manager features is controlled by user
    accounts. A user account identifies how a user is authenticated and
    determines what privileges are granted to the user.
Cloudera Manager provides several mechanisms for
      authenticating users. You can configure Cloudera Manager to authenticate
      users against the Cloudera Manager database or against an external
      authentication service. The external authentication service can be an LDAP
      server (Active Directory or an OpenLDAP compatible directory), or you can
      specify another external service. Cloudera Manager also supports using the
      Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) to enable single sign-on.
For information about the privileges associated with
      each of the Cloudera Manager user roles, see Cloudera Manager User Roles.
