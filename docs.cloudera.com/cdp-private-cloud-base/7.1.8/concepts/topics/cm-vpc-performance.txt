Performance Trade Offs
Learning about the types of workloads appropriate for Virtual
    Private Clusters can help you decide if this architecture is appropriate for
    your needs. Throughput
Because data will be accessed over network connections to other
        clusters, this architecture may not be appropriate for workloads that
        scan large amounts of data. These types of workloads may run better on
        Regular clusters where compute and storage are collocated and features
        such as Impala short-circuit reads can provide improved performance.
You can evaluate the networking performance using the Network Performance
        Inspector.
Ephemeral Clusters
For deployments where the Compute clusters are shut down or suspended
        when they are not needed, cluster services that collect historical data
        do not collect data when the Compute clusters are off-line, and the
        history is not available to users. This affects services such as the
        Spark History Server and the YARN JobHistory Server. When the Compute
        cluster restarts, the previous history will be available.
