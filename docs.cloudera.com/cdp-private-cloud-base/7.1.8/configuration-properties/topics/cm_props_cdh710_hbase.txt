Rules to Extract Events from Log Files

Description
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not specified, the default is "false".rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is unlimited.periodminutes  - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified, the default is one minutethreshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.Example:{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Role Triggers

Description
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health system.

Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files

Description
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not specified, the default is "false".rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is unlimited.periodminutes  - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified, the default is one minutethreshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.Example:{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Role Triggers

Description
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files

Description
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not specified, the default is "false".rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is unlimited.periodminutes  - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified, the default is one minutethreshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.Example:{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files

Description
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not specified, the default is "false".rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is unlimited.periodminutes  - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified, the default is one minutethreshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.Example:{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Role Triggers

Description
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

HBase Memstore Pre-close Flush Size

Description
If the memstores in a region are this size or larger when closing, run a pre-flush process to clear out memstores before putting up the region closed flag and taking the region offline. On close, a flush process is run under the close flag up to empty memory. During this time, the region is offline and no writes are taken. If the memstore content is large, the flush process could take a long time to complete. The pre-flush process cleans out the bulk of the memstore before putting up the close flag and taking the region offline, so that the flush process that runs under the close flag has little to do.

HStore Compaction Threshold

Description
If this number of HStoreFiles in any one HStore is exceeded, then a compaction is run to rewrite all HStoreFiles files as one HStoreFile. (One HStoreFile is written per flush of memstore.) You can delay compaction by specifying a larger number, but the compaction will take longer when it does run. During a compaction, updates cannot be flushed to disk. Long compactions require memory sufficient to carry the logging of all updates across the duration of the compaction. If too large, clients timeout during compaction.

Audit Event Filter

Description

Event filters are defined in a JSON object like the following:



{
  "defaultAction" : ("accept", "discard"),
  "rules" : [
    {
      "action" : ("accept", "discard"),
      "fields" : [
        {
          "name" : "fieldName",
          "match" : "regex"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}



A filter has a default action and a list of rules, in order of precedence.
Each rule defines an action, and a list of fields to match against the
audit event.



A rule is "accepted" if all the listed field entries match the audit
event. At that point, the action declared by the rule is taken.



If no rules match the event, the default action is taken. Actions
default to "accept" if not defined in the JSON object.



The following is the list of fields that can be filtered for HBase events:


allowed: whether the operation was allowed or denied.
username: the user performing the action.
tableName: the table affected by the operation.
family: the column family affected by the operation.
qualifier: the qualifier the operation.
action: the action being performed.



The default HBase audit event filter discards events that affect the internal
-ROOT-, .META. and _acl_ tables.

Audit Event Tracker

Description

Configures the rules for event tracking and coalescing. This feature is
used to define equivalency between different audit events. When
events match, according to a set of configurable parameters, only one
entry in the audit list is generated for all the matching events.



Tracking works by keeping a reference to events when they first appear,
and comparing other incoming events against the "tracked" events according
to the rules defined here.


Event trackers are defined in a JSON object like the following:


{
  "timeToLive" : [integer],
  "fields" : [
    {
      "type" : [string],
      "name" : [string]
    }
  ]
}



Where:



timeToLive: maximum amount of time an event will be tracked, in
  milliseconds. Must be provided. This defines how long, since it's
  first seen, an event will be tracked. A value of 0 disables tracking.
fields: list of fields to compare when matching events against
  tracked events.



Each field has an evaluator type associated with it. The evaluator defines
how the field data is to be compared. The following evaluators are
available:



value: uses the field value for comparison.
username: treats the field value as a user name, and ignores any
  host-specific data. This is useful for environment using Kerberos,
  so that only the principal name and realm are compared.



The following is the list of fields that can used to compare HBase events:



operation: the HBase operation being performed.
username: the user performing the action.
ipAddress: the IP from where the request originated.
allowed: whether the operation was allowed or denied.
tableName: the name of the table affected by the operation.
family: the column family affected by the operation.
qualifier: the qualifier of the operation.



The default event tracker for HBase services defines equality by comparing the
username, operation, table name, family, and qualifier of the events.

Service Triggers

Description
The configured triggers for this service. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific service. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger fires if there are more than 10 DataNodes with more than 500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType = DataNode and last(fd_open) > 500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 10, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.
