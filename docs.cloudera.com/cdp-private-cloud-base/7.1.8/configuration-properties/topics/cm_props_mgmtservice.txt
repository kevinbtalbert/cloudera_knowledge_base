Rules to Extract Events from Log Files

Description
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not specified, the default is "false".rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is unlimited.periodminutes  - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified, the default is one minutethreshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.Example:{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Role Triggers

Description
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files

Description
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not specified, the default is "false".rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is unlimited.periodminutes  - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified, the default is one minutethreshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.Example:{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Metric Filter

Description
Defines a Metric Filter for this role. Cloudera Manager Agents will not send filtered metrics to the Service Monitor. Define the following fields:Health Test Metric Set - Select this parameter to collect only metrics required for health tests.Default Dashboard Metric Set - Select this parameter to collect only metrics required for the default dashboards. For user-defined charts, you must add the metrics you require for the chart using the Custom Metrics parameter. Include/Exclude Custom Metrics  - Select Include to specify metrics that should be collected. Select Exclude to specify metrics that should not be collected. Enter the metric names to be included or excluded using the Metric Name parameter.Metric Name - The name of a metric that will be included or excluded during metric collection. If you do not select  Health Test Metric Set or Default Dashboard Metric Set, or specify metrics by name, metric filtering will be turned off (this is the default behavior).For example, the following configuration enables the collection of metrics required for Health Tests and the jvm_heap_used_mb metric:Include only Health Test Metric Set: Selected.Include/Exclude Custom Metrics: Set to Include.Metric Name: jvm_heap_used_mbYou can also view the JSON representation for this parameter by clicking View as JSON.

Role Triggers

Description
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files

Description
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not specified, the default is "false".rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is unlimited.periodminutes  - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified, the default is one minutethreshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.Example:{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Metric Filter

Description
Defines a Metric Filter for this role. Cloudera Manager Agents will not send filtered metrics to the Service Monitor. Define the following fields:Health Test Metric Set - Select this parameter to collect only metrics required for health tests.Default Dashboard Metric Set - Select this parameter to collect only metrics required for the default dashboards. For user-defined charts, you must add the metrics you require for the chart using the Custom Metrics parameter. Include/Exclude Custom Metrics  - Select Include to specify metrics that should be collected. Select Exclude to specify metrics that should not be collected. Enter the metric names to be included or excluded using the Metric Name parameter.Metric Name - The name of a metric that will be included or excluded during metric collection. If you do not select  Health Test Metric Set or Default Dashboard Metric Set, or specify metrics by name, metric filtering will be turned off (this is the default behavior).For example, the following configuration enables the collection of metrics required for Health Tests and the jvm_heap_used_mb metric:Include only Health Test Metric Set: Selected.Include/Exclude Custom Metrics: Set to Include.Metric Name: jvm_heap_used_mbYou can also view the JSON representation for this parameter by clicking View as JSON.

Role Triggers

Description
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Alert On Transitions Out of Alerting Health

Description
If set, the health events for transitions out of an alertable health level will also be considered an alert. For example, consider an entity that is configured to alert when it has bad health. If that entity's health becomes bad, an alert will be generated. If this setting is enabled, an alert will also be generated when it returns to good health. If this setting is disabled, then no alert will be generated when it returns to good health. Note that an entity must have enable_alerts set to true for health alerts to be generated for it.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files

Description
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not specified, the default is "false".rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is unlimited.periodminutes  - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified, the default is one minutethreshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.Example:{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Metric Filter

Description
Defines a Metric Filter for this role. Cloudera Manager Agents will not send filtered metrics to the Service Monitor. Define the following fields:Health Test Metric Set - Select this parameter to collect only metrics required for health tests.Default Dashboard Metric Set - Select this parameter to collect only metrics required for the default dashboards. For user-defined charts, you must add the metrics you require for the chart using the Custom Metrics parameter. Include/Exclude Custom Metrics  - Select Include to specify metrics that should be collected. Select Exclude to specify metrics that should not be collected. Enter the metric names to be included or excluded using the Metric Name parameter.Metric Name - The name of a metric that will be included or excluded during metric collection. If you do not select  Health Test Metric Set or Default Dashboard Metric Set, or specify metrics by name, metric filtering will be turned off (this is the default behavior).For example, the following configuration enables the collection of metrics required for Health Tests and the jvm_heap_used_mb metric:Include only Health Test Metric Set: Selected.Include/Exclude Custom Metrics: Set to Include.Metric Name: jvm_heap_used_mbYou can also view the JSON representation for this parameter by clicking View as JSON.

Role Triggers

Description
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Time-Series Storage

Description
The approximate amount of disk space dedicated to storing time series and health data. Once the store has reached its maximum size, older data is deleted to make room for newer data. The disk usage is approximate because data is deleted only when the limit is reached.Note that Cloudera Manager stores time-series data at a number of different data granularities, and these granularities have different effective retention periods. Specifically, Cloudera Manager stores metric data as both raw data points and ten-minutely, hourly, six-hourly, daily, and weekly summary data points. Raw data consumes the bulk of the allocated storage space, weekly summaries the least. As such, raw data is retained for the shortest amount of time, while weekly summary points are unlikely to ever be deleted.See the "Storage" tab on the 'Host Monitor' -> 'Charts Library' -> 'Host Monitor Storage' page for more information on how space is consumed within the Host Monitor. This tab also shows information about the amount of data retained and time window covered by each data granularity.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files

Description
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not specified, the default is "false".rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is unlimited.periodminutes  - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified, the default is one minutethreshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.Example:{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Audit Event Filter

Description

Event filters are defined in a JSON object like the following:



{
  "defaultAction" : ("accept", "discard"),
  "rules" : [
    {
      "action" : ("accept", "discard"),
      "fields" : [
        {
          "name" : "fieldName",
          "match" : "regex"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}



A filter has a default action and a list of rules, in order of precedence.
Each rule defines an action, and a list of fields to match against the
audit event.



A rule is "accepted" if all the listed field entries match the audit
event. At that point, the action declared by the rule is taken.



If no rules match the event, the default action is taken. Actions
default to "accept" if not defined in the JSON object.



The following is the list of fields that can be filtered for NAVMS events:



operation: Navigator operation performed e.g. auditReport, savedSearch etc.
username: the user performing the action.
ipAddress: the IP from where the request originated.
allowed: whether the operation was allowed or denied.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files

Description
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not specified, the default is "false".rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is unlimited.periodminutes  - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified, the default is one minutethreshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.Example:{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

If a log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not specified, the default is "false".rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is unlimited.periodminutes  - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified, the default is one minutethreshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.Example:{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files

Description
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not specified, the default is "false".rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is unlimited.periodminutes  - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified, the default is one minutethreshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.Example:{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Metric Filter

Description
Defines a Metric Filter for this role. Cloudera Manager Agents will not send filtered metrics to the Service Monitor. Define the following fields:Health Test Metric Set - Select this parameter to collect only metrics required for health tests.Default Dashboard Metric Set - Select this parameter to collect only metrics required for the default dashboards. For user-defined charts, you must add the metrics you require for the chart using the Custom Metrics parameter. Include/Exclude Custom Metrics  - Select Include to specify metrics that should be collected. Select Exclude to specify metrics that should not be collected. Enter the metric names to be included or excluded using the Metric Name parameter.Metric Name - The name of a metric that will be included or excluded during metric collection. If you do not select  Health Test Metric Set or Default Dashboard Metric Set, or specify metrics by name, metric filtering will be turned off (this is the default behavior).For example, the following configuration enables the collection of metrics required for Health Tests and the jvm_heap_used_mb metric:Include only Health Test Metric Set: Selected.Include/Exclude Custom Metrics: Set to Include.Metric Name: jvm_heap_used_mbYou can also view the JSON representation for this parameter by clicking View as JSON.

Role Triggers

Description
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Time-Series Storage

Description
The approximate amount of disk space dedicated to storing time series and health data. Once the store has reached its maximum size, older data is deleted to make room for newer data. The disk usage is approximate because data is deleted only when the limit is reached.Note that Cloudera Manager stores time-series data at a number of different data granularities, and these granularities have different effective retention periods. Specifically, Cloudera Manager stores metric data as both raw data points and ten-minutely, hourly, six-hourly, daily, and weekly summary data points. Raw data consumes the bulk of the allocated storage space, weekly summaries the least. As such, raw data is retained for the shortest amount of time, while weekly summary points are unlikely to ever be deleted.See the "Storage" tab on the 'Service Monitor' -> 'Charts Library' -> 'Service Monitor Storage' page for more information on how space is consumed within the Service Monitor. This tab also shows information about the amount of data retained and time window covered by each data granularity.

Service Triggers

Description
The configured triggers for this service. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific service. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger fires if there are more than 10 DataNodes with more than 500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType = DataNode and last(fd_open) > 500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 10, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files

Description
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not specified, the default is "false".rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is unlimited.periodminutes  - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified, the default is one minutethreshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.Example:{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Metric Filter

Description
Defines a Metric Filter for this role. Cloudera Manager Agents will not send filtered metrics to the Service Monitor. Define the following fields:Health Test Metric Set - Select this parameter to collect only metrics required for health tests.Default Dashboard Metric Set - Select this parameter to collect only metrics required for the default dashboards. For user-defined charts, you must add the metrics you require for the chart using the Custom Metrics parameter. Include/Exclude Custom Metrics  - Select Include to specify metrics that should be collected. Select Exclude to specify metrics that should not be collected. Enter the metric names to be included or excluded using the Metric Name parameter.Metric Name - The name of a metric that will be included or excluded during metric collection. If you do not select  Health Test Metric Set or Default Dashboard Metric Set, or specify metrics by name, metric filtering will be turned off (this is the default behavior).For example, the following configuration enables the collection of metrics required for Health Tests and the jvm_heap_used_mb metric:Include only Health Test Metric Set: Selected.Include/Exclude Custom Metrics: Set to Include.Metric Name: jvm_heap_used_mbYou can also view the JSON representation for this parameter by clicking View as JSON.

Role Triggers

Description
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role. triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. enabled  (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.expressionEditorConfig  (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
  "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.
