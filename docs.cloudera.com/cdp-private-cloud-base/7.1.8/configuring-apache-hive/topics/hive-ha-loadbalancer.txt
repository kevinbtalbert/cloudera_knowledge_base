Configuring HiveServer high availability using a load balancer
To enable high availability for multiple HiveServer (HS2) hosts, you need to know how
        to configure a load balancer to manage them. First, you configure the Hive Delegation Token
        Store, next you add HiveServer roles, and finally, you configure the load
        balancer.

HiveServer HA does not automatically fail and retry long-running Hive queries. If any
                of the HiveServer instances fail, all queries running on that instance fail and are
                not retried. The client application must re-submit the queries. 
After you enable HiveServer2 high availability, existing Oozie jobs must be changed
                to reflect the HS2 address. On Kerberos-enabled clusters, you must use the load
                balancer's principal to connect to HS2 directly; otherwise, after you enable
                HiveServer2 high availability, direct connections to HiveServer2 instances fail.
            

Minimum Required Role: Configurator (also provided by Cluster Administrator,
            Full Administrator)

Configuring the Hive Delegation Token StoreYou need to enable Hive Delegation Token Store implementation as the first step in         configuring HiveServer high availability using a load balancer. You also need to understand         the interaction between Oozie and HS2 with regard to the delegation token.Adding a HiveServer roleYou can add a HiveServer (HS2) role to the Hive-on-Tez service, not to the Hive         service.Configuring the HiveServer load balancer Cloudera Manager exposes the HiveServer load balancer property. You see how to         access the property and set it.
