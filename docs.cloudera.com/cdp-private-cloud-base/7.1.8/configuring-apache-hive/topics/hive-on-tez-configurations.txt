Hive on Tez configurations
Understanding key Hive on Tez properties might help you tune performance or
    troubleshoot problems, such as running multiple TEZ Application Master (AM) when your default
    sessions configuration allows running only one. After upgrading, the number of default sessions
    allowed might be only one. Making Hive on Tez configuration changes is recommended for users who
    know what they are doing. 


Property and Default Value
Description
How to Check and Configure



hive.server2.tez.default.queues (default: "default")
A list of comma separated values corresponding to YARN queues for which to
              maintain a Tez session pool
Use the Cloudera Manager Safety Valve. When specifying additional queues, they
              must already exist in YARN.


hive.server2.tez.sessions.per.default.queue (default:1)

The number of Tez sessions (DAGAppMaster) to maintain in the pool per YARN
                queue
The total number of concurrent Tez session running can be calculated with:
(Tez Sessions)total = HiveServer2instances x
                  (default.queues) x (sessions.per.default.queue)
The pooled Tez Sessions are always running, even on an idle cluster.

Use the Cloudera Manager Safety Valve. A value of 1 means only one query can run
              at a time


hive.server2.tez.initialize.default.sessions (default: true)
If enabled, HiveServer (HS2), at startup, will launch all necessary Tez sessions
              within the specified default.queues to meet the
                sessions.per.default.queue requirements.
Use the Cloudera Manager Safety Valve.
