You can use statistics to optimize queries for improved performance. The cost-based
        optimizer (CBO) also uses statistics to compare query plans and choose the best one. By
        viewing statistics instead of running a query, you can often get answers to your data
        questions faster.

This task shows how to generate different types of statistics about a table.  


Launch a Hive shell or editor.

Gather table statistics for the non-partitioned table
                    mytable:
ANALYZE TABLE mytable COMPUTE STATISTICS;

View table statistics you generated:

DESCRIBE EXTENDED mytable;


Gather column-level statistics for the table:

ANALYZE TABLE mytable COMPUTE STATISTICS FOR COLUMNS;


View column statistics for the col_name column in
                        my_table in the my_db database:

DESCRIBE FORMATTED my_db.my_table col_name;
