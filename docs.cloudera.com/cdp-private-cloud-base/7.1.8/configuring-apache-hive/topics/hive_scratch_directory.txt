Removing scratch directories 
You need to know how to periodically clear scratch directories used by Apache Hive to
        prevent problems, such as failing jobs.

Scratch directories where Hive stores intermediate, or temporary, files accumulate
                too much data over time and overflow. You can configure Hive to remove scratch
                directories periodically and without user intervention. Using Cloudera Manager, you
                add the following properties as shown in the procedure:

hive.start.cleanup.scratchdir
 Value: true 
Cleans up the Hive scratch directory while starting the HiveServer.


hive.server2.clear.dangling.scratchdir
Value: true
Starts a thread in HiveServer to clear out the dangling directories
                        from the file system, such as HDFS.


hive.server2.clear.dangling.scratchdir.interval
Example Value: 1800s 



In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > Hive on Tez > Configuration. Clusters > Hive on Tez > Configuration.

Search for the Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                    for hive-site.xml setting.
                

In the Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                    hive-site.xml setting, click +.

InName enter the property name and in value enter the
                    value.
