Exporting the Cluster Configuration
To create a cluster template, you begin by exporting the configuration from the
    source cluster. The cluster must be running and managed by Cloudera Manager. 

Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
By default, Cloudera Manager redacts sensitive information from the
        exported configuration JSON file. If you need the ability to restore the
        cluster configuration, you must do one of the following:
Disable redaction. The JSON file will contain all the
            configurations, including sensitive information and can be used to
            restore the cluster configuration.
Replace the redacted information. The JSON will contain the
            word "REDACTED" where sensitive information was redacted. Replace
            these values with the correct values before restoring the cluster
            configuration.


(Optional) If you want to export the
          configuration without redaction, you can disable redaction by setting
          a JVM parameter:
Log in the Cloudera Manager server host using
            ssh.
Edit the
                /etc/default/cloudera-scm-server file by adding
              the following property (separate each property with a space) to
              the line that begins with export
                CMF_JAVA_OPTS.-Dcom.cloudera.api.redaction=falseFor
              example:export CMF_JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx2G -Dcom.cloudera.api.redaction=false"
Restart Cloudera Manager:
sudo service cloudera-scm-server restart


Any host templates you have created are used to export the configuration. If you do not
          want to use those templates in the new cluster, delete them. In Cloudera Manager, go to
              Hosts > Host
            Templates and click Delete next to the
          Host Template you want to delete.Delete any Host Templates created by the Cloudera Manager Installation Wizard. They
          typically have a name like Template - 1). Run the following command to download the JSON configuration file to a convenient
          location for
          editing:curl -u admin_username:admin_user_password
"http://Cloudera Manager URL/api/v49/clusters/Cluster name/export" >
path_to_file/file_name.jsonFor
            example:curl -u adminuser:adminpass "http://myCluster-1.myDomain.com:7180/api/v49/clusters/Cluster1/export" > myCluster1-template.jsonnoteAdd the ?exportAutoConfig=true parameter to the command above to include
            configurations made by Autoconfiguration. These configurations are included for
            reference only and are not used when you import the template into a new cluster. For
            example:
            curl -u admin_username:admin_user_password
"http://Cloudera Manager URL/api/v49/clusters/Cluster name/export?exportAutoConfig=true" >
path_to_file/file_name.jsonnote'The cluster from which you
            export the JSON configuration file may have been installed using
            either parcels or packages. You can determine the type of
            installation from the JSON configuration file by examining the first
            section. If there are entries for "repositories":
              [], or "products": [], , then the
            cluster was installed using parcels. Clusters installed using
            packages do not have these entries. For
              example:{
  "cdhVersion" : "5.15.0",
  "displayName" : "Cluster 1",
  "cmVersion" : "5.15.0",
  "repositories" : [ "http://my_cluster.com/cdh5/5.x/parcels", "http://my_cluster.com/cdh5/parcels/ ..."
  "products" : [ {
    "version" : "5.15.0-1.cdh5.15.0.p0.727055",
    "product" : "CDH"
  } ],
