Importing the Template to a New Cluster
Complete the steps below to import the cluster template.
You can only import
        a cluster template to create a new cluster that is running the same
        version of Cloudera Runtime as the cluster from which the template was
        exported.
(Optional) If you are restoring the  configuration from a
          redacted backup JSON file, you must replace all entries with the word
          "REDACTED" with the appropriate value. 
Log in to the Cloudera Manager server as root.Run the following command to import the template. If you have remote repository
          URLS configured in the source cluster, append the command with
            ?addRepositories=true.curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d
      @path_to_template/template_filename.json
http://admin_user:admin_password@cloudera_manager_url:cloudera_manager_port/api/v49/cm/importClusterTemplateYou
          should see a response similar to the
              following:{
  "id" : 17,
  "name" : "ClusterTemplateImport",
  "startTime" : "2020-03-09T23:44:38.491Z",
  "active" : true,
  "children" : {
    "items" : [ ]
  }Examples:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @myTemplate.json http://admin:admin@myNewCluster-1.mydomain.com:7182/api/v49/cm/importClusterTemplate
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @myTemplate.json http://admin:admin@myNewCluster-1.mydomain.com:7182/api/v49/cm/importClusterTemplate?addRepositories=trueIf
            there is no response, or you receive an error message, the JSON file
            may be malformed, or the template may have invalid hostnames or
            invalid references. Inspect the JSON file, correct any errors, and
            then re-run the command.
Open Cloudera Manager for the new cluster in a web browser and click the Cloudera
          Manager logo to go to the home page. Click the All Recent Commands tab.If the import
          is proceeding, you should see a link labeled Import Cluster
            Template. Click the link to view the progress of the import. If any of
            the commands fail, correct the problem and click Retry. You may
            need to edit some properties in Cloudera Manager. After you import the template,
          Cloudera Manager applies the Autoconfiguration rules that set properties such as memory
          and CPU allocations for various roles. If the new cluster has different hardware or
          operational requirements, you may need to modify these values.
