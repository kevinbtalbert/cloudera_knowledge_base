Using the Cloudera Manager API

The Cloudera Manager API provides configuration and
      service lifecycle management, service health information and metrics, and
      allows you to configure Cloudera Manager itself. The API is served on the
      same host and port as the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, and does not
      require an extra process or extra configuration. The API supports HTTP
      Basic Authentication, accepting the same users and credentials as the
      Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
You can also access the Cloudera Manager Swagger API user interface from
      the Cloudera Manager Admin Console. Go to
          Support > API
          Explorer to open Swagger.
