Disabling Redaction of sensitive information when using the Cloudera
    Manager API
By default, Cloudera Manager API redacts sensitive information
    when exporting configuration information. You can disable redaction. 

By default, Cloudera Manager redacts sensitive
        information from the exported configuration JSON file. If you need the
        ability to restore the Cloudera Manager configuration, you must do one
        of the following:
Disable redaction. The JSON file will contain all the
            configurations, including sensitive information and can be used to
            restore the Cloudera Manager configuration.
Replace the redacted information. The JSON will contain the
            word "REDACTED" where sensitive information was redacted. Replace
            these values with the correct values before restoring the Cloudera
            Manager configuration.

To disable redaction:

Log in the Cloudera Manager server host using ssh.
Edit the /etc/default/cloudera-scm-server file by
          adding the following property (separate each property with a space) to
          the line that begins with export
            CMF_JAVA_OPTS.-Dcom.cloudera.api.redaction=falseFor
          example:export CMF_JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx2G -Dcom.cloudera.api.redaction=false"Restart Cloudera Manager server:
sudo service cloudera-scm-server restart
