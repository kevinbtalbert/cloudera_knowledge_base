Backing up the Cloudera Manager configuration
Steps to export the Cloudera Manager configuration. 

Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
By default, Cloudera Manager redacts sensitive
        information from the exported configuration JSON file. If you need the
        ability to restore the Cloudera Manager configuration, you must do one
        of the following:
Disable redaction. The JSON file will contain all the
            configurations, including sensitive information and can be used to
            restore the Cloudera Manager configuration.
Replace the redacted information. The JSON will contain the
            word "REDACTED" where sensitive information was redacted. Replace
            these values with the correct values before restoring the Cloudera
            Manager configuration.


Exporting the Cloudera Manager Configuration(Optional) If you want to export the
          configuration without redaction, you can disable redaction by setting
          a JVM parameter:
Log in the Cloudera Manager server host using
            ssh.
Edit the
                /etc/default/cloudera-scm-server file by adding
              the following property (separate each property with a space) to
              the line that begins with export
                CMF_JAVA_OPTS.-Dcom.cloudera.api.redaction=falseFor
              example:export CMF_JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx2G -Dcom.cloudera.api.redaction=false"
Restart Cloudera Manager:
sudo service cloudera-scm-server restart

Export the Cloudera Manager configuration:
Log in to a host that has network access to the Cloudera
              Manager server host using ssh.
Run the following command:
# curl -u admin_uname:admin_pass "http://cm_server_host:7180/api/v49/cm/deployment" >
path_to_file/cm-deployment.json
Where:
admin_uname is a
                    username with either the Full Administrator or Cluster
                    Administrator role.
admin_pass is the
                    password for the admin_uname
                    username.
cm_server_host is the
                    hostname of the Cloudera Manager server. 
path_to_file is the
                    path to the file where you want to save the
                    configuration.
