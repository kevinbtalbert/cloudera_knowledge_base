Using the Cloudera Manager API to Set Advanced Configuration Snippets
    (Safety Valves)
You can use the Cloudera Manager API to set service configuration
    properties. 
You must have network access to the Cloudera Manager Admin
      Console. 

Find the name of the configuration property. 
Go to the Cloudera Manager Configuration
                Property Reference and navigate to the page for the
              Cloudera Runtime version and service you want to
            configure.
Search through the page for the Advanced Configuration
              Snippet property.
Copy the value of the API Name.
            

Determine whether the Advanced Configuration Snippet property
          is defined using name/value pairs or XML:
Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin
            Console.
Go to the service where you want to change the advanced
              configuration.
Click the Configuration
              tab.
Search for the Advanced Configuration Snippet
              property.

If the property is a text file using name/value pairs, the
                  description includes a View as text
                  link.


If the property is an XML file, the description includes a
                    View as XML link.



Log into a host with network access to the Cloudera Manager Admin
          Console using ssh, and run one of the following commands: 
Snippet is defined using name/value
            pairs:curl -X PUT -u username:password "Cloudera_Manager_server_name:Cloudera_Manager_server_port/api/v49/clusters/Cluster_name/services/service_name/config" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{  \"items\": [        {      \"name\": \"API-Name\",      \"value\": \"name=value\",      \"sensitive\": false    }  ]}"For
            example, the following command changes the value of the
              HDFS Replication Environment Advanced Configuration
              Snippet (Safety Valve) in the HDFS-1 service in
            Cluster 1 to test=2:
curl -X PUT -u admin:admin "http://myCMserver.com:7180/api/v49/clusters/Cluster%201/services/HDFS-1/config" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{  \"items\": [        {      \"name\": \"hdfs_replication_env_safety_valve\",      \"value\": \"test=2\",      \"sensitive\": false    }  ]}"Important:
            The value you enter overwrites all the contents of the Snippet, so
            you must also include any existing values. For example, if only the
            following value is currently configured: foo1=bar1,
            then to add an additional name/value pair, you must set the value
            like this:
            \"value\": \"foo1=bar1 foo2=bar2\"This
            command sets the Advanced Configuration Snippet to the
            following:foo1=bar1
foo2=bar2

Snippet is defined using
            XML:curl -X PUT -u username:password "Cloudera_Manager_server_name:Cloudera_Manager_server_port/api/v49/clusters/Cluster_name/services/service_name/config" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{  \"items\": [        {      \"name\": \"API-Name\",      \"value\": \"XML structure\",      \"sensitive\": false    }  ]}"For
            example:
            curl -X PUT -u admin:admin "http://myCMserver.com:7180/api/v49/clusters/Cluster%201/services/HDFS-1/config" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{  \"items\": [        {      \"name\": \"hdfs_replication_env_safety_valve\",      \"value\": \"<property><name>foo</name><value>bar</value><description>Example</description></property>\",      \"sensitive\": false    }  ]}"This
            call sets the Advanced Configuration Snippet to the
            following:<property>
  <name>foo</name>
  <value>bar</value>
  <description>Example</description>
</property>

Important: The value you enter overwrites all the
            contents of the Snippet, so you must also include any
            previously-existing <property>
            elements.


The configuration value has been changed.
