Custom Configuration

Minimum Required Role:
Configurator (also provided by
          Cluster Administrator,
Limited Cluster Administrator , and
          Full Administrator)
Cloudera Manager exposes properties that allow you to insert custom configuration text into XML configuration, property, and text files, or into an environment. The naming convention for these properties is: XXX
Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for YYY or XXX
YYY
Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve), where XXX is a service or role and YYY is the target.
The values you enter into a configuration snippet must conform to the syntax of
      the target. For an XML configuration file, the configuration snippet must
      contain valid XML property definitions. For a properties file, the
      configuration snippet must contain valid property definitions. Some files
      simply require a list of host addresses.
The configuration snippet mechanism is intended for use in cases where there is
      configuration setting that is not exposed as a configuration property in
      Cloudera Manager. Configuration snippets generally override normal
      configuration. Contact Cloudera Support if you are required to use a
      configuration snippet that is not explicitly documented.
Service-wide configuration snippets apply to all roles in the service; a
      configuration snippet for a role group applies to all instances of the
      role associated with that role group.
Server and client configurations have separate configuration snippets. In general after
      changing a server configuration snippet you must restart the server, and after changing a
      client configuration snippet you must redeploy the client configuration. Sometimes you can
      refresh instead of restart. In some cases however, you must restart a dependent server after
      changing a client configuration. For example, changing a MapReduce client configuration marks
      the dependent Hive server as stale, which must be restarted. The Admin Console displays an
      indicator when a server must be restarted. In addition, the All Configuration Issues tab on
      the Home page indicates the actions you must perform to resolve stale
      configurations.
Configuration Snippet Types and Syntax

Configuration
Set configuration properties in various configuration files; the property name
            indicates into which configuration file the configuration will be placed. Configuration
            files have the extension .xml or .conf.For example,
              there are several configuration snippets for the Hive service. One Hive configuration
              snippet property is called the HiveServer2 Advanced Configuration Snippet for
                hive-site.xml; configurations you enter here are inserted verbatim into the
                hive-site.xml file associated with the HiveServer2 role
              group.To see a list of configuration snippets that apply to a specific
              configuration file, enter the configuration file name in the Search field in the top
              navigation bar. For example, searching for mapred-site.xml shows the
              configuration snippets that have mapred-site.xml in their
              name.Some configuration snippet descriptions include the phrase for this
                role only. These configurations are stored in memory, and only inserted to the
              configuration when running an application from Cloudera Manager. Otherwise, the
              configuration changes are added to the configuration file on disk, and are used when
              running the application both from Cloudera Manager and from the command line.
Syntax:<property>
  <name>property_name</name> 
  <value>property_value</value>
</property>For
            example, to specify a MySQL connector library, put this property definition in that
            configuration
              snippet:<property>
  <name>hive.aux.jars.path</name> 
  <value>file:///usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar</value>
</property>If
              you do not set these properties in the correct syntax, then Cloudera Manager cannot
              parse the input XML and you may see an "Invalid XML" error as shown in the following
                image:



Environment
Specify key-value pairs for a service, role, or client that are inserted into the
            respective environment.One example of using an environment configuration snippet is
              to add a JAR to a classpath. Place JARs in a custom location such as
                /opt/myjars and extend the classpath using the appropriate service
              environment configuration snippet. The value of a JAR property must conform to the
              syntax supported by its environment. Do not place JARs inside locations such as
                /opt/cloudera or
                /usr/lib/{hadoop*,hbase*,hive*} that are managed
              by Cloudera because they are overwritten at upgrades.
Syntax:
key=value
For example, to add JDBC connectors to a Hive gateway classpath, add
              AUX_CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar:\
/usr/share/java/oracle-connector-java.jar
              or AUX_CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/* to Gateway Client Advanced
                Configuration Snippet for hive-env.sh.

Logging
Set log4j  properties in a log4j.properties file.
              Syntax:
key1=value1
key2=value2
            For example:
            log4j.rootCategory=INFO, console max.log.file.size=200MB
max.log.file.backup.index=10

Metrics
Set properties to configure Hadoop metrics in a
            hadoop-metrics.properties or
            hadoop-metrics2.properties file.
            Syntax:
key1=value1
key2=value2For example:*.sink.foo.class=org.apache.hadoop.metrics2.sink.FileSink
namenode.sink.foo.filename=/tmp/namenode-metrics.out
secondarynamenode.sink.foo.filename=/tmp/secondarynamenode-metrics.out

Whitelists and blacklists
Specify a list of host addresses that are allowed or disallowed from accessing a
            service.Syntax:
host1.domain1 host2.domain2
