Manually Redeploying Client Configuration Files

Although Cloudera Manager will deploy client configuration files
        automatically in many cases, if you have modified the configurations for
        a service, you may need to redeploy those configuration files.
If your client configurations were deployed automatically, the command
        described in this section will attempt to redeploy them as
        appropriate.
noteIf you are deploying client configurations on a host that has
        multiple services installed, some of the same configuration files,
        though with different configurations, will be installed in the
          conf directories for each service. Cloudera Manager
        uses the priority parameter in the alternatives
          --install command to ensure that the correct configuration
        directory is made active based on the combination of services on that
        host. The priority order is YARN > MapReduce > HDFS. The priority
        can be configured under the Gateway sections of the
          Configuration tab for the appropriate service.
On the Home > Status tab, click  to
          the right of the cluster name and select Deploy Client Configuration.Click Deploy Client Configuration.
