Modifying Configuration Properties Using Cloudera
    Manager
Using Cloudera Manager to modify cluster
    configurations.
When a
      service is added to Cloudera Manager, either through the installation or upgrade wizard or
      with the Add Services workflow, Cloudera Manager automatically sets the configuration
      properties, based on the needs of the service and characteristics of the cluster in which it
      will run. These configuration properties include both service-wide configuration properties,
      as well as specific properties for each role type associated with the service, managed through
      role groups. A role group is a set of configuration properties for a role type, as well as a
      list of role instances associated with that group. Cloudera Manager automatically creates a
      default role group named Role Type Default Group for each role type.
