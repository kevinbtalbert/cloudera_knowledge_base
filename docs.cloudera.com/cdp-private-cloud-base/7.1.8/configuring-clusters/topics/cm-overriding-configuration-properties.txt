Overriding Configuration Properties

For role types that allow multiple instances, each role instance inherits its
      configuration properties from its associated role group. While role groups provide a
      convenient way to provide alternate configuration properties for selected groups of role
      instances, there may be situations where you want to make a one-off configuration changeâ€”for
      example when a host has malfunctioned and you want to temporarily reconfigure it. In this
      case, you can override configuration properties for a specific role instance: 
Go to the page of the service with the role you want to change. Click
            Clusters in the left menu and select the service, or click the
            Status tab on the Cloudera Manager Home page and select the
          service.Click the Instances tab.Click the role instance you want to change.Click the Configuration
        tab.Change the configuration values as appropriate.Save your changes.
You will most likely need to restart your service or role to have your configuration
      changes take effect.
