Resetting Configuration Properties to the Default Value

To reset a property back to its default value, click
      the  icon. The default value is inserted and the
      icon turns into an Undo icon (). Explicitly setting a configuration to the
      same value as its default (inherited value) has the same effect as using
      the  icon.



There is no mechanism for resetting to an autoconfigured value. However,
      you can use the configuration history and rollback feature to revert any configuration
      changes.
