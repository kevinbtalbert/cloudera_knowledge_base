Restarting Services and Instances after Configuration Changes
If you change the configuration properties after you start a service or instance, you
    may need to restart the service or instance to have the configuration properties become active. 

I
Minimum Required Role:
Operator
        (also provided by Configurator,
          Cluster Administrator, Limited
          Cluster Administrator , Full
          Administrator) 
f you change configuration properties at the service level that affect
        a particular role only (such as all DataNodes but not the NameNodes),
        you can restart only that role; you do not need to restart the entire
        service. If you changed the configuration for a particular role instance
        (such as one of four DataNodes), you may need to restart only that
        instance.

Follow the instructions in the topics Restarting a Service or
            Starting, Stopping, and Restarting Role Instances. If you see a Finished status, the service or role
          instances have restarted.Go to the Home > Status tab. 
The service should show a Status of Started for all instances
      and a health status of Good.
