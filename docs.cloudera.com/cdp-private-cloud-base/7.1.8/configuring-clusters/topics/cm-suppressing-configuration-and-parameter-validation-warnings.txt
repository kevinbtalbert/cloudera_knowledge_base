Suppressing Configuration and Parameter Validation Warnings
Suppressing configuration validation warnings.  d
You can suppress the warnings that Cloudera Manager issues when a
        configuration value is outside the recommended range or is invalid. If a
        warning does not apply to your deployment, you might want to suppress
        it. Suppressed validation warnings are still retained by Cloudera
        Manager, and you can unsuppress the warnings at any time. You can
        suppress each warning when you view it, or you can configure suppression
        for a specific validation before warnings occur.
