Viewing and Editing Overridden Configuration Properties

To see a list of all role instances that have an
      override value for a particular configuration setting, click the
        Configuration tab on the page for the service and
      select Status > Has overrides. A list of configuration properties where values have been
      overridden displays. The panel for each configuration property displays
      the values for each role group or instance. You can edit the value of this
      property for this instance, or, you can click the  icon next to
      an instance name to remove the overridden value.
