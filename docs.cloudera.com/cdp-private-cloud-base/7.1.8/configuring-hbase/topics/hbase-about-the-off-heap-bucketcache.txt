About the Off-heap BucketCache
If the BucketCache is enabled, it stores data blocks, leaving the on-heap cache free
    for storing indexes and Bloom filters.
The physical location of the BucketCache storage can be either in memory
      (off-heap) or in a file stored in a fast disk.
Off-heap: This is the default configuration.
File-based: You can use the file-based storage mode to store the
            BucketCache on an SSD or FusionIO device,

You can configure a column family to keep its data blocks in the L1
        cache instead of the BucketCache, using the
          HColumnDescriptor.cacheDataInL1(true) method or by
        using the following syntax in HBase
        Shell:hbase> alter 'myTable', CONFIGURATION => {CACHE_DATA_IN_L1 => 'true'}}

Off-heap BucketCacheIf the BucketCache is enabled, it stores data blocks, leaving the on-heap cache free       for storing indexes and Bloom filters. The physical location of the BucketCache storage can be either in memory       (off-heap) or in a file stored in a fast disk.BucketCache IO engineUse the hbase.bucketcache.ioengine parameter to define where to store     the content of the BucketCache. Its value can be offheap,         file:PATH,     mmap:PATH, pmem:PATH ,     or it can be empty. By default it is empty which means that BucketCache is disabled.Configure BucketCache IO engineYou must configure the BucketCache IO engine using Cloudera Manager.
