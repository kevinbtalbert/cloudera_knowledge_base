Configuring HBase BlockCache
You can configure BlockCache in two different ways in HBase: the default on-heap
      LruBlockCache and the BucketCache, which is usually off-heap. 
If you have less than 20 GB of RAM available for use by HBase, consider tailoring the
         default on-heap BlockCache implementation (LruBlockCache) for your cluster.
If you have more than 20 GB of RAM available, consider adding off-heap BlockCache
         (BucketCache).
In the default configuration, HBase uses a single on-heap cache. If you configure the
      off-heap BucketCache, the on-heap cache is used for Bloom filters and
      indexes, and the off-heap BucketCache is used to cache data blocks. This is
      called the Combined Blockcache configuration. The Combined BlockCache
      allows you to use a larger in-memory cache while reducing the negative impact of garbage
      collection in the heap, because HBase manages the BucketCache instead of
      relying on the garbage collector.

Contents of the BlockCacheIn HBase, a block is a single unit of I/O. The block cache keeps data blocks resident     in the memory after they are read. Size the BlockCacheWhen you use the LruBlockCache, the     blocks needed to satisfy each read are cached, old blocks are evicted to make room for new     blocks using a Least-Recently-Used algorithm . Set the size of the BlockCache to satisfy your     read requirements. Decide to use the BucketCache The BucketCache manages areas of memory called buckets     for holding the cached blocks. You can use BucketCache if any of the conditions listed in here     are are true.About the Off-heap BucketCacheIf the BucketCache is enabled, it stores data blocks, leaving the on-heap cache free     for storing indexes and Bloom filters.Cache eviction prioritiesYou must decide on the cache eviction priorities to allow for scan-resistance and     in-memory column families.Bypass the BlockCacheYou can bypass the BlockCache if the data needed for a specific but atypical operation       does not all fit in memory.Monitor the BlockCacheCloudera Manager provides metrics to monitor the performance of the       BlockCache, to assist you in tuning your configuration.
