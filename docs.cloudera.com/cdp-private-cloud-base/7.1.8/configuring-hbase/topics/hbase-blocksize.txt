Using HBase blocksize
You must configure the HBase blocksize to set the smallest unit of data HBase can read
  from the column family's HFiles.
HBase data is stored in one (after a major compaction) or more (possibly before a major
   compaction) HFiles per column family per region. The blocksize determines:

The blocksize for a given column family determines the smallest unit of data HBase can read
    from the column family's HFiles.
The basic unit of measure cached by a RegionServer in the BlockCache.

The default blocksize is 64 KB. The appropriate blocksize is dependent upon your data and usage
   patterns. Use the following guidelines to tune the blocksize size, in combination with testing
   and benchmarking as appropriate.warningThe default blocksize is appropriate for a
    wide range of data usage patterns, and tuning the blocksize is an advanced operation. The wrong
    configuration can negatively impact performance.

Consider the average key/value size for the column family when tuning the blocksize. You can
    find the average key/value size using the HFile
    utility:$ hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.HFile -f /path/to/HFILE -m -v

Consider the pattern of reads to the table or column family. For instance, if it is common to
     scan for 500 rows on various parts of the table, performance might be increased if the
     blocksize is large enough to encompass 500-1000 rows, so that often, only one read operation on
     the HFile is required. If your typical scan size is only 3 rows, returning 500-1000 rows would
     be overkill.
It is difficult to predict the size of a row before it is written, because the data will be
     compressed when it is written to the HFile. Perform testing to determine the correct blocksize
     for your data.



Configure the blocksize for a column familyYou can configure the blocksize of a column family at table creation or by disabling         and altering an existing table.
