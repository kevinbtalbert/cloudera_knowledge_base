BucketCache IO engine
Use the hbase.bucketcache.ioengine parameter to define where to store
    the content of the BucketCache. Its value can be offheap,
        file:PATH,
    mmap:PATH, pmem:PATH ,
    or it can be empty. By default it is empty which means that BucketCache is disabled.

You can set the following values in the hbase.bucketcache.ioengine
        parameter to define where to store the BucketCache:

offheap: When hbase.bucketcache.ioengine is set to
            offheap the content of the BucketCache is stored off-heap.
file:PATH: When
            hbase.bucketcache.ioengine is set to
              file:PATH, the BucketCache uses file caching.
mmap:PATH: When
            hbase.bucketcache.ioengine is set to
              mmap:PATH, the content of the BucketCache is
          stored and accessed through memory mapping to a file under the specified path.
pmem:PATH: When
            hbase.bucketcache.ioengine is set to
              pmem:PATH, BucketCache uses direct memory access
          to and from a file on the specified path. The specified path must be under a volume that
          is mounted on a persistent memory device that supports direct access to its own address
            space.The advantage of the pmem engine over the
              mmap engine is that it supports large cache size. That is because
              pmem allows for reads straight from the device address, which means
            in this mode no copy is created on DRAM. Therefore, swapping due to DRAM free memory
            exhaustion is not an issue when large cache size is specified. With devices currently
            available, the bucket cache size can be set to the order of hundreds of GBs or even a
            few TBs. When bucket cache size is set to larger than 256GB, the OS limit must be
            increased, which can be configured by the max_map_count property. Make
            sure you have an extra 10% for other processes on the host that require the use of
            memory mapping. This additional overhead depends on the load of processes running on the
            RS hosts. To calculate the OS limit divide the block cache size in GB by 4 MB and then
            multiply it by 1.1: (block cache size in GB / 4 MB) * 1.1.
