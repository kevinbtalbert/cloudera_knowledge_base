Bulk Write Access
Bulk loading HFiles can be an extremely effective way to increase the overall
        throughput of ingest into HBase. Quota management when bulk loading is important because
        large HFiles have the potential to quickly violate a quota.Clients group HFiles by region boundaries and send the file for each column family to the
            RegionServer presently hosting that region. The RegionServer ultimately inspects each
            file, ensuring that it should be loaded into this region, and then, sequentially, load
            each file into the correct column family.
As a part of the precondition-check of the fileâ€™s boundaries before loading it,
                the quota state should be inspected to determine if loading the next file will
                violate the quota. If the RegionServer determines that it will violate the quota, it
                should not load the file and inform the client that the file was not loaded because
                it would violate the quota.
