Bypass the BlockCache
You can bypass the BlockCache if the data needed for a specific but atypical operation
      does not all fit in memory.
For an
         atypical operation does not all fit in memory, using the BlockCache can be
         counter-productive because data that you are still using may be evicted, or even if other
         data is not evicted, excess garbage collection can adversely effect performance. For this
         type of operation, you may decide to bypass the BlockCache. To bypass the BlockCache for a
         given Scan or Get, use the setCacheBlocks(false) method.
In addition, you can prevent a specific column family's contents from
        being cached, by setting its BLOCKCACHE configuration
        to false. Use the following syntax in HBase
        Shell:hbase> alter 'myTable', CONFIGURATION => {NAME => 'myCF', BLOCKCACHE => 'false'}
