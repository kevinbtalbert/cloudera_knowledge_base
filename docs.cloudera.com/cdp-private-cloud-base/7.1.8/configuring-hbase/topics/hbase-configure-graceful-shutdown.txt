Configure the graceful shutdown timeout property
You must configure this property to allow enough time for a graceful shutdown of a
        RegionServer. A graceful shutdown of an HBase RegionServer allows the regions hosted by that
        RegionServer to be moved to other RegionServers before stopping the
        RegionServer.
This timeout only affects a graceful shutdown of the entire HBase service, not
            individual RegionServers. Therefore, if you have a large cluster with many
            RegionServers, you should strongly consider increasing the timeout from its default of
            180 seconds.

Go to the HBase service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select Scope  > HBASE-1 (Service
                        Wide).

Use the Search box to search for the Graceful Shutdown
                        Timeout property and edit the value.

Click Save Changes to save this setting.
