Configuring HBase MultiWAL
You can configure multiple write-ahead logs (MultiWAL) for HBase. If you do not
    configure MultiWAL, each region on a RegionServer writes to the same WAL. 
A busy RegionServer might host several regions, and each write to the WAL is serial because
      HDFS only supports sequentially written files. This causes the WAL to negatively impact
      performance.
MultiWAL allows a RegionServer to write multiple WAL streams in parallel
      by using multiple pipelines in the underlying HDFS instance, which
      increases total throughput during writes. noteIn the current
        implementation of MultiWAL, incoming edits are partitioned by Region.
        Therefore, throughput to a single Region is not increased.
To configure MultiWAL for a RegionServer, set the value of the property
        hbase.wal.provider to multiwal and
      restart the RegionServer. To disable MultiWAL for a RegionServer, unset
      the property and restart the RegionServer.
RegionServers using the original WAL implementation and those using the
      MultiWAL implementation can each handle recovery of either set of WALs, so
      a zero-downtime configuration update is possible through a rolling
      restart.
