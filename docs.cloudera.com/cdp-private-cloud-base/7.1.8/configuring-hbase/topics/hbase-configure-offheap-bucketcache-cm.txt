Configure the off-heap BucketCache using Cloudera Manager
You can configure the off-heap BucketCache engine using Cloudera Manager.

Go to the HBase service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select the RegionServer scope and do the
                    following:


Set BucketCache IOEngine to
                                offheap.


Update the value of BucketCache Size according
                            to the required BucketCache size.
When you set the BucketCache Size, Cloudera
                            Manager automatically sets the -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize
                            JVM option for the RegionServers.Cloudera Manager automatically adds
                                the JVM option -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=<size>
                                replacing <size> with a value not smaller than
                                the off-heap BucketCache, expressed as a number of gigabytes +
                                around 1GB used for HDFS short circuit read. For example, if the
                                off-heap BucketCache is 16GB and the heap size is 15GB, the total
                                value of MaxDirectMemorySize could be 32G:
                                    -XX:MaxDirectMamorySize=32G.



Optionally, when combined BucketCache is in use, you can decrease the heap size
                    ratio allocated to the L1 BlockCache, and increase the Memstore size. The
                    on-heap BlockCache only stores indexes and Bloom filters, the actual data
                    resides in the off-heap BucketCache. A larger Memstore is able to accommodate
                    more write request before flushing them to disks.

Decrease HFile Block Cache Size to
                            0.3 or 0.2.
Increase Maximum Size of All Memstores in
                            RegionServer to 0.5 or 0.6
                        respectively.

Restart or rolling restart your RegionServers for the changes to take
                    effect.
