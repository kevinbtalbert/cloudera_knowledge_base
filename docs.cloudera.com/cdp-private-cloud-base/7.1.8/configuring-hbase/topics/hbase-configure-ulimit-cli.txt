Configuring ulimit for HBase
You can configure the ulimit for HBase using the Maximum Process File
            Descriptors property in Cloudera Manager.
Cloudera recommends increasing the maximum number of file handles to more than
            10,000. Increasing the file handles for the user running the HBase process is an
            operating system configuration, not an HBase configuration. A common mistake is to
            increase the number of file handles for a particular user when HBase is running as a
            different user. HBase prints the ulimit it is using on the first line in the logs. Make
            sure that it is correct.

In Cloudera Manager navigate to HBase >  Configuration.

Find the Maximum Process File Descriptors
                    property.

Set the property as applicable for your use case.

Click Save Changes.
