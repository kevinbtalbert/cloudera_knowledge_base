Configure ulimit using Pluggable Authentication Modules using the Command Line
Follow these command-line instructions to configure ulimit using Pluggable
        Authentication Modules on systems that do not use Cloudera Manager. 
If you are using ulimit, you must make the following configuration changes:

In the /etc/security/limits.conf file, add the following lines, adjusting
                    the values as appropriate. This assumes that your HDFS user is called hdfs and your HBase user is called
                        hbase.

hdfs  -       nofile  32768
hdfs  -       nproc   2048
hbase -       nofile  32768
hbase -       nproc   2048
note

Only the root user can edit this file.
If this change does not take effect, check other
                                configuration files in the /etc/security/limits.d/ directory for lines containing
                                the hdfs or hbase user and the
                                    nofile value.
                                Such entries may be overriding the entries in /etc/security/limits.conf.




To apply the changes in /etc/security/limits.conf on Ubuntu and Debian systems, add the
                    following line in the /etc/pam.d/common-session file: 
session required  pam_limits.soFor
                    more information on the ulimit
                    command or per-user operating system limits, refer to the documentation for your
                    operating system.
