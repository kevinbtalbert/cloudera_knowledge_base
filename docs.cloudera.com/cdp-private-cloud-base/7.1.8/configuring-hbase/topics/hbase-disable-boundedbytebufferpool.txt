Disable the BoundedByteBufferPool
HBase uses a BoundedByteBufferPool to avoid fragmenting the heap.
        You can disable BoundedByteBufferPool using Cloudera Manager.

The G1 garbage collector reduces the need to avoid fragmenting the heap in some
                cases. If you use the G1 garbage collector, you can disable the
                    BoundedByteBufferPool in HBase. This can reduce the number of
                "old generation" items that need to be collected. This configuration is
                experimental.


Go to the HBase service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select Scope >
                    RegionServer.

Select Category > Advanced.

Locate the HBase Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                        Valve) for hbase-site.xml property, or search for it by typing
                    its name in the Search box.

Add the following XML:

<property>
  <name>hbase.ipc.server.reservoir.enabled</name>
  <value>false</value>
</property>


Enter a Reason for change, and then click
                        Save Changes to commit the changes.

Restart the service.
