Enable hedged reads for HBase
You need to enable hedged read if a read operation from a HDFS block is slow. 

Go to the HBase service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select Scope > HBASE-1
                        (Service-Wide).

Select Category >
                    Performance.

Configure the HDFS Hedged Read Threadpool Size and
                        HDFS Hedged Read Delay Threshold properties. The
                    descriptions for each of these properties on the configuration pages provide
                    more information.

Enter a Reason for change, and then click
                        Save Changes to commit the changes.
