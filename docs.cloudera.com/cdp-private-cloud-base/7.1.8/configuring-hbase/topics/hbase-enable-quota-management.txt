Configuring quotas
HBase quotas are disabled by default. To enable quotas, the relevant
            hbase-site.xml property must be set to true
        and the limit of each quota specified on the command line. 
hbase superuser privileges

Set the hbase.quota.enabled property in the
                        hbase-site.xml file to
                    true.

Enter the command to set the limit of the quota, type of quota, and to which
                    entity to apply the quota. The command and its syntax are:


            $hbase_shell> set_quota TYPE =>
            
                quota_type,
                arguments
