Understanding HBase garbage collection
You can configure garbage collection to free up the memory that is no longer referenced
  by Java objects.
warningConfiguring the JVM garbage collection for HBase is an advanced operation.
   Incorrect configuration can have major performance implications for your cluster. Test any
   configuration changes carefully.
Garbage collection (memory cleanup) by the JVM can cause HBase clients to experience excessive
   latency.
To tune the garbage collection settings, you pass the relevant parameters to the JVM.
Example configuration values are not recommendations and should not be considered as such. This
   is not the complete list of configuration options related to garbage collection. See the
   documentation for your JVM for details on these settings.

-XX:+UseG1GC: Use the 'G1' garbage collection algorithm. You can tune G1
    garbage collection to provide a consistent pause time, which benefits long-term running Java
    processes such as HBase, NameNode, Solr, and ZooKeeper. For more information about tuning G1,
    see the Oracle documentation on tuning garbage collection.
-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=value: The garbage collection pause time. Set this to
    the maximum amount of latency your cluster can tolerate while allowing as much garbage
    collection as possible. XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled Enable or disable parallel reference
    processing by using a + or - symbol before the parameter name. 
-XX:-ResizePLAB: Enable or disable resizing of Promotion Local Allocation
    Buffers (PLABs) by using a + or - symbol before the parameter name. 
-XX:ParallelGCThreads=value: The number of parallel garbage collection
    threads to run concurrently.

-XX:G1NewSizePercent=value: The percent of the heap to be  used for garbage
     collection. If the value is too low, garbage collection is ineffective. If the value is too
     high, not enough heap is available for other uses by HBase.
