Using hedged reads
You can enable hedged reads if you want to increase the performance of a read operation
  from an HDFS block that occasionally takes a long time. This feature helps in situations where a
  read occasionally takes a long time rather than when there is a systemic problem. 
If a read from an HDFS block is slow, the HDFS client starts up another parallel, 'hedged' read
   against a different block replica. The result of whichever read returns first is used, and the
   outstanding read is cancelled. Hedged reads can be enabled for HBase when the HFiles are stored
   in HDFS. This feature is disabled by default.

Enable hedged reads for HBaseYou need to enable hedged read if a read operation from a HDFS block is slow. Monitor the performance of hedged readsYou can monitor the performance of hedged reads using the following metrics provided by     Hadoop when hedged reads are enabled.
