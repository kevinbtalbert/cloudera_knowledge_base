Optimizing HBase I/O
You can optimize HBase I/O using several ways. Two HBase key concepts that helps
    you in the process are BlockCache and MemStore tuning. 
The information in this section is oriented toward basic BlockCache and MemStore tuning.
            As such, it describes only a subset of cache configuration options. CDP supports
            additional BlockCache and MemStore properties, as well as other configurable performance
            optimizations such as remote procedure calls (RPCs), HFile block size settings, and
            HFile compaction. For a complete list of configurable properties, see the
            hbase-default.xml source file in GitHub.
HBase I/O componentsThe concepts related to HBase file operations and memory (RAM) caching are HFile,     Block, BlockCache, MemStore and Write Ahead Log (WAL).
