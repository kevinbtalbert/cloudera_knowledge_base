Examples of overlapping quota policies
With the ability to define a quota policy on namespaces and tables, you have
        to define how the policies are applied. A table quota should take precedence over a
        namespace quota.
Scenario 1
For example, consider Scenario 1, which is outlined in the following table.
                Namespace n has the following collection of tables:
                    n1.t1, n1.t2, and
                    n1.t3. The namespace quota is 100 GB. Because the total
                storage required for all tables is less than 100 GB, each table can accept new
                WRITEs. Table 1. Scenario 1: Overlapping Quota Policies

Object
Quota
Storage Utilization



Namespace n1
100 GB
80 GB


Table n1.t1
10 GB
5 GB


Table n1.t2
(not set)
50 GB


Table n1.t3
(not set)
25 GB



Scenario 2
In Scenario 2, as shown in the following table, WRITEs to table
                    n1.t1 are denied because the table quota is violated, but
                WRITEs to tablen1.t2 and table n1.t3 are
                still allowed because they are within the namespace quota. The violation policy for
                the table quota on table n1.t1 is enacted.

Namespace n1
100 GB
60 GB


Table n1.t1
10 GB
15 GB


Table n1.t2
(not set)
30 GB


Table n1.t3
(not set)
15 GB



Scenario 3
In the Scenario 3 table below, WRITEs to all tables are not allowed because the
                storage utilization of all tables exceeds the namespace quota limit. The namespace
                quota violation policy is applied to all tables in the namespace.
Table 3. Scenario 3: Overlapping Quota Policies

Namespace n1
100 GB
108 GB


Table n1.t1
10 GB
8 GB


Table n1.t2
(not set)
50 GB


Table n1.t3
(not set)
50 GB



Scenario 4
In the Scenario 4 table below, table n1.t1 violates the quota set at the
                table level. The table quota violation policy is enforced. In addition, the disk
                utilization of table n1t1 plus the sum of disk utilization for table
                    n1t2 and table n1t3 exceeds the 100 GB namespace quota. Therefore,
                the namespace quota violation policy is also applied.Table 4. Scenario 4: Overlapping Quota Policies

Table n1.t3
(not set)
50 GB
