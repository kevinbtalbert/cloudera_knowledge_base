Using quota management
Two types of HBase quotas are well established: throttle quota and number-of
        tables-quota. These two quotas can regulate users and tables. 
In a multitenant HBase environment, ensuring that each tenant can use only its allotted
            portion of the system is key in meeting SLAs.

Configuring quotasHBase quotas are disabled by default. To enable quotas, the relevant             hbase-site.xml property must be set to true         and the limit of each quota specified on the command line. General Quota SyntaxThe general quota syntax are THROTTLE_TYPE,             Request sizes and space limit, Number of requests,             Time limits and  Number of tables or         regions.Throttle quotasThe throttle quota, also known as RPC limit quota, is commonly used         to manage length of RPC queue as well as network bandwidth utilization. Space quotasSpace quotas, also known as filesystem space quotas, limit the         amount of stored data. It can be applied at a table or namespace level where table-level         quotas take priority over namespace-level quotas.Quota enforcementWhen a quota limit is exceeded, the Master server instructs RegionServers to         enable an enforcement policy for the namespace or table that violated the quota.Quota violation policiesIf quotas are set for the amount of space each HBase tenant can fill on HDFS,         then a quota violation policy should be planned and implemented on the system.Impact of quota violation policyQuota violation policies can impact live write access, bulk write access, and                 read access. You must understand what the quota violation policies mean for your                 deployment before you plan and implement it on your system.Number-of-Tables QuotasThe number-of-tables quota is set as part of the namespace metadata and does not         involve the set_quota command.Number-of-Regions QuotasThe number-of-regions quota is similar to the number-of-tables quota. The         number-of-regions quota is set as part of the namespace metadata and does not involve the             set_quota command.
