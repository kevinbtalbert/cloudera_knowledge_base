Test MOB storage and retrieval performance
You can test the MOB storage and retrieval performance by using the Apache HBase Load
        Test Tool (ltt), and by configuring it to generate MOB values.


Run this HBase load test tool command in your command-line interface:

$ hbase ltt -mob_threshold 102400 -generator \
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.LoadTestDataGeneratorWithMOB:medium_column:102400:104857 \
    -tn example_table -families small_column,medium_column
    -num_keys 10000 -write 3:1024
importantThis command must be run by a user who has the permission
                        to create the passed table, or the table must be created earlier and the
                        user should be given the required permissions.


-mob_threshold is the size (in bytes) at
                                which an object is considered to be a MOB. You must set this
                                threshold for the tool to configure column families as
                                MOB-enabled.


-generator is the class that generates
                                load for the tool. You must set this parameter to tell the tool how
                                the values must be created. For example, when you set this as
                                LoadTestDataGeneratorWithMOB:medium_column:102400:104857, the
                                parameter accepts the name of a column family, and a range of data
                                sizes for that column. This option pseudo-randomly chooses to make
                                cells in that column family that are of this size range
                                (102400:104857, rather than the default cell size.


-tn is the name of the table to create, and use


-families is a list of column families to create on
                                the table you provided in using the -tn parameter.


-num_keys is the number of rows to write.

-write is the upper bound on the number of cells to
                            write per column family and the average size of those cells.
