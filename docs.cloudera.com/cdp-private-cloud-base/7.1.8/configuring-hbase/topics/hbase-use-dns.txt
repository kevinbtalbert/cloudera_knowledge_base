Using DNS with HBaseCloudera Docs
Using DNS with HBase
You must configure DNS to resolve RegionServer and Master hostnames in your cluster.
      HBase uses the local hostname to report its IP address. Both forward and reverse DNS resolving
      works.

In Cloudera Manager navigate to HBase >  Configuration.

Find the RegionServer Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety-Valve) for
                  hbase-site.xml property.

Click the plus icon to add the property that is applicable for your use case:

If your server has multiple interfaces, HBase uses the interface that the primary
                  hostname resolves to, and you must ensure that the cluster configuration is
                  consistent and every host has the same network interface configuration. If this is
                  your use case add the following configuration:
Name:
                           hbase.regionserver.dns.interface
Value: primary interface



If you want to use a different DNS name server than the system-wise default, add
                  the following configuration:
Name:
                           hbase.regionserver.dns.nameserver
Value: a different DNS name server



Click Save Changes.
