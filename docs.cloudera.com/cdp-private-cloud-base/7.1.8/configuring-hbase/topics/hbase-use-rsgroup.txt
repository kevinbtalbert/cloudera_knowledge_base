Using RegionServer grouping
You can use RegionServer Grouping (rsgroup) to impose strict isolation between
    RegionServers by partitioning RegionServers into distinct groups. You can use HBase Shell
    commands to define and manage RegionServer Grouping.
You must first create an rsgroup before you can add RegionServers to it. Once you have
        created an rsgroup, you can move your HBase tables into this rsgroup so that only the
        RegionServers in the same rsgroup can host the regions of the table. 
noteRegionServers and tables can only belong to one rsgroup at a time. By default, all the
        tables and RegionServers belong to the default rsgroup.
A custom balancer implementation tracks assignments per rsgroup and moves regions to the
        relevant RegionServers in that rsgroup. The rsgroup information is stored in a regular HBase
        table, and a ZooKeeper-based read-only cache is used at cluster bootstrap time.

Enable RegionServer grouping using Cloudera ManagerYou must use Cloudera Manager to enable RegionServer Grouping before you can define         and manage rsgroups. Configure RegionServer groupingWhen you add a new rsgroup, you are creating an rsgroup other than the default group. Monitor RegionServer groupingYou can monitor the status of the commands using the Tables tab on the HBase Master UI     home page. Remove a RegionServer from RegionServer groupingYou can remove a RegionServer by moving it to the default rsgroup.         Edits made using shell commands to all rsgroups, except the default         rsgroup, are persisted to the system hbase:rsgroup table. If an rsgroup         references a decommissioned RegionServer, then the rsgroup should be updated to undo the         reference.Enabling ACL for RegionServer groupingYou can enable ACL for RegionServer grouping using Cloudera Manager. If authorization         is enabled only Global Admins can manage rsgroups.Best practices when using RegionServer groupingYou must keep in mind the following best practices when using rsgroups.Disable RegionServer groupingWhen you no longer require rsgroups, you can disable it for your cluster.
