Accessing the Oozie server with a browser
If you have enabled the Oozie web console by adding the ExtJS library, you can connect
    to the console at http://<OOZIE_HOSTNAME>:11000/oozie.
noteIf the Oozie server is configured to use Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO Authentication, you must
        use a web browser that supports Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO (for example, Firefox or Internet
        Explorer).
For information on how to enable the Oozie web console on managed clusters by adding the
      ExtJS library, see Enabling the Oozie web console on managed clusters.
