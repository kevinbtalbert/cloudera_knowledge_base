Adding the Oozie service using Cloudera Manager
The Oozie service can be automatically installed and started
      during your installation of CDP with Cloudera Manager. If required, you can install
    Oozie manually with the Add Service wizard in Cloudera Manager. The wizard configures and
    starts Oozie and its dependent services.

noteIf your instance of Cloudera Manager uses an external database, you must also configure
        Oozie with an external database.
