Configuring an external database for Oozie
Oozie is a stateless web application by design. All information about running and
    completed workflows, coordinators, and bundle jobs are stored in a relational database. Oozie
    supports an embedded PostgreSQL database; however, Cloudera strongly recommends that you use an
    external database for production systems.
