Configuring Oracle for Oozie
You must install Oracle 12.2, create the Oozie Oracle user and grant privileges, and
    add the Oracle JDBC driver jar file to Oozie.

Install and Start Oracle 12.2
Use Oracle's instructions.

Create the Oozie Oracle User and Grant Privileges.
The following example uses the Oracle sqlplus command-line tool, and
                    shows the privileges Cloudera recommends. Oozie needs CREATE SESSION to start
                    and manage workflows. The additional roles are needed for creating and upgrading
                    the Oozie database. sqlplus system@localhost/<SERVICE_NAME>
    
SQL> create user <user> identified by <password> default tablespace <tablespace> temporary tablespace temp;
    User created.
SQL> grant create sequence to <user>;
    Grant succeeded.
SQL> grant create session to <user>;
    Grant succeeded.
SQL> grant create table to <user>;
    Grant succeeded.
SQL> alter user <user> quota unlimited on <tablespace>; 
    User altered.
SQL> exit important
For security reasons, do not make the following grant:
grant select any table to oozie;


Add the Oracle JDBC Driver JAR to Oozie.
Copy or symbolically link the Oracle JDBC driver JAR into the
            /var/lib/oozie/ directory.noteYou must manually download the Oracle
            JDBC driver JAR file.
