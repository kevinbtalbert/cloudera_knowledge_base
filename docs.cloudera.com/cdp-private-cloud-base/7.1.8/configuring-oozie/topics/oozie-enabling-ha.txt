Enabling Oozie High Availability
You must select the host on which to install the additional Oozie server and specify
        the required property values to install Oozie High Availability (HA).
Ensure that the requirements are satisfied.
In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to the Oozie service.
Select Actions > Enable High Availability to see eligible Oozie server hosts. The host running the current
                Oozie server is not eligible.Select the host on which to install an additional Oozie server and click
                    Continue.Update the following fields for the Oozie load balancer: 


HostnameFor
                            example:nightly6x-1.vpc.cloudera.com
HTTP PortFor
                            example:5002
HTTPS PortFor
                            example:5000

Click Continue.
Cloudera Manager stops the Oozie servers, adds another Oozie server,
                    initializes the Oozie server High Availability state in ZooKeeper, configures
                    Hue to reference the Oozie load balancer, and restarts the Oozie servers and
                    dependent services. In addition, Cloudera Manager generates Kerberos credentials
                    for the new Oozie server and regenerates credentials for existing
                    servers.
