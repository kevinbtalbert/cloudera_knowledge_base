File System Credentials 
To allow Oozie to access S3, ABFS, and other filesystems, it has to request a
        delegation token to obtain credentials. Although HUE supports only the built-in credentials
        (see Hue
            limitation)this can be done through properties. There are three options to
        set file system credentials for an Oozie workflow or action which are resulting the same.
        You can choose any of them based on your current usage and preference.


Set file system credentials for Oozie through hadoop properties using Hue Editor 
Set default credentials using Cloudera Manager 
Modify the workflow XML file manually 


You can use the advanced settings to override the default configurations.
