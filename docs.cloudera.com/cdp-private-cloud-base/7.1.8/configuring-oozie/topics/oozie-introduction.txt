Overview of Oozie
Apache Oozie Workflow Scheduler for Hadoop is a workflow and coordination
    service for managing Apache Hadoop jobs:


Oozie Workflow jobs are Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of actions; actions
        are Hadoop jobs (such as MapReduce, Streaming, Hive, Sqoop and so on) or non-Hadoop actions
        such as Java, shell, Git, and SSH.
Oozie Coordinator jobs trigger recurrent Workflow jobs based on time (frequency)
        and data availability.
Oozie Bundle jobs are sets of Coordinator jobs managed as a single job.

Oozie is an extensible, scalable and data-aware service that you can use to
      orchestrate dependencies among jobs running on Hadoop.
