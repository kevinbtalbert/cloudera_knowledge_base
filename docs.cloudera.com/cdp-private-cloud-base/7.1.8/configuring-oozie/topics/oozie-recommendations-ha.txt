Requirements for Oozie High Availability
You must ensure your cluster meets all the requirements for configuring Oozie High
        Availability (HA).

Multiple active Oozie servers, preferably identically configured.
JDBC JAR in the same location across all Oozie hosts (for example,
                    /var/lib/oozie/).
External database that supports multiple concurrent connections, preferably with HA
                support. 
ZooKeeper ensemble with distributed locks to control database access, and service
                discovery for log aggregation.
Load balancer (preferably with HA support, for example HAProxy),
                virtual IP, or round-robin DNS to provide a single entry point (of the multiple
                active servers), and for callbacks from the Application Master or JobTracker.
