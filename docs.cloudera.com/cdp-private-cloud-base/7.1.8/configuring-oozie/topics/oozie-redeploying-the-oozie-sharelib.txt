Redeploying the Oozie ShareLib
Some Oozie actions – specifically DistCp, Streaming, Sqoop, and Hive –
    require external JAR files in order to run. Instead of having to keep these JAR files in each
    workflow's lib folder, or forcing you to manually manage them using the
      oozie.libpath property on every workflow using one of these actions, Oozie
    provides the ShareLib. 
The ShareLib behaves very similarly to oozie.libpath, except that it is
      specific to the aforementioned actions and their required JARs.


Redeploying the Oozie sharelib using Cloudera ManagerWhen you switch between MapReduce and YARN computation frameworks, you must       redeploy the Oozie ShareLib.
