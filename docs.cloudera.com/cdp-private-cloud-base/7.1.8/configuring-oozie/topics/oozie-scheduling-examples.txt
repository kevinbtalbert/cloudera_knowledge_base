Oozie scheduling examples
You can use cron scheduling in Oozie to ensure that the jobs run according to the
        criteria that you specify.

The following examples show cron scheduling in Oozie. Oozie's processing time zone is
                UTC. If you are in a different time zone, add to or subtract from the appropriate
                offset in these examples.

Run at the 30th minute of every hour
Set the minute field to 30 and the remaining fields to
                            * so they match every value.
                        frequency="30 * * * *"

Run at 2:30 p.m. every day
Set the minute field to 30, the hour field to
                            14, and the remaining fields to *.
                        frequency="30 14 * * *"

Run at 2:30 p.m. every day in February
Set the minute field to 30, the hour field to
                            14, the day-of-month field to *, the
                        month field to 2 (February), and the day-of-week field to
                            *. frequency="30 14 * 2 *"

Run every 20 minutes between 5:00-10:00 a.m. and between 12:00-2:00 p.m. on
                        the fifth day of each month
Set the minute field to 0/20, the hour field to
                            5-9,12-13, the day-of-month field to
                            0/5, and the remaining fields to *.
                        frequency="0/20 5-9,12-13 0/5 * *"

Run every Monday at 5:00 a.m. 
Set the minute field to 0, the hour field to

                        month field to *, and the day-of-week field to
                            MON. frequency="0 5 ? * MON"
noteIf the ? was set to *, this
                            expression would run the job every day at 5:00 a.m., not just
                            Mondays.

Run on the last day of every month at 5:00 a.m. 
Set the minute field to 0, the hour field to
                            5, the day-of-month field to L, the
                        month field to *, and the day-of-week field to
                            ?. frequency="0 5 L * ?"

Run at 5:00 a.m. on the weekday closest to the 15th day of each month 
Set the minute field to 0, the hour field to
                            5, the day-of-month field to 15W, the
                        month field to *, and the day-of-week field to
                            ?. frequency="0 5 15W * ?"

Run every 33 minutes from 9:00-3:00 p.m. on the first Monday of every month

                        (the first Monday), and the remaining fields to *.
                        frequency="0/33 9-14 ? * 2#1"

Run every hour from 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. on weekdays
Set the minute field to 0, the hour field to
                            9-17, the day-of-month field to ?, the
                        month field to *, and the day-of-week field to
                            2-6. frequency="0 9-17 ? * 2-6"

Run on the second-to-last day of every month
Set the minute field to 0, the hour field to
                            0, the day-of-month field to L-1, the
                        month field to *, and the day-of-week field to
                            ?. frequency="0 0 L-1 * ?"
note“L-1″ means the second-to-last day of the month.


Oozie uses Quartz, a job scheduler library, to parse the cron syntax.
                For more examples, go to the CronTrigger Tutorial on the Quartz
                website. Quartz has two fields (second and year) that Oozie does not support.
