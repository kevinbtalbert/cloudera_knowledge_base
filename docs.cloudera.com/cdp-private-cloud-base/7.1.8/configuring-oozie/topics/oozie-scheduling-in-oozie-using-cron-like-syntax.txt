Scheduling in Oozie using cron-like syntax
Most Linux distributions include the cron utility, which is used for scheduling time-based
    jobs. You can schedule Oozie using Cron-like syntax.
Location
Set the scheduling information in the frequency
        attribute of the coordinator.xml file. A simple
        file looks like the following example. The frequency attribute and
        scheduling information appear in bold.
<coordinator-app name="MY_APP" frequency="30 14 * * *" 
start="2009-01-01T05:00Z" end="2009-01-01T06:00Z" timezone="UTC" xmlns="uri:oozie:coordinator:0.5">
   <action>
      <workflow>
         <app-path>hdfs://localhost:8020/tmp/workflows</app-path>
      </workflow>
   </action>
</coordinator-app>

Syntax and structure
The cron-like syntax used by Oozie is a string with five
        space-separated fields:

minute
hour
day-of-month
month
day-of-week

The structure takes the form of * * * * *. For
        example, 30 14 * * * means that the job runs at at 2:30
        p.m. everyday. The minute field is set to 30, the hour
        field is set to 14, and the remaining fields are set to
          *.

Allowed values and special characters
The following table describes special characters allowed and indicates
        in which fields they can be used.
