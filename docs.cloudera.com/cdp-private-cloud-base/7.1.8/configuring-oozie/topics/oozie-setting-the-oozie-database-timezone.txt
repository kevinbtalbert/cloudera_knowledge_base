Setting the Oozie database timezone
Depending on the type of database you are using with Oozie, you must configure specific
    properties for setting the database timezone. 
Cloudera recommends that you set the timezone in the Oozie database to GMT. Databases do not
      handle Daylight Saving Time (DST) shifts correctly. There might be problems if you run any
      Coordinators with actions scheduled to materialize during the one-hour period that gets lost
      in DST. 
importantChanging the timezone on an existing Oozie database while Coordinators
      are already running might cause Coordinators to shift by the offset of their timezone from GMT
      one time after you make this change.
For more information about how to set your database's timezone, see your database's
      documentation.
