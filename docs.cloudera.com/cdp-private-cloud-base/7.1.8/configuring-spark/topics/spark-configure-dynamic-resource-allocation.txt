Configuring dynamic resource allocation
This section describes how to configure dynamic resource allocation for Apache Spark. 
When the dynamic resource allocation feature is enabled, an application's use of
            executors is dynamically adjusted based on workload. This means that an application can
            relinquish resources when the resources are no longer needed, and request them later
            when there is more demand. This feature is particularly useful if multiple applications
            share resources in your Spark cluster.
importantDynamic resource allocation does not work with
        Spark Streaming.
You can configure dynamic resource allocation at either the cluster or the job
            level:



Cluster level: Dynamic resource allocation is enabled by
              default. The associated shuffle service starts automatically.


Job level: You can customize dynamic resource allocation
              settings on a per-job basis. Job settings override cluster
              configuration settings.



Cluster configuration is the default, unless overridden by job configuration.
The following subsections describe each configuration approach, followed by a list of
            dynamic resource allocation properties and a set of instructions for customizing the
            Spark Thrift server port.
