Customize dynamic resource allocation settings
Use the following steps to review and customize dynamic resource
    allocation settings. 

Dynamic resource allocation requires an external shuffle service that
        runs on each worker node as an auxiliary service of NodeManager. This
        service is started automatically; no further steps are needed.
Dynamic resource allocation is enabled by default. To modify dynamic
        allocation settings, use the following procedure.

From the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) interface, click through
          to Cloudera Manager for the cluster running Spark.Go to the Spark service page
              (Clusters > Spark
              service).Click on the Configuration
        tab.In the Search box, enter
            dynamicAllocation.After making the changes you want, enter the reason for the
          change in the Reason for change... box, and
          then click Save Changes.Restart the Spark service (Spark
              service > Actions > Restart).
