Running Spark applications on secure clusters
All CDP clusters are secure by default. Disabling security on CDP
    clusters is not supported. To run a Spark application on a secure cluster,
    you must first authenticate using Kerberos.
 Users running Spark applications must first authenticate to Kerberos,
      using kinit, as follows: 
kinit username@EXAMPLE.COM
 After authenticating to Kerberos, users can submit their applications
      using  spark-submit  as usual, as shown below. This
      command submits one of the default Spark sample jobs using an environment
      variable as part of the path, so modify as needed for your own use: 
$ spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi --master yarn \
--deploy-mode cluster $SPARK_HOME/lib/spark-examples.jar 10
