Spark security

When you create an environment in the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP)
      Management Console, it automatically creates a Kerberos- and TLS-enabled
      data lake cluster. Data hub clusters are linked to environments, and
      therefore also have Kerberos enabled by default. You do not need to do
      anything to enable Kerberos or TLS for Apache Spark in CDP. Disabling
      security is not supported.
 To submit Spark jobs to the cluster, users must authenticate with
      their Kerberos credentials. For more information, see the Environments documentation.

Enabling Spark authenticationSpark authentication here refers to an internal authentication     mechanism, and not to Kerberos authentication, which is enabled     automatically for all Cloudera Data Platform deployments.Enabling Spark EncryptionRunning Spark applications on secure clustersAll CDP clusters are secure by default. Disabling security on CDP     clusters is not supported. To run a Spark application on a secure cluster,     you must first authenticate using Kerberos.Configuring HSTS for SparkYou can configure Apache Spark to include HTTP headers to prevent Cross-Site         Scripting (XSS), Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS), MIME-Sniffing, and also enforce HTTP Strict         Transport Security (HSTS).
