Enabling Access Control for
      Zeppelin Elements
This section describes how to restrict access to specific Apache Zeppelin elements. 
After configuring authentication, you may want to restrict access to Zeppelin notes and
            data, and also set restrictions on what users and groups can configure Zeppelin
            interpreters. You can authorize access at three levels within Zeppelin:



UI authorization restricts access to Zeppelin Interpreter, Credential,
                     and Configuration pages based on administrative privileges.


Note-level authorization restricts access to notes based on permissions
                     (owner, reader, or writer) granted to users and groups.


Data-level authorization restricts access to specific data sets.
