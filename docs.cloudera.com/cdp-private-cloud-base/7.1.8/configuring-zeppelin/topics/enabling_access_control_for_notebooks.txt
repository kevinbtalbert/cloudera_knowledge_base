Enable Access Control for
      Notebooks
This section describes how to restrict access to Apache Zeppelin notebooks by granting
      permissions to specific users and groups. 
There are two main steps in this process: defining the
            searchBase property in the Zeppelin Shiro configuration, and then
         specifying permissions.
In Zeppelin configuration settings, the Zeppelin administrator should specify
                  activeDirectoryRealm.searchBase or
                  ldapRealm.searchBase, depending on whether Zeppelin uses AD or
               LDAP for authentication. The value of searchBase controls where
               Zeppelin looks for users and groups. 
For more information, refer to "Shiro Settings: Reference" in this guide. For an
               example, see "Configure Zeppelin for Authentication: LDAP and Active Directory" in
               this guide.

The owner of the notebook should navigate to the note and complete the following
               steps:


Click the lock icon on the notebook:
Zeppelin presents a popup menu. Enter the user and groups that should have
                     access to the note. To search for an account, start typing the
                           name.Note: If you are using Shiro as the identity store, users
                        should be listed in the [user]section. If you are using AD
                        or LDAP users and groups should be stored in the realm associated with your
                        Shiro configuration.
