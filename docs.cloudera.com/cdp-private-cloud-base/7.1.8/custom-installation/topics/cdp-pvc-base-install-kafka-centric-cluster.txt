Installing a Kafka-centric clusterCloudera Docs
Installing a
    Kafka-centric
    cluster
A
    Kafka-centric
    cluster
     has
    Kafka and Ranger deployed on it, but does not have HDFS. You can install a
    Kafka-centric
    cluster by provisioning the correct services and by disabling
    long-term
    audit logging in Ranger. 

Starting with Cloudera Runtime 7.1.6,
        long-term
        auditing
        in Ranger can be enabled or disabled.
        If
        you do not need to store audit logs for more than 90 days, long term audit logging can be
        disabled. If this feature is disabled, Ranger does not require HDFS as a
        dependency. As a result, you can install and deploy a
        Kafka-centric
        cluster, which has Kafka and Ranger, but not
        HDFS.
The following list of steps walk you through how you can set up a Kafka centric cluster.
        These instructions act as an extension to the CDP Private Cloud Base Installation
          Guide.
        These
        steps provide a use
        case-specific
        walkthrough of the Add Cluster - Configuration wizard. They are
        intended as an alternative to the instructions provided in Product Installation - Step
          7: Set Up a Cluster Using the Wizard.



Ensure that
          Cloudera
          Manager
          is installed and running on your cluster.
Kerberos must
          be
          set up and configured for your cluster. 
You
          must
          have logged into the Cloudera Manager Admin Console and
           completed
          the configuration and setup steps provided by the Add Cluster -
            Installation wizard. 
You
          must
          be ready to install and configure services with the Add
            Cluster - Configuration
          wizard.



If not started, start the Add Cluster - Configuration
          wizard.
To start the wizard, click Clusters > Add Services.
The
          Select
          Services page is displayed.

Select
          the
          services you want to install and
          configure.



Select the Custom Services option.


Scroll through the list and select the following services:



Core Configuration


Zookeeper


Kafka


Solr


Ranger





Click Continue. 
The
              Assign
              Roles page is displayed. 



Configure
          role assignments for the hosts in your cluster.
The
          Assign
          Roles page
          
          appears with suggested role assignments for some services. However, the Kafka Broker role
          and certain other optional roles must be configured manually. 


Click the Select hosts field below Kafka
                Broker. 


Select
              one
              or more hosts from the list.
The Kafka Broker role is assigned to the hosts that you select.


Click Ok.

Optional: 
 Select hosts for other optional roles available on this page.
Select hosts the same way as you did for the Kafka Broker role.noteOther
                optional roles displayed on this page are not required. 
                Assign
                hosts to these roles
                only
                if you want to
                
                access 
                the features that they provide. If selected, these roles might require additional
                configuration either during or after installation. Configuration of these roles is
                not covered in these instructions.


Click Continue.
The
              Setup
              Database page is displayed.



Set
          up
          the
          database.
On the Setup Database page, you can enter the database hosts,
          names, usernames, and passwords you created when you installed and configured the
          databases on your hosts. Database setup is required for the Ranger service and the Reports
          Manager role.noteIf the Cloudera Management Service was set up previously and is
            running, database setup for the Reports Manager role might not be needed. If
            configuration is not needed, the wizard only displays the configuration fields for
            Ranger.


Select the database type and enter the database name, username, and password for
              Ranger.
Ensure that No is selected from the Use JDBC URL
                Override drop-down list.


Select the database type and enter the database name, username, and password for
              Reports Manager. 
Skip this step if the configuration fields for Reports Manager are not displayed.
            


Click Test Connection to validate the settings. 


After verifying that connection is successful, click
                Continue. 
The
              Enter
              Required Parameters page is displayed. 



Enter the
          required
          parameters.
Ranger requires that you set initial passwords for a number of its users.


Set a password for each user by configuring the properties displayed on this
              page.


Click Continue.
The
              Review
              Changes page is displayed.

The
          Review
          Changes page lists default and suggested settings for several
          configuration parameters. In addition,
          this page
          enables
          you to configure your services before starting them for the first time. 


Find and configure the following properties:


Ranger Plugin DFS Audit Enabled: Clear the checkbox to
                  disable the feature.
