Unable to start DAS after installing the GPL Extras parcel
When CDH 7.1.x and
        GPL
        Extras parcels are activated in your CDP deployment, then you may not be able to start the
        DAS service and see the following error in the logs: Error: Could not find or load
            main class org.apache.ranger.credentialapi.buildks. 

When you activate multiple parcels in your deployment, the directory path of each
                parcel is appended to the PARCEL_DIRNAMES environment variable
                separated by colons (:). For example,
                    PARCEL_DIRNAMES=CDH-7.1.4-1.cdh7.1.4.p0.5755945:GPLEXTRAS-7.1.4-1.gplextras7.1.4.p0.5755945.
                This changes the path calculation for the Ranger plugin library
                    (ranger_hive_plugin_install_lib) in the DAS
                    /root/DAS-7.1.x/scripts/setup.py file. To resolve this issue,
                specify the latest activated CDH 7.1.x parcel directory in the DAS WebApp Advanced
                Configuration Snippet so that it overwrites the PARCEL_DIRNAMES
                environment variable.


Log into Cloudera Manager as an administrator.

Go to Clusters > $DAS service > Configuration > DAS WebApp and search for the Data Analytics Studio Webapp Server
                        Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) field.
                

Add the following property in the editor mode:

Key:
PARCEL_DIRNAMES
Value:
                            [***LATEST-PARCEL-DIRECTORY-NAME***]

In the Value field, enter the path of the latest
                    activated CDH 7.1.x parcel that you have installed on your cluster. 
For example:Key:
PARCEL_DIRNAMESValue:
CDH-7.1.4-1.cdh7.1.4.p0.5755945

Click Save Changes.

Restart the DAS service.
