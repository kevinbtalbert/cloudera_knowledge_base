Unable to view new databases and tables, or unable to see changes to the existing databases
  or tables
If you cannot see the new databases or tables, or the changes that you made to the
  existing tables, then try the following:


Verify whether the HIVE_ON_TEZ service is running by going to Cloudera Manager > Clusters > HIVE_ON_TEZ > Status.


This can also happen if the Hive metadata replication fails. To troubleshoot
     replication-related failures, see Troubleshooting replication failure in the DAS Event Processor.
