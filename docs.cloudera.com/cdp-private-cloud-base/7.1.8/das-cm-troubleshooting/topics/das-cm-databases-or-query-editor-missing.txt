Cannot see databases, or the query editor is missing

If you cannot see the databases or the query editor on the Compose page,
   then try the following:


Verify whether the HS2 service is running by going to Cloudera Manager > Clusters > HIVE_ON_TEZ > Status.


Verify whether the Hive configuration parameter in the Metastore Transactional
      Listener List field is set to
      org.apache.hive.hcatalog.listener.DbNotificationListener by going to Cloudera Manager > Clusters > HIVE_ON_TEZ > Configuration.


Ideally, the DAS Event Processor runs the repl dump command as a hive service user. The hive
     service user can run the repl dump command if the user has repl admin privileges. Verify
     whether DAS can read the repl root directory permissions, especially if DAS and hive are
     running as different service users.
There may be exceptions in the /var/log/das/event-processor.log file
     with repl dump failures because of read errors.
noteIf the DAS service cannot read the repl root directory permissions, then it can cause a
     number of repl directories to be created, but not deleted.
