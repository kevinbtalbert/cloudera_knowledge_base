Queries are not appearing on the Queries page

If queries are not appearing on the Queries page, then try the
   following:


Check your role. Only admin users can view queries and data of other users. Non-admin users
     can view only the queries that they have run.
To enlist yourself as the admin user, go to Cloudera Manager > Clusters > DAS > Configuration, and add your user name in the Admin Users field. 
For example, hive,admin1,admin2. To make all users administrators, specify
     an asterik (*).


Make sure that the DAS services are running as the hive service user.


Go to Cloudera Manager > Clusters > HIVE_ON_TEZ and verify whether the logs are added to the path specified in the
      Base Directory for Hive Proto Hook field.


Go to Cloudera Manager > Clusters > TEZ and verify whether the logs are added to the path specified in the
      Tez history events directory field.
Use the following command to get the path to the logs for
     Hive:hdfs dfs -ls /warehouse/tablespace/external/hive/sys.db/query_data
Use the following commands to get the paths to the logs for Tez:
     hdfs dfs -ls /warehouse/tablespace/external/hive/sys.db/dag_datahdfs dfs -ls /warehouse/tablespace/external/hive/sys.db/dag_metahdfs dfs -ls /warehouse/tablespace/external/hive/sys.db/app_data
If you have not run any queries, then the log directories can be empty.

Verify whether you have the required access and permission to directories specified in the
     Base Directory for Hive Proto Hook and Tez history events
     directory field by checking errors from EventProcessorPipeline in
    the /var/log/das/event-processor.log file. 

If you have a large number of users running Hive queries simultaneously using DAS, the
     connections from Hive can get exhausted. This sends the query to a queue in Hive which takes a
     long time to start running. This can result in the following: 

If a query is fired from DAS, it does not return any log or indicate that the
        query has been queued.


The query does not appear on the UI, because no event is received by DAS.


Evaluate your cluster usage. You may need to add more machines to the clusters to resolve
     this issue.
