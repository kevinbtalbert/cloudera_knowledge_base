DAS architecture
In a CDP Private Cloud Base deployment, DAS is included in the Cloudera Runtime parcel. Use the
  latest version of Cloudera Manager to configure and deploy DAS in your CDP Private Cloud Base
  clusters.
DAS comprises of an Event Processor and a Webapp. The Event Processor processes Hive and Tez
   events, and also replicates the Hive metadata. The Webapp serves as the DAS UI. It serves data
   from the Postgres instance which is populated by the Event Processor, and uses the Hive on Tez to
   run Hive queries triggered through the Query Compose page.
The following diagram shows the interactions between the DAS components and its
   dependencies:
