Backing up NameNode metadata
You must back up the VERSION file and then back up the NameNode metadata.

Make a single backup of the VERSION file. 
This does not need to be backed up regularly as it does not change, but it is
          important since it contains the clusterID, along with other details. 

Use the following command to back up the NameNode metadata. 
It automatically determines the active NameNode, retrieves the current fsimage, and
          places it in the defined backup_dir.
          hdfs dfsadmin -fetchImage backup_dir 

On startup, the NameNode process reads the
        fsimage file and commits it to memory. If the JournalNodes are up and
      running, and there are edit files present, any edits newer than the fsimage
      are also applied. If the JournalNodes are unavailable, it is possible to lose any data
      transferred in the interim.
