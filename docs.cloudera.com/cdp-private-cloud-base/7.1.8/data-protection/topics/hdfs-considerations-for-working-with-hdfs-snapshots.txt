Considerations for working with HDFS snapshots
You can create snapshots only for directories that allow the creation of snapshots.
        If a directory already contains snapshots, you cannot delete or rename the directory unless
        you remove all the snapshots.
You must consider the following when working with HDFS snapshots:
You must enable snapshot creation on a particular directory before creating
                    snapshots on that directory. Such a directory is termed as a
                        snapshottable directory. However, you cannot create snapshots
                    on a directory if its corresponding child or parent directory is already enabled
                    for snapshot creation.
You cannot delete or rename a directory that contains snapshots. You must first
                    remove all the snapshots before attempting the delete or rename operation.
For a snapshottable directory, its path component .snapshot can
                    be used to access the snapshots.For example, consider the directory
                            /foo that is enabled for snapshot creation. For the
                        directory /foo with a snapshot snap1, the
                        path /foo/.snapshot/snap1 refers to the snapshot of
                            /foo.
You can enable or disable snapshot creation on a particular directory only if
                    you have the superuser privilege.
On a snapshottable directory; you can create, delete, or rename snapshots. These
                    operations require either the superuser privilege or the owner access to the
                    directory. In addition, you can list directories that have snapshot creation
                    enabled or view differences between contents of snapshots.
You cannot rename a snapshot outside the snapshottable directory.
