Create snapshots on a directoryCloudera Docs
Create snapshots on a directory
You can create snapshots on a specified directory and protect your important
        data.
You must have enabled snapshot creation.

Only a user with either of the following privileges can perform this task:
The owner privilege to the directory on which to create the snapshots
The superuser privilege




Run the hdfs dfs command with the
                        -createSnapshot option and specify the path to the
                    directory on which you want to create snapshots.
The following example shows how you can create a snapshot
                        snap1 on the directory
                        /data/dir1:hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /data/dir1 snap1If
                        snapshot creation is successfully enabled on the specified directory, a
                        confirmation message
                            appears.Created snapshot /data/dir1/.snapshot/snap2noteYou
                            can also run the command without mentioning the snapshot name. In such a
                            situation, the new snapshot has the time stamp of creation as its name.
                            See the following
                            example:Created snapshot /data/dir1/.snapshot/s20180412-065533.159
