Enable and disable snapshot creation using Cloudera Manager
For snapshots to be created, HDFS directories must be enabled for snapshots. You
        cannot specify a directory as part of a snapshot policy unless it has been enabled for
        snapshots.

From the Clusters tab, select the HDFS
                    service.

Go to the File Browser tab.

Go to the directory you want to enable for snapshots.

In the File Browser, click the drop-down menu next to the full file path and
                    select Enable Snapshots.

noteOnce you enable snapshots for a directory, you cannot enable snapshots on
                        any of its subdirectories. Snapshots can be taken only on directories that
                        have snapshots enabled.


noteTo disable snapshots for a directory that has snapshots enabled, use
                            Disable Snapshots from the drop-down menu specified earlier. If
                        snapshots of the directory exist, they must be deleted before snapshots can
                        be disabled.
