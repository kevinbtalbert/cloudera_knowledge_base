Managing snapshot policies using Cloudera Manager
Cloudera Manager enables the creation of snapshot policies that define the
        directories or tables for which snapshots should be taken, the intervals at which snapshots
        should be taken, and the number of snapshots that should be kept for each snapshot
        interval.
For example, you can create a policy that takes both daily and weekly snapshots, and
            specify that seven daily snapshots and five weekly snapshots should be maintained.
