Options to determine differences between contents of snapshots
Run the hdfs snapshotDiff command for a report that lists the
        difference between the contents of two snapshots. Run the distcp diff
        command to determine the difference between contents of specified source and target
        snapshots, and use the command with the -update option to move the
        difference to a specified target directory.
Generating a report listing the difference between contents of two
                snapshots
Using the hdfs snapshotDiff between two snapshots on a specified
                directory path provides the list of changes to the directory. Consider the following
                example:


hdfs snapshotDiff /data/dir1 snap1 snap2
M	.
-	./file1.csv
R	./file2.txt -> ./fileold.txt
+	./filenew.txt


This example shows the following changes to the directory /data/dir1
                after the creation of snap1 and before the creation of
                    snap2:
Statement
Explanation

 M .
The directory /data/dir1 is modified.

- ./file1.csv
The file file1.csv is deleted.

R ./file2.txt -> ./fileold.txt
The file file2.txt is renamed to
                                fileold.txt.

+ ./filenew.txt
The file filenew.txt is added to the directory
                                /data/dir1.


Moving the differences between the contents of two snapshots to a specified
                directory
Using the distcp diff command with the -update
                option on snapshots enables you to determine the difference between the contents of
                two snapshots and move the difference to a specified target directory. Consider the
                following example:

hadoop distcp -diff snap_old snap_new -update /data/source_dir
                /data/target_dir
The command in this example determines the changes between
            the snapshots snap_old and snap_new present in the
                source_dir directory, and updates the
            target_dirdirectory with the changes.The following conditions must
                be satisfied for the content changes to be moved to
                    /data/target_dir:
Both /data/source_dir and /data/target_dir
                        are distributed file system paths.
The snapshots snap_old and snap_new are
                        created for /data/source_dir such that
                            snap_old is older than snap_new.
The /data/target_dir path also contains
                            snap_old. In addition, no changes are made to
                            /data/target_dir after the creation of
                            snap_old.
