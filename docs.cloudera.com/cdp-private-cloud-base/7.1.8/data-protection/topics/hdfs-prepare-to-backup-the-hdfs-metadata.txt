Prepare to back up the HDFS metadata
Regardless of the solution, a full, up-to-date continuous backup of the
                        namespace is not possible. Some of the most recent data is always lost. HDFS
                        is not an Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) system. Most data can be
                        easily recreated if you re-run Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) or processing
                        jobs.


Normal NameNode failures are handled by the Standby NameNode. Doing so
                        creates a safety-net for the very unlikely case where both master NameNodes
                        fail.


In the case of both NameNode failures, you can start the NameNode service
                        with the most recent image of the namespace.


Name Nodes maintain the namespace as follows:


Standby NameNodes keep a namespace image in memory based on
                                    edits available in a storage ensemble in Journal
                                Nodes.


Standby NameNodes make a namespace checkpoint and saves an
                           fsimage_* to disk.


Standby NameNodes transfer the fsimage to the primary
                                NameNodes using HTTP.




Both NameNodes write fsimages to disk in the following
                sequence:


NameNodes write the namespace to a file fsimage.ckpt_*
                        on disk.


NameNodes creates an fsimage_*.md5 file.


NameNodes moves the file fsimage.ckpt_* to
                            fsimage_.*.


The process by which both NameNodes write fsimages to disk
                ensures that:


The most recent namespace image on disk in an fsimage_* file is on
                  the standby NameNode.


Any fsimage_* file on disk is finalized and does not
                        receive updates.
