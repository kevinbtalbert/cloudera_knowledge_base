Preventing inadvertent deletion of directories
You can prevent inadvertent deletion of important data from your HDFS cluster by
        marking specific directories as protected. Marking a directory as protected
        prevents its recursive deletion. However, this does not protect against graceful deletion of
        files under the directory. You can delete the files by moving them to trash.

Go to the HDFS service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Set the Cluster-wide Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                        for core-site.xml property as specified:


Name:
                            fs.protected.directories
Value: Specify a comma-separated list of the
                            directories that you want to mark as protected; for
                            example, /user, /data, and so on.



Enter a Reason for Change, and then click
                        Save Changes to save the property changes.

Restart the cluster.

noteBy default, subdirectories present under directories
                            (fs.protected.directories) are not protected. You
                        must set the dfs.protected.subdirectories.enable
                        parameter to true to protect subdirectories. For
                        example, if you set the fs.protected.directories
                        parameter to true for the parent directory
                            testA, the subdirectory testB
                        under testA(/testA/testB) can be deleted or renamed if
                            dfs.protected.subdirectories.enable is set to
                            false.
