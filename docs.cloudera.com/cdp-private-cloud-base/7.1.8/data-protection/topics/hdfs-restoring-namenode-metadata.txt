Restoring NameNode metadata
If both the NameNode and the secondary NameNode were to suddenly go offline, you can
    restore the NameNode.

Add a new host to your Hadoop cluster. 

Add the NameNode role to the host. Make sure it has the same hostname as the original
          NameNode.

Create a directory path for the NameNode name.dir (for
            example, /dfs/nn/current), ensuring that the permissions are set
          correctly. 

Copy the VERSION and latest fsimage file to the
             /dfs/nn/current directory. 

Run the following command to create the md5 file for the fsimage.

md5sum fsimage > fsimage.md5


Start the NameNode process.
