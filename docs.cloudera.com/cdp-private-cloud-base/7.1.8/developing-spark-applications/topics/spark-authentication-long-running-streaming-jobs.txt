Configuring authentication for long-running Spark Streaming
    jobs

 Long-running applications such as Spark Streaming jobs must be able to
      write data continuously, which means that the user may need to delegate tokens possibly beyond
      the default lifetime. This workload type requires passing Kerberos principal and keytab to the
        spark-submit script using the --principal and
        --keytab parameters. 
noteOnly YARN cluster mode is supported with the
          --principal and --keytab parameters. The keytab
      is copied to the host running the ApplicationMaster, and the Kerberos login is renewed
      periodically by using the principal and keytab to generate the required delegation tokens
      needed for HDFS. 
note For secure distribution of the keytab to the
      ApplicationMaster host, the cluster should be configured for TLS/SSL
      communication for YARN and HDFS encryption.
