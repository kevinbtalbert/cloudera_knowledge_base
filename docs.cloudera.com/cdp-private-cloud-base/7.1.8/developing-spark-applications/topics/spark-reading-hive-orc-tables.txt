Reading Hive ORC tables


For existing Hive tables, Spark can read them without
          createOrReplaceTempView. If the table is stored as
        ORC format (the default), predicate push-down, partition pruning, and
        vectorized query execution are also applied according to the
        configuration.
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM hiveTable WHERE age = 20")
