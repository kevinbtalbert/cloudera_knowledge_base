Accessing Spark SQL through the Spark shell
Use the following steps to access Spark SQL using the Spark shell. 

The following sample command launches the Spark shell on a YARN cluster:

spark-shell --num-executors 1 --executor-memory 512m --master
          yarn-client

To read data directly from the file system, construct a SQLContext. For
        an example that uses SQLContext and the Spark DataFrame API to access a
        JSON file, see Using the Spark DataFrame API.
To read data by interacting with the Hive Metastore, construct a HiveContext instance
        (HiveContext extends SQLContext). For an example of the use of HiveContext (instantiated as
          val sqlContext), see "Accessing ORC Files from Spark" in this guide.
