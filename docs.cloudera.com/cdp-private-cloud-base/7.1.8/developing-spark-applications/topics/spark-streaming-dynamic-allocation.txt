Spark Streaming and Dynamic Allocation
Dynamic allocation is enabled by default, which means that
    executors are removed when idle. Dynamic allocation conflicts with Spark
    Streaming operations.

        In Spark Streaming, data comes in batches, and executors run whenever
        data is available. If the executor idle timeout is less than the batch
        duration, executors are constantly added and removed. However, if the
        executor idle timeout is greater than the batch duration, executors are
        never removed. Therefore, Cloudera recommends that you disable dynamic
        allocation by setting spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled
        to false when running streaming applications.
