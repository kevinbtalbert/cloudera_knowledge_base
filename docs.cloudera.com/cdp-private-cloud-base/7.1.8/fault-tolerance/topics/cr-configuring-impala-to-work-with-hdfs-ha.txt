Configuring Impala to work with HDFS HA
You must reconfigure the Hive metastore database and issue from the INVALIDATE
      METADATA statement from the Impala shell.

Complete the steps to reconfigure the Hive metastore database.
Impala shares the same underlying database with Hive, to manage metadata for
          databases, tables, and so on.

Issue the INVALIDATE METADATA statement from an Impala shell.
This one-time operation makes all Impala daemons across the cluster aware of the
          latest settings for the Hive metastore database. 
Alternatively, restart the Impala service.
