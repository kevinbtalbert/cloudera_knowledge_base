Disabling and redeploying HDFS HA
When you disable HDFS HA, Cloudera Manager ensures that one NameNode is active, and
    saves the namespace. Then it stops the standby NameNode, creates a Secondary NameNode, removes
    the standby NameNode role, and restarts all the HDFS services.
Go to the HDFS service.Select Actions > Disable
            High Availability.
Select the hosts for the NameNode and the Secondary NameNode and click
            Continue.
Select the HDFS checkpoint directory and click
          Continue.Confirm that you want to take this action.Configure the Hive Metastore to use HDFS HA.
