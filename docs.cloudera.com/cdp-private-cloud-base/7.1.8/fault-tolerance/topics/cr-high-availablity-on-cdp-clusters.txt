High Availability on HDFS clusters
Configuring HDFS High Availability (HA) eliminates the NameNode as a potential single
      point of failure (SPOF) in an HDFS cluster.

Configuring HDFS High AvailabilityThe HDFS NameNode High Availability (HA) feature enables you to run redundant     NameNodes in the same cluster in an Active/Passive configuration with a hot standby. This     eliminates the NameNode as a potential single point of failure (SPOF) in an HDFS     cluster.
