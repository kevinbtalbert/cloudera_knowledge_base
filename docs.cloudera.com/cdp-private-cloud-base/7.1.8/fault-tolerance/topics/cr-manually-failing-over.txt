Manually failing over to the standby NameNode
If you are running a HDFS service with HA enabled, you can manually cause the active
        NameNode to failover to the standby NameNode. This is useful for planned downtimeâ€”for
        hardware changes, configuration changes, or software upgrades of your primary
        host.


Go to the HDFS service.

Click the Instances tab.

Click Federation and High Availability.

Locate the row for the Nameservice where you want to fail over the NameNode. 
Multiple rows display only when using HDFS federation.

Select Actions > Manual Failover.

noteThis option does not appear if HA is not enabled for the cluster.


From the pop-up, select the NameNode that should be made active, then click
                        Manual Failover.

noteFor advanced use only: You can set the Force Failover
                        checkbox to force the selected NameNode to be active, irrespective of its
                        state or the other NameNode's state. Forcing a failover will first attempt
                        to failover the selected NameNode to active mode and the other NameNode to
                        standby mode. It will do so even if the selected NameNode is in safe mode.
                        If this fails, it will proceed to transition the selected NameNode to active
                        mode. To avoid having two NameNodes be active, use this only if the other
                        NameNode is either definitely stopped, or can be transitioned to standby
                        mode by the first failover step.


Click Finish.

Cloudera Manager transitions the NameNode you selected to be
            the active NameNode, and the other NameNode to be the standby NameNode. HDFS should
                never have two active NameNodes.
