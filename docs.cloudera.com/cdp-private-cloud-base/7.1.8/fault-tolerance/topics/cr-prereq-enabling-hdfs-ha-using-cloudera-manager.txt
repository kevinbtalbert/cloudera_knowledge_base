There are certain prerequisites that your cluster must satisfy before HDFS HA can be
    enabled using Cloudera Manager.
You must perform the following tasks before enabling HDFS HA:
Ensure that you perform all the required configuration and setup tasks.
Enabling and disabling HA causes a service outage for the HDFS service and all
            services that depend on HDFS. Before enabling or disabling HA, ensure that there are
          no jobs running on your cluster.
Ensure that you have a ZooKeeper service configured.

Enabling or disabling HA causes the previous monitoring history to become
            unavailable.
Some parameters will be automatically set as follows once you have enabled JobTracker
            HA. If you want to change the value from the default for these parameters, use an
            advanced configuration snippet.

mapred.job.tracker.persist.jobstatus.active: true
