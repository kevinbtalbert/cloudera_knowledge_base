Using Cloudera Manager to manage HDFS HA
You can use Cloudera Manager to configure your CDP cluster for HDFS HA and automatic
        failover. 
Enabling HDFS HAAn HDFS high availability (HA) cluster uses two NameNodes -- an active NameNode and a     standby NameNode. Only one NameNode can be active at any point in time.Prerequisites for enabling HDFS HA using Cloudera ManagerThere are certain prerequisites that your cluster must satisfy before HDFS HA can be     enabled using Cloudera Manager.Enabling High Availability and automatic failoverYou can use Cloudera Manager to configure your CDP cluster for HDFS HA and automatic     failover. In Cloudera Manager, HA is implemented using Quorum-based storage. Quorum-based     storage relies upon a set of JournalNodes, each of which maintains a local edits directory that     logs the modifications to the namespace metadata. Enabling HA enables automatic failover as part     of the same command.Disabling and redeploying HDFS HAWhen you disable HDFS HA, Cloudera Manager ensures that one NameNode is active, and     saves the namespace. Then it stops the standby NameNode, creates a Secondary NameNode, removes     the standby NameNode role, and restarts all the HDFS services.Configuring other CDP components to use HDFS HAYou can use the HDFS high availability NameNodes with other components of     CDP.Changing a nameservice name for Highly Available HDFS using Cloudera ManagerBased on your requirements, you can change a nameservice name for a cluster that has     HDFS HA configured.Manually failing over to the standby NameNodeIf you are running a HDFS service with HA enabled, you can manually cause the active         NameNode to failover to the standby NameNode. This is useful for planned downtimeâ€”for         hardware changes, configuration changes, or software upgrades of your primary         host.Additional HDFS haadmin commands to administer the clusterAfter your HA NameNodes are configured and started, you will have access to some         additional commands to administer your HA HDFS cluster.Turning safe mode on HA NameNodesYou can use the applicable dfsadmin command options to turn safe         mode on for a single or both the active and standby NameNodes. Converting from an NFS-mounted shared edits directory to Quorum-Based StorageConverting a HA configuration from using an NFS-mounted shared edits directory to         Quorum-based storage involves disabling the current HA configuration then enabling HA using         Quorum-based storage.Parent topic: Configuring HDFS High Availability
