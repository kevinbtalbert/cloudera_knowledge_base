Troubleshooting Prometheus for SMM
Troubleshooting Prometheus for SMM requires being able to diagnose and debug problems
                related to performance, network connectivity, out-of-memory conditions, disk space
                usage, and crash or non-responsive conditions.
This section provides some troubleshooting solutions for Prometheus issues for SMM.
Issue: If no metrics are available.
Solution: Examine if all configured Prometheus targets are running.
Issue: You observe incorrect metrics in SMM.
Solution: Examine up metrics to determine if scraping failed at certain
            points in time.
Issue: If Prometheus does not start up or scrape right after Kafka startup, or Prometheus
            is down for some time, scrapped metric values might be unusually high. 
Solution: This situation can be avoided by querying the endpoints manually with the
                                                  update=true parameter and then
                                                starting Prometheus. If you already encountered this
                                                situation, you can delete that particular time
                                                series with the delete API of Prometheus.
