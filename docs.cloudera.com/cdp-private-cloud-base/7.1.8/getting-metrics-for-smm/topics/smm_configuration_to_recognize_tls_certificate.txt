Configuring SMM to recognize Prometheus’s TLS certificate
You can configure Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) either to use its own keystore or
        truststore, or to use the auto-TLS feature in Cloudera Manager. Cloudera recommends using
        the auto-TLS feature for CDP clusters.

If the TLS proxy’s certificate is not recognized by SMM, it must be added to SMM
                truststore. The process is different for auto-TLS and the manual TLS setups.

Auto-TLS
If the TLS proxy certificate is not recognized by the cluster, you can add the TLS
                proxy certificate to the CA truststore of the cluster by triggering a certificate
                regeneration. This involves restarting the services in the cluster.
Go to Administration >  Security from the left menu bar.




Click Rotate Auto-TLS Certificates.
In the Trusted CA Certificates Location field, enter
                        the path to the Nginx server’s certificate. For example,
                            /etc/nginx/certs/ca-certificate.pem. Ensure that the
                        file is accessible by the cloudera-scm user.
Specify the authentication method with other nodes of the cluster (password
                        or certificate).
Click Next and follow the instructions in the
                        wizard.


Manual TLS

You can use the keytool command to configure the manual TLS
                        settings.Keytool is a tool provided by the Java Runtime Environment to
                    manipulate JKS type keystores. You can find it in the bin
                    folder of your JRE installation. For example,
                        /usr/java/default/jre/bin/keytool.
Use the following command to add the TLS proxy’s certificate to SMM’s
                                truststore:keytool -import -file <TLS PROXY OR CA CERTIFICATE> -alias Nginx_for_Prometheus -keystore <SMM_TRUSTSTORE> -storepass <TRUSTSTORE PASSWORD>For
                                example,keytool -import -file /etc/nginx/certs/ca-certificate.pem -alias Nginx_for_Prometheus -keystore smm_trusstore.jksThis
                                command creates the truststore if it does not already
                            exist.
Create a keystore for SMM if it does not already
                                exist:keytool -genkey -keystore smm_keystore.jks -alias smm -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA256withRSA -validity 365 -keysize 3072It
                                creates a keystore with a self-signed key.
Set the following SMM properties in Cloudera Manager:
streams.messaging.manager.ssl.keyStorePath/ssl_server_keystore_location
ssl_server_keystore_password
ssl_server_keystore_keypassword (by default it
                                    is the same as the keystore file password)
streams.messaging.manager.ssl.trustStorePath/ssl_client_truststore_location
ssl_client_truststore_password
