HBase backup and disaster recovery strategies
Backup-and-restore is a standard set of operations for many databases. You must have
        an effective backup-and-restore strategy to ensure that you can recover data in case of data
        loss or failures.
HBase snapshot enables you to take a snapshot of a table without much impact on
            RegionServers, because snapshot, clone, and restore operations do not involve data
            copying. In addition, exporting a snapshot to another cluster has no impact on
            RegionServers.
If your data is already in an HBase cluster, replication is useful for getting the data
            into additional HBase clusters.
