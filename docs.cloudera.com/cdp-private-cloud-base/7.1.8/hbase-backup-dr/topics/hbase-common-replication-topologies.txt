Common replication topologies
You must learn about the common replication topologies before you configure and deploy
  HBase replication.
Some common replication topologies are:
A central source cluster might propagate changes to multiple destination clusters, for
     failover or due to geographic distribution.
A source cluster might push changes to a destination cluster, which might also push its own
     changes back to the original cluster.
Many different low-latency clusters might push changes to one centralized cluster for backup
     or resource-intensive data-analytics jobs. The processed data might then be replicated back to
     the low-latency clusters.
Multiple levels of replication can be chained together to suit your needs.
