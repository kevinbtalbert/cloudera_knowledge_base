Configure snapshots
Snapshots are enabled by default, you must disable snapshots if you do not intend to
      use it. Snapshots do not affect HBase performance if they are not used.
Snapshots are on by default; to disable them, set the
          hbase.snapshot.enabled property in
          hbase-site.xml to false:
<property>
   <name>hbase.snapshot.enabled</name>
   <value>
      false
   </value>
</property>
To enable snapshots after you have disabled them, set
          hbase.snapshot.enabled to true.
note
If you have taken snapshots and then decide to disable snapshots, you must
            delete the snapshots before restarting the HBase master; the HBase
            master will not start if snapshots are disabled and snapshots exist.
