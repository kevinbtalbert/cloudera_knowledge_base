Dynamic resource pools are used to control the resources available for MapReduce jobs
        created for HBase snapshots on Amazon S3. By default, MapReduce jobs run against the default
        dynamic resource pool.

                follow these steps:


Open the HBase service page.

Select Scope > HBASE
                            (Service-Wide).

Select Category > Backup.

Type Scheduler in the Search
                    box.

Enter name of a dynamic resource pool in the Scheduler pool for remote snapshots in
                        AWS S3 property.

Click Save Changes.
