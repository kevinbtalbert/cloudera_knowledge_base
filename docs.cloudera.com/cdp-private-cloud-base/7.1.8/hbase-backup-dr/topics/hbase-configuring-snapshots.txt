Configuring HBase snapshots
HBase snapshot support enables you to take a snapshot of a table without much impact
        on RegionServers, because snapshot, clone, and restore operations do not involve data
        copying. In addition, exporting a snapshot to another cluster has no impact on
        RegionServers.
About HBase snapshotsHBase snapshots allow you to clone a table without making data copies, and with       minimal impact on RegionServers. Exporting the table to another cluster does not have any       impact on the RegionServers.Configure snapshotsSnapshots are enabled by default, you must disable snapshots if you do not intend to       use it. Snapshots do not affect HBase performance if they are not used.Manage HBase snapshots using Cloudera ManagerFor HBase services, you can use the Table Browser tab to view the HBase tables       associated with a service on your cluster. You can view the currently saved snapshots for your       tables, and delete or restore them. Store HBase snapshots on Amazon S3HBase snapshots can be stored on the cloud storage service Amazon S3.Manage HBase snapshots using the HBase shellYou can manage snapshots by using the HBase shell, or you can use a shell       script.Export a snapshot to another clusterYou can export any snapshot from one cluster to another. Exporting the snapshot copies       the table's hfiles, logs, and the snapshot metadata, from the source cluster to the       destination cluster.Snapshot failuresRegion moves, splits, and other metadata actions that happen while a snapshot is in       progress can cause the snapshot to fail. The software detects and rejects corrupted snapshot       attempts.
