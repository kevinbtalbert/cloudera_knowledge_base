Enable bulk load replication using Cloudera Manager
You can enable bulk load replication using Cloudera Manager.

If you have enabled Kerberos cross-realm authentication:

At the command line, use the list_principals command to list
                    the kdc, admin_server, and
                        default_domain for each realm.
Add this information to each cluster using Cloudera Manager. For each cluster,
                    go to HDFS > Configuration > Trusted Kerberos Realms. Add the target and source realms. This requires a restart of
                    HDFS.
Enter a Reason for change, and then click Save Changes to
                    commit the changes. Restart the role and service when Cloudera Manager prompts
                    you to restart.



Go to the source cluster from which you want to replicate the buck loaded
                    data.

Go to HBase > Configuration.

Select Scope > (Service-Wide). 

Locate the HBase Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                        for hbase-site.xml property or search for it by typing its name in
                    the Search box.

Add the following property values:


Name: hbase.replication.bulkload.enabledValue:
                                trueDescription: Enable bulk load replication
Name: hbase.replication.cluster.id Value: source1Description:
                                Provide a source cluster-ID. For example, source1. 



Manually copy and paste the source cluster’s HBase client configuration files
                    in the target cluster where you want the data to be replicated. Copy
                        core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, and
                        hbase-site.xml to the target cluster. Do this for all
                    RegionServers.

Go to the target cluster where you want the data to be replicated. 

Go to HBase > Configuration.

Select Scope > (Service-Wide). 

Locate the HBase Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                        for hbase-site.xml property or search for it by typing its name in
                    the Search box.

Add the following property value:


Name: hbase.replication.conf.dir Value:
                                /opt/cloudera/fs_confDescription: Path to the configuration
                                directory where the source cluster’s configuration files have been
                                copied. The path for copying the configuration file is
                                [hbase.replication.conf.dir]/[hbase.replication.cluster.id],
                                i.e.:/opt/cloudera/fs_conf/source/



Restart the HBase service on both clusters to deploy the new
                    configurations.

In the target cluster, ensure that you copy the
                                    configuration files to the path set in
                                    [hbase.replication.conf.dir]. There, you must create a directory
                                    with the [hbase.replication.cluster.id] name. 


Make sure to set the correct file permissions to hbase user using
                                    the command:
                                    chown -R hbase:hbase /opt/cloudera/fs_conf/source





Add the peer to the source cluster as you would with normal replication.


In the HBase shell, add the target cluster as a peer using the following
                            command:
                            add_peer '1', CLUSTER_KEY => '<cluster_name>:<hbase_port>:/hbase'
Enable the replication for the table to which you will be bulk loading
                            data using the
                            command:enable_table_replication 'IntegrationTestBulkLoad'
Alternatively, you can allow replication on a column family using the
                            command:
                            disable ‘IntegrationTestBulkLoad’
alter 'IntegrationTestBulkLoad', {NAME => ‘D’, REPLICATION_SCOPE => '1'}
enable ‘IntegrationTestBulkLoad’




You can verify if BulkLoad Replication is working in your set up by
                        following the example in this blog post:
