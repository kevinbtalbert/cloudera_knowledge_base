      associated with a service on your cluster. You can view the currently saved snapshots for your
      tables, and delete or restore them.

View the list of saved snapshots currently maintained. These can
          include one-off immediate snapshots, as well as scheduled policy-based
          snapshots.
Delete a saved snapshot.
Restore from a saved snapshot.
Restore a table from a saved snapshot to a new table (Restore As).
