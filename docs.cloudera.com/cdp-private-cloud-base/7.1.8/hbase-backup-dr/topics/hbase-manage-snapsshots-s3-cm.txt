Manage HBase snapshots on Amazon S3 in Cloudera Manager
 You can manage your snaphots stored on Amazon S3 using Cloudera Manager. 
To take HBase snapshots and store them on Amazon S3, perform the following
            steps

On the HBase service page in Cloudera Manager, click the Table Browser tab.

Select a table in the Table Browser. If any recent local or remote snapshots
                    already exist, they display on the right side.

In the dropdown for the selected table, click Take Snapshot.

Enter a name in the Snapshot Name field of
                    the Take Snapshot dialog box.

If Amazon S3 storage is configured, the Take
                        Snapshot dialog box Destination
                    section shows a choice of Local or Remote S3. Select Remote S3.

Click Take Snapshot.
While the Take Snapshot command is running,
                    a local copy of the snapshot with a name beginning cm-tmp followed by an
                    auto-generated filename is displayed in the Table Browser. This local copy is
                    deleted as soon as the remote snapshot has been stored in Amazon S3. If the
                    command fails without being completed, the temporary local snapshot might not be
                    deleted. This copy can be manually deleted or kept as a valid local snapshot. To
                    store a current snapshot in Amazon S3, run the Take Snapshot command again, selecting Remote S3 as the Destination, or use
                    the HBase command-line tools to manually export the existing temporary local
                    snapshot to Amazon S3.
