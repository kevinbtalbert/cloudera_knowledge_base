Manage Policies for HBase snapshots in Amazon S3
You can configure policies to automatically create snapshots of HBase tables on an
    hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis. Snapshot policies for HBase snapshots stored in
    Amazon S3 are configured using the same procedures as for local HBase snapshots. See the  Cloudera Manager snapshot polices for more information. For snapshots stored in Amazon
        S3, you must also choose Remote S3 in the Destination section of the policy
        management dialog boxes.noteYou can only configure a policy as Local or Remote S3 at the time the policy is created
      and cannot change the setting later. If the setting is wrong, create a new policy.When you create a snapshot based on a snapshot policy, a local copy of the
      snapshot is created with a name beginning with cm-auto followed by an auto-generated filename. The temporary copy of the snapshot
      is displayed in the Table Browser and is deleted as soon as the remote snapshot has been
      stored in Amazon S3. If the snapshot procedure fails without being completed, the temporary
      local snapshot might not be deleted. This copy can be manually deleted or kept as a valid
      local snapshot. To export the HBase snapshot to Amazon S3, use the HBase command-line tools to
      manually export the existing temporary local snapshot to Amazon S3.
