Replication across three or more clusters
When configuring replication among three or more clusters, Cloudera recommends to enable
      KEEP_DELETED_CELLS on column families in the destination cluster, where
      REPLICATION_SCOPE=1 in the source cluster.
The following commands show how to enable this configuration using HBase Shell.
On the source
     cluster:create 't1',{NAME=>'f1', REPLICATION_SCOPE=>1}
On the destination
     cluster:create 't1',{NAME=>'f1', KEEP_DELETED_CELLS=>'true'}
