Restore an HBase snapshot from Amazon S3
You can restore a snapshot that you have stored on Amazon S3.
To restore a snapshot stored on Amazon S3

Select the table in the Table Browser.

Click Restore Table.

Choose Remote S3 and select the table to
                    restore.

Click Restore.
Cloudera Manager creates a local copy of the remote snapshot with a name
                    beginning with cm-tmp followed
                    by an auto-generated filename, and uses that local copy to restore the table in
                    HBase. Cloudera Manager then automatically deletes the local copy. If the Restore command fails without completing, the
                    temporary copy might not be deleted and can be seen in the Table Browser. In
                    that case, delete the local temporary copy manually and re-run the Restore command to restore the table from
                    Amazon S3.
