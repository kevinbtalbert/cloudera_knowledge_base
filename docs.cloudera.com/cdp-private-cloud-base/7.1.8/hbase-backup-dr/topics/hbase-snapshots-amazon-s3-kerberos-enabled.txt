HBase snapshots on Amazon S3 with Kerberos enabled
 YARN should by default allow the hbase user to run MapReduce jobs
        even when Kerberos is enabled.
If Kerberos is enabled on your cluster, and YARN does not allow the
                hbase user to run MapReduce jobs, perform the following
            steps

Open the YARN service page in Cloudera Manager.

Select Scope > NodeManager.

Select Category > Security.

In the Allowed System
                        Users property, click the + sign and add hbase to the list of allowed system
                    users.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the YARN service.
