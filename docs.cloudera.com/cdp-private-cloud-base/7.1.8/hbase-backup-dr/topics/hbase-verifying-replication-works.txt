Verify that replication works
Confirm data has been replicated from a source cluster to a remote destination cluster.

Install and configure YARN on the source cluster. 

If YARN cannot be used in the source cluster, configure YARN on the
                        destination cluster to verify replication.
If neither the source nor the destination clusters can have YARN installed,
                        you can configure the tool to use local mode; however, performance and
                        consistency could be negatively impacted.


Ensure that you have the required permissions:


You have sudo permissions to run commands as the hbase user, or a user
                            with admin permissions on both clusters.
You are an hbase user configured for submitting jobs with YARN.

noteTo use the hbase user in a secure cluster, use Cloudera Manager to add the
                        hbase user as a YARN whitelisted user. For a new installation, the hbase
                        user is already added to the whitelisted users. In addition, /user/hbase
                        should exist on HDFS and owned as the hbase user, because YARN will create a
                        job staging directory there.


Run the VerifyReplication command:

src-node$ sudo -u hbase hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.replication.VerifyReplication peer1 table1
...
        org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.replication.VerifyReplication$Verifier$Counters

                ONLY_IN_PEER_TABLE_ROWS=1

The following table describes the VerifyReplication
                            counters:Table 1. VerifyReplication Counters

Counter
Description



GOODROWS
Number of rows. On both clusters, and all values are
                                            the same.


CONTENT_DIFFERENT_ROWS
The key is the same on both source and destination
                                            clusters for a row, but the value differs.


ONLY_IN_SOURCE_TABLE_ROWS
Rows that are only present in the source cluster but
                                            not in the destination cluster.


ONLY_IN_PEER_TABLE_ROWS
Rows that are only present in the destination cluster
                                            but not in the source cluster.


BADROWS
Total number of rows that differ from the source and
                                            destination clusters; the sum of
                                                CONTENT_DIFFERENT_ROWS +
                                                ONLY_IN_SOURCE_TABLE_ROWS +
                                                ONLY_IN_PEER_TABLE_ROWS


By default, VerifyReplication compares the entire content of
                            table1 on the source cluster against
                            table1 on the destination cluster that is configured to
                        use the replication peer peer1.
Use the following options to define the period of time, versions, or column
                            familiesTable 2. VerifyReplication Counters

Option
Description



--starttime=<timestamp>
Beginning of the time range, in milliseconds. Time
                                            range is forever if no end time is defined.


--endtime=<timestamp>
End of the time range, in milliseconds.


--versions=<versions>
Number of cell versions to verify.


--families=<cf1,cf2,..>
Families to copy; separated by commas.


The following example, verifies replication only for rows with a timestamp
                        range of one
                        day:src-node$ sudo -u hbase hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.replication.VerifyReplication --starttime=1472499077000 --endtime=1472585477000 --families=c1  peer1 table1
