Request a timeline-consistent read
You can use request a timeline-consistent read in your application.

To request a timeline-consistent read in your application, use the
                    get.setConsistency(Consistency.TIMELINE) method before
                performing the Get or Scan operation.
To check whether the result is stale (comes from a secondary replica), use the
                    isStale() method of the result object. Use the following
                examples for reference. 


Get request

Get get = new Get(key);
get.setConsistency(Consistency.TIMELINE);
Result result = table.get(get);


Scan request

Scan scan = new Scan();
scan.setConsistency(CONSISTENCY.TIMELINE);
ResultScanner scanner = table.getScanner(scan);
Result result = scanner.next();


Scan request to a specific replica.

This example overrides the normal behavior of sending the read request to all
                        known replicas, and only sends it to the replica specified by ID.
Scan scan = new Scan();
scan.setConsistency(CONSISTENCY.TIMELINE);
scan.setReplicaId(2);
ResultScanner scanner = table.getScanner(scan);
Result result = scanner.next();


Detect a stale result

You can also request timeline consistency using HBase Shell, allowing the
                        result to come from a secondary replica.
hbase> get 'myTable', 'myRow', {CONSISTENCY => "TIMELINE"}
hbase> scan 'myTable', {CONSISTENCY => 'TIMELINE'}
