Timeline consistency
You can change your consistency level to TIMELINE to allow a more
  flexible standard of consistency than the default HBase model of STRONG
  consistency. 
A client can indicate the level of consistency it requires for a given read (Get or Scan)
   operation. The default consistency level is STRONG, meaning that the read
   request is only sent to the RegionServer servicing the region. This is the same behavior as when
   read replicas are not used. The other possibility, TIMELINE, sends the request
   to all RegionServers with replicas, including the primary. The client accepts the first response,
   which includes whether it came from the primary or a secondary RegionServer. If it came from a
   secondary, the client can choose to verify the read later or not to treat it as definitive.
