Apache HBase overview
Apache HBase database provides random, persistent access to data. Apache HBase is
        ideal for scenarios that require real-time analysis and tabular data for end-user
        applications.As a natively nonrelational database, Apache HBase can combine data sources that use a wide
                        variety of structures and schemas. HBase is designed for resilient data
                        storage and is intended for hosting very large tables with sparse data.
                        Apache HBase can host big data tables because it scales linearly to handle
                        very large (petabyte scale), column-oriented data sets. The data store is
                        predicated on a key-value model that supports low latency reads, writes, and
                        updates in a distributed environment.
