HBase authentication
You must establish a mechanism for HBase servers and clients to securely identify
    themselves with HDFS, ZooKeeper, and each other. This ensures that hosts are who they claim to
    be.
To enable HBase to work with Kerberos security, you must enable Kerberos Authentication for
      Cloudera Runtime and use Kerberos authentication for ZooKeeper. This means that HBase Master,
      RegionServer, and client hosts must each have a Kerberos principal for authenticating to the
      ZooKeeper ensemble.
Before you start configuring Kerberos authentication for HBase ensure that:
Kerberos is enabled for the cluster.
Kerberos principals for Cloudera Manager Server, HBase and ZooKeeper hosts exist and are
          available for use.


Cloudera Manager automatically configures authentication between HBase to ZooKeeper and sets up
      the HBase Thrift gateway to support impersonation (doAs). However, you must
      manually configure the HBase REST service for Kerberos, as it uses Simple authentication by
      default, instead of Kerberos. noteImpersonation (doAs) cannot be used with
        Thrift framed transport (TFramedTransport) because SASL does not work with Thrift framed
        transport.Although an HBase Thrift server can connect to a secured Hadoop cluster,
      access is not secured from clients to the HBase Thrift server. To encrypt communication
      between clients and the HBase Thrift Server you must configure TLS/SSL for HBase Thrift
      Server.

Configuring HBase servers to authenticate with a secure HDFS clusterYou can configure HBase servers to authenticate with a secure HDFS cluster using         Cloudera Manager.Configuring secure HBase replicationYou must configure cross realm support for Kerberos, ZooKeeper, and Hadoop to         configure secure HBase replication.Configure the HBase client TGT renewal period You must configure the HBase Client TGT Renewal Period to a value that allows the user   enough time to finish HBase client processes.Disabling Kerberos authentication for HBase clientsClient applications that run on legacy products and do not have Kerberos enabled,         fail to connect to COD instances that have Kerberos enabled. You can disable Kerberos         authentication in your COD instances so that HBase or Phoenix clients can connect         seamlessly.
