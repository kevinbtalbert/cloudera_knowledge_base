Remove or add storage directories for NameNode data directories
This is a cluster administration task where existing Namenode DataDir must be changed. Perform the following steps to change the Namenode directories with downtime.

Take a backup of the existing DataDir paths on NNs. For instance, for each NN,
                    if there are two DataDir paths, taking backup of one DataDir is
                    sufficient.

Create new mounts where the Namenode data will reside and ensure the
                    permissions and ownerships are all same as that of the old Namenode data
                    directories.

Shutdown the Standby Namenode.

Log in to the host and copy the NN DataDir content from old mount to new
                    mount.

Verify the permission and ownership of fsimage* edits*
                        VERSION files.

Navigate to Cloudera Manager >
                        HDFS > Instances > click on
                    the SBNN role (stopped one) >
                        Configuration > search for
                        dfs.namenode.name.dir > change the mount path to new
                    one > Save Changes

Start the SBNN NameNode.

Wait for the SBNN to start and is out of safe
                    mode.

Navigate to Cloudera Manager >
                        HDFS > Configuration >
                        Federation and High Availability >
                        Actions > Manual Failover >
                    select SBNN option > click Manual
                        Failover > wait until the failover is complete.

You must verify using the NN webUIs if the previous SBNN node is now the ANN
                    and ANN node is now the SBNN.

Repeat steps 2-7 on the new SBNN which was previous ANN.
