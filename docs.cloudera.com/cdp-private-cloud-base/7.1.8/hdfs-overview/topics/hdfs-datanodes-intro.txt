DataNodes
DataNodes store data in a Hadoop cluster and is the name of the daemon that manages the
    data. File data is replicated on multiple DataNodes for reliability and so that localized
    computation can be executed near the data.
Within a cluster, DataNodes should be uniform. If they are not uniform, issues can occur. For
      example, DataNodes with less memory fill up more quickly than DataNodes with more memory,
      which can result in job failures.
importantThe default replication factor for HDFS is three.
      That is, three copies of data are maintained at all times. Cloudera
      recommends that you do not configure a lower replication factor when you
      have at least three DataNodes. A lower replication factor may lead to data
      loss. 

How NameNode manages blocks on a failed DataNodeA DataNode is considered dead after a set period without any heartbeats (10.5 minutes     by default). Replace a disk on a DataNode hostIn your CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, you can replace faulty disks on the DataNode host. You     must stop all the managed services and decommission the DataNode role instance before replacing     the faulty disk.Remove a DataNodeBefore removing a DataNode, ensure that all the prerequisites for removal are     satisfied. Fixing block inconsistenciesYou can use the output of hdfs fsck or hdfs dfsadmin       -report commands for information about inconsistencies with the HDFS data blocks     such as missing, misreplicated, or underreplicated blocks. You can adopt different methods to     address these inconsistencies.Add storage directories using Cloudera ManagerYou can add a new storage directory and specify the storage type using Cloudera     Manager.Remove storage directories using Cloudera ManagerYou can use Cloudera Manager to remove existing storage directories and specify new     directories.Configuring storage balancing for DataNodesYou can configure HDFS to distribute writes on each DataNode in a manner that balances     out available storage among that DataNode's disk volumes.Perform a disk hot swap for DataNodes using Cloudera ManagerYou can replace disks on your CDP Private Cloud Base cluster without shutting down a DataNode.     This is referred to as hot swap.
