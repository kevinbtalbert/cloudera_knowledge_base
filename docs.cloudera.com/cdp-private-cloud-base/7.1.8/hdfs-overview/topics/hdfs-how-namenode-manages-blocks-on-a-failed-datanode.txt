How NameNode manages blocks on a failed DataNode
A DataNode is considered dead after a set period without any heartbeats (10.5 minutes
    by default). 
When this happens, the NameNode performs the following actions to maintain the configured
      replication factor (3x replication by default):
The NameNode determines which blocks were on the failed DataNode.
The NameNode locates other DataNodes with copies of these blocks.
The DataNodes with block copies are instructed to copy those blocks to other DataNodes
          to maintain the configured replication factor.

Keep the following in mind when working with dead DataNodes:
If the DataNode failed due to a disk failure, follow the procedure
          in Replace a disk on a DataNode host or Perform a disk hot swap for DataNodes using Cloudera Manager to bring
          a repaired DataNode back online. If a DataNode failed to heartbeat for other reasons, they
          need to be recommissioned to be added back to the cluster.
If a DataNode fails to heartbeat for reasons other than disk failure, it needs to be
          recommissioned to be added back to the cluster.
If a DataNode rejoins the cluster, there is a possibility for
            surplus replicas of blocks that were on that DataNode. The NameNode
            will randomly remove excess replicas adhering to Rack-Awareness
            policies.
