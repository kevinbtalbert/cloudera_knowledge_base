JournalNodes
High-availability clusters use JournalNodes to synchronize active and standby
    NameNodes. The active NameNode writes to each JournalNode with changes, or "edits," to HDFS
    namespace metadata. During failover, the standby NameNode applies all edits from the
    JournalNodes before promoting itself to the active state.
Moving the JournalNode edits directory for a role group using Cloudera ManagerDepending on your requirements, you can change the location of the edits directory for     each JournalNode in the JournalNode Default Group.Moving the JournalNode edits directory for a role instance using Cloudera ManagerDepending on your requirements, you can change the location of the edits directory for     one JournalNode instance.Synchronizing the contents of JournalNodesYou can synchronize the contents of the JournalNodes in your CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.         Enabling this capability helps in maintaining consistency in the contents of all the         JournalNodes across the cluster. For example, a JournalNode whose contents go out of         synchronization can automatically copy the contents of the other JournalNodes in the cluster         to ensure consistency.
