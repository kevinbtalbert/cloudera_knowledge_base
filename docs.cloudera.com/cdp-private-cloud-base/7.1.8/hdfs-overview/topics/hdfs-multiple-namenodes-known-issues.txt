Known issue and its workaround
Before you proceed further configuring additional namenodes, you must be aware of the
    following known issue.
Known Issue Description
In case the JournalNodes were restarted on a cluster recently, the Add new
          NameNode wizard for HDFS service might fail to bootstrap the new NameNode, if
        there was not a new fsImage created since the restart of the
        JournalNodes. However, while restarting the JournalNodes the edit logs were rolled in the
        system.

Known Issue Workaround
If the bootstrap fails during the Add new NameNode wizard, you must
        perform the following steps:

Delete the newly added NameNode and FailoverController
Move the active HDFS NameNode to safe mode
Perform the Save Namespace operation on the active HDFS NameNode
Leave safe mode on the active HDFS NameNode
Try to add the new NameNode again

noteEntering safe mode disables write operation to HDFS and causes a service disruption. If
        you can not afford to enter safe mode, just delete the newly added NameNode and
        FailoverController in the HDFS service. You must wait until HDFS automatically creates a new
        fsImage and try adding the new NameNode again with the wizard.
