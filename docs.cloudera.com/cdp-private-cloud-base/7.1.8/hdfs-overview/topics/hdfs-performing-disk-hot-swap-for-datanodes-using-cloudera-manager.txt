Perform a disk hot swap for DataNodes using Cloudera Manager
You can replace disks on your CDP Private Cloud Base cluster without shutting down a DataNode.
    This is referred to as hot swap.

caution

Hot swap can only add disks with empty data directories.
Removing a disk does not move the data off the disk, which could potentially result in
            data loss.
Do not perform hot swap on multiple hosts at the same time.



Configure data directories to remove the disk you are swapping
          out.


Go to the HDFS service.


Click the Instances tab.


In the Role Type column, click on the affected
              DataNode.


Click the Configuration tab.


Select Scope > DataNode.


Select Category > Main.


Change the value of the DataNode Data Directory property to
              remove the directories that are mount points for the disk you are removing. 

warningChange the value of this property only for the specific DataNode
                instance where you are planning to hot swap the disk. Do not edit the role
                group value for this property. Doing so will cause data loss.
