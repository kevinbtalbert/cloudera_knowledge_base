Synchronizing the contents of JournalNodes
You can synchronize the contents of the JournalNodes in your CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.
        Enabling this capability helps in maintaining consistency in the contents of all the
        JournalNodes across the cluster. For example, a JournalNode whose contents go out of
        synchronization can automatically copy the contents of the other JournalNodes in the cluster
        to ensure consistency.
The cluster on which you want to enable JournalNode
            synchronization must have High Availability enabled.

                        dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir parameters.
