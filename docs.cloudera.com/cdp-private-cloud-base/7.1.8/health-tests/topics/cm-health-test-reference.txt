Cloudera Manager Health Tests

This section provides information on health tests supported by Cloudera Manager.

noteCloudera Manager provides monitoring of network port information
        at the Operating System level. The underlying network issues from the upper level of Big
        Data software cannot be resolved from the Cloudera Manager point of view. The frame error,
        if seen, requires you to contact the relevant network team for inspection and further
        action. Note that this kind of frame errors are typically related to hardware, such as
        server network port, network cable of related lines, switch ports, and pertinent
          items.For more information, refer to these KB articles - Cloudera Manager Monitoring Frame Error Bonded Network
           and CDH and Network Frame Errors.

There are two types of health tests:
Pass-fail tests - there are two types:
Compare a property to a yes-no value. For example, whether a
              service or role started as expected, a DataNode is connected to
              its NameNode, or a TaskTracker is (or is not) blocked.
Exercise a service lightly to confirm it is working and
              responsive. HDFS (NameNode role), HBase, and ZooKeeper services
              perform these tests, which are referred to as "canary" tests.
Both types of pass-fail tests result in the health reported as
          being either Good or Bad.
Metric tests - compare a property to a numeric value. For
          example, the number of file descriptors in use, the amount of disk
          space used or free, how much time spent in garbage collection, or how
          many pages were swapped to disk in the previous 15 minutes. In these
          tests the property is compared to a threshold that determine whether
          everything is Good, (for example, plenty of disk space
          available), whether it is Concerning (disk space getting low),
          or is Bad (a critically low amount of disk space).

By default most health tests are enabled and (if appropriate) configured
      with reasonable thresholds. You can modify threshold values by editing the
      monitoring properties under the entity's Configuration tab. You can
      also enable or disable individual or summary health tests, and in some
      cases specify what should be included in the calculation of overall health
      for the service, role instance, or host. 
importantActivity Monitor feature is not supported with
      Cloudera Manager. Note that when you load a backup of Cloudera Manager, you could come across
      the configuration settings of Activity Monitor.
