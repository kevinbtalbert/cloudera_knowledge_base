Active Database Audit Pipeline Test

 This Active Database health test checks that the Auditing for the Active Database role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of Active Database process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Active Database host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check Active Database monitoring setting. 

Short Name: Audit Pipeline Test
      
Monitoring Period For Audit Failures

Description
The period to review when checking if audits are blocked and not getting processed.
Template Name

mgmt_navigator_failure_window

Default Value
20
Unit(s)
MINUTES


Navigator Audit Failure Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds for failures encountered when monitoring audits within a recent period specified by the mgmt_navigator_failure_window configuration for the role. The value that can be specified for this threshold is the number of bytes of audits data that is left to be sent to audit server.
Template Name

mgmt_navigator_failure_thresholds

Default Value
critical:any, warning:never
Unit(s)
BYTES


Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check

Description
Enable test of audit events processing pipeline. This will test if audit events are not getting processed by Audit Server for a role that generates audit.
Template Name

mgmt_navigator_status_check_enabled

Default Value
true
Unit(s)
no unit





Active Database File Descriptors

 This Active Database health test checks that the number of file descriptors used does not rise above some percentage of the Active Database file descriptor limit. A failure of this health test may indicate a bug in either Hadoop or Cloudera Manager. Contact Cloudera support. This test can be configured using the File Descriptor Monitoring Thresholds Active Database monitoring setting. 

Short Name: File Descriptors
      
File Descriptor Monitoring Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds of the number of file descriptors used. Specified as a percentage of file descriptor limit.
Template Name

db_active_fd_thresholds

Default Value
critical:70.0, warning:50.0
Unit(s)
PERCENT





Active Database Host Health

 This Active Database health test factors in the health of the host upon which the Active Database is running. A failure of this test means that the host running the Active Database is experiencing some problem. See that host's status page for more details.This test can be enabled or disabled using the Active Database Host Health Test Active Database monitoring setting. 

Short Name: Host Health
      
Active Database Host Health Test

Description
When computing the overall Active Database health, consider the host's health.
Template Name

db_active_host_health_enabled

Default Value
true
Unit(s)
no unit





Active Database Process Status

 This Active Database health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Active Database host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the Active Database role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the Active Database process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Active Database host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the Active Database has crashed or because the Active Database will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the Active Database logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Active Database host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the Active Database host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the Active Database host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Active Database Process Health Test Active Database monitoring setting. 

Short Name: Process Status
      
Active Database Process Health Test

Description
Enables the health test that the Active Database's process state is consistent with the role configuration
Template Name

db_active_scm_health_enabled

Default Value
true
Unit(s)
no unit





Active Database Swap Memory Usage

 This Active Database health test checks the amount of swap memory in use by the role. A failure of this health test may indicate that your machine is overloaded. This test can be configured using the Process Swap Memory Thresholds monitoring settings.

Short Name: Swap Memory Usage
      
Process Swap Memory Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds on the swap memory usage of the process. This takes precedence over the host level threshold.
Template Name

process_swap_memory_thresholds

Default Value
critical:never, warning:200.0
Unit(s)
BYTES





Active Database Swap Memory Usage Rate Beta

 This Active Database health test checks the change of the amount of swap memory usage by the role during a predefined period. A failure of this health test may indicate that your machine is overloaded. This test can be configured using the Swap Memory Usage Rate Thresholds and Swap Memory Usage Rate Window monitoring settings. 

Short Name: Swap Memory Usage Rate Beta
      
Swap Memory Usage Rate Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds on the swap memory usage rate of the process. Specified as the change of the used swap memory during the predefined period.
Template Name

process_swap_memory_rate_thresholds

Default Value
critical:never, warning:never
Unit(s)
BYTES


Swap Memory Usage Rate Window

Description
The period to review when computing unexpected swap memory usage change of the process.
Template Name

process_swap_memory_rate_window

Default Value
5
Unit(s)
MINUTES





Active Database Unexpected Exits

 This Active Database health test checks that the Active Database has not recently exited unexpectedly. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of unexpected exits exceeds a critical threshold. For example, if this test is configured with a critical threshold of 1, this test returns "Good" health if there have been no unexpected exits recently. If 1 or more unexpected exits occured recently, this test returns "Bad" health. The test also indicates whether any of the exits were caused by an OutOfMemory error if the Cloudera Manager Kill When Out of Memory monitoring setting is enabled. This test can be configured using the Unexpected Exits Thresholds and Unexpected Exits Monitoring Period Active Database monitoring settings. 

Short Name: Unexpected Exits
      
Unexpected Exits Monitoring Period

Description
The period to review when computing unexpected exits.
Template Name

unexpected_exits_window

Default Value
5
Unit(s)
MINUTES


Unexpected Exits Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds for unexpected exits encountered within a recent period specified by the unexpected_exits_window configuration for the role.
Template Name

unexpected_exits_thresholds

Default Value
critical:any, warning:never
Unit(s)
no unit
