Authentication Service Authentication Server Health

 This is a Authentication Service service-level health test that checks that enough of the Authentication Servers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Authentication Servers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Authentication Servers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Authentication Servers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Authentication Servers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Authentication Servers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Authentication Servers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Authentication Servers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Authentication Servers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Authentication Servers. Check the status of the individual Authentication Servers for more information. This test can be configured using the Authentication Service Authentication Service service-wide monitoring setting.

Healthy Authentication Server Monitoring Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds of the overall Authentication Server health. The check returns "Concerning" health if the percentage of "Healthy" Authentication Servers falls below the warning threshold. The check is unhealthy if the total percentage of "Healthy" and "Concerning" Authentication Servers falls below the critical threshold.

Authentication Service Authentication Server Load Balancer Health

 This is a Authentication Service service-level health test that checks that enough of the Authentication Server Load Balancers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Authentication Server Load Balancers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Authentication Server Load Balancers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Authentication Server Load Balancers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Authentication Server Load Balancers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Authentication Server Load Balancers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Authentication Server Load Balancers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Authentication Server Load Balancers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Authentication Server Load Balancers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Authentication Server Load Balancers. Check the status of the individual Authentication Server Load Balancers for more information. This test can be configured using the Authentication Service Authentication Service service-wide monitoring setting.

Authentication Service Canary

 This canary checks whether it is possible to log in to the Authentication Service. A failure of this check indicates that it will not be possible to log in to anything that uses the Authentication Service for single-sign-on. Look in the Authentication Service logs for more information.
