Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor Audit Pipeline Test

 This Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor health test checks that the Auditing for the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor monitoring setting.

Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor File Descriptors

 This Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor health test checks that the number of file descriptors used does not rise above some percentage of the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor file descriptor limit. A failure of this health test may indicate a bug in either Hadoop or Cloudera Manager. Contact Cloudera support. This test can be configured using the File Descriptor Monitoring Thresholds Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor monitoring setting.

Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor Host Health

 This Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor health test factors in the health of the host upon which the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor is running. A failure of this test means that the host running the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor is experiencing some problem. See that host's status page for more details.This test can be enabled or disabled using the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor Host Health Test Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor monitoring setting. 

Short Name: Host Health
      
Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor Host Health Test

no unit





Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor Log Directory Free Space

 This Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor health test checks that the filesystem containing the log directory of this Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor has sufficient free space. This test can be configured using the Log Directory Free Space Monitoring Absolute Thresholds and Log Directory Free Space Monitoring Percentage Thresholds Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor monitoring settings. 

Short Name: Log Directory Free Space
      
Log Directory Free Space Monitoring Absolute Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds for monitoring of free space on the filesystem that contains this role's log directory.
Template Name

Default Value
critical:5.36870912E9, warning:1.073741824E10
Unit(s)
BYTES


Log Directory Free Space Monitoring Percentage Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds for monitoring of free space on the filesystem that contains this role's log directory. Specified as a percentage of the capacity on that filesystem. This setting is not used if a Log Directory Free Space Monitoring Absolute Thresholds setting is configured.
Template Name

Default Value
critical:never, warning:never
Unit(s)
PERCENT





Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor Process Status

 This Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor has crashed or because the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor Process Health Test Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor monitoring setting. 

Short Name: Process Status
      
Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor Process Health Test

Description

Default Value
true
Unit(s)
no unit





Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor Swap Memory Usage

 This Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor health test checks the amount of swap memory in use by the role. A failure of this health test may indicate that your machine is overloaded. This test can be configured using the Process Swap Memory Thresholds monitoring settings.

Short Name: Swap Memory Usage

Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor Unexpected Exits

 This Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor health test checks that the Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor has not recently exited unexpectedly. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of unexpected exits exceeds a critical threshold. For example, if this test is configured with a critical threshold of 1, this test returns "Good" health if there have been no unexpected exits recently. If 1 or more unexpected exits occured recently, this test returns "Bad" health. The test also indicates whether any of the exits were caused by an OutOfMemory error if the Cloudera Manager Kill When Out of Memory monitoring setting is enabled. This test can be configured using the Unexpected Exits Thresholds and Unexpected Exits Monitoring Period Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor monitoring settings.
