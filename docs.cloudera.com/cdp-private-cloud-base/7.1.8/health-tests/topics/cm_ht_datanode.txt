DataNode Audit Pipeline Test

 This DataNode health test checks that the Auditing for the DataNode role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of DataNode process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the DataNode host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check DataNode monitoring setting.

DataNode Block Count

 This is a DataNode health test that checks for whether the DataNode has too many blocks. Having too many blocks on a DataNode may affect the DataNode's performance. A DataNode with a large number of blocks will require a larger java heap and may experience longer garbage collection pauses. Additionally, a large number of blocks may be an indicator of the presence of many small files. HDFS is not optimized for dealing with many small files, and processing times may suffer when operating across many small files. If only some DataNodes have a high number of blocks, running the HDFS Rebalance command may address this issue by moving data between DataNodes. If the HDFS Rebalance command reports the cluster as balanced without fixing the block imbalance then the problem is related to the presence of many small files. Consult the HDFS documentation for best-practices on addressing this issue. If many small files is not a concern for your use case, consider disabling this health test. If all DataNodes have a high number of blocks and the issue is not related to small files, additional DataNodes should be added. This test can be configured using the DataNode Block Count Thresholds DataNode monitoring setting.

A failure of this health test may indicate that the DataNode is not getting enough CPU resources, or that it is spending too much time doing garbage collection. Inspect the DataNode logs for any pause monitor output and check garbage collection metrics exposed by the DataNode. This test can be configured using the Pause Duration Thresholds and Pause Duration Monitoring Period DataNode monitoring settings.

DataNode Unexpected Exits

 This DataNode health test checks that the DataNode has not recently exited unexpectedly. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of unexpected exits exceeds a critical threshold. For example, if this test is configured with a critical threshold of 1, this test returns "Good" health if there have been no unexpected exits recently. If 1 or more unexpected exits occured recently, this test returns "Bad" health. The test also indicates whether any of the exits were caused by an OutOfMemory error if the Cloudera Manager Kill When Out of Memory monitoring setting is enabled. This test can be configured using the Unexpected Exits Thresholds and Unexpected Exits Monitoring Period DataNode monitoring settings.

DataNode Web Server Status

 This health test checks that the role's web server is responding quickly to requests by the Cloudera Manager Agent, and that the Cloudera Manager Agent can collect metrics from the web server. Failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the web server of the DataNode, a misconfiguration of the DataNode, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. Consult the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and the logs of the DataNode for more detail. If the test failure message indicates a communication problem, the Cloudera Manager Agent's HTTP requests to the DataNode's web server are failing or timing out. If the test's failure message indicates an unexpected response, the DataNode's web server responded to the Cloudera Manager Agent's request, but the response could not be interpreted for some reason. This test can be configured using the Web Metric Collection DataNode monitoring setting.
