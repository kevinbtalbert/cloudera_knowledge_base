DOCKER Docker Server Health

 This is a DOCKER service-level health test that checks that enough of the Docker Servers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Docker Servers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Docker Servers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Docker Servers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Docker Servers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Docker Servers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Docker Servers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Docker Servers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Docker Servers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Docker Servers. Check the status of the individual Docker Servers for more information. This test can be configured using the DOCKER DOCKER service-wide monitoring setting.
