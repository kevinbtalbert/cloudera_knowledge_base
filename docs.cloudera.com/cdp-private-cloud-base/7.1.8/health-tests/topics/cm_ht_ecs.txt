ECS Ecs Agent Health

 This is a ECS service-level health test that checks that enough of the Ecs Agents in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Ecs Agents falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Ecs Agents. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Ecs Agents falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Ecs Agents. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Ecs Agents, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Ecs Agents have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Ecs Agents have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Ecs Agents have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Ecs Agents. Check the status of the individual Ecs Agents for more information. This test can be configured using the ECS ECS service-wide monitoring setting.

Healthy Ecs Agent Monitoring Thresholds

ECS Ecs Server Health

 This is a ECS service-level health test that checks that enough of the Ecs Servers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Ecs Servers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Ecs Servers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Ecs Servers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Ecs Servers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Ecs Servers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Ecs Servers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Ecs Servers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Ecs Servers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Ecs Servers. Check the status of the individual Ecs Servers for more information. This test can be configured using the ECS ECS service-wide monitoring setting.
