Event Server Audit Pipeline Test

 This Event Server health test checks that the Auditing for the Event Server role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of Event Server process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Event Server host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check Event Server monitoring setting.

Event Server Cloudera Manager Descriptor Age

 This is a Event Server health test that checks if the Cloudera Manager descriptor has been refreshed recently. The Cloudera Manager descriptor is used to pass configuration information from the Cloudera Manager Server to the Event Server. If the descriptor becomes stale, Event Server operation may be impacted because the Event Server will receive information about new hosts, roles, and services, or changes to existing hosts, roles, and services. A stale descriptor usually indicates problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Server but can also indicate performance problems or a bug. Consult the Event Server log and the Cloudera Manager Server log for more information. This test can be configured using the Cloudera Manager Descriptor Age Thresholds Cloudera Manager Event Server setting.
