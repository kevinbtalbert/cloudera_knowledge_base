Flume Agent Health

 This is a Flume service-level health test that checks that enough of the Agents in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Agents falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Agents. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Agents falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Agents. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Agents, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Agents have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Agents have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Agents have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Agents. Check the status of the individual Agents for more information. This test can be configured using the Flume Flume service-wide monitoring setting.
