Hive Execution HiveServer2 Health

 This is a Hive Execution service-level health test that checks that enough of the HiveServer2s in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy HiveServer2s falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of HiveServer2s. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" HiveServer2s falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of HiveServer2s. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 HiveServer2s, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more HiveServer2s have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 HiveServer2s have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 HiveServer2s have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy HiveServer2s. Check the status of the individual HiveServer2s for more information. This test can be configured using the Hive Execution Hive Execution service-wide monitoring setting.
