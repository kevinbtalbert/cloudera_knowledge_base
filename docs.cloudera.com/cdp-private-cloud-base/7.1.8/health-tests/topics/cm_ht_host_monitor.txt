Host Monitor Audit Pipeline Test

 This Host Monitor health test checks that the Auditing for the Host Monitor role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of Host Monitor process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Host Monitor host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check Host Monitor monitoring setting.

Host Monitor Cloudera Manager Descriptor Age

 This is a Host Monitor health test that checks if the Cloudera Manager descriptor has been refreshed recently. The Cloudera Manager descriptor is used to pass configuration information from the Cloudera Manager Server to the Host Monitor. If the descriptor becomes stale, Host Monitor operation may be impacted because the Host Monitor will receive information about new hosts, roles, and services, or changes to existing hosts, roles, and services. A stale descriptor usually indicates problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Server but can also indicate performance problems or a bug. Consult the Host Monitor log and the Cloudera Manager Server log for more information. This test can be configured using the Cloudera Manager Descriptor Age Thresholds Cloudera Manager Host Monitor setting.

Host Monitor Pause Duration

 This Host Monitor health test checks that the Host Monitor threads are not experiencing long scheduling pauses. The test uses a pause monitoring thread in the Host Monitor that tracks scheduling delay by noting if it is run on its requested schedule. If the thread is not run on its requested schedule, the delay is noted and considered pause time. The health test checks that no more than some percentage of recent time is spent paused. A failure of this health test may indicate that the Host Monitor is not getting enough CPU resources, or that it is spending too much time doing garbage collection. Inspect the Host Monitor logs for any pause monitor output and check garbage collection metrics exposed by the Host Monitor. This test can be configured using the Pause Duration Thresholds and Pause Duration Monitoring Period Host Monitor monitoring settings.

 This Host Monitor health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Host Monitor host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the Host Monitor role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the Host Monitor process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Host Monitor host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the Host Monitor has crashed or because the Host Monitor will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the Host Monitor logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Host Monitor host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the Host Monitor host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the Host Monitor host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Host Monitor Process Health Test Host Monitor monitoring setting.

Host Monitor Unexpected Exits

 This Host Monitor health test checks that the Host Monitor has not recently exited unexpectedly. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of unexpected exits exceeds a critical threshold. For example, if this test is configured with a critical threshold of 1, this test returns "Good" health if there have been no unexpected exits recently. If 1 or more unexpected exits occured recently, this test returns "Bad" health.

Host Monitor Web Server Status

 This health test checks that the role's web server is responding quickly to requests by the Cloudera Manager Agent, and that the Cloudera Manager Agent can collect metrics from the web server. Failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the web server of the Host Monitor, a misconfiguration of the Host Monitor, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. Consult the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and the logs of the Host Monitor for more detail. If the test failure message indicates a communication problem, the Cloudera Manager Agent's HTTP requests to the Host Monitor's web server are failing or timing out. If the test's failure message indicates an unexpected response, the Host Monitor's web server responded to the Cloudera Manager Agent's request, but the response could not be interpreted for some reason. This test can be configured using the Web Metric Collection Host Monitor monitoring setting.
