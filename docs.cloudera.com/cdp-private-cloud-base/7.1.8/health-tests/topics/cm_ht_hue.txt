Hue Kerberos Ticket Renewer Health

 This is a Hue service-level health test that checks that enough of the Kerberos Ticket Renewers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Kerberos Ticket Renewers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Kerberos Ticket Renewers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Kerberos Ticket Renewers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Kerberos Ticket Renewers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Kerberos Ticket Renewers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Kerberos Ticket Renewers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Kerberos Ticket Renewers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Kerberos Ticket Renewers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Kerberos Ticket Renewers. Check the status of the individual Kerberos Ticket Renewers for more information. This test can be configured using the Hue Hue service-wide monitoring setting.

Hue Load Balancer Health

 This is a Hue service-level health test that checks that enough of the Load Balancers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Load Balancers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Load Balancers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Load Balancers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Load Balancers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Load Balancers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Load Balancers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Load Balancers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Load Balancers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Load Balancers. Check the status of the individual Load Balancers for more information. This test can be configured using the Hue Hue service-wide monitoring setting.

Hue Server Health

 This is a Hue service-level health test that checks that enough of the Hue Servers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Hue Servers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Hue Servers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Hue Servers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Hue Servers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Hue Servers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Hue Servers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Hue Servers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Hue Servers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Hue Servers. Check the status of the individual Hue Servers for more information. This test can be configured using the Hue Hue service-wide monitoring setting.
