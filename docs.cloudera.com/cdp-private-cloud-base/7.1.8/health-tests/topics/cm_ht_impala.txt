Impala Catalog Server Health

 This Impala service-level health test checks for the presence of a running, healthy Impala Catalog Server. The test returns "Bad" health if the service is running and the Impala Catalog Server is not running. In all other cases it returns the health of the Impala Catalog Server. A failure of this health test indicates a stopped or unhealthy Impala Catalog Server. Check the status of the Impala Catalog Server for more information. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Impala Catalog Server Role Health Test Impala Catalog Server service-wide monitoring setting.

Impala Daemon Health

 This is a Impala service-level health test that checks that enough of the Impala Daemons in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Impala Daemons falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Impala Daemons. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Impala Daemons falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Impala Daemons. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Impala Daemons, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Impala Daemons have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Impala Daemons have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Impala Daemons have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Impala Daemons. Check the status of the individual Impala Daemons for more information. This test can be configured using the Impala Impala service-wide monitoring setting.
