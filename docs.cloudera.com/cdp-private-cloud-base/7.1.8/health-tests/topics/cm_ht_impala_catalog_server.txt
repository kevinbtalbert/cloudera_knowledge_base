Impala Catalog Server Audit Pipeline Test

 This Impala Catalog Server health test checks that the Auditing for the Impala Catalog Server role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of Impala Catalog Server process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Impala Catalog Server host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check Impala Catalog Server monitoring setting.

Impala Catalog Server Process Status

 This Impala Catalog Server health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Impala Catalog Server host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the Impala Catalog Server role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the Impala Catalog Server process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Impala Catalog Server host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the Impala Catalog Server has crashed or because the Impala Catalog Server will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the Impala Catalog Server logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Impala Catalog Server host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the Impala Catalog Server host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the Impala Catalog Server host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Impala Catalog Server Process Health Test Impala Catalog Server monitoring setting.

Impala Catalog Server Resident Set Size

 This Impala Catalog Server health test checks that the size of the resident set does not rise above a configured threshold value. A failure of this health test may indicates that the Impala Catalog Server process is consuming more memory than expected. It is possible that that unexpected memory consumption may lead to swapping and decreased performance for processes running on the same host as this Impala Catalog Server. Increased Impala Catalog Server memory consumption may be caused by an increased workload on the Impala service, or by a bug in the Impala Catalog Server software. To avoid failures of this health test, free up additional memory for this Impala Catalog Server process and increase the Resident Set Size Thresholds monitoring setting. This test can be configured using the Resident Set Size Thresholds Impala Catalog Server monitoring setting. 

Short Name: Resident Set Size

A failure of this health test may indicate that the Catalog Server is having trouble communicating with the StateStore. Look in the Catalog Server logs for more details. This test may return an unknown result if the Service Monitor is not able to communicate with the StateStore web server. Check the status of the StateStore web server and the Service Monitor logs if this test is returning an unknown result. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Catalog Server Connectivity Health Test Catalog Server monitoring setting. The Catalog Server Connectivity Tolerance at Startup Catalog Server monitoring setting and the Health Test Startup Tolerance StateStore monitoring setting can be used to control the test's tolerance windows around Catalog Server and StateStore restarts respectively.

Impala Catalog Server Web Server Status

 This health test checks that the role's web server is responding quickly to requests by the Cloudera Manager Agent, and that the Cloudera Manager Agent can collect metrics from the web server. Failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the web server of the Impala Catalog Server, a misconfiguration of the Impala Catalog Server, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. Consult the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and the logs of the Impala Catalog Server for more detail. If the test failure message indicates a communication problem, the Cloudera Manager Agent's HTTP requests to the Impala Catalog Server's web server are failing or timing out. If the test's failure message indicates an unexpected response, the Impala Catalog Server's web server responded to the Cloudera Manager Agent's request, but the response could not be interpreted for some reason. This test can be configured using the Web Metric Collection Impala Catalog Server monitoring setting.
