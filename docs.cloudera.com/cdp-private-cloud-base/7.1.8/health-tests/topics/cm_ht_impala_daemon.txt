Impala Daemon Audit Pipeline Test

 This Impala Daemon health test checks that the Auditing for the Impala Daemon role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of Impala Daemon process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Impala Daemon host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check Impala Daemon monitoring setting.

 This Impala Daemon health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Impala Daemon host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the Impala Daemon role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the Impala Daemon process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Impala Daemon host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the Impala Daemon has crashed or because the Impala Daemon will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the Impala Daemon logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Impala Daemon host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the Impala Daemon host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the Impala Daemon host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Impala Daemon Process Health Test Impala Daemon monitoring setting.

Impala Daemon Resident Set Size

 This Impala Daemon health test checks that the size of the resident set does not rise above a configured threshold value. A failure of this health test may indicates that the Impala Daemon process is consuming more memory than expected. It is possible that that unexpected memory consumption may lead to swapping and decreased performance for processes running on the same host as this Impala Daemon. Increased Impala Daemon memory consumption may be caused by an increased workload on the Impala service, or by a bug in the Impala Daemon software. To avoid failures of this health test, free up additional memory for this Impala Daemon process and increase the Resident Set Size Thresholds monitoring setting. This test can be configured using the Resident Set Size Thresholds Impala Daemon monitoring setting.

Impala Daemon Web Server Status

 This health test checks that the role's web server is responding quickly to requests by the Cloudera Manager Agent, and that the Cloudera Manager Agent can collect metrics from the web server. Failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the web server of the Impala Daemon, a misconfiguration of the Impala Daemon, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. Consult the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and the logs of the Impala Daemon for more detail. If the test failure message indicates a communication problem, the Cloudera Manager Agent's HTTP requests to the Impala Daemon's web server are failing or timing out.
