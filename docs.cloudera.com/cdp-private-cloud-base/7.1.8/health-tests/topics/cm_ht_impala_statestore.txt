Impala StateStore Audit Pipeline Test

 This Impala StateStore health test checks that the Auditing for the Impala StateStore role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of Impala StateStore process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Impala StateStore host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check Impala StateStore monitoring setting.

Impala StateStore Process Status

 This Impala StateStore health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Impala StateStore host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the Impala StateStore role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the Impala StateStore process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Impala StateStore host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the Impala StateStore has crashed or because the Impala StateStore will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the Impala StateStore logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Impala StateStore host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the Impala StateStore host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the Impala StateStore host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Impala StateStore Process Health Test Impala StateStore monitoring setting.

Impala StateStore Resident Set Size

 This Impala StateStore health test checks that the size of the resident set does not rise above a configured threshold value. A failure of this health test may indicates that the Impala StateStore process is consuming more memory than expected. It is possible that that unexpected memory consumption may lead to swapping and decreased performance for processes running on the same host as this Impala StateStore. Increased Impala StateStore memory consumption may be caused by an increased workload on the Impala service, or by a bug in the Impala StateStore software. To avoid failures of this health test, free up additional memory for this Impala StateStore process and increase the Resident Set Size Thresholds monitoring setting. This test can be configured using the Resident Set Size Thresholds Impala StateStore monitoring setting. 

Short Name: Resident Set Size

Impala StateStore Unexpected Exits

 This Impala StateStore health test checks that the Impala StateStore has not recently exited unexpectedly. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of unexpected exits exceeds a critical threshold. For example, if this test is configured with a critical threshold of 1, this test returns "Good" health if there have been no unexpected exits recently. If 1 or more unexpected exits occured recently, this test returns "Bad" health. The test also indicates whether any of the exits were caused by an OutOfMemory error if the Cloudera Manager Kill When Out of Memory monitoring setting is enabled.

Impala StateStore Web Server Status

 This health test checks that the role's web server is responding quickly to requests by the Cloudera Manager Agent, and that the Cloudera Manager Agent can collect metrics from the web server. Failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the web server of the Impala StateStore, a misconfiguration of the Impala StateStore, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. Consult the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and the logs of the Impala StateStore for more detail. If the test failure message indicates a communication problem, the Cloudera Manager Agent's HTTP requests to the Impala StateStore's web server are failing or timing out. If the test's failure message indicates an unexpected response, the Impala StateStore's web server responded to the Cloudera Manager Agent's request, but the response could not be interpreted for some reason. This test can be configured using the Web Metric Collection Impala StateStore monitoring setting.
