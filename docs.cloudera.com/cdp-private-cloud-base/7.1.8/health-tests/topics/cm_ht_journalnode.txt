JournalNode Audit Pipeline Test

 This JournalNode health test checks that the Auditing for the JournalNode role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of JournalNode process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the JournalNode host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check JournalNode monitoring setting.
