Kafka Broker Health

 This is a Kafka service-level health test that checks that enough of the Kafka Brokers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Kafka Brokers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Kafka Brokers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Kafka Brokers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Kafka Brokers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Kafka Brokers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Kafka Brokers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Kafka Brokers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Kafka Brokers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Kafka Brokers. Check the status of the individual Kafka Brokers for more information. This test can be configured using the Kafka Kafka service-wide monitoring setting.

Healthy Kafka Broker Monitoring Thresholds

The check is unhealthy if the total percentage of "Healthy" and "Concerning" Kafka Brokers falls below the critical threshold.

Kafka Connect Health

 This is a Kafka service-level health test that checks that enough of the Kafka Connects in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Kafka Connects falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Kafka Connects. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Kafka Connects falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Kafka Connects. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Kafka Connects, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Kafka Connects have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Kafka Connects have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Kafka Connects have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Kafka Connects. Check the status of the individual Kafka Connects for more information. This test can be configured using the Kafka Kafka service-wide monitoring setting.
