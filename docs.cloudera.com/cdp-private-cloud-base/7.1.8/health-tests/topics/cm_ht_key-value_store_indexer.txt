Key-Value Store Indexer Lily HBase Indexer Health

 This is a Key-Value Store Indexer service-level health test that checks that enough of the Lily HBase Indexers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Lily HBase Indexers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Lily HBase Indexers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Lily HBase Indexers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Lily HBase Indexers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Lily HBase Indexers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Lily HBase Indexers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Lily HBase Indexers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Lily HBase Indexers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Lily HBase Indexers. Check the status of the individual Lily HBase Indexers for more information. This test can be configured using the Key-Value Store Indexer Key-Value Store Indexer service-wide monitoring setting.
