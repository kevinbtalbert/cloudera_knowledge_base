Knox Gateway Health

 This is a Knox service-level health test that checks that enough of the Knox Gateways in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Knox Gateways falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Knox Gateways. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Knox Gateways falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Knox Gateways. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Knox Gateways, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Knox Gateways have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Knox Gateways have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Knox Gateways have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Knox Gateways. Check the status of the individual Knox Gateways for more information. This test can be configured using the Knox Knox service-wide monitoring setting.

Knox IDBroker Health

 This is a Knox service-level health test that checks that enough of the Knox IDBrokers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Knox IDBrokers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Knox IDBrokers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Knox IDBrokers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Knox IDBrokers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Knox IDBrokers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Knox IDBrokers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Knox IDBrokers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Knox IDBrokers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Knox IDBrokers.
