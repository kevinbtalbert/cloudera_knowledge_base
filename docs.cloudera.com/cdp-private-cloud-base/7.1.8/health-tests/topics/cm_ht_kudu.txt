Kudu Master Health

 This is a Kudu service-level health test that checks that enough of the Masters in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Masters falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Masters. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Masters falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Masters. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Masters, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Masters have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Masters have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Masters have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Masters. Check the status of the individual Masters for more information. This test can be configured using the Kudu Kudu service-wide monitoring setting.
