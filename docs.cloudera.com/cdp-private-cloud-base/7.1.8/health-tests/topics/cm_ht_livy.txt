In all other cases it returns the health of the Livy Server. A failure of this health test indicates a stopped or unhealthy Livy Server. Check the status of the Livy Server for more information. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Livy Server Role Health Test Livy Server service-wide monitoring setting.
