Livy Server for Spark 3 Audit Pipeline Test

 This Livy Server for Spark 3 health test checks that the Auditing for the Livy Server for Spark 3 role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of Livy Server for Spark 3 process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Livy Server for Spark 3 host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check Livy Server for Spark 3 monitoring setting.

Livy Server for Spark 3 Process Status

 This Livy Server for Spark 3 health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Livy Server for Spark 3 host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the Livy Server for Spark 3 role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the Livy Server for Spark 3 process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Livy Server for Spark 3 host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the Livy Server for Spark 3 has crashed or because the Livy Server for Spark 3 will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the Livy Server for Spark 3 logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Livy Server for Spark 3 host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the Livy Server for Spark 3 host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the Livy Server for Spark 3 host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Livy Server for Spark 3 Process Health Test Livy Server for Spark 3 monitoring setting.
