LLAP Proxy Audit Pipeline Test

 This LLAP Proxy health test checks that the Auditing for the LLAP Proxy role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of LLAP Proxy process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the LLAP Proxy host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check LLAP Proxy monitoring setting.

LLAP Proxy Pause Duration

 This LLAP Proxy health test checks that the LLAP Proxy threads are not experiencing long scheduling pauses. The test uses a pause monitoring thread in the LLAP Proxy that tracks scheduling delay by noting if it is run on its requested schedule. If the thread is not run on its requested schedule, the delay is noted and considered pause time. The health test checks that no more than some percentage of recent time is spent paused. A failure of this health test may indicate that the LLAP Proxy is not getting enough CPU resources, or that it is spending too much time doing garbage collection. Inspect the LLAP Proxy logs for any pause monitor output and check garbage collection metrics exposed by the LLAP Proxy. This test can be configured using the Pause Duration Thresholds and Pause Duration Monitoring Period LLAP Proxy monitoring settings.

This test can fail either because the LLAP Proxy has crashed or because the LLAP Proxy will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the LLAP Proxy logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the LLAP Proxy host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the LLAP Proxy host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the LLAP Proxy host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the LLAP Proxy Process Health Test LLAP Proxy monitoring setting.
