Master Audit Pipeline Test

 This Master health test checks that the Auditing for the Master role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of Master process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Master host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check Master monitoring setting.
