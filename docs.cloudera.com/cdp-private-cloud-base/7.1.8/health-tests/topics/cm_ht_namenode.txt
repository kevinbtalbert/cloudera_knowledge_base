NameNode Audit Pipeline Test

 This NameNode health test checks that the Auditing for the NameNode role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of NameNode process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the NameNode host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check NameNode monitoring setting.

NameNode Pause Duration

 This NameNode health test checks that the NameNode threads are not experiencing long scheduling pauses. The test uses a pause monitoring thread in the NameNode that tracks scheduling delay by noting if it is run on its requested schedule. If the thread is not run on its requested schedule, the delay is noted and considered pause time. The health test checks that no more than some percentage of recent time is spent paused. A failure of this health test may indicate that the NameNode is not getting enough CPU resources, or that it is spending too much time doing garbage collection. Inspect the NameNode logs for any pause monitor output and check garbage collection metrics exposed by the NameNode. This test can be configured using the Pause Duration Thresholds and Pause Duration Monitoring Period NameNode monitoring settings.

NameNode Process Status

 This NameNode health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the NameNode host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the NameNode role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the NameNode process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the NameNode host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the NameNode has crashed or because the NameNode will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the NameNode logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the NameNode host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the NameNode host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the NameNode host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the NameNode Process Health Test NameNode monitoring setting.

NameNode RPC Latency

 This is a NameNode health test that checks that a moving average of the average time it takes for the NameNode to respond to requests does not exceed some value. A failure of this health test could indicate misconfiguration of the NameNode, that the NameNode is having a problem writing to one of its data directories, or may indicate a capacity planning problem. Check the NameNode's RpcQueueTime_avg_time and if this indicates that the bulk of the RPC latency is spent with requests queued, try increasing the NameNode Handler Count. If the NameNode's RpcProcessingTime_avg_time indicates the bulk of the RPC latency is due to request processing, check to see that each of the directories in which the HDFS metadata is being stored is performing adequately. This test can be configured using the NameNode RPC Latency Thresholds and NameNode RPC Latency Monitoring Window NameNode monitoring settings.
