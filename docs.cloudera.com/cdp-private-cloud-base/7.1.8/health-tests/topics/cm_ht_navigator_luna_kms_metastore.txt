Navigator Luna KMS Metastore Audit Pipeline Test

 This Navigator Luna KMS Metastore health test checks that the Auditing for the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of Navigator Luna KMS Metastore process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check Navigator Luna KMS Metastore monitoring setting.

Navigator Luna KMS Metastore File Descriptors

 This Navigator Luna KMS Metastore health test checks that the number of file descriptors used does not rise above some percentage of the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore file descriptor limit. A failure of this health test may indicate a bug in either Hadoop or Cloudera Manager. Contact Cloudera support. This test can be configured using the File Descriptor Monitoring Thresholds Navigator Luna KMS Metastore monitoring setting.

Navigator Luna KMS Metastore Host Health

 This Navigator Luna KMS Metastore health test factors in the health of the host upon which the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore is running. A failure of this test means that the host running the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore is experiencing some problem. See that host's status page for more details.This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore Host Health Test Navigator Luna KMS Metastore monitoring setting. 

Short Name: Host Health
      
Navigator Luna KMS Metastore Host Health Test

Description
When computing the overall Navigator Luna KMS Metastore health, consider the host's health.

Navigator Luna KMS Metastore Process Status

 This Navigator Luna KMS Metastore health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore has crashed or because the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore Process Health Test Navigator Luna KMS Metastore monitoring setting. 

Short Name: Process Status

Unit(s)
BYTES





Navigator Luna KMS Metastore Swap Memory Usage Rate Beta

 This Navigator Luna KMS Metastore health test checks the change of the amount of swap memory usage by the role during a predefined period. A failure of this health test may indicate that your machine is overloaded. This test can be configured using the Swap Memory Usage Rate Thresholds and Swap Memory Usage Rate Window monitoring settings. 

Short Name: Swap Memory Usage Rate Beta
      
Swap Memory Usage Rate Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds on the swap memory usage rate of the process. Specified as the change of the used swap memory during the predefined period.

Navigator Luna KMS Metastore Unexpected Exits

 This Navigator Luna KMS Metastore health test checks that the Navigator Luna KMS Metastore has not recently exited unexpectedly. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of unexpected exits exceeds a critical threshold. For example, if this test is configured with a critical threshold of 1, this test returns "Good" health if there have been no unexpected exits recently. If 1 or more unexpected exits occured recently, this test returns "Bad" health. The test also indicates whether any of the exits were caused by an OutOfMemory error if the Cloudera Manager Kill When Out of Memory monitoring setting is enabled. This test can be configured using the Unexpected Exits Thresholds and Unexpected Exits Monitoring Period Navigator Luna KMS Metastore monitoring settings.
