Navigator Metadata Server Process Status

 This Navigator Metadata Server health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Navigator Metadata Server host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the Navigator Metadata Server role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the Navigator Metadata Server process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Navigator Metadata Server host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the Navigator Metadata Server has crashed or because the Navigator Metadata Server will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the Navigator Metadata Server logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Navigator Metadata Server host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the Navigator Metadata Server host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the Navigator Metadata Server host for more details.

Navigator Metadata Server Solr Element Count Threshold Test

 This alert indicates when the document count in the Navigator Elements Solr core is reaching Solrs maximum limit. Typically, the maximum number of documents in a Solr core is around 2 billion. When the document count reaches the critical threshold, Navigator Metadata Server will stop working. The warning threshold is set to give administrators time to reduce the volume of documents before Navigator can no longer function. Consider changing these thresholds if you want to give more time between when the alerts are triggered and when Navigator Metadata Server stops working. To reduce the number of documents, make sure Navigator purge is running regularly. For more information, see Troubleshooting Cloudera Navigator Metadata Server
