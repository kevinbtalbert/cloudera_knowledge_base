Omid tso server Health

 This is a Omid service-level health test that checks that enough of the Omid tso servers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Omid tso servers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Omid tso servers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Omid tso servers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Omid tso servers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Omid tso servers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Omid tso servers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Omid tso servers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Omid tso servers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Omid tso servers. Check the status of the individual Omid tso servers for more information. This test can be configured using the Omid Omid service-wide monitoring setting.
