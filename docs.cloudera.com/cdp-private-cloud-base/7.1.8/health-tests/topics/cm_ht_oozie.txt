Oozie Server Health

 This is a Oozie service-level health test that checks that enough of the Oozie Servers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Oozie Servers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Oozie Servers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Oozie Servers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Oozie Servers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Oozie Servers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Oozie Servers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Oozie Servers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Oozie Servers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Oozie Servers. Check the status of the individual Oozie Servers for more information. This test can be configured using the Oozie Oozie service-wide monitoring setting.
