Phoenix Query Server Health

 This is a Phoenix service-level health test that checks that enough of the Query Servers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Query Servers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Query Servers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Query Servers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Query Servers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Query Servers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Query Servers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Query Servers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Query Servers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Query Servers. Check the status of the individual Query Servers for more information. This test can be configured using the Phoenix Phoenix service-wide monitoring setting.
