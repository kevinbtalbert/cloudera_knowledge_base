Ranger Admin Health

 This is a Ranger service-level health test that checks that enough of the Ranger Admins in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Ranger Admins falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Ranger Admins. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Ranger Admins falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Ranger Admins. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Ranger Admins, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Ranger Admins have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Ranger Admins have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Ranger Admins have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Ranger Admins. Check the status of the individual Ranger Admins for more information. This test can be configured using the Ranger Ranger service-wide monitoring setting.
