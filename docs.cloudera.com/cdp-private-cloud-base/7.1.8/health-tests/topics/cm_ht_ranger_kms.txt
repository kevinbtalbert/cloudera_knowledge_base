Ranger KMS Server Health

 This is a Ranger KMS service-level health test that checks that enough of the Ranger KMS Servers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Ranger KMS Servers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Ranger KMS Servers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Ranger KMS Servers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Ranger KMS Servers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Ranger KMS Servers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Ranger KMS Servers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Ranger KMS Servers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Ranger KMS Servers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Ranger KMS Servers. Check the status of the individual Ranger KMS Servers for more information. This test can be configured using the Ranger KMS Ranger KMS service-wide monitoring setting.
