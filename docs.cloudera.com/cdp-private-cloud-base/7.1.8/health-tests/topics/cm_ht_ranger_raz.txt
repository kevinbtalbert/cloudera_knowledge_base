Ranger Raz Server Health

 This is a Ranger Raz service-level health test that checks that enough of the Ranger Raz Servers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Ranger Raz Servers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Ranger Raz Servers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Ranger Raz Servers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Ranger Raz Servers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Ranger Raz Servers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Ranger Raz Servers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Ranger Raz Servers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Ranger Raz Servers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Ranger Raz Servers. Check the status of the individual Ranger Raz Servers for more information. This test can be configured using the Ranger Raz Ranger Raz service-wide monitoring setting.
