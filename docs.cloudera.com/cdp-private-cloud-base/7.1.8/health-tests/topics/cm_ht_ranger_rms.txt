Ranger RMS Server Health

 This is a Ranger RMS service-level health test that checks that enough of the Ranger RMS Servers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Ranger RMS Servers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Ranger RMS Servers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Ranger RMS Servers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Ranger RMS Servers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Ranger RMS Servers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Ranger RMS Servers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Ranger RMS Servers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Ranger RMS Servers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Ranger RMS Servers. Check the status of the individual Ranger RMS Servers for more information. This test can be configured using the Ranger RMS Ranger RMS service-wide monitoring setting.
