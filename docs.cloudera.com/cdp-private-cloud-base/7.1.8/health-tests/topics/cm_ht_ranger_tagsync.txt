Ranger Tagsync Audit Pipeline Test

 This Ranger Tagsync health test checks that the Auditing for the Ranger Tagsync role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of Ranger Tagsync process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Ranger Tagsync host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check Ranger Tagsync monitoring setting.

Ranger Tagsync File Descriptors

 This Ranger Tagsync health test checks that the number of file descriptors used does not rise above some percentage of the Ranger Tagsync file descriptor limit. A failure of this health test may indicate a bug in either Hadoop or Cloudera Manager. Contact Cloudera support. This test can be configured using the File Descriptor Monitoring Thresholds Ranger Tagsync monitoring setting. 

Short Name: File Descriptors
      
File Descriptor Monitoring Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds of the number of file descriptors used. Specified as a percentage of file descriptor limit.

critical:70.0, warning:50.0
Unit(s)
PERCENT





Ranger Tagsync Host Health

 This Ranger Tagsync health test factors in the health of the host upon which the Ranger Tagsync is running. A failure of this test means that the host running the Ranger Tagsync is experiencing some problem. See that host's status page for more details.This test can be enabled or disabled using the Ranger Tagsync Host Health Test Ranger Tagsync monitoring setting. 

Short Name: Host Health
      
Ranger Tagsync Host Health Test

Description
When computing the overall Ranger Tagsync health, consider the host's health.
Template Name

ranger_tagsync_host_health_enabled

Default Value
true
Unit(s)
no unit





Ranger Tagsync Log Directory Free Space

 This Ranger Tagsync health test checks that the filesystem containing the log directory of this Ranger Tagsync has sufficient free space. This test can be configured using the Log Directory Free Space Monitoring Absolute Thresholds and Log Directory Free Space Monitoring Percentage Thresholds Ranger Tagsync monitoring settings. 

Short Name: Log Directory Free Space
      
Log Directory Free Space Monitoring Absolute Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds for monitoring of free space on the filesystem that contains this role's log directory.
Template Name

log_directory_free_space_absolute_thresholds

Default Value
critical:5.36870912E9, warning:1.073741824E10
Unit(s)
BYTES


Log Directory Free Space Monitoring Percentage Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds for monitoring of free space on the filesystem that contains this role's log directory. Specified as a percentage of the capacity on that filesystem. This setting is not used if a Log Directory Free Space Monitoring Absolute Thresholds setting is configured.
Template Name

log_directory_free_space_percentage_thresholds

Default Value
critical:never, warning:never
Unit(s)
PERCENT





Ranger Tagsync Process Status

 This Ranger Tagsync health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Ranger Tagsync host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the Ranger Tagsync role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the Ranger Tagsync process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Ranger Tagsync host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the Ranger Tagsync has crashed or because the Ranger Tagsync will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the Ranger Tagsync logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Ranger Tagsync host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the Ranger Tagsync host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the Ranger Tagsync host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Ranger Tagsync Process Health Test Ranger Tagsync monitoring setting. 

Short Name: Process Status
      
Ranger Tagsync Process Health Test

Description
Enables the health test that the Ranger Tagsync's process state is consistent with the role configuration
Template Name

ranger_tagsync_scm_health_enabled

Default Value
true
Unit(s)
no unit





Ranger Tagsync Swap Memory Usage

 This Ranger Tagsync health test checks the amount of swap memory in use by the role. A failure of this health test may indicate that your machine is overloaded. This test can be configured using the Process Swap Memory Thresholds monitoring settings.

Short Name: Swap Memory Usage
      
Process Swap Memory Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds on the swap memory usage of the process. This takes precedence over the host level threshold.
Template Name

process_swap_memory_thresholds

Default Value
critical:never, warning:200.0
Unit(s)
BYTES





Ranger Tagsync Swap Memory Usage Rate Beta

 This Ranger Tagsync health test checks the change of the amount of swap memory usage by the role during a predefined period. A failure of this health test may indicate that your machine is overloaded. This test can be configured using the Swap Memory Usage Rate Thresholds and Swap Memory Usage Rate Window monitoring settings. 

Short Name: Swap Memory Usage Rate Beta
      
Swap Memory Usage Rate Thresholds

Description
The health test thresholds on the swap memory usage rate of the process. Specified as the change of the used swap memory during the predefined period.

Default Value
5
Unit(s)
MINUTES





Ranger Tagsync Unexpected Exits

 This Ranger Tagsync health test checks that the Ranger Tagsync has not recently exited unexpectedly. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of unexpected exits exceeds a critical threshold. For example, if this test is configured with a critical threshold of 1, this test returns "Good" health if there have been no unexpected exits recently. If 1 or more unexpected exits occured recently, this test returns "Bad" health. The test also indicates whether any of the exits were caused by an OutOfMemory error if the Cloudera Manager Kill When Out of Memory monitoring setting is enabled. This test can be configured using the Unexpected Exits Thresholds and Unexpected Exits Monitoring Period Ranger Tagsync monitoring settings.
