RegionServer Audit Pipeline Test

 This RegionServer health test checks that the Auditing for the RegionServer role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of RegionServer process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the RegionServer host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check RegionServer monitoring setting.

 This RegionServer health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the RegionServer host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the RegionServer role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the RegionServer process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the RegionServer host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the RegionServer has crashed or because the RegionServer will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the RegionServer logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the RegionServer host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the RegionServer host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the RegionServer host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the RegionServer Process Health Test RegionServer monitoring setting.

 This is a RegionServer health test that checks that the sum of the sizes of all store file indexes does not exceed some percentage of the RegionServer's maximum heap size. A failure of this health test indicates that the RegionServer is using a significant portion of its memory for store file indexes. If the amount of memory devoted to these indexes is undesirably high, the size of indexes can be reduced by increasing the HBase block size, by using smaller key values, or by using fewer columns.. Each of these choices involves trade-offs. Contact Cloudera Support for more information on this topic.

RegionServer Web Server Status

 This health test checks that the role's web server is responding quickly to requests by the Cloudera Manager Agent, and that the Cloudera Manager Agent can collect metrics from the web server. Failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the web server of the RegionServer, a misconfiguration of the RegionServer, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. Consult the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and the logs of the RegionServer for more detail. If the test failure message indicates a communication problem, the Cloudera Manager Agent's HTTP requests to the RegionServer's web server are failing or timing out.
