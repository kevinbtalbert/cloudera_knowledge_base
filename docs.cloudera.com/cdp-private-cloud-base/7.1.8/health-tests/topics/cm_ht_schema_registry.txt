Schema Registry Server Health

 This is a Schema Registry service-level health test that checks that enough of the Schema Registry Servers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Schema Registry Servers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Schema Registry Servers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Schema Registry Servers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Schema Registry Servers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Schema Registry Servers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Schema Registry Servers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Schema Registry Servers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Schema Registry Servers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Schema Registry Servers. Check the status of the individual Schema Registry Servers for more information. This test can be configured using the Schema Registry Schema Registry service-wide monitoring setting.
