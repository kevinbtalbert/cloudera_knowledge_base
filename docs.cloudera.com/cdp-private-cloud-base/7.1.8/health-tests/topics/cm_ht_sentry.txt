Sentry Server Health

 This is a Sentry service-level health test that checks that enough of the Sentry Servers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Sentry Servers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Sentry Servers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Sentry Servers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Sentry Servers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Sentry Servers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Sentry Servers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Sentry Servers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Sentry Servers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Sentry Servers. Check the status of the individual Sentry Servers for more information. This test can be configured using the Sentry Sentry service-wide monitoring setting.
