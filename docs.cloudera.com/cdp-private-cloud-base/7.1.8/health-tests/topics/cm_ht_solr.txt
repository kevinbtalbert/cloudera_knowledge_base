Solr Server Health

 This is a Solr service-level health test that checks that enough of the Solr Servers in the cluster are healthy. The test returns "Concerning" health if the number of healthy Solr Servers falls below a warning threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Solr Servers. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of healthy and "Concerning" Solr Servers falls below a critical threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total number of Solr Servers. For example, if this test is configured with a warning threshold of 95% and a critical threshold of 90% for a cluster of 100 Solr Servers, this test would return "Good" health if 95 or more Solr Servers have good health. This test would return "Concerning" health if at least 90 Solr Servers have either "Good" or "Concerning" health. If more than 10 Solr Servers have bad health, this test would return "Bad" health. A failure of this health test indicates unhealthy Solr Servers. Check the status of the individual Solr Servers for more information. This test can be configured using the Solr Solr service-wide monitoring setting.
