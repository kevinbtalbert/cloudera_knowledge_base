Solr Server Audit Pipeline Test

 This Solr Server health test checks that the Auditing for the Solr Server role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of Solr Server process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Solr Server host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check Solr Server monitoring setting.

Solr Server Process Status

 This Solr Server health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Solr Server host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the Solr Server role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the Solr Server process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Solr Server host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the Solr Server has crashed or because the Solr Server will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the Solr Server logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Solr Server host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the Solr Server host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the Solr Server host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Solr Server Process Health Test Solr Server monitoring setting.

Solr Server Solr Server API Liveness

 This is a Solr Server health test that checks that the Solr Server is responding quickly to API requests by the Cloudera Manager Agent to collect the status of the Solr Server's Solr cores. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the Solr Server, a misconfiguration of the Solr Server or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. Consult the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and the logs of the Solr Server for more details. If the test's failure message indicates a communication problem, this means that the Cloudera Manager Agent's HTTP requests to the Solr Server are failing or timing out. These requests are completely local to the Solr Server's host, and so should never fail under normal conditions. If the test's failure message indicates an unexpected response, then the Solr Server responded to the Cloudera Manager Agent's request, but the Cloudera Manager Agent could not interpret the response for some reason. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Solr Server API Liveness Solr Server monitoring setting and can be configured using the Solr Server API Liveness Request Duration monitoring setting.

Solr Server Unexpected Exits

 This Solr Server health test checks that the Solr Server has not recently exited unexpectedly. The test returns "Bad" health if the number of unexpected exits exceeds a critical threshold. For example, if this test is configured with a critical threshold of 1, this test returns "Good" health if there have been no unexpected exits recently. If 1 or more unexpected exits occured recently, this test returns "Bad" health.

Solr Server Web Server Status

 This health test checks that the role's web server is responding quickly to requests by the Cloudera Manager Agent, and that the Cloudera Manager Agent can collect metrics from the web server. Failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the web server of the Solr Server, a misconfiguration of the Solr Server, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. Consult the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and the logs of the Solr Server for more detail. If the test failure message indicates a communication problem, the Cloudera Manager Agent's HTTP requests to the Solr Server's web server are failing or timing out. If the test's failure message indicates an unexpected response, the Solr Server's web server responded to the Cloudera Manager Agent's request, but the response could not be interpreted for some reason.
