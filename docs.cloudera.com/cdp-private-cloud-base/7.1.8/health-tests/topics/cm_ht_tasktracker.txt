TaskTracker Audit Pipeline Test

 This TaskTracker health test checks that the Auditing for the TaskTracker role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of TaskTracker process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the TaskTracker host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check TaskTracker monitoring setting.
