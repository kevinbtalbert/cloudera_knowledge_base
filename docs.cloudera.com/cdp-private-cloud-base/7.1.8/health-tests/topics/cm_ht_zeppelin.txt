In all other cases it returns the health of the Zeppelin Server. A failure of this health test indicates a stopped or unhealthy Zeppelin Server. Check the status of the Zeppelin Server for more information. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Zeppelin Server Role Health Test Zeppelin Server service-wide monitoring setting.
