ZooKeeper Server Audit Pipeline Test

 This Server health test checks that the Auditing for the Server role is getting processed correctly and is not blocked. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the audit pipeline of Server process. This test can fail either because the Cloudera Audit Server is not accepting audits, or the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Server host isn't able to send audits because of some network issue. Check the Cloudera Manager Agent logs and Cloudera Audit Server logs for more details.  This test can be enabled or disabled using the Navigator Audit Pipeline Health Check Server monitoring setting.

ZooKeeper Server Maximum Request Latency

 This is a ZooKeeper server health test that checks that the ratio of the maximum request latency to the maximum client-negotiable session timeout does not exceed some value. Note that the maximum client-negotiable timeout need not be the actual session timeout used by a client but is the upper bound of such client session timeouts. As a result, this test being in "Good" health does not preclude clients from experiencing timeouts based on the particular session timeout value they have negotiated with the server. A failure of this health test likely indicates a high load on the ZooKeeper Server. This test can be configured using the Maximum Latency Monitoring Thresholds ZooKeeper Server monitoring setting.

Outstanding requests are the number of queued requests in the server. It increases when the server is under load and is receiving more sustained requests than it can process. A failure of this health test indicates a high connection load on the ZooKeeper Server. This test can be configured using the ZooKeeper Server Outstanding Requests Thresholds and ZooKeeper Server Outstanding Requests Monitoring Period ZooKeeper Server monitoring settings.

ZooKeeper Server Process Status

 This Server health test checks that the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Server host is heart beating correctly and that the process associated with the Server role is in the state expected by Cloudera Manager. A failure of this health test may indicate a problem with the Server process, a lack of connectivity to the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Server host, or a problem with the Cloudera Manager Agent. This test can fail either because the Server has crashed or because the Server will not start or stop in a timely fashion. Check the Server logs for more details. If the test fails because of problems communicating with the Cloudera Manager Agent on the Server host, check the status of the Cloudera Manager Agent by running /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-agent status on the Server host, or look in the Cloudera Manager Agent logs on the Server host for more details. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Server Process Health Test Server monitoring setting.

ZooKeeper Server Quorum Membership

 This is a ZooKeeper server role-level health test to verify that the server is part of a quorum. This check is disabled if the ZooKeeper Server is in standalone mode. The test returns "Concerning" health as long as the quorum membership status for the ZooKeeper Server was determined within the detection window and it is in leader election. The test returns "Bad" health if the ZooKeeper Server is not part of a quorum or the quorum status of the ZooKeeper Server could not be determined for the entire detection window. A failure of this health test may indicate a communication problem between this ZooKeeper Server and the rest of its peers or between the Cloudera Manager Service Monitor and the ZooKeeper Server. Check the ZooKeeper Server and Cloudera Manager Service Monitor logs for additional information. This test can be enabled or disabled using the Enable the Quorum Membership Check ZooKeeper Server monitoring setting. In addition, the Quorum Membership Detection Window setting can be used to adjust the time that the Cloudera Manager Service Monitor has to detect the ZooKeeper Server quorum membership status before this health test fails.
