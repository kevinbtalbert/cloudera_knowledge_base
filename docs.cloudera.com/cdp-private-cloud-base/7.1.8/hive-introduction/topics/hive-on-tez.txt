Hive on Tez introduction
The Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) service provides an Apache Hive SQL database that
  Apache Tez executes.
The Hive on Tez service provides a SQL-based data warehouse system based on Apache Hive 3.x.
   The enhancements in Hive 3.x over previous versions can improve SQL query performance, security,
   and auditing capabilities. The Hive metastore (HMS) is a separate service, not part of Hive, not
   even necessarily on the same cluster. HMS stores the metadata on the backend for Hive, Impala,
   Spark, and other components.
Apache Tez is the Hive execution engine for the Hive on Tez service, which includes HiveServer
   (HS2) in Cloudera Manager. MapReduce is not supported. In a Cloudera cluster, if a legacy script
   or application specifies MapReduce for execution, an exception occurs. Most user-defined
   functions (UDFs) require no change to run on Tez instead of MapReduce. 
With expressions of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and data transfer primitives, execution of
   Hive queries on Tez instead of MapReduce improves query performance. In Cloudera Data Platform
   (CDP), Tez is usually used only by Hive, and launches and manages Tez AM automatically when Hive
   on Tez starts. SQL queries you submit to Hive are executed as follows:

Hive compiles the query.
Tez executes the query.
Resources are allocated for applications across the cluster.
Hive updates the data in the data source and returns query results.
