Installing Hive on Tez and adding a HiveServer role
Cloudera Runtime (CR) services for Cloudera Private Cloud Base include Hive on Tez
        and Hive Metastore (HMS). Hive on Tez is a SQL query engine using Apache Tez that performs
        the HiveServer (HS2) role in a Cloudera cluster. You need to install Hive on Tez and HMS in
        the correct order; otherwise, HiveServer fails. You need to install additional HiveServer
        roles to Hive on Tez, not the Hive service; otherwise, HiveServer fails.

Add the Hive service to a cluster.
warningDo not add the HiveServer2 role to the Hive service. Only the Hive on Tez
                        service supports this role.

Add the Hive on Tez service to the same cluster.
The Hive on Tez service includes the HiveServer2 role.
