Setting up the metastore database
You need to know how to set up a backend database for Hive metastore (HMS) if you have
    an on-prem cluster. Set up consists of installing a supported database, configuring properties,
    specifying the metastore location. You can also configure optional connection parameters.
You need to install a supported database for Hive metastore (HMS) to store the metadata. You
      configure Hive metastore by modifying hive-site.xml. You use the Cloudera
      Manager Safety Valve feature instead of hive set key=value on the command
      line.

A step-by-step procedure shows you how to set a number of         property names and values in lieu of using hive set key=value on the         command line, which is not supported.              Configuring metastore location and HTTP modeIn addition to the database properties you need to set in CDP Private Cloud Base, you must configure the metastore URI property.         This property defines one or more metastore locations.               Setting up a JDBC URL connection overrideYou can configure fine-grained tuning of the HMS database connection. You specify a         JDBC URL override, which depends on your database, for establishing a connection to the Hive         metastore database.
