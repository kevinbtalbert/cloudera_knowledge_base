Next-Gen Storage


Apache Ozone is a scalable, redundant, and distributed object store optimized
for big data workloads. Apart from scaling to billions of objects of varying
sizes, applications that use frameworks like Apache Spark, Apache YARN and
Apache Hive work natively on Ozone without any modifications. Ozone natively
supports the S3 API and provides a Hadoop-compatible file system interface.
Ozone is typically available in a CDP Private Cloud Base deployment.
