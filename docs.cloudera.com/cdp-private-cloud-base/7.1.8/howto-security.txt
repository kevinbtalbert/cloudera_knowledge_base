Security


CDP security components ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of your CDP services and data. CDPâ€™s comprehensive and
centralized security features include user authentication, resource
access authorization, data encryption, and data governance.
Authentication, a process that requires users and services to prove
their identity when trying to access a system resource, is provided by
integration with MIT Kerberos and LDAP/AD. Encryption for data at rest
or data in motion is provided by TLS, HDFS transparent encryption,
Cloudera NavEncrypt, Key Trustee Server, and Ranger
KMS. Authorization, or control over who has access to a particular
resource or service, is provided by Apache Ranger, Apache HDFS ACLs,
traditional POSIX-style permissions for directories and files, and
Apache HBase ACLs.
