About Hue Query Processor
The Hue Query Processor indexes and retrievs Hive query history and query details and
  provides APIs to access them. Enabling the processor allows you to view Hive query history and
  query details on the Queries tab on the Hue Job Browser page.
noteAdministrators must add the Query Processor service to
   the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster using Cloudera Manager to enable Data Analytics Studio (DAS)
   features and functionality in Hue.
The Query Processor inherits Kerberos and Auto-TLS configurations from your Cloudera
   Manager-based cluster.
You can enable or disable Hue to display the Queries tab by
   selecting or deselecting the Query Processor Service option in the Hue
   Advanced Configuration Snippet in Cloudera Manager.
