Cancelling a Query
 Various client applications let you interactively cancel queries
    submitted or monitored through those applications.
Setting a Time Limit on Query Execution
 An Impala administrator can set a default value of the
          EXEC_TIME_LIMIT_S query option for a resource pool.
        If a user accidentally runs a large query that executes for longer than
        the limit, it will be automatically terminated after the time limit
        expires to free up resources. 
 You can override the default value per query or per session if you do
        not want to apply the default EXEC_TIME_LIMIT_S value
        to a specific query or a session.
