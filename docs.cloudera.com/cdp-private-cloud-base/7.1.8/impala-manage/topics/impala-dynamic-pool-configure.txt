Configuring Dynamic Resource Pool
Admission control and dynamic resource pools are enabled by
    default. However, until you configure the settings for the dynamic resource
    pools, the admission control feature is effectively not enabled.
There is always a resource pool designated
      as root.default. By default, all Impala queries run in
      this pool when the dynamic resource pool feature is enabled for Impala.
      You create additional pools when your workload includes identifiable
      groups of queries (such as from a particular application, or a particular
      group within your organization) that have their own requirements for
      concurrency, memory use, or service level agreement (SLA). Each pool has
      its own settings related to memory, number of queries, and timeout
      interval. 

In Cloudera Manager, navigate to
          Clusters > Impala Admission Control Configuration. If the
          cluster has an Impala service, the Resource
              Pools tab displays under the
            Impala Admission Control tab.
In the Impala Admission Control tab,
          click Create Resource Pool.Specify a name and resource limits for the pool:

In the Resource Pool Name field, type a
              unique name containing only alphanumeric characters.
Optionally, in the Submission Access
                Control tab, specify which users and groups can
              submit queries. By default, anyone can submit queries. To restrict
              this permission, select the Allow these users and
                groups option and provide a comma-delimited list of
              users and groups in the Users and
                Groups fields respectively. 

Click Create.Click Refresh Dynamic Resource
          Pools.
