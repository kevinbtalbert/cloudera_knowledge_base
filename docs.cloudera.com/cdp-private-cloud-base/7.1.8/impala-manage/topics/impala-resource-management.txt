Managing Resources in Impala
Impala includes the features that balance and maximize resources to
    improve query performance and scalability of your Cloudera
    cluster.
A typical deployment uses the following resource management features:


Static service poolsUse the static service pools to
            allocate dedicated resources for Impala to manage and prioritize
            workloads on clusters.
Admission controlWithin the constraints of the static
            service pool, you can further subdivide Impala's resources using
            dynamic resource pools and admission control.
