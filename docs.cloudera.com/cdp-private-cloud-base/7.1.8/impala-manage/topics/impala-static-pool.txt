Creating Static Pools
To manage and prioritize workloads on clusters, use the static
    service pools to allocate dedicated resources for Impala for predictable
    resource availability. When static service pools are used, Cloudera Manager
    creates a cgroup in which Impala runs. This cgroup limits memory, CPU and
    Disk I/O according to the static partitioning policy.
Create static resource pools for the services running in your
      Cloudera cluster.

In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Clusters > Static service pools.
In the Configuration tab, allocate a
          portion of resource to each component.


HDFS always needs to have a minimum of 5-10% of the
                resources.

 Generally, YARN and Impala split the rest of the resources. 

For mostly batch workloads, you might allocate YARN 60%,
                    Impala 30%, and HDFS 10%. 


For mostly ad-hoc query workloads, you might allocate
                    Impala 60%, YARN 30%, and HDFS 10%.
