Impala Logs
You can review Impala log files on each host, when you have traced an issue back to a
    specific system. The Impala logs contain information about any errors Impala encountered, jobs
    Impala has completed, and settings Impala is configured with.
 The logs store information about Impala startup options. This
      information appears once for each time Impala is started and may include: 

 Machine name. 
 Impala version number. 
 Flags used to start Impala. 
 CPU information. 
 The number of available disks. 

A new set of log files is produced each time the associated daemon is
      restarted. These log files have long names including a timestamp. The
        .INFO, .WARNING, and
        .ERROR files are physically represented as symbolic
      links to the latest applicable log files.
Review Impala log files on each host, when you have traced an issue back
      to a specific system:

By using the web interface at
          http://host-name:25000/logs where
          host-name is your Cloudera cluster host name. The
          web interface limits the amount of logging information displayed. To
          view every log entry, access the log files directly through the file
          system. Impala log files can often be several megabytes in
        size.
By examining the contents of the log file By default, the Impala
          logs are stored at /var/log/impalad/,
            /var/log/catalogd/, and
            /var/log/statestore/. The most comprehensive log,
          showing informational, warning, and error messages, is in the file
          name impalad.INFO. For each of
            impalad, statestored,
            catalogd:
 Examine the .INFO files to see configuration
            settings for the processes. 
 Examine the .WARNING files to see all kinds of
            problem information, including such things as suboptimal settings
            and also serious runtime errors. 
 Examine the .ERROR and/or
              .FATAL files to see only the most serious errors,
            if the processes crash, or queries fail to complete. These messages
            are also in the .WARNING file.
