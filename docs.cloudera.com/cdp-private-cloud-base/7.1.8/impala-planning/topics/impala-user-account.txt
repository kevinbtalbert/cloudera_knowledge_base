User Account Requirements
Impala creates and uses a user and group named
      impala. 
 Do not delete this account or group and do not modify the account's or
      group's permissions and rights. Ensure no existing systems obstruct the
      functioning of these accounts and groups. For example, if you have scripts
      that delete user accounts not in a white-list, add these accounts to the
      list of permitted accounts. 
 For correct file deletion during DROP TABLE operations,
      Impala must be able to move files to the HDFS trashcan. You might need to
      create an HDFS directory /user/impala, writeable by
      the impala user, so that the trashcan can be created.
      Otherwise, data files might remain behind after a DROP TABLE
      statement. 
 Impala should not run as root. Best Impala performance
      is achieved using direct reads, but root is not permitted
      to use direct reads. Therefore, running Impala as root
      negatively affects performance. 
 By default, any user can connect to Impala and access all the associated
      databases and tables. You can enable authorization and authentication
      based on the Linux OS user who connects to the Impala server, and the
      associated groups for that user. These security features do not change the
      underlying file permission requirements. The impala user
      still needs to be able to access the data files.
