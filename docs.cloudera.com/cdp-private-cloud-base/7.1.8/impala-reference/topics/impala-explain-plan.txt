Understanding Performance using EXPLAIN Plan
To understand the high-level performance considerations for Impala
    queries, read the output of the EXPLAIN statement for the
    query. You can get the EXPLAIN plan without actually
    running the query itself.
 The EXPLAIN statement gives you an outline of the
      logical steps that a query will perform, such as how the work will be
      distributed among the nodes and how intermediate results will be combined
      to produce the final result set. You can see these details before actually
      running the query. You can use this information to check that the query
      will not operate in some very unexpected or inefficient way. 
Read the EXPLAIN plan from bottom to top: 
 The last part of the plan shows the low-level details such as the
          expected amount of data that will be read, where you can judge the
          effectiveness of your partitioning strategy and estimate how long it
          will take to scan a table based on total data size and the size of the
          cluster. 
 As you work your way up, next you see the operations that will be
          parallelized and performed on each Impala node. 
 At the higher levels, you see how data flows when intermediate
          result sets are combined and transmitted from one node to another. 
 The EXPLAIN_LEVEL query option lets you customize
          how much detail to show in the EXPLAIN plan depending
          on whether you are doing high-level or low-level tuning, dealing with
          logical or physical aspects of the query.

 The example below shows how the standard EXPLAIN output
      moves from the lowest (physical) level to the higher (logical) levels. The
      query begins by scanning a certain amount of data; each node performs an
      aggregation operation (evaluating COUNT(*)) on some
      subset of data that is local to that node; the intermediate results are
      transmitted back to the coordinator node (labelled here as the
        EXCHANGE node); lastly, the intermediate results are
      summed to display the final result.

 The EXPLAIN plan is also printed at the beginning of
      the query PROFILE report to provide convenience in
      examining both the logical and physical aspects of the query side-by-side. 
 The amount of detail displayed in the EXPLAIN
      output is controlled by the EXPLAIN_LEVEL query option.
      You customize how much detail to show in the EXPLAIN plan
      depending on whether you are doing high-level or low-level tuning, dealing
      with logical or physical aspects of the query. You typically increase this
      setting from standard to extended when
      double-checking the presence of table and column statistics during
      performance tuning, or when estimating query resource usage in conjunction
      with the resource management features.
