Configuring for Kudu Tables
The Kudu configuration property must be set for Impala to connect
    to the appropriate Kudu server.
In Cloudera Manager, navigate to
              Clusters > Impala
              Service.In the Configuration tab, specify the
          Kudu service you want to use in the Kudu
            Service field. Typically, the required value
          for this setting is
          kudu_host:7051. In a
          high-availability Kudu deployment, specify the names of multiple Kudu
          hosts separated by commas. If the Kudu Service field is not set,
          you can still associate the appropriate value for each table by
          specifying a TBLPROPERTIES('kudu.master_addresses')
          clause in the CREATE TABLE statement or changing the
            TBLPROPERTIES('kudu.master_addresses') value with
          an ALTER TABLE statement.
