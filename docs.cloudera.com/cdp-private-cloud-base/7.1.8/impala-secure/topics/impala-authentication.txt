Impala Authentication
Authentication is the mechanism to ensure that only specified hosts
    and users can connect to Impala.
 Authentication feature verifies that when clients connect to Impala, they are connected to a
      legitimate server. The feature prevents spoofing such as impersonation (setting
      up a phony client system with the same account and group names as a legitimate user) and
        person-in-the-middle attacks (intercepting application requests before they
      reach Impala and eavesdropping on sensitive information in the requests or the results). 
Impala automatically handles both Kerberos and LDAP authentication. Each
        impalad daemon can accept both Kerberos and LDAP
      requests through the same port. No special actions need to be taken if
      some users authenticate through Kerberos and some through LDAP.
You can also make proxy connections to Impala through Apache Knox. If you are using Knox to
      access Impala api calls and if you have a custom kerberos principal name with default service
      user name for knox then the Configuration under Clusters -> Impala ->
        Configuration should include the custom knox principal name
      <knox_custom_kerberos_principal_name> as one of the comma separated list
      of values.
 where <knox_custom_kerberos_principal_name> is the value of the Kerberos Principal in the
      Knox service.
Select Clusters>Knox>Configuration and search for Kerberos Principal to display this value. 
Regardless of the authentication mechanism used, Impala always creates
      HDFS directories and data files owned by the same user (typically
        impala). Once you are finished setting up
      authentication, set up authorization to control user-level access to
      databases, tables, columns, partitions when they connect through
      Impala.
