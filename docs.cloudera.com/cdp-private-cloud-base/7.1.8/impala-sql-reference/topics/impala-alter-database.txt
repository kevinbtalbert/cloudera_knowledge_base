ALTER DATABASE statement
The ALTER DATABASE statement changes the characteristics of a
    database.
      Use the SET OWNER clause to transfer the ownership of the database from
      the current owner to another user or a role.
     The database owner is originally set to the user who creates the database.
        When object ownership is enabled in Ranger, an owner of a database can
        have the ALL with GRANT or
          ALL without GRANT privilege. The
        term OWNER is used to differentiate between the
          ALL privilege that is explicitly granted via the
          GRANT statement and a privilege that is implicitly
        granted by the CREATE DATABASE statement. 
Syntax:

ALTER DATABASE database_name SET OWNER USER user_name;
ALTER DATABASE database_name SET OWNER ROLE role_name;
