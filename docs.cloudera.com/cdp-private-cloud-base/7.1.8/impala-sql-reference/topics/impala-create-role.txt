CREATE ROLE statementCloudera Docs
CREATE ROLE statement
The CREATE ROLE
    statement creates a role to which privileges can be granted. Privileges can be granted to roles,
    which can then be assigned to a group and the users belonging to the group will be assigned the
    role. A user that has been assigned a role will only be able to exercise the privileges of that
    role. Only users with administrative privileges can create/drop roles. By default, the
      Impala users do not have administrative privileges in Ranger. For Impala
    users to have administrative privileges in Ranger you must use Ranger Web UI and
    configure.
Syntax:
CREATE ROLE role_name

Required privileges:
 Only administrative users can use this statement. 
Compatibility:

      Impala makes use of any roles and privileges specified by the GRANT and
      REVOKE statements in Hive, and Hive makes use of any roles and privileges specified by the
      GRANT and REVOKE statements in Impala. The Impala GRANT
      and REVOKE statements for privileges do not require the ROLE keyword to be
      repeated before each role name, unlike the equivalent Hive statements.
    
Cancellation: Cannot be cancelled.
      
HDFS permissions: This statement does not touch any HDFS files or directories,
        therefore no HDFS permissions are required.
