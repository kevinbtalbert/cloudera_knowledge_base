DROP VIEW statement
The DROP VIEW statement removes the specified view, which was
    originally created by the CREATE VIEW statement. Because a view is purely a
    logical construct (an alias for a query) with no physical data behind it, DROP
      VIEW only involves changes to metadata in the metastore database, not any data files
    in HDFS.
Syntax:
DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS] [db_name.]view_name
Statement type: DDL
      
Cancellation: Cannot be cancelled.
      
HDFS permissions: This statement does not touch any HDFS files or directories,
        therefore no HDFS permissions are required.
      
Examples:

        The following example creates a series of views and then drops them. These examples illustrate how views
        are associated with a particular database, and both the view definitions and the view names for
        CREATE VIEW and DROP VIEW can refer to a view in the current database or
        a fully qualified view name.

-- Create and drop a view in the current database.
CREATE VIEW few_rows_from_t1 AS SELECT * FROM t1 LIMIT 10;
DROP VIEW few_rows_from_t1;

-- Create and drop a view referencing a table in a different database.
CREATE VIEW table_from_other_db AS SELECT x FROM db1.foo WHERE x IS NOT NULL;
DROP VIEW table_from_other_db;

USE db1;
-- Create a view in a different database.
CREATE VIEW db2.v1 AS SELECT * FROM db2.foo;
-- Switch into the other database and drop the view.
USE db2;
DROP VIEW v1;

USE db1;
-- Create a view in a different database.
CREATE VIEW db2.v1 AS SELECT * FROM db2.foo;
-- Drop a view in the other database.
DROP VIEW db2.v1;
