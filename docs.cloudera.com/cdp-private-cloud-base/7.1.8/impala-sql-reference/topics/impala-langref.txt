Apache Impala SQL Overview
You can use Apache Impala SQL to manage and access data in Hadoop storage. Review the
    basic concepts related to Apache Impala SQL such as schema objects you can use to store and
    manipulate data, supported data types, literals, operators, built-in functions, and so on. 

Impala provides a high degree of compatibility with the Hive Query Language. Impala uses
        the same metadata store as Hive to record information about table structure and properties.
        Therefore, Impala can access tables defined through the built-in Impala CREATE
          TABLE command, or tables created using the Hive data definition language (DDL).
