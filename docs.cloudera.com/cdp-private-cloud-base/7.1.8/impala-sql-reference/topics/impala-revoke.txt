REVOKE statement
The REVOKE statement revokes privileges on a
    specified object from groups or users. 

Syntax:


      REVOKE privilege ON object_type object_name
      FROM USER user_name
      REVOKE privilege ON object_type object_name
      FROM GROUP group_name
      REVOKE privilege ON object_type object_name
      FROM ROLE role_name
      
        privilege ::= ALL | ALTER | CREATE | DROP | INSERT | REFRESH | SELECT | SELECT(column_name)
      
      object_type ::= SERVER | URI | DATABASE | TABLE
    
See the GRANT statement for the required privileges and the scope for SQL
        operations.  The ALL privilege is a distinct privilege and not a union
        of all other privileges.
      The following syntax is supported when Impala is using Ranger to manage authorization.
    REVOKE privilege ON object_type object_name
  FROM USER user_name

REVOKE privilege ON object_type object_name
  FROM GROUP group_name


  privilege ::= ALL | ALTER | CREATE | DROP | INSERT | REFRESH | SELECT | SELECT(column_name)

object_type ::= SERVER | URI | DATABASE | TABLE
      You cannot revoke a privilege granted with the WITH GRANT OPTION. If a
      privilege is granted with the WITH GRANT OPTION, first revoke the grant
      option, and then revoke the privilege.
    
      Typically, the object name is an identifier. For URIs, it is a string literal.
     The ability to grant or revoke SELECT privilege on
        specific columns is available in Impala 2.3 and higher. 
Required privileges:
 Only administrative users those with ALL privileges on the
        server can use this statement. 
Compatibility:


 The Impala REVOKE statement is available in Impala 2.0 and higher. 
 In Impala 1.4 and higher, Impala makes use of any privileges
            specified by the GRANT and REVOKE
            statements in Hive, when your system is configured to use the Ranger
            service.


Cancellation: Cannot be cancelled.
      
HDFS permissions: This statement does not touch any HDFS files or directories,
        therefore no HDFS permissions are required.
