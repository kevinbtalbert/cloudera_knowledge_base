Impala schema objects
 You must understand what schema objects are, what they include, and where they are
    stored. The conceptual information related to these objects help you to understand the various
    ways to specify their names and work with them. 
Schema objects are logical structures that you use to store and manipulate data. Schema
        objects include databases, tables, views, functions, and so on.

Impala aliasesYou must be aware of certain guidelines and rules about assigning an alias to the names     of tables, columns, or column expressions in SQL statements and using the alias when referencing     the table or column in the same statement.Impala databases Provides information about how to manage Impala databases that are logical containers     for a group of tables.Overview of Impala functionsProvides information about using Functions to apply arithmetic, string, or other     computations and transformations to Impala data.Impala identifiersProvides information about using Identifiers as the names of databases, tables, or     columns when creating the objects.Impala tablesProvides information about Tables that are the primary containers for data in     Impala.Impala viewsProvides information about using Views as lightweight logical constructs that can act     as aliases for queries. Using a view, you can issue complicated reporting queries with compact     and simple syntax and reduce maintenance by avoiding the duplication of complicated queries     across multiple applications in multiple languages.
