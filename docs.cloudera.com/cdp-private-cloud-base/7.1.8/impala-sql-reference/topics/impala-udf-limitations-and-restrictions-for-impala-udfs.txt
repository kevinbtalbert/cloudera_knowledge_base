Limitations and restrictions for Impala UDFs
The following limitations and restrictions apply to Impala UDFs in the current release.


 Impala does not support Hive UDFs that accept or return composite or nested types, or
          other types not available in Impala tables. 


        The Hive current_user() function cannot be
        called from a Java UDF through Impala.
      

 All Impala UDFs must be deterministic, that is, produce the same output each time when
          passed the same argument values. For example, an Impala UDF must not call functions such
          as rand() to produce different values for each invocation. It must not
          retrieve data from external sources, such as from disk or over the network. 
 An Impala UDF must not spawn other threads or processes. 
 Prior to Impala 2.5 when the catalogd
          process is restarted, all UDFs become undefined and must be reloaded. In Impala 2.5 and
          higher, this limitation only applies to older Java UDFs. Re-create those UDFs using the
          new CREATE FUNCTION syntax for Java UDFs, which excludes the function
          signature, to remove the limitation entirely. 
 Impala currently does not support user-defined table functions (UDTFs). 
 The CHAR and VARCHAR types cannot be used
          as input arguments or return values for UDFs.
