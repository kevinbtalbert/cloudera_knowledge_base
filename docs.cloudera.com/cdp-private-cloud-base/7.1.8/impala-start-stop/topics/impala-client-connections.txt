Impala Startup Options for Client Connections
Use the following flags to control client connections to Impala when starting Impala
  Daemon coordinator. If a configuration field exists in Cloudera Manager, the field name is shown
  in parenthesis next to the flag name.
 If the Cloudera Manager interface does not yet have a form field for
   an option, the Advanced category page for each
   daemon includes one or more Safety Valve fields
   where you can enter option names directly. 

 --accepted_client_cnxn_timeout 
 Controls how Impala treats new connection requests if it has run
     out of the number of threads configured by
     --fe_service_threads.  If
      --accepted_client_cnxn_timeout > 0, new
      connection requests are rejected if Impala can't get a server
      thread within the specified (in seconds) timeout.  If
       --accepted_client_cnxn_timeout=0, i.e. no
       timeout, clients wait indefinitely to open the new session until
       more threads are available.  The default timeout is 5
        minutes.  The timeout applies only to client facing thrift
         servers, i.e., HS2 and Beeswax servers. 

 --disconnected_session_timeout 
 When a HiveServer2 session has had no open connections for longer
     than this value, the session will be closed, and any associated
     queries will be unregistered.  Specify the value in hours.
      The default value is 1 hour.  This flag does not
      apply to Beeswax clients. When a Beeswax client connection is
      closed, Impala closes the session associated with that connection.
     

 --fe_service_threads (Impala Daemon Max Client)
 Specifies the maximum number of concurrent client connections
     allowed. The default value is 64 with which 64 queries can run
     simultaneously.  If you have more clients trying to connect to
      Impala than the value of this setting, the later arriving clients
      have to wait for the duration specified by
      --accepted_client_cnxn_timeout. You can
      increase this value to allow more client connections. However, a
      large value means more threads to be maintained even if most of
      the connections are idle, and it could negatively impact query
      latency. Client applications should use the connection pool to
      avoid need for large number of sessions. 

 --idle_client_poll_time_s 
 The value of this setting specifies how frequently Impala polls
     to check if a client connection is idle and closes it if the
     connection is idle. A client connection is idle if all sessions
     associated with the client connection are idle.  By default,
      --idle_client_poll_time_s is set to 30 seconds.
      If --idle_client_poll_time_s is set to 0,
      idle client connections stay open until explicitly closed by the
      clients.  The connection will only be closed if all the
       associated sessions are idle or closed. Sessions cannot be idle
       unless either the flag --idle_session_timeout or
       the IDLE_SESSION_TIMEOUT query option is set to
       greater than 0. If idle session timeout is not configured, a
       session cannot become idle by definition, and therefore its
       connection stays open until the client explicitly closes it. 

 --max_cookie_lifetime_s 
Impala uses cookies for authentication
     when clients connect via HiveServer2 over HTTP. Use the
     --max_cookie_lifetime_s startup flag to control
     how long generated cookies are valid for.  Specify the value in
      seconds.  The default value is 1 day.  Setting the
       flag to 0 disables cookie support.  When
        an unexpired cookie is successfully verified, the user name
        contained in the cookie is set on the connection.  Each
         impalad uses its own key to generate the
         signature, so clients that reconnect to a different
         impalad have to re-authenticate.  On a
          single impalad, cookies are valid across sessions
          and connections. 
--beeswax_port (Impala Daemon Beeswax Port)
Specifies the port for clients to connect to Impala daemon via the
     Beeswax protocol.You can disable the Beeswax end point for
      clients by setting the flag to 0.
 --hs2_http_port (Impala Daemon HiveServer2 HTTP Port)
 Specifies the port for clients to connect to Impala daemon over
     HTTP.  You can disable the HTTP end point for clients by setting
      the flag to 0.  To enable TLS/SSL for
       HiveServer2 HTTP endpoint, use
       --ssl_server_certificate and
       --ssl_private_key. 

--hs2_port (Impala Daemon HiveServer2 Port)
Specifies the port for clients to connect to Impala daemon via the
     HiveServer2 protocol.You can disable the binary HiveServer2 end
      point for clients by setting the flag to 0.
