Spooling Impala Query Results
In Impala, you can control how query results are materialized and
    returned to clients, e.g. impala-shell, Hue, JDBC apps.
Result spooling is turned off by default, but can be enabled via the
        SPOOL_QUERY_RESULTS query option.


When query result spooling is disabled, Impala relies on clients to fetch results to
          trigger the generation of more result row batches until all the result rows have been
          produced. If a client issues a query without fetching all the results then that query
          continues to be in the running state indefinitely and the query fragments continue to
          consume the resources until the query is cancelled and unregistered, potentially tying up
          resources and causing other queries to wait for an extended period of time in admission
            control.Impala would materialize rows on-demand where rows are created only when the
            client requests them.For example, if a Hue user runs a complex query that returns
            1000 rows, but does not scroll through all the returned rows, and then stays idle for a
            while, the query will remain running and will hold onto all of its resources until it is
            explicitly closed or the session times out.
When query result spooling is enabled, result sets of queries are
          eagerly fetched and spooled in the spooling location, either in memory
          or on disk. Once all result rows have been fetched and stored in
            the spooling location, the resources are freed up. Incoming client
            fetches can get the data from the spooled results.


Admission Control and Result Spooling
Query results spooling collects and stores query results in memory that
        is controlled by admission control. Use the following query options to
        calibrate how much memory to use and when to spill to disk.
MAX_RESULT_SPOOLING_MEM

The maximum amount of memory used when spooling query results.
                If this value is exceeded when spooling results, all memory will
                most likely be spilled to disk. Set to 100 MB by default. 

MAX_SPILLED_RESULT_SPOOLING_MEM

The maximum amount of memory that can be spilled to disk when
                spooling query results. Must be greater than or equal to
                  MAX_RESULT_SPOOLING_MEM. If this value is
                exceeded, the coordinator fragment will block until the client
                has consumed enough rows to free up more memory. Set to 1 GB by
                default.



Fetch Timeout
Resources for a query are released when the query completes its
        execution. To prevent clients from indefinitely waiting for query
        results, use the FETCH_ROWS_TIMEOUT_MS query option to
        set the timeout when clients fetch rows. Timeout applies both when query
        result spooling is enabled and disabled:
When result spooling is disabled (SPOOL_QUERY_RESULTS =
              FALSE), the timeout controls how long a client waits for
            a single row batch to be produced by the coordinator. 
When result spooling is enabled ( (SPOOL_QUERY_RESULTS =
              TRUE), a client can fetch multiple row batches at a time,
            so this timeout controls the total time a client waits for row
            batches to be produced.


Explain Plans
Below is the part of the EXPLAIN plan output for
        result spooling.F01:PLAN FRAGMENT [UNPARTITIONED] hosts=1 instances=1
|  Per-Host Resources: mem-estimate=4.02MB mem-reservation=4.00MB thread-reservation=1
PLAN-ROOT SINK
|  mem-estimate=4.00MB mem-reservation=4.00MB spill-buffer=2.00MB thread-reservation=0
The mem-estimate for the PLAN-ROOT
              SINK is an estimate of the amount of memory needed to
            spool all the rows returned by the query.
The mem-reservation is the number and size of the
            buffers necessary to spool the query results. By default, the read
            and write buffers are 2 MB in size each, which is why the default is
            4 MB.


PlanRootSink
In Impala, the PlanRootSink class controls
        the passing of batches of rows to the clients and acts as a queue of
        rows to be sent to clients.



When result spooling is disabled, a single batch or rows is sent
              to the PlanRootSink, and then the client must
              consume that batch before another one can be sent.


When result spooling is enabled, multiple batches of rows can be
              sent to the PlanRootSink, and multiple batches
              can be consumed by the client.
