Setting Timeout and Retries for Thrift Connections to Backend
    Client
Impala connections to the backend client are subject to failure
    in cases when the network is momentarily overloaded. 

To avoid failed queries due to transient network problems, you can
        configure the number of Thrift connection retries using the following
        option:


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Impala
              service > Configuration.In the Impala Daemon Command Line Argument Advanced
            Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) field, specify the
          following.
To avoid failed queries due to transient network problems, you can
            configure the number of Thrift connection retries using the
            following option:

 The --backend_client_connection_num_retries
              option specifies the number of times Impala will try connecting to
              the backend client after the first connection attempt fails. By
              default, impalad will attempt three
              re-connections before it returns a failure. 

 You can configure timeouts for sending and receiving data from the
            backend client. Therefore, if for some reason a query does not respond, instead
            of waiting indefinitely for a response, Impala will terminate the
            connection after a configurable timeout. 

 The --backend_client_rpc_timeout_ms option can
              be used to specify the number of milliseconds Impala should wait
              for a response from the backend client before it terminates the
              connection and signals a failure. The default value for this
              property is 300000 milliseconds, or 5 minutes. 

Click Save Changes and restart
          Impala.
