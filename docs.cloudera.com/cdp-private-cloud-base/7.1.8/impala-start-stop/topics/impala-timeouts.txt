Setting Timeouts in Impala
Depending on how busy your cluster is, you might increase or
    decrease various timeout values. Increase timeouts if Impala is cancelling
    operations prematurely, when the system is responding slower than usual but
    the operations are still successful if given extra time. Decrease timeouts
    if operations are idle or hanging for long periods, and the idle or hung
    operations are consuming resources and reducing concurrency.
Setting Timeout and Retries for Thrift Connections to Backend ClientImpala connections to the backend client are subject to failure     in cases when the network is momentarily overloaded. Increasing StateStore TimeoutIf you have an extensive Impala schema, for example, with     hundreds of databases, tens of thousands of tables, you might encounter     timeout errors during startup as the Impala catalog service broadcasts     metadata to all the Impala nodes using the StateStore service. To avoid such     timeout errors on startup, increase the StateStore timeout value from its     default of 10 seconds. Setting the Idle Query and Idle Session TimeoutsTo keep long-running queries or idle sessions from tying up cluster     resources, you can set timeout intervals for both individual queries, and     entire sessions.Adjusting Heartbeat TCP Timeout IntervalUsing the TCP flag, you can prevent the Statestore from waiting indefinitely for a         response from the subscribers that fail to respond to the heartbeat RPC within the set         period.
