Configuring the Hue Server to Store Data in the Oracle database
You can connect Hue to your Oracle database while installing Cloudera Runtime (and
    Hue).
Parent topic: Install and Configure Oracle Database for CDP
Connect Hue Service to Oracle

If you want to connect Hue service to Oracle with an existing CDH installation, then
        connect and restart Hue without saving the data in your current database. Alternatively, you
        can migrate the old data into Oracle.


New Cloudera Runtime Installation

See Step 3: Install Cloudera Manager Server to install Cloudera
          Manager (and its Installation Wizard), which you will use here to
          install Cloudera Runtime and the Oracle client.
noteCDP 7.1.8 uses Django version 3.2.13 which supports Oracle Database Server versions
          12.2 and higher and cx_Oracle (the Python interface for Oracle database) versions 6.0 or
          higher.
For a complete setup, see Using Oracle database with Hue.



Existing CDH Installation
If you are using Oracle database with Hue and are upgrading to CDP 7.x from CDH 5
        or CDH 6, then do the following:

Deactivate the Oracle Client Parcel



Log on to Cloudera Manager.
Go to the Parcels page by clicking
                    Hosts > Parcels (or clicking the
                parcels icon ).
Click the
                    Configuration > Check
                    for New Parcels.
Find ORACLE_INSTANT_CLIENT and click
                  Deactivate.



Install Hue with Oracle database 12c and higher


Download the zip files for the Instant Client Package, both Basic
                  and SDK (with headers).noteIf you are using Oracle database 11g, then
                    download the corresponding 11g Instant Client Package from the Oracle
                    website.
Switch to the host with the downloaded files and upload zip to the Hue server
                  host:scp instantclient-*.zip root@<hue server hostname>:.
Arrange the client libraries to mirror the tree structure in the image as shown
                  in the following
                    example:# Create nested directories: /usr/share/oracle/instantclient/lib/
mkdir -pm 755 /usr/share/oracle/instantclient/lib

# Unzip. The files expand into /usr/share/oracle/instantclient/instantclient_<ver>/
unzip '*.zip' -d /usr/share/oracle/instantclient/

# Move lib files from instantclient_<ver> to /usr/share/oracle/instantclient/lib/
mv /usr/share/oracle/instantclient/`ls -l /usr/share/oracle/instantclient/ | grep instantclient_ | awk '{print $9}'`/lib* /usr/share/oracle/instantclient/lib/

# Move rest of the files to /usr/share/oracle/instantclient/
mv /usr/share/oracle/instantclient/`ls -l /usr/share/oracle/instantclient/ | grep instantclient_ | awk '{print $9}'`/* /usr/share/oracle/instantclient/

# Create symbolic links. Remember to edit version numbers as necessary
cd /usr/share/oracle/instantclient/lib
ln -s libclntsh.so.<ver>.1 libclntsh.so
ln -s libocci.so.<ver>.1 libocci.sowhere
                      <ver> is the version of the Instant Client Package.
                    Replace <ver> with the actual version of the Instant
                    Client Package.
Set the path for $ORACLE_HOME and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH as shown in the following
                  example:export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/share/oracle/instantclient
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/lib






Connect Hue to Oracle

If you are not migrating the current (or old) database, simply
            connect to your new Oracle database and restart Hue. 


[migration only] Stop Hue Service
In Cloudera Manager, navigate to
                        Cluster > Hue.
Select Actions > Stop.noteIf
                      necessary, refresh the page to ensure the Hue service is
                      stopped: .

[migration only] Dump Current Database
Select Actions > Dump Database.
Click Dump Database. The file is
                    written to /tmp/hue_database_dump.json on
                    the host of the Hue server.
Log on to the host of the Hue server in a
                    command-line terminal. 
Edit /tmp/hue_database_dump.json
                    by removing all objects with
                      useradmin.userprofile in the
                      model field. For
                    example:# Count number of objects
grep -c useradmin.userprofile /tmp/hue_database_dump.jsonvi /tmp/hue_database_dump.json{
  "pk": 1,
  "model": "useradmin.userprofile",
