Allocating Hosts for Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMS 
If you are enabling data-at-rest encryption for a Cloudera Runtime cluster, Cloudera
    recommends that you isolate the Key Trustee Server from other enterprise data hub (EDH) services
    by deploying the Key Trustee Server on dedicated hosts in a separate cluster managed by Cloudera
    Manager. 
Cloudera also recommends deploying Key Trustee KMS on dedicated hosts in the same cluster as
      the EDH services that require access to Key Trustee Server. This architecture helps users
      avoid having to restart the Key Trustee Server when restarting a cluster.
For production environments in general, or if you have enabled high availability for HDFS and
      are using data-at-rest encryption, Cloudera recommends that you enable high availability for
      Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMS.
