Before You Begin a Trial Installation
Before you begin a trial installation, you must disable SELinux if you want the
    Cloudera Manager installer to run. You can also optionally configure an HTTP proxy. 
(Optional) Configure an HTTP Proxy
The Cloudera Manager installer accesses
          archive.cloudera.com by using yum on
        RHEL systems. zypper on SLES systems, or
          apt-get on Ubuntu systems.  If your hosts access the
        Internet through an HTTP proxy, you can configure yum
        system-wide, to access
          archive.cloudera.com through a proxy. 
To do so, modify the system configuration on every cluster host as
        follows: 

OS
File
Property



RHEL-compatible
/etc/yum.conf
proxy=http://server:port/


SLES
/root/.curlrc
--proxy=http://server:port/


Ubuntu
/etc/apt/apt.conf
Acquire::http::Proxy
                      "http://server:port";



Disable SELinux
note CDP Private Cloud Base  is supported on platforms with Security-Enhanced Linux
        (SELinux) enabled and in enforcing mode. Cloudera is not responsible for
        SELinux policy development, support, or enforcement. If you experience issues running
        Cloudera software with SELinux enabled, contact your OS provider for assistance.If you
          are using SELinux in enforcing mode, Cloudera Support can request that
          you disable SELinux or change the mode to permissive to rule out SELinux
          as a factor when investigating reported issues.
Although Cloudera supports running Cloudera software with SELinux enabled, the Cloudera
        Manager installer will not proceed if SELinux is enabled. Disable SELinux or set it to
        permissive mode before running the installer. 
After you have installed and deployed Cloudera Manager and Runtime, you can re-enable
        SELinux by changing SELINUX=permissive back to
          SELINUX=enforcing in /etc/selinux/config (or
          /etc/sysconfig/selinux), and then running the following command to
        immediately switch to enforcing mode:
setenforce 1
If you are having trouble getting Cloudera Software working with SELinux, contact your OS
        vendor for support. Cloudera is not responsible for developing or supporting SELinux
        policies.
