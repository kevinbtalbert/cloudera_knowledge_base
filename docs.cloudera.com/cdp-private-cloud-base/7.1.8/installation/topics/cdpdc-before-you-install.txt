Before You Install
Before you begin a production installation of Cloudera Manager,
    Cloudera Runtime, and other managed services, review the CDP Private Cloud Base Requirements and Supported Versions, in addition to the
    Cloudera Data Platform Release Notes.
For planning, best practices, and recommendations, review the CDP Private Cloud Base Reference Architecture.
importantIn a typical installation process, socket's somax
      connection must NOT be set to a very low value (default is 128, which is very low for Hadoop
      systems). Cloudera recommends that you set socket's somax connection value to atleast 16000
      OOTB via Cloudera Manager or host inspector.
cautionCloudera recommends to disable
        fapolicyd daemon present in RHEL 8.4 systems before beginning installation
      of Cloudera Manager application. Be informed that fapolicyd is a user space
      daemon that determines access rights to files based on attributes of the process and file. It
      can be used to either blacklist or whitelist processes or file access. Proceed with caution
      with enforcing the use of this daemon. Improper configuration may render the system
      non-functional.
note The importance of security in a production environment cannot be understated. TLS and
      Kerberos form the baseline for secure operations of your CDP Runtime environment. Cloudera
      supports security services such as Ranger and Atlas only when they are run on
      clusters where Kerberos is enabled to authenticate users.
The following topics describe additional considerations you should be aware
      of before beginning an installation:

Installing Python 3.8 for Cloudera Manager 7.7.3Python 3.8 is required for using Cloudera Manager 7.7.3. Cloudera Manager 7.7.3 is     supported only on Python 3.8. You must install Python 3.8 on all cluster hosts before installing     Cloudera Manager and adding services to your cluster. Storage Space Planning for Cloudera ManagerThis topic helps you plan for the storage needs and data storage locations used by the     Cloudera Manager Server and the Cloudera Management Service to store metrics and     data.Configure Network NamesYou must configure each host in the cluster to ensure that all members can     communicate with each other.Setting SELinux ModeSecurity-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) allows you to set access control through policies.     If you are having trouble deploying Runtime or CDH with your policies, set SELinux in permissive     mode on each host before you deploy Runtime or CDH on your cluster.Disabling the FirewallTo disable the firewall on each host in your cluster, perform the following steps on     each host. Enable an NTP ServiceRuntime requires that you configure a Network Time Protocol (NTP) service on each     machine in your cluster. Most operating systems include the ntpd service for     time synchronization.Impala RequirementsTo perform as expected, Impala depends on the availability of the software, hardware,     and configurations described in the following sections.Runtime Cluster Hosts and Role AssignmentsCluster hosts can be broadly described as master hosts, utility     hosts, gateway hosts, or worker hosts.Allocating Hosts for Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMSIf you are enabling data-at-rest encryption for a Cloudera Runtime cluster, Cloudera     recommends that you isolate the Key Trustee Server from other enterprise data hub (EDH) services     by deploying the Key Trustee Server on dedicated hosts in a separate cluster managed by Cloudera     Manager. Configuring Local Package and Parcel RepositoriesCloudera hosts two types of software repositories that you can use to install products     such as Cloudera Manager or Cloudera Runtimeâ€”parcel repositories and package repositories. These     repositories are effective solutions in most cases, but custom installation solutions are     sometimes required. Configuring /tmp directory for cluster hostsYou must ensure that the /tmp directory is writable so that Cloudera Manager can use         the directory for installing hosts and for generating certificates and credential         scripts.Parent topic: Production Installation
