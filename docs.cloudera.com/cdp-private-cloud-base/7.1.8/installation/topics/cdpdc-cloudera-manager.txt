Table 1. Cloudera Manager Server Storage Requirements

Component
Storage
Notes



Partition hosting /usr
1 GB



Partition hosting /var
100 GB to 5 TB
Scales according to number of nodes managed. See table below.


Partition hosting /opt
25 GB minimum
Usage grows as the number of parcels downloaded
                     increases. Budget 8 GB for each additional CDH parcel, and 1 GB for each
                     additional non-CDH parcel.


Cloudera Manager Database Server


< 500 hosts: 5 GB
> 500 hosts: 10 GB


Minimum memory and processor requirements should allow support for the
                     following number of parallel database connections:
< 500 hosts: 100 database connections
> 500 hosts: 250 database connections



Reports Manager Database Server
Minimum 1 GB
Reports Manager growth depends on number of HDFS
                     users and monitored directories.

importantFor medium and larger clusters, Host Monitor
            (HMON) and Service Monitor (SMON) should run on a host that is separate from Cloudera
            Manager. For medium and larger clusters, the SQL database should not be shared between
            Cloudera Manager and CDH component services. Host Monitor and Service Monitor do not use
            SQL database. They use an on-disk LevelDB database in the /var
            partition.
