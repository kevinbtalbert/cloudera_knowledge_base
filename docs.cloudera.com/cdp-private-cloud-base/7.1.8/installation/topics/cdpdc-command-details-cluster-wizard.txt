Command Details
The Command Details page lists the details of the
      First Run command. 
You can expand the running commands to view the details of any step, including log files and
      command output. You can filter the view by selecting Show All Steps,
        Show Only Failed Steps, or Show Only Running
        Steps.
After the First Run command completes, click
        Continue to go to the Summary page.
If cluster deployment fails, be sure to click Resume in the wizard
      after you fix any issues. If you do not click Resume, the Ranger
      service will not enable all of the necessary plugins.
