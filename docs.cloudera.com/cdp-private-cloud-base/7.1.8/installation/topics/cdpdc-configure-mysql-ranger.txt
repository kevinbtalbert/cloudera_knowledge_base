Configuring a Ranger or Ranger KMS Database: MySQL/MariaDB
Prior to upgrading your cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base you must configure the MySQL or
    MariaDB database instance for Ranger by creating a Ranger database and user.
    Before you begin the transition, review the support policies of database and
    admin policy support for transactions.

A supported version of MySQL or MariaDB must be running and available to be used by Ranger.
        See Database Requirements.

important

Ranger and Ranger KMS should use separate databases.
Ranger only supports the InnoDB engine for MySQL and MariaDB databases.



When using MySQL or MariaDB, the storage engine used for the Ranger admin policy store
        tables must support transactions. InnoDB supports transactions. A storage engine that does
        not support transactions is not suitable as a policy store.

Log in to the host where you want to set up the MySQL database
          for Ranger. Make sure you have the MYSQL connector version 5.1.x. in the
            /usr/share/java/ directory with name
            mysql-connector-java.jar. 
importantIf you are using TLS v1.2, you must use version
            5.1.48.
Edit the following file: /etc/my.cnf and add
          the following line: 
log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1 
Restart the
          database:systemctl restart mysqld
          or:systemctl restart mariadb
Log in to mysql:
mysql -u root
Run the following commands to create the Ranger database and
          user.
Substitute the following in the command: 
(optional) Replace rangeradmin with a username of your choice. Note
              this username, you will need to enter it later when running the Upgrade
                Cluster command. noteFor Ranger KMS, use (for example)
                  rangerkms rather than rangeradmin. 
(optional) Replace cloudera with a password of
              your choice. Note this password, you will need to enter it later
              when running the Upgrade Cluster
              command.
<Ranger Admin Role hostname> â€“ the name of
              the host where the Ranger Admin role will run. Note this host, you
              will need to enter it later when running the Upgrade
                Cluster command.
CREATE DATABASE ranger;
CREATE USER 'rangeradmin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'cloudera';
CREATE USER 'rangeradmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'cloudera';
CREATE USER 'rangeradmin'@'<Ranger Admin Role hostname>' IDENTIFIED BY 'cloudera';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ranger.* TO 'rangeradmin'@'%';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ranger.* TO 'rangeradmin'@'localhost';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ranger.* TO 'rangeradmin'@'<Ranger Admin Role hostname>';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Use the exit; command to exit MySQL.

Test connecting to the database using the following command:
mysql -u rangeradmin -pcloudera


After testing the connection, use the exit;
          command to exit MySQL.

Continue with the cluster installation or upgrade to complete the transition.
