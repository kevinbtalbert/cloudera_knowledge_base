Configure Network NamesCloudera Docs
Configure Network Names
You must configure each host in the cluster to ensure that all members can
    communicate with each other.

important Cloudera Runtime requires IPv4. IPv6 is not
        supported.
tipWhen bonding, use the bond0 IP address as it represents all
        aggregated links.


Set the hostname to a unique name (not localhost).
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname foo-1.example.com

Edit /etc/hosts with the IP address and fully qualified domain
          name (FQDN) of each host in the cluster. You can add the unqualified name as well.
1.1.1.1  foo-1.example.com  foo-1
2.2.2.2  foo-2.example.com  foo-2
3.3.3.3  foo-3.example.com  foo-3
4.4.4.4  foo-4.example.com  foo-4

important

The canonical name of each host in /etc/hosts
must be the FQDN (for example myhost-1.example.com), not the
                unqualified hostname (for example myhost-1). The canonical name is
                the first entry after the IP address.
Do not use aliases, either in /etc/hosts or in configuring
                DNS.
Unqualified hostnames (short names) must be unique in a Cloudera Manager instance.
                For example, you cannot have both host01.example.com and
                  host01.standby.example.com managed by the same Cloudera Manager
                Server.


Edit /etc/sysconfig/network with the FQDN of this host only:
HOSTNAME=foo-1.example.com
Verify that each host consistently identifies to the network:
Run uname -a and check that the hostname matches the output
              of the hostname command.
Run /sbin/ifconfig and note the value of inet
                addr in the eth0 (or bond0) entry, for
              example:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0C:29:A4:E8:97  
          inet addr:172.29.82.176  Bcast:172.29.87.255  Mask:255.255.248.0
...

Run host -v -t A $(hostname) and verify that the output
              matches the hostname command. The IP address should be the same as
              reported by ifconfig for eth0 (or
                bond0):
Trying "foo-1.example.com"
...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
foo-1.example.com. 60 IN	A	172.29.82.176


importantIf the host command is not installed on
                your system, then install it by running the following command:

RHEL:yum install bind-utils
Ubuntu:apt install bind9-host
SLES:zypper in bind-utils
