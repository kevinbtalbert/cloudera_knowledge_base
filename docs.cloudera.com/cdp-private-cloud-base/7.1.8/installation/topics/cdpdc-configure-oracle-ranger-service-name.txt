Configuring a Ranger or Ranger KMS Database: Oracle using /ServiceName format 
Prior to upgrading your cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base you
    must configure the Oracle database instance for Ranger by creating a Ranger database and user.
    Before you begin the transition, review the support policies of database and admin policy
    support for transactions.

A supported version of Oracle must be running and available to be used
        by Ranger. See Database Requirements.
importantRanger and Ranger KMS should use separate databases.


While installing Ranger service from Cloudera Manager using the installation wizard, in
            Setup Database, set the connection properties, as shown in the
          following example:






In Database Type, select Oracle.

In Use JDBC URL Override, select
          Yes.

In JDBC URL, type:

jdbc:oracle:thin:@//host:port/ServiceName

 This sets the JDBC URL to have the ServiceName connection url
          format.

In Username, type the user name required for connecting to the
          Oracle database Service Name you defined in the JDBC URL.

In Password, type the user name required for connecting to the
          Oracle database Service Name you defined in the JDBC URL.

note Use similar steps to configure Ranger KMS service with Oracle database type using
            /ServiceName format. For Ranger KMS, use rangerkms rather than
              rangeradmin. 


Click Test Connection.

After connection succeeds, click Continue.

Continue installing or upgrading your
      cluster.
