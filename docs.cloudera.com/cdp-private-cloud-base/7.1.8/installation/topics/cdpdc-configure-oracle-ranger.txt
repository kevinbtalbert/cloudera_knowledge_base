Configuring a Ranger or Ranger KMS Database: Oracle
Prior to upgrading your cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base you must configure the Oracle
    database instance for Ranger by creating a Ranger database and user. Before
    you begin the transition, review the support policies of database and admin
    policy support for transactions.

A supported version of Oracle must be running and available to be used
        by Ranger. See Database Requirements.
importantRanger and Ranger KMS should use separate databases.


On the Ranger host, install the appropriate JDBC .jar file.


Download the Oracle JDBC (OJDBC) driver from https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html.


Copy the .jar file to the Java share directory.

sudo cp /tmp/ojdbc8-12.2.0.1.jar /usr/share/java/oracle-connector-java.jar


Make sure the .jar file has the appropriate permissions. For
                example:
                sudo chmod 644 /usr/share/java/oracle-connector-java.jar


Log in to the host where the Oracle database is running and
          launch Oracle sqlplus:
sqlplus sys/root as sysdba


Create the Ranger database and user. Run the following
          commands:

note
If the database user is a ranger administrator user, you must grant these privileges
              to rangeradmin user explicity. If necessary, you may revoke SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE,
              CREATE_ANY_SYNONYM and CREATE_PUBLIC_SYNONYM privileges from rangeradmin user after
              completing the intallation. However, you must then grant these same privileges
              to rangeradmin user before performing an upgrade.



# sqlplus sys/root as sysdba
CREATE USER rangeradmin IDENTIFIED BY rangeradmin; 
GRANT SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE TO rangeradmin;
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO rangeradmin; 
QUIT;
GRANT CREATE SESSION,CREATE PROCEDURE,CREATE TABLE,CREATE VIEW,CREATE SEQUENCE,CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM,CREATE TRIGGER,UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO rangeradmin;
ALTER USER rangeradmin DEFAULT TABLESPACE <tablespace>;
ALTER USER rangeradmin quota unlimited on <tablespace>;
note For Ranger KMS, use rangerkms rather
            than rangeradmin.
