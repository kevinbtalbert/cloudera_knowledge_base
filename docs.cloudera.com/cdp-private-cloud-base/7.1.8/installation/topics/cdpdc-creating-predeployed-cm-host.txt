Creating a Pre-Deployed Cloudera Manager Host
Complete the steps below to create a Cloudera Manager virtual machine
    image.

Instantiate a virtual machine image (an AMI, if you are using
          Amazon Web Services) based on a supported operating system and start
          the virtual machine. See the documentation for your virtualization
          environment for details.Install Cloudera Manager and configure a database. You can configure either a local
          or remote database. Wait for the Cloudera Manager Admin console to become active.Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin console.Download any parcels for Runtime or other services managed by Cloudera Manager. Do
          not distribute or activate the parcels.Log in to the Cloudera Manager server host:
Run the following command to stop the Cloudera Manager service:
                service cloudera-scm-server stop
Run the following command to disable autostarting of the
                cloudera-scm-server service:

RHEL 7.x /CentOS
                  7.x.x:systemctl disable cloudera-scm-server.service

Ubuntu:update-rc.d -f cloudera-scm-server remove




Create an image of the Cloudera Manager host. If you installed the Cloudera Manager database on a remote host, also create an
          image of the database host. 
noteEnsure that there are no clients using the remote database while creating the image.
