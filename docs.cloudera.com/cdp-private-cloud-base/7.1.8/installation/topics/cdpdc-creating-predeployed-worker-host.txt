Creating a Pre-Deployed Worker Host
Complete the steps below to create a pre-deployed worker host.

Instantiate a virtual machine image (an AMI, if you are using Amazon Web Services)
          based on a supported operating system and start the virtual machine. See the
            documentation for your virtualization environment for details. Download the parcels required for the worker host from the public parcel
          repository, or from a repository that you have created and save them to a temporary
          directory. See Cloudera Manager 7 Download Information.From the same location where you downloaded the parcels, download the
              parcel_name.parcel.sha1 file for each parcel.
        Calculate and compare the sha1 of the downloaded parcel to ensure that the parcel
          was downloaded correctly. For example:

sha1sum KAFKA-2.0.2-1.2.0.2.p0.5-el6.parcel | awk '{print $1}' > KAFKA-2.0.2-1.2.0.2.p0.5-el6.parcel.sha

diff KAFKA-2.0.2-1.2.0.2.p0.5-el6.parcel.sha1 KAFKA-2.0.2-1.2.0.2.p0.5-el6.parcel.sha

Unpack the parcel:
Create the following directories:

/opt/cloudera/parcels
/opt/cloudera/parcel-cache


Set the ownership for the two directories you just created so that they are
              owned by the username that the Cloudera Manager agent runs as.
Set the permissions for each directory using the following
              command:chmod 755 directoryNote
              that the contents of these directories will be publicly available and can be safely
              marked as world-readable.
Running as the same user that runs the Cloudera Manager agent, extract the
              contents of the parcel from the temporary directory using the following command:
tar -zxvf parcelfile -C /opt/cloudera/parcels/

Add a symbolic link from the product name of each parcel to the
                /opt/cloudera/parcels directory.For example, to link
                /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-6.0.0-1.cdh6.0.0.p0.309038 to
                  /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH, use the following
              command:ln -s /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-6.0.0-1.cdh6.0.0.p0.309038 /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH
Mark the parcels to not be deleted by the Cloudera Manager agent on start up
              by adding a .dont_delete marker file (this file has no contents) to
              each subdirectory in the /opt/cloudera/parcels directory. For
              example:
touch /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/.dont_delete

Verify the file
          exists:ls -l /opt/cloudera/parcels/parcelnameYou
          should see output similar to the
          following:ls -al /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH

Install the Cloudera Manager agent. If you have not already done so, Step 1:
            Configure a Repository for Cloudera Manager. Create an image of the worker host. See the documentation for
            your virtualization environment for details.
