Creating a Temporary Internal Repository
You can quickly create a temporary remote repository to deploy packages on a one-time
    basis. Cloudera recommends using the same host that runs Cloudera Manager, or a gateway host. 
This example uses Python SimpleHTTPServer as the Web server to host the
        /var/www/html directory, but you can use a different directory.

Download the repository you need following the instructions in Downloading and
            Publishing the Package Repository.Determine a port that your system is not listening on. This example uses port
          8900.Start a Python SimpleHTTPServer in the /var/www/html
          directory:
cd /var/www/html
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8900
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8900 ...

Visit the Repository URL
              http://<web_server>:8900/cloudera-repos/
          in your browser and verify the files you downloaded are present.
