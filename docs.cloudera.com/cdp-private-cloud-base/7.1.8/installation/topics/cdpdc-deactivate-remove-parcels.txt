Deactivate and Remove Parcels
If you installed using packages, skip this step and go to Uninstall the
      Cloudera Manager Server; you will remove packages in Uninstall Cloudera Manager
      Agent and Managed Software. If you installed using parcels remove them as
    follows:

Click the parcel indicator  in the left-hand navigation
        bar.In the Location selector on the left, select All
            Clusters.For each activated parcel, select
              Actions > Deactivate.
          When this action has completed, the parcel button changes to Activate.For each activated parcel, select
              Actions > Remove from
            Hosts. When this action has completed, the parcel button
          changes to Distribute.For each activated parcel, select
              Actions > Delete.
          This removes the parcel from the local parcel repository.

There might be multiple parcels that have been downloaded and distributed, but that
      are not active. If this is the case, you should also remove those parcels from any hosts onto
      which they have been distributed, and delete the parcels from the local repository.
