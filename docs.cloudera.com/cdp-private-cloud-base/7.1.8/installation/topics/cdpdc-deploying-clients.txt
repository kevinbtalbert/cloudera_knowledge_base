Deploying Clients
Client configuration files are generated automatically by Cloudera Manager based on the
    services you install.
Cloudera Manager deploys these configurations automatically at the end of the installation
      workflow. You can also download the client configuration files to deploy them manually.
If you modify the configuration of your cluster, you might need to redeploy the client
      configuration files. If a service's status is "Client configuration redeployment required,"
      you need to redeploy those files.
