Apache Impala, Apache Kudu, Apache Spark 2, and Cloudera
                Search are included in the Runtime parcel. To download the files
                for the latest Runtime 7 release, run the following commands on
                the Web server
                host:sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/cloudera-repos
sudo wget --recursive --no-parent --no-host-directories https://[username]:[password]@archive.cloudera.com/p/cdh7/7.1.8/parcels/ -P /var/www/html/cloudera-repos

sudo chmod -R ugo+rX /var/www/html/cloudera-repos/p/cdh7


noteIf you want to access the previous version of Cloudera Runtime, just replace the
            version 7.1.5.0 with 7.1.4.0.

Sqoop Connectors
To download the parcels for a Sqoop Connector release, run the following commands
                on the Web server host. This example uses the latest available Sqoop
                  Connectors:sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/cloudera-repos
sudo wget --recursive --no-parent --no-host-directories http://archive.cloudera.com/sqoop-connectors/parcels/latest/ -P /var/www/html/cloudera-repos
sudo chmod -R ugo+rX /var/www/html/cloudera-repos/sqoop-connectorsIf
                  you want to create a repository for a different Sqoop Connector release, replace
                    latest with the Sqoop Connector version that you want. You can
                  see a list of versions in the parcels parent directory.


Visit the Repository URL
              http://<Web_server>/cloudera-repos/ in
          your browser and verify the files you downloaded are present. If you do not see anything,
          your Web server may have been configured to not show indexes.
