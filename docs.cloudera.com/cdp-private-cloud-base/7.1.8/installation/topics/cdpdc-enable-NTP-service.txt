Enable an NTP Service
Runtime requires that you configure a Network Time Protocol (NTP) service on each
    machine in your cluster. Most operating systems include the ntpd service for
    time synchronization.

RHEL 7 compatible operating systems use chronyd by default instead of
          ntpd. If chronyd is running (on any OS), Cloudera
        Manager uses it to determine whether the host clock is synchronized. Otherwise, Cloudera
        Manager uses ntpd.
noteIf you are using ntpd to synchronize your host clocks, but
          chronyd is also running, Cloudera Manager relies on
          chronyd to verify time synchronization, even if it is not synchronizing
        properly. This can result in Cloudera Manager reporting clock offset errors, even though the
        time is correct.To fix this, either configure and use chronyd or disable
          it and remove it from the hosts.
To use ntpd for time synchronization:



Install the ntp package:

RHEL
            compatible:yum install ntp
SLES:zypper install ntp
Ubuntu:apt-get install ntp

Edit the /etc/ntp.conf file to add NTP servers, as in the
          following example:
server 0.pool.ntp.org
server 1.pool.ntp.org
server 2.pool.ntp.org
Start the ntpd service:
RHEL 7
            Compatible:sudo systemctl start ntpd
SLES,
            Ubuntu:sudo service ntpd start
Configure the ntpd service to run at boot: 
RHEL 7
            Compatible:sudo systemctl enable ntpd
SLES,
            Ubuntu:chkconfig ntpd on
Synchronize the system clock to the NTP server:
ntpdate -u <ntp_server>
Synchronize the hardware clock to the system clock:
hwclock --systohc
