(Recommended) Enable Kerberos
Kerberos is an authentication protocol that relies on cryptographic mechanisms to handle interactions between a requesting client and server, greatly reducing the risk of impersonation. 
For information on enabling Kerberos, see Enabling Kerberos Authentication for CDP.
noteAuthorization through Apache Ranger is just one element of a secure production cluster:
   Cloudera supports Ranger only when it runs on a cluster where Kerberos is enabled to
   authenticate users.
