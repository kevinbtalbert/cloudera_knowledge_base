Configure Ranger with SSL/TLS enabled  PostgreSQL Database
Steps to configure Ranger service with SSL/TLS enabled PostgreSQL
        database.

Make sure that:

The database and database user for Ranger service are created in the required
                    postgreSQL.
A database server certificate is issued by a trusted certificate authority.
 The server host name matches the host name in the database server
                        certificate.note From CDPDC-7.1.5 onwards, Ranger
                        service requires postgres jdbc driver version >= 42.2.5. The Ranger code
                        also constructs the JDBC connection string to have sslmode=verify-full, if
                        Ranger Database SSL configurations are set in case of postgresql database
                        type.
Copy the database server certificate to /var/lib/ranger/
                    path , or use any custom path.



While installing Ranger service from Cloudera Manager using the installation wizard,
                stop at Setup Database to set the connection properties. The
                following steps apply to both FIPS-enabled  and non FIPS-enabled clusters.


In Setup Databases > Type, select PostgreSQL.

In Use JDBC URL Override, select
                        Yes.

In JDBC URL, type the following connection URL
                    format:

jdbc:postgresql://<DB-HOST>:<DB-PORT>/<RANGER-DB>?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=
<path-to-database-server-certificate>


Click Test Connection.

Click Continue.

In Review Config, update the following
                    configurations:


ranger.db.ssl.enabled
true
ranger.db.ssl.verifyServerCertificate
true
ranger.db.ssl.auth.type
1-way
ranger.db.ssl.certificateFile
<path-to-db-server-certificate>
