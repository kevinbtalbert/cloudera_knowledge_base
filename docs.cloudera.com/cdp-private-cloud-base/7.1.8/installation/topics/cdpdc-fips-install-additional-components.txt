Install and configure additional required components
Use the following steps to install additional required components for FIPS. 

note
FIPS publications (including the 140-2 publication) do not mandate the use of
                    Apache Knox, Kerberos, Apache Ranger, Apache Atlas, HDFS TDE, Ranger KMS, or Key
                    Trustee Server. However, it is typical that these features are employed with
                    Cloudera deployments in government regulated environments to achieve many types
                    of government authorizations with various government standards, such as FedRAMP
                    or FISMA. FIPS and NIST publications serve as the basis for many of these
                    government standards.



Perform the Additional Steps for Apache Ranger.

Add Ranger to the Shadow group. 


usermod -a -G shadow ranger



Install and Configure TLS either automatically or manually.
If you are using Auto-TLS, see: 

Use case 1: Use CM to generate an
                                    internal CA and corresponding certificates
Use case 2: Use an existing
                                    Certificate Authority


If you are manually configuring TLS, see: 

Manually Configuring TLS
                                    Encryption for Cloudera Manager

noteAdditional manual TLS configuration steps may be required for stack
                            components. 


Generate certificates in BCFKS format
The standard keytool utility distributed with the
                        JDK can generate BCFKS formatted keystores using the CCJ security provider.
                        When the CCJ security provider is statically installed into the JDK as
                        previously described, there is no need to pass the keytool
                        utility the -providerpath path/to/ccj-3.0.1.jar or
                            -providerclass
                            com.safelogic.cryptocomply.jcajce.provider.ProvBCFKS arguments.
                        It is only necessary to pass BCFKS as the storetype for the
                            keytool operation being invoked.
For example, keytool -importkeystore can be used
                        to import a PKCS12 keystore into a BCFKS keystore:

keytool \
    -importkeystore -v \
    -srckeystore <pkcs12_keystore_file> \
    -srcstoretype PKCS12 \
    -srcstorepass <pkcs12_pass> \
    -destkeystore <bcfks_keystore_file> \
    -deststoretype BCFKS \
    -deststorepass <bcfks_keystore_pass> \
    -destkeypass <bcfks_key_pass>

Systems administrators and other platform implementers should
                        consult their organizationâ€™s information systems security managers for the
                        correct procedures for generating keypairs and requesting signing of x509
                        certificates. The Cloudera Data Platform requires the private key and signed
                        certificate in both PEM encoded and BCFKS keystore format. The steps to
                        accomplish this task might look similar to the following:



openssl genpkey


openssl req


Have the CA sign the CSR.


Import the private key and signed certificate into a PKCS12
                            keystore:

openssl pkcs12



Import the PKCS12 keystore into a BCFKS keystore:

keytool -importkeystore




Enable Kerberos authentication using the Cloudera Manager Kerberos
                    wizard.

Set the kdc_timeout value in the krb5.conf
                    file to a high enough setting to avoid client timeout errors while running
                    queries. 


Open the /etc/krb5.conf file with a text editor.


Under [libdefaults], set the
                                kdc_timeout value to a minimum of 5000 (5
                            seconds).
