Cloudera recommends splitting HiveServer2 into multiple instances and
                  load balancing them once you start allocating more than 16 GB to HiveServer2. The
                  objective is to adjust the size to reduce the impact of Java garbage collection on
                  active processing by the service.




Set this value using the Java Heap Size of HiveServer2 in
                    Bytes Hive configuration property.
