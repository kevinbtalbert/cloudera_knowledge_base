The requirements for the Host Monitor are based on the number of monitored entities. 
To see the number of monitored entities, perform the following steps: 


Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console and click
                Clusters > Cloudera Management
                Service.
Find the Cloudera Management Service Monitored Entities chart.
            If the chart does not exist, add it from the Chart Library.
For more information about Cloudera Manager entities, see Cloudera Manager Entity
