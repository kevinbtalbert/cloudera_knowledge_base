 Identify Roles that Use the Embedded Database Server 
Before you can migrate to another database server, you must first identify the
    databases using the embedded database server. 
When the Cloudera Manager Embedded Database server is initialized, it creates
        the Cloudera Manager database and databases for roles in the Management Services. The
        Installation Wizard (which runs automatically the first time you log in to Cloudera Manager)
        or Add Service action for a cluster creates additional databases for roles when run.
        It is in this context that you identify which roles are used in the embedded database
        server.To identify which roles are using the Cloudera Manager embedded database server: 

Obtain and save the cloudera-scm superuser password from the embedded
          database server. You will need this password in subsequent steps:

head -1  /var/lib/cloudera-scm-server-db/data/generated_password.txt

Make a list of all services that are using the embedded database server. Then,
          after determining which services are not using the embedded database server, remove those
          services from the list. The scm database must remain in your list. Use
          the following table as a guide:

Verify which roles are using the embedded database. Roles using the embedded
          database server always use port 7432 (the default port for the embedded database) on the
          Cloudera Manager Server host.

Verify which roles are using the embedded database. Roles using the embedded
              database server always use port 7432 (the default port for the embedded database) on
              the Cloudera Manager Server host. For Cloudera Management Services:
Select Cloudera Management Service > Configuration, and type
                  "7432" in the Search field.
Confirm that the hostname for the services being used is the same hostname used
                  by the Cloudera Manager Server.
note
If any of the following fields contain the value "7432", then the service is
                  using the embedded database:

Activity Monitor
Reports Manager

For the Oozie Service:
Select Oozie service > Configuration, and type "7432" in the
                      Search field.
Confirm that the hostname is the Cloudera Manager Server.
For Hive and Hue Services:
Select the specific service > Configuration, and type "database host"
                    in the Search field.
Confirm that the hostname is the Cloudera Manager Server.
In the Search field, type “database port” and confirm that the port is
                    7432.
Repeat these steps for each of the services (Hive and Hue).


Verify the database names in the embedded database server match the database names
          on your list (Step 2). Databases that exist on the database server and not used by their
          roles do not need to be migrated. This step is to confirm that your list is
          correct.
noteDo not add the postgres, template0, or
              template1 databases to your list. These are used only by the
            PostgreSQL server.
psql -h localhost -p 7432 -U cloudera-scm -l
Password for user cloudera-scm: <password>

(12 rows)

 You should now have a list of all roles and database names that
      use the embedded database server, and are ready to proceed with the migration of databases
      from the embedded database server to the external PostgreSQL database server.
