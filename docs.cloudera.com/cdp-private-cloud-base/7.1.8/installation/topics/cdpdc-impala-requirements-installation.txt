Impala Requirements
To perform as expected, Impala depends on the availability of the software, hardware,
    and configurations described in the following sections.
Product Compatibility Matrix
 The ultimate source of truth about compatibility between various versions of Cloudera
        Runtime, Cloudera Manager, and various Runtime components is the Product Compatibility
        Matrix. 

Supported Operating Systems
 The relevant supported operating systems and versions for Impala are the same as for the
        corresponding Cloudera Runtime platforms. For details, see the Operating System
          Requirements topic.

Hive Metastore and Related Configuration
Impala can interoperate with data stored in Hive, and uses the same infrastructure as Hive
        for tracking metadata about schema objects such as tables and columns. The following
        components are prerequisites for Impala: 
 To install the metastore: 

 Install a MySQL or PostgreSQL database. Start the database if it is not started after
          installation. 
 Download the MySQL Connector or the PostgreSQL connector  and place it in the
            /usr/share/java/ directory. 
 Use the appropriate command line tool for your database to create the metastore
          database. 
 Use the appropriate command line tool for your database to grant privileges for the
          metastore database to the hive user. 
 Modify hive-site.xml to include information matching your particular
          database: its URL, username, and password. You will copy the
            hive-site.xml file to the Impala Configuration Directory later in the
          Impala installation process. 


Java Dependencies
 Although Impala is primarily written in C++, it does use Java to communicate with various
        Hadoop components: 

 The officially supported JVMs for Impala are the OpenJDK JVM and Oracle JVM. Other JVMs
          might cause issues, typically resulting in a failure at impalad
          startup. In particular, the JamVM used by default on certain levels of Ubuntu systems can
          cause impalad to fail to start.
          
        
 Internally, the impalad daemon relies on the
            JAVA_HOME environment variable to locate the system Java libraries.
          Make sure the impalad service is not run from an environment with an
          incorrect setting for this variable. 
 All Java dependencies are packaged in the impala-dependencies.jar
          file, which is located at /usr/lib/impala/lib/. These map to everything
          that is built under fe/target/dependency. 


Networking Configuration Requirements
 As part of ensuring best performance, Impala attempts to complete tasks on local data, as
        opposed to using network connections to work with remote data. To support this goal, Impala
        matches the hostname provided to each Impala daemon with the IP address of
        each DataNode by resolving the hostname flag to an IP address. For Impala to work with local
        data, use a single IP interface for the DataNode and the Impala daemon on each machine.
        Ensure that the Impala daemon's hostname flag resolves to the IP address of the DataNode.
        For single-homed machines, this is usually automatic, but for multi-homed machines, ensure
        that the Impala daemon's hostname resolves to the correct interface. Impala tries to detect
        the correct hostname at start-up, and prints the derived hostname at the start of the log in
        a message of the form: 
Using hostname: impala-daemon-1.example.com
 In the majority of cases, this automatic detection works correctly. If you need to
        explicitly set the hostname, do so by setting the --hostname flag. 

Glibc Version Requirement
Impala daemons should be deployed on nodes using the same Glibc version since different
        Glibc version supports different Unicode standard version. Not using the same Glibc version
        might result in inconsistent UTF-8 behavior when UTF8_MODE is set to true.

Hardware Requirements
 The memory allocation should be consistent across Impala executor nodes. A single Impala
        executor with a lower memory limit than the rest can easily become a bottleneck and lead to
        suboptimal performance. 
 This guideline does not apply to coordinator-only nodes. 

Hardware Requirements for Optimal Join Performance
 During join operations, portions of data from each joined table are loaded into memory.
        Data sets can be very large, so ensure your hardware has sufficient memory to accommodate
        the joins you anticipate completing. 
 While requirements vary according to data set size, the following is generally
        recommended: 

 CPU  Impala version 2.2 and higher uses the SSSE3 instruction set, which
            is included in newer processors. 
note This required level of processor is the same as in Impala version 1.x. The Impala
            2.0 and 2.1 releases had a stricter requirement for the SSE4.1 instruction set, which
            has now been relaxed. 

 Memory  128 GB or more recommended, ideally 256 GB or more. If the
            intermediate results during query processing on a particular node exceed the amount of
            memory available to Impala on that node, the query writes temporary work data to disk,
            which can lead to long query times. Note that because the work is parallelized, and
            intermediate results for aggregate queries are typically smaller than the original data,
            Impala can query and join tables that are much larger than the memory available on an
            individual node. 

 JVM Heap Size for Catalog Server  4 GB or more recommended, ideally 8 GB or more, to
            accommodate the maximum numbers of tables, partitions, and data files you are planning
            to use with Impala. 

 Storage  DataNodes with 12 or more disks each. I/O speeds are often the limiting
            factor for disk performance with Impala. Ensure that you have sufficient disk space to
            store the data Impala will be querying.
