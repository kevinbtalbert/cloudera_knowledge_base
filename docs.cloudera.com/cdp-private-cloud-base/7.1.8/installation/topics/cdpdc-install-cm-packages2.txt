If you are using an Oracle database for Cloudera Manager Server,
          edit the /etc/default/cloudera-scm-server file on the Cloudera Manager
          server host. Locate the line that begins with export CMF_JAVA_OPTS and
          change the -Xmx2G option to -Xmx4G.If you are installing on Ubuntu, and are planning to add the
          Kudu service to the cluster and are planning to enable Apache Ranger,
          run the following command on all cluster hosts: 
sudo apt-get install gettext-base
noteIf you know in advance which hosts will be running the Kudu
            service roles, you only need to run this command on those
            hosts.
