Install and Configure PostgreSQL for CDP
To use a PostgreSQL database, follow these procedures. For
    information on compatible versions of the PostgreSQL database, see Database Requirements.
noteThe following instructions are for a dedicated PostgreSQL database for use in production
      environments, and are unrelated to the embedded PostgreSQL database provided by Cloudera for
      trial installations.

Installing Postgres JDBC DriverYou must install the required Postgres JDBC driver.Installing PostgreSQL ServerInstall the PostgreSQL packages on the PostgreSQL server.Installing the psycopg2 Python package for PostgreSQL-backed HueIf you are installing Runtime 7 and using PostgreSQL as a backend database for Hue,     then you must install the 2.9.5 version of the psycopg2 package on all Hue hosts. The psycopg2     package is automatically installed as a dependency of Cloudera Manager Agent, but the version     installed is often lower than 2.9.3. Configuring and Starting the PostgreSQL ServerBy default, PostgreSQL only accepts connections on the loopback interface. Configure     PostgreSQL to accept the connections based on hostname, IP address (including CIDR address), or     MAC address. A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is not a requirement. If you do not make these     changes, the services cannot connect to and use the database on which they depend.Parent topic: Step 5. Install and Configure Databases
