Step 5. Install and Configure Databases
Cloudera Manager uses various databases and datastores to store information about the
    Cloudera Manager configuration, as well as information such as the health of the system, or task
    progress.
Although you can deploy different types of databases in a single
      environment, doing so can create unexpected complications. Cloudera
      recommends choosing one supported database provider for all of the
      Cloudera databases.
Cloudera recommends installing the databases on different hosts than the
      services, located in the same data center. Separating databases from
      services can help isolate the potential impact from failure or resource
      contention in one or the other. It can also simplify management in
      organizations that have dedicated database administrators.
For information about supported databases, see Database Requirements
