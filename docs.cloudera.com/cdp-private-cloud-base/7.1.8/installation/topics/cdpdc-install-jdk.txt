Step 2: Install Java Development Kit
CDP Private Cloud Base  requires a JDK installed on all hosts., you can
    either install OpenJDK or a Oracle JDK directly from Oracle. 
There are several options for installing a JDK on your CDP Private Cloud Base  hosts:
Install OpenJDK 8 on the Cloudera Manager server host and then allow
          Cloudera Manager to install OpenJDK 8 on its managed hosts.
Manually install a supported JDK on all cluster
          hosts before installing Cloudera software. 

Requirements:


The JDK must be 64-bit. Do not use a 32-bit JDK.
The installed JDK must be a supported version as documented in .
The same version of the JDK must be installed on each cluster host.
The JDK must be installed at
          /usr/java/jdk-version.


important


noteCloudera strongly recommends installing Oracle JDK at
                /usr/java/<jdk-version>
            and OpenJDK at /usr/lib/jvm, which allows Cloudera
            Manager to auto-detect and use the correct JDK version. If you
            install the JDK anywhere else, there are additional steps required
            to configure Cloudera Manager with your chosen location. See Configuring a Custom Java Home Location.

The RHEL-compatible operating system supported by CDP Private Cloud Base  7
          uses AES-256 encryption by default for tickets. To support AES-256 bit
          encryption in JDK versions lower than 1.8u161, you must install the
          Java Cryptography (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy File on
          all cluster and Hadoop user machines. Cloudera Manager can
          automatically install the policy files, or you can install them
          manually. For JCE Policy File installation instructions, see the
            README.txt file included in the
            jce_policy-x.zip file. JDK 1.8u161 and higher
          enable unlimited strength encryption by default, and do not require
          policy files.
On SLES platforms, do not install or try to use the IBM Java version
          bundled with the SLES distribution.
