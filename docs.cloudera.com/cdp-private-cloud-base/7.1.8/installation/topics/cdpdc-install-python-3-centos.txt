Installing Python 3.8 on CentOS 7 for HueCloudera Docs
Installing Python 3.8 on CentOS 7 for Hue
You must install Python 3.8 on all hosts on which you want to run the Hue service
        after installing Cloudera Manager and before adding the services to your
        cluster.

If you are using Oracle Enterprise Linux (OEL) 7, CentOS 7, RHEL 7, then you must
                install Python 3.8 and then install the psycopg2-binary package for using PostgreSQL
                as a backend database for Hue.
Install the necessary developer tools such as gcc and
                    make on your system.
Install the following packages before installing Python 3.8:
openssl-devel
bzip2-devel
libffi-devel
zlib-devel
yum install gcc openssl-devel bzip2-devel libffi-devel zlib-devel -ynoteYou
                    cannot install the openssl-devel package on a FIPS
                    cluster.


SSH into the host system as a root user.

Change directory to /opt:

cd /opt


Download Python 3.8 as follows:

curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.12/Python-3.8.12.tgz


Decompress the package as follows:

tar -zxvf Python-3.8.12.tgz


Install Python 3.8 as follows:

./configure --enable-shared

The --enabled-shared option is used to build a shared library
                    instead of a static library.

Build Python 3.8 as follows:


Run the make command to compile the files:

make



Run the following command to put the compiled files in the default
                            location or in the custom location that you specified using the
                                --prefix option:

make install



Copy the shared compiled library files (libpython3.8.so) to the
                                /lib64/ directory:

cp --no-clobber ./libpython3.8.so* /lib64/

The --no-clobber option is used to prevent
                            overwriting files.


Change the permissions of the libpython3.8.so files as follows:

chmod 755 /lib64/libpython3.8.so*



If you see an error such as error while loading shared libraries:
                        libpython3.8.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
                        directory, then run the following commands:
                    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/
echo $PATH

Change the permission of the Python 3.8 installation directory to
                        755 so that Hue and its related services can leverage the
                    binary and the site packages, as follows:

chmod -R 755 /usr/local/lib/python3.8


(For Hue) If you have installed Python 3.8 at a custom location, then you must
            append the custom path in Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Hue > Configuration > Hue Service Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                    Valve) separated by colon (:) as follows:Key:
                    PATHValue:
                    [***CUSTOM-INSTALL-PATH***]:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
