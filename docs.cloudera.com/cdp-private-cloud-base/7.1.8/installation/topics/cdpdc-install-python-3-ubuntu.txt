Installing Python 3.8 on Ubuntu 18 for HueCloudera Docs
Installing Python 3.8 on Ubuntu 18 for Hue
You must install Python 3.8 on all hosts on which you want to run the Hue service
        after installing Cloudera Manager and before adding the services to your
        cluster.

Install the necessary developer tools such as gcc and
                    make on your system.
Install the following packages before installing Python 3.8:
build-essential
zlib1g-dev
libssl-dev
libffi-dev
libbz2-dev
sudo apt install -y build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev libbz2-dev


SSH into the host system as a root user.

Download Python 3.8 and decompress the package by running the following
                    commands:

cd /opt
curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.12/Python-3.8.12.tgz


tar -zxvf Python-3.8.12.tgz


Change directory to where you decompressed the Python 3.8 package:

cd /opt/Python-3.8.12


Install Python 3.8 as follows:

./configure --enable-shared --prefix=[***CUSTOM-INSTALL-PATH***]


noteBy default, Python could be installed in any one of the
                        following locations: 
/usr/bin
/usr/local/python38/bin
/usr/local/bin
/opt/rh/rh-python38/root/usr/bin
If you are installing Python 3.8 in any other location, then you
                            must specify the path using the --prefix option. You
                            must also create a symbolic link pointing to
                                /usr/bin or to
                                /usr/local/bin by running the following
                            command:ln -s [***SOURCE***] [***DESTINATION***]For
                            example:
                            ln -s [***CUSTOM-PYTON-PATH***]/python3.8 /usr/bin/python3.8

The --enabled-shared option is used to build a shared library
                    instead of a static library.

Build Python 3.8 as follows:


Run the make command to compile the files:

make



Run the following command to put the compiled files in the default
                            location or in the custom location that you specified using the
                                --prefix option:

make install



Copy the shared compiled library files (libpython3.8.so) to the
                                /lib64/ directory:

cp --no-clobber ./libpython3.8.so* /lib64/

The --no-clobber option is used to prevent
                            overwriting files.


Change the permissions of the libpython3.8.so files as follows:

chmod 755 /lib64/libpython3.8.so*



If you see an error such as error while loading shared libraries:
                        libpython3.8.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
                        directory, then run the following command:
                    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/

Change the permission of the Python 3.8 installation directory to
                        755 so that Hue and its related services can leverage the
                    binary and the site packages, as follows:

chmod -R 755 /usr/local/lib/python3.8


(For Hue) If you have installed Python 3.8 at a custom
            location, then you must append the custom path in Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Hue > Configuration > Hue Service Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                    Valve) separated by colon (:) as follows after adding the Hue
                    service:Key:
                    PATHValue:
                    [***CUSTOM-INSTALL-PATH***]:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:
