Step 7: Install Runtime and Other Software
After you set up the Cloudera Manager database, start Cloudera Manager Server and log
    in to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console. Then proceed through the installation
    wizard.

Start Cloudera Manager Server:

sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-server
If you want to configure the Cloudera Manager server to start
          automatically when the host reboots, run the following command:
sudo systemctl enable cloudera-scm-server

Wait several minutes for the Cloudera Manager Server to start. To observe the
          startup process, run the following on the Cloudera Manager Server host:
sudo tail -f /var/log/cloudera-scm-server/cloudera-scm-server.log
When you see this log entry, the Cloudera Manager Admin Console is
          ready:INFO WebServerImpl:com.cloudera.server.cmf.WebServerImpl: Started Jetty server.If
          the Cloudera Manager Server does not start, see Troubleshooting Installation
            Problems.In a web browser, go to
            http://<server_host>:7180, where
            <server_host> is the FQDN or IP address of the host where the
          Cloudera Manager Server is running.
noteIf you enabled auto-TLS, you are redirected to
                https://<server_host>:7183, and a security
            warning is displayed. You might need to indicate that you trust the certificate, or
            click to proceed to the Cloudera Manager Server host.
Log into Cloudera Manager Admin Console. The default credentials are:
Username:
admin
Password:
admin
noteCloudera Manager does not support changing the admin username for
            the installed account. You can change the password using Cloudera Manager after you run
            the installation wizard. Although you cannot change the admin username,
            you can add a new user, assign administrative privileges to the new user, and then
            delete the default admin account.

After logging in, the installation wizard launches. The following sections guide you
      through each step of the installation wizard.
