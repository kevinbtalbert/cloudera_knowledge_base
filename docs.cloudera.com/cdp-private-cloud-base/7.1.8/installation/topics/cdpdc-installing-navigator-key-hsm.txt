Installing Cloudera Navigator Key HSM

    translates between the target HSM platform and Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server. Navigator
    Key HSM allows you to use a Key Trustee Server to securely store and retrieve encryption keys
    and other secure objects, without being limited solely to a hardware-based platform.
