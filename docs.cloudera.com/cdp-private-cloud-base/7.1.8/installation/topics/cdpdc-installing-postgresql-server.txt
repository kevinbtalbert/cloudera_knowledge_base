Installing PostgreSQL Server
Install the PostgreSQL packages on the PostgreSQL server.
note

If you already have a PostgreSQL database set up, you can skip to the section
            Configuring and Starting the PostgreSQL Server to verify that your
          PostgreSQL configurations meet the requirements for Cloudera Manager.
Make sure that the data directory, which by default is
            /var/lib/postgresql/data/, is on a partition that has sufficient free
          space.
Cloudera Manager supports the use of a custom schema name for the Cloudera Manager
          Server database, but not the Runtime component databases (such as Hive and Hue). For more
          information, see Scehmas in the PostgreSQL documentation.


Install the PostgreSQL packages as follows:
RHEL:
sudo yum install postgresql-server
SLES:sudo zypper install --no-recommends postgresql96-servernoteThis
        command installs PostgreSQL 9.6. If you want to install a different version, you can use
          zypper search postgresql to search for an available supported version.
        
Ubuntu:sudo apt-get install postgresql
