Installing the psycopg2 Python package for PostgreSQL-backed Hue
If you are installing Runtime 7 and using PostgreSQL as a backend database for Hue,
    then you must install the 2.9.5 version of the psycopg2 package on all Hue hosts. The psycopg2
    package is automatically installed as a dependency of Cloudera Manager Agent, but the version
    installed is often lower than 2.9.3. 
Cloudera recommends that you install the 2.9.5 version of the psycopg2
      package on RHEL8 and CentOS 8.
Before you begin, you must disable the postgresql10 section from the
        cloudera-manager.repo file as follows:
SSH in to the Cloudera Manager host as an Administrator.
Change to the directory where you had downloaded the
            cloudera-manager.repo file. On RHEL, the file is present under the
            /etc/yum.repo.d directory.
Open the file for editing and update the value of the enabled property
          to 0 as follows:[postgresql10]
name=Postgresql 10
baseurl=https://archive.cloudera.com/postgresql10/redhat8/
gpgkey=https://archive.cloudera.com/postgresql10/redhat8/RPM-GPG-KEY-PGDG-10
enabled=0 
gpgcheck=1
module_hotfixes=true 
Save the file and exit.
noteThe steps to disable the postgresql10
        section are applicable to all supported operating systems (CentOS, RHEL, SLES, and
        Ubuntu).

The following steps apply to CentOS 7, RHEL 7, and OEL 7:

SSH into the Hue server host as a root user.
Install the psycopg2-binary package as
            follows:pip3.8 install psycopg2-binary
Repeat these steps on all the Hue server hosts.

If you get the "Error: pg_config executable not found" error
          while installing the psycopg2-binary package, then run the following
          commands to install the postgresql, postgresql-devel,
            python-devel
          packages:yum install postgresql postgresql-devel python-devel
