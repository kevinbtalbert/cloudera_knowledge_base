Instantiating a Cloudera Manager Image
Complete the following steps to create a new Cloudera Manager instance from a virtual
    machine image.

Instantiate the Cloudera Manager image.If the Cloudera Manager database will be hosted on a remote host, also instantiate
          the database host image.Ensure that the cloudera-scm-server service is not running by
          running the following command on the Cloudera Manager host:
service cloudera-scm-server statusIf it is running, stop it
          using the following command:service cloudera-scm-server stop
On the Cloudera Manager host, create a file named uuid in the
            /etc/cloudera-scm-server directory. Add a globally unique identifier to
          this file using the following command:
          cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid > /etc/cloudera-scm-server/uuid
The
          existence of this file informs Cloudera Manager to reinitialize its own unique identifier
          when it starts. Run the following command to start the Cloudera Manager service:
service cloudera-scm-server start
Run the following command to enable automatic restart for the
            cloudera-scm-server:

SLES:
              chkconfig cloudera-scm-server on

RHEL 7.x /CentOS
              7.x.x:systemctl enable cloudera-scm-server.service

Ubuntu:update-rc.d -f cloudera-scm-server defaults
