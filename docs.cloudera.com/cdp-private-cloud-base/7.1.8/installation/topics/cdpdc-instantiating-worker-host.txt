Instantiating a worker host
You must instantiate a worker host from the pre-deployed image that
    you have created.

Instantiate the virtual machine image for the Cloudera worker
          host.

Edit the /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini file
          and set the server_host and
            server_port properties to reference the Cloudera
          Manager server host.

Configure TLS/SSL. 

Start the Cloudera Manager agent service:

service cloudera-scm-agent start
