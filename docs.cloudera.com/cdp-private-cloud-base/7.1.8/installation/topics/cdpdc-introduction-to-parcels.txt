Introduction to Parcels
Parcels are a packaging format that facilitate upgrading software from within Cloudera
    Manager. 
You can download, distribute, and activate a new software version all
      from within Cloudera Manager. Cloudera Manager downloads a parcel to a
      local directory. Once the parcel is downloaded to the Cloudera Manager
      Server host, an Internet connection is no longer needed to deploy the
      parcel. For detailed information about parcels, see Overview of Parcels.
If your Cloudera Manager Server does not have Internet access, you can
      obtain the required parcel files and put them into a parcel repository.
      For more information, see Configuring a Local Parcel Repository.
