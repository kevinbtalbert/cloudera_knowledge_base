Installing Apache Knox
 This document provides instructions on how to install Apache
    Knox using the CDP Private Cloud Base installation
    process. 

Apache Knox is an application gateway for interacting with the REST APIs and UIs. The
                Knox Gateway provides a single access point for all REST and HTTP interactions in
                your Cloudera Data Platform cluster.


When installing Knox, you must have Kerberos enabled on your cluster.


From your Cloudera Manager homepage, go to Status tab > $Cluster Name > ... > Add Service



From the list of services, select Knox and click
                        Continue.

On the Select Dependencies page, choose the dependencies
                    you want Knox to set up: 

HDFS, Ranger, Solr, Zookeeper
For users that require Apache Ranger for authorization. HDFS with
                            Ranger. HDFS depends on Zookeeper, and Ranger depends on Solr. 

HDFS, Zookeeper
HDFS depends on Zookeeper.

No optional dependencies
For users that do not wish to have Knox integrate with HDFS or
                            Ranger.


On the Assign Roles page, select role assignments for your
                    dependencies and click Continue:


Knox service roles
Description
Required?



Knox Gateway
If Knox is installed, at least one instance of this role
                                        should be installed. This role represents the Knox Gateway
                                        which provides a single access point for all REST and HTTP
                                        interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters. 
Required


KnoxIDBroker*
It is strongly recommended that this role is installed on
                                        its own dedicated host. As its name suggests this role will
                                        allow you to take advantage of Knoxâ€™s Identity Broker
                                        capabilities, an identity federation solution that exchanges
                                        cluster authentication for temporary cloud
                                        credentials.*
Optional*


Gateway
This role comes with the CSD framework. The gateway
                                        structure is used to describe the client configuration of
                                        the service on each host where the gateway role is
                                        installed.
Optional

* Note: KnoxIDBroker appears in the Assign Roles page, but it is not
                    currently supported in CDP Private Cloud. 

On the Review Changes page, most of the default values are
                    acceptable, but you must Enable Kerberos Authentication and supply the Knox
                    Master Secret. There are additional parameters you can specify or change, listed
                    in Knox Install Role Parameters.


Click Enable Kerberos Authentication
Kerberos is required where Knox is enabled.


Supply the Knox Master Secret, e.g.
                                knoxsecret.


Click Continue.



The Command Details page shows the status of your
                    operation. After completion, your system admin can view logs for your
                    installation under stdout.
