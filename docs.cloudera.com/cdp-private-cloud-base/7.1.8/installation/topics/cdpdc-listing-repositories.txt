Listing Repositories
You can list the enabled repositories by running one of the following
    commands:


RHEL compatible:
yum repolist
SLES:
zypper repos
Ubuntu:
apt-get does not include a command to display sources, but you can
          determine sources by reviewing the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list and
          any files contained in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/.


The following shows an example of the output of yum repolist on a CentOS 7
      sytstem:repo id               repo name                                           status
