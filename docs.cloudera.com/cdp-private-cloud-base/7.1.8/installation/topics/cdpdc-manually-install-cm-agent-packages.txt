Manually Install Cloudera Manager Agent Packages
The Cloudera Manager Agent is responsible for starting and stopping processes,
    unpacking configurations, triggering installations, and monitoring all hosts in a cluster. You
    can install the Cloudera Manager agent manually on all hosts, or Cloudera Manager can install
    the Agents in a later step. To use Cloudera Manager to install the agents, skip this section. 
To install the Cloudera Manager Agent packages manually, do the following on every
      cluster host (including those that will run one or more of the Cloudera Management Service
      roles: Service Monitor, Activity Monitor, Event Server, Alert Publisher, or Reports
        Manager):noteYou must make sure that you set the Java home path
        correctly while installing the agents manually.Add the Java home path in Cloudera Manager
          under Hosts > All Hosts >
            Configuration > Java Home Directory.
          Later, start the service.

Use one of the following commands to install the Cloudera Manager Agent packages:



OS
Command



RHEL, if you have a yum repo configured:

$ sudo yum install cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-daemons



RHEL, if you're manually transferring RPMs:

$ sudo yum --nogpgcheck localinstall cloudera-manager-agent-package.*.x86_64.rpm cloudera-manager-daemons.*.x86_64.rpm



SLES

$ sudo zypper install cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-daemons



Ubuntu

$ sudo apt-get install cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-daemons



On every cluster host, configure the Cloudera Manager Agent to point to the
          Cloudera Manager Server by setting the following properties in the
            /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini configuration file:


Property
Description



server_host
Name of the host where Cloudera Manager Server is running.


server_port
Port on the host where Cloudera Manager Server is running.


Start the Agents by running the following command on all
          hosts:
sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-agent
If the agent starts without errors, no response displays.
When the Agent starts, it contacts the Cloudera Manager Server. If
            communication fails between a Cloudera Manager Agent and Cloudera
            Manager Server, see Troubleshooting Installation
              Problems. When the Agent hosts reboot,
              cloudera-scm-agent starts automatically.
