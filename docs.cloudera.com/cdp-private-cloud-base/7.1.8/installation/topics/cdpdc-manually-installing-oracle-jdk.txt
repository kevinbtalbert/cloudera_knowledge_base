Manually Installing Oracle JDK
The Oracle JDK installer is available both as an RPM-based installer for RPM-based
    systems, and as a .tar.gz file. These instructions are for the
      .tar.gz file.

Download the .tar.gz file for one of the 64-bit supported versions of
          the Oracle JDK from Java SE 8 Downloads.

noteIf you want to download the JDK directly using a utility such as
              wget, you must accept the Oracle license by configuring headers,
            which are updated frequently. Blog posts and Q&A sites can be a good source of
            information on how to download a particular JDK version using
            wget.

Extract the JDK to /usr/java/jdk-version. For
          example:
tar xvfz /path/to/jdk-8u<update_version>-linux-x64.tar.gz -C /usr/java/
Repeat this procedure on all cluster hosts. 
After you have finished, continue to Step 3: Install Cloudera Manager
        Server.
