Migrating from the Cloudera Manager Embedded PostgreSQL Database Server to an External
    PostgreSQL Database 
If you have already used the embedded PostgreSQL database and you are unable to redeploy
    a fresh cluster, you must migrate the embedded PostgreSQL database sever to an external
    PostgreSQL database.
Cloudera Manager provides an embedded PostgreSQL database server for trial and proof of
      concept deployments when creating a cluster. To remind users that this embedded database is
      not suitable for production, Cloudera Manager displays the banner text: "You are running
      Cloudera Manager in non-production mode, which uses an embedded PostgreSQL database. Switch to
      using a supported external database before moving into production." 
If, however, you have already used the embedded database, and you are unable to redeploy a
      fresh cluster, then you must migrate to an external PostgreSQL database. 

noteThis procedure does not describe how to migrate to a database server other than
        PostgreSQL. Moving databases from one database server to a different type of database server
        is a complex process that requires modification of the schema and matching the data in the
        database tables to the new schema. It is strongly recommended that you engage with Cloudera
        Professional Services if you wish to perform a migration to an external database server
        other than PostgreSQL. 


PrerequisitesBefore migrating the Cloudera Manager embedded PostgreSQL database to an external     PostgreSQL database, ensure that your setup meets the following conditions:Identify Roles that Use the Embedded Database ServerBefore you can migrate to another database server, you must first identify the     databases using the embedded database server. Migrate Databases from the Embedded Database Server to the External PostgreSQL Database ServerAfter you identify the roles that use the embedded database, you are ready to migrate     from the embedded database server to an external PostgreSQL database server.Parent topic: Trial Installation
