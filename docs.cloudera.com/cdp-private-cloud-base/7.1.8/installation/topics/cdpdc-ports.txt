Ports
Cloudera Manager, Cloudera Runtime components, managed services, and third-party
    components use the ports listed in the tables that follow. 
Before you deploy Cloudera Manager, Cloudera Runtime, managed services, and third-party
      components, make sure these ports are open on each system. If you are using a firewall, such
      as iptables or firewalld, and cannot open all the listed
      ports, you must disable the firewall completely to ensure full functionality.
In the tables in the subsections that follow, the Access Requirement column for each port is
      usually either "Internal" or "External." In this context, "Internal" means that the port is
      used only for communication among the components (for example the JournalNode ports in an HA
      configuration); "External" means that the port can be used for either internal or external
      communication (for example, ports used by NodeManager and the JobHistory Server Web UIs).
Unless otherwise specified, the ports access requirement is unidirectional, meaning that
      inbound connections to the specified ports must be allowed. In most modern stateful firewalls,
      it is not necessary to create a separate rule for return traffic on a permitted session.
