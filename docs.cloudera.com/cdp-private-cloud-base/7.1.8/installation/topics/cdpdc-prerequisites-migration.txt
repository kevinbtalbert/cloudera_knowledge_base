Prerequisites 
Before migrating the Cloudera Manager embedded PostgreSQL database to an external
    PostgreSQL database, ensure that your setup meets the following conditions:


 The external PostgreSQL database server is running. 
 The database server is configured to accept remote connections. 
 The database server is configured to accept user logins using md5. 
 No one has manually created any databases in the external database server for roles
          that will be migrated. noteTo view a list of databases in the external database server
            (requires default superuser
            permission):sudo -u postgres psql -l
 All health issues with your cluster have been resolved.


 For details about configuring the database server, see Configuring and Starting the
        PostgreSQL Server. 

important Only perform the steps in Configuring and Starting the
          PostgreSQL Server. Do not proceed with the creation of databases as
        described in the subsequent section. 

 For large clusters, Cloudera recommends running your database server on a dedicated host.
      Engage Cloudera Professional Services or a certified database administrator to correctly tune
      your external database server.
