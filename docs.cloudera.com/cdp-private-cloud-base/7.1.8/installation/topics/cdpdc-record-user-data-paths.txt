Record User Data Paths
Record the location of the user data paths by checking the configuration in each
    service.
The user data paths listed in the topic Remove User Data, /var/lib/flume-ng /var/lib/hadoop* /var/lib/hue /var/lib/navigator
          /var/lib/oozie /var/lib/solr /var/lib/sqoop* /var/lib/zookeeper
data_drive_path/dfs
            data_drive_path/mapred
        data_drive_path/yarn, are the default settings. However, at
      some point they might have been reconfigured in Cloudera Manager. If you want to remove all
      user data from the cluster and have changed the paths, either when you installed Runtime and
      managed services or at some later time, note the location of the paths by checking the
      configuration in each service.
