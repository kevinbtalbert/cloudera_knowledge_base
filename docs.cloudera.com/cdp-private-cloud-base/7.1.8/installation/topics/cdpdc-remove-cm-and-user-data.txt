Remove Cloudera Manager, User Data, and Databases
Permanently remove Cloudera Manager data, the Cloudera Manager lock file, and user
    data. Then stop and remove the databases.

On all Agent hosts, stop any running Cloudera Manager and managed processes:

for u in cloudera-scm flume hadoop hdfs hbase hive httpfs hue impala llama mapred oozie solr spark sqoop sqoop2 yarn zookeeper; do sudo kill $(ps -u $u -o pid=); done
noteThis step should not be necessary if you stopped all the services and the Cloudera
            Manager Agent correctly.
If you are uninstalling on RHEL, run the following commands on all Agent hosts to
          permanently remove Cloudera Manager data. If you want to be able to access any of this
          data in the future, you must back it up before removing it. If you used an embedded
          PostgreSQL database, that data is stored in
            /var/lib/cloudera-scm-server-db. 
sudo umount cm_processes
sudo rm -Rf /usr/share/cmf /var/lib/cloudera* /var/cache/yum/cloudera* /var/log/cloudera* /var/run/cloudera*
On all Agent hosts, run this command to remove the Cloudera Manager lock
          file:
sudo rm /tmp/.scm_prepare_node.lock
This step permanently removes all user data. To preserve the data, copy it to
          another cluster using the distcp command before starting the uninstall
          process. 
On all Agent hosts, run the following commands:
sudo rm -Rf /var/lib/flume-ng /var/lib/hadoop* /var/lib/hue /var/lib/navigator /var/lib/oozie /var/lib/solr /var/lib/sqoop* /var/lib/zookeeper

Run the following command on each data drive on all Agent hosts (adjust the
              paths for the data drives on each host):
sudo rm -Rf data_drive_path/dfs data_drive_path/mapred data_drive_path/yarn

Stop and remove the databases. If you chose to store Cloudera Manager or user data
          in an external database, see the database vendor documentation for details on how to
          remove the databases.
