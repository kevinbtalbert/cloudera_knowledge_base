Reports Manager

The Reports Manager fetches the fsimage from the NameNode at regular intervals. It reads
        the fsimage and creates a Lucene index for it. To improve the indexing performance, Cloudera
        recommends provisioning a host as powerful as possible and dedicating an SSD disk to the
        Reports Manager. 
importantDo not place the Reports Manager on the same host as
      the Service Monitor. This can cause CPU usage issues.

The recommended value is up to four times the current recommendation (4 * FsImage size + 2 Gb).
For Example: 
FsImage size: 20 Gb; 
Current  recommendation in the official documentation: 4 * 20 Gb + 2 Gb = 82 Gb; 
Recommended value for the increased heap memory needs: x * 82 Gb (1 < x <= 4)



Minimum: 8 cores 
Recommended: 16 cores (32 cores, with hyperthreading enabled.)


1 dedicated disk that is at least 20 times the size of the fsimage. Cloudera
                strongly recommends using SSD disks.
