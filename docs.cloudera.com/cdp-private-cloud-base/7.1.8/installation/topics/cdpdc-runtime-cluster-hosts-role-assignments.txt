Runtime Cluster Hosts and Role AssignmentsCloudera Docs
Runtime Cluster Hosts and Role Assignments
Cluster hosts can be broadly described as master hosts, utility
    hosts, gateway hosts, or worker hosts.


Master hosts run Hadoop master processes such as the HDFS
          NameNode and YARN Resource Manager.
Utility hosts run other cluster processes that are not master processes such as
          Cloudera Manager and one or more Hive Metastores.
Gateway hosts are client access points for launching jobs in
          the cluster. The number of gateway hosts required varies depending on
          the type and size of the workloads.
Worker hosts primarily run DataNodes and other distributed
          processes such as Impalad. 


importantCloudera recommends that you always enable high
      availability when Runtime is used in a production environment. 
The following tables describe the recommended
      role allocations for different cluster sizes. Note that these
      configurations take into account services dependencies that might not be
      obvious. For example, running Atlas or Ranger requires also running HBase,
      Kafka, Solr, and ZooKeeper. For details see Service Dependences in Cloudera
        Manager. 

noteWhen High Availability (HA) is enabled and the
        total number of nodes is under 10, you must carefully plan the composition of the worker
        nodes. That is the utility nodes and master nodes. If you decide that your development
        cluster is to be HA enabled, you must add the HA configuration for at least 3-10 hosts for
        seamless performance.
