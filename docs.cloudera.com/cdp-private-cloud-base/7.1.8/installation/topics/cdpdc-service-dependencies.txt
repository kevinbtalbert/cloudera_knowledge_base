Service Dependencies in Cloudera Manager
The following tables list service dependencies that exist between
    various services in a Cloudera Manager deployment.
When configuring CDP Runtime for production environments, be sure that
      Kerberos is enabled for user authentication. Cloudera supports security
      services such as Ranger and Atlas when they run on clusters where Kerberos
      is enabled to authenticate users.
Service dependencies for Spark 2 on YARN and Cloudera Data Science Workbench are listed
      separately.
