Setting SELinux Mode
Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) allows you to set access control through policies.
    If you are having trouble deploying Runtime or CDH with your policies, set SELinux in permissive
    mode on each host before you deploy Runtime or CDH on your cluster.

noteCDP Private Cloud Base, with the exception of
        Cloudera Navigator Encrypt, is supported on platforms with
        Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enabled and in
          enforcing mode. Cloudera is not responsible for
        SELinux policy development, support, or enforcement. If you experience
        issues running Cloudera software with SELinux enabled, contact your OS
        provider for assistance.If you are using SELinux in
            enforcing mode, Cloudera Support can request that
          you disable SELinux or change the mode to permissive
          to rule out SELinux as a factor when investigating reported
          issues.


Check the SELinux state:

getenforce


If the output is either Permissive or Disabled, you
          can skip this task and continue to Disabling the
            Firewall to disable the firewall on each host in  your cluster. If the output is
            enforcing, continue to the next step.
Open the /etc/selinux/config file (in some systems, the
            /etc/sysconfig/selinux file).Change the line SELINUX=enforcing to
            SELINUX=permissive.Save and close the file.Restart your system or run the following command to disable SELinux
          immediately:
setenforce 0
After you have installed and deployed Runtime or CDH, you can re-enable SELinux
          by changing SELINUX=permissive back to SELINUX=enforcing
          in /etc/selinux/config (or /etc/sysconfig/selinux), and
          then running the following command to immediately switch to enforcing
            mode:setenforce 1If you are having
            trouble getting Cloudera Software working with SELinux, contact your OS vendor for
            support. Cloudera is not responsible for developing or supporting SELinux
          policies.
