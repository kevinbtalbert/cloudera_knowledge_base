Setting Up a Web Server
To host an internal repository, you must install or use an existing Web server on an
    internal host that is reachable by the Cloudera Manager host, and then download the repository
    files to the Web server host. 
The examples in this section use Apache HTTP Server as the Web
      server. If you already have a Web server in your organization, you can skip to
        Downloading and Publishing the Package Repository.

Install Apache HTTP Server:

RHEL / CentOS

sudo yum install httpd

SLES

sudo zypper install httpd

Ubuntu

sudo apt-get install httpd


Start Apache HTTP Server:

RHEL 7

sudo systemctl start httpd

SLES 12, Ubuntu 18

sudo systemctl start apache2
