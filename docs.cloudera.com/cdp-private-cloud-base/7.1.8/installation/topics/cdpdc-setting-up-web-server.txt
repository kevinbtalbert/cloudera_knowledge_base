Setting Up a Web Server
To host an internal repository, you must install or use an existing Web server on an
    internal host that is reachable by the Cloudera Manager host, and then download the repository
    files to the Web server host. 
The examples on this page use Apache HTTP Server as the Web server. If you already
      have a Web server in your organization, you can skip to Downloading and Publishing the
        Parcel Repository.

Install Apache HTTP Server:


RHEL / CentOS

sudo yum install httpd

SLES

sudo zypper install httpd

Ubuntu

sudo apt-get install httpd



Edit the Apache HTTP Server configuration file
            (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf by default) to add or edit the following
          line in the <IfModule mime_module> section:
    AddType application/x-gzip .gz .tgz .parcel
If the <IfModule mime_module> section does not exist, you can add
            it in its entirety as follows:
noteThis example configuration was modified from the default configuration provided
            after installing Apache HTTP Server on RHEL 7.
<IfModule mime_module>
    #
    # TypesConfig points to the file containing the list of mappings from
    # filename extension to MIME-type.
    #
    TypesConfig /etc/mime.types

    #
    # AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration
    # file specified in TypesConfig for specific file types.
    #
    #AddType application/x-gzip .tgz
    #
    # AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers uncompress
    # information on the fly. Note: Not all browsers support this.
    #
    #AddEncoding x-compress .Z
    #AddEncoding x-gzip .gz .tgz
    #
    # If the AddEncoding directives above are commented-out, then you
    # probably should define those extensions to indicate media types:
    #
    AddType application/x-compress .Z
    AddType application/x-gzip .gz .tgz .parcel

    #
    # AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to "handlers":
    # actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server
    # or added with the Action directive (see below)
    #
    # To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories:
    # (You will also need to add "ExecCGI" to the "Options" directive.)
    #
    #AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

    # For type maps (negotiated resources):
    #AddHandler type-map var

    #
    # Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.
    #
    # To parse .shtml files for server-side includes (SSI):
    # (You will also need to add "Includes" to the "Options" directive.)
    #
    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml
</IfModule>
warningSkipping this step could result in an error message Hash
              verification failed when trying to download the parcel from a local repository,
            especially in Cloudera Manager 6 and higher.
Start Apache HTTP Server:

RHEL 7

sudo systemctl start httpd

SLES 12, Ubuntu 18

sudo systemctl start apache2
