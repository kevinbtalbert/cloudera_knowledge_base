Step 6: Set up and configure the Cloudera Manager database
Cloudera Manager Server includes the scm_prepare_database.sh script
    that can create and configure a database.
The scm_prepare_database.sh script can perform the following
      activities:

Create the Cloudera Manager Server database configuration file.
(PostgreSQL) Create and configure a database for Cloudera Manager Server to use.
(PostgreSQL) Create and configure a user account for Cloudera Manager Server.

The scm_prepare_database.sh script checks the connection between the
      Cloudera Manager Server and the database. Upon successful connection, the script writes the
        /etc/cloudera-scm-server/db.properties file. When you start Cloudera
      Manager for the first time, the scm_prepare_database.sh script creates
      and populates the necessary tables
Although the script can create a database, the following procedures assume that you have
      already created the database as described in Install and Configure Databases. For
      more information about tuning the Cloudera Manager database for best performance, see the
      corresponding Knowledge article: hibernate.c3p0 Configs for Cloudera Manager.
The following sections describe the syntax for the script and
      demonstrate how to use it:
