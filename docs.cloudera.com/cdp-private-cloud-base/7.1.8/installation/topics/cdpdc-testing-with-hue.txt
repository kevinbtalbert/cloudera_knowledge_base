Testing with Hue
You can test the cluster by running Hue. 

Hue is a graphical user interface that allows you to interact with your clusters by
                running applications that let you browse HDFS and cloud object storage such as S3
                and ABFS, manage a Hive metastore, and run Hive, Impala, and Search queries, and
                Oozie workflows.


From Cloudera Manager, go to Clusters > Hue service.

Click Web UI link and select the Hue web URL, which
                    opens Hue in a new window.
By default, Authentication Backend is set to
                        AllowFirstUserDjangoBackend. This makes the first
                    user who logs into Hue the Superuser and allows you to set the username and
                    password, and create other users.
You can change the Authentication Backend as per your
                    requirements from Hue configurations in Cloudera Manager.

You can run a query or browse the database that you have set up for Hue.
For more information, see the Hue documentation.
