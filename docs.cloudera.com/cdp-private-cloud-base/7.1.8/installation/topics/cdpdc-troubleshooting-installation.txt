TLS Protocol Error with OpenJDK
If you are using an older version of OpenJDK 1.8 and have enabled SSL/TLS for the Cloudera
        Manager Admin Console, you may encounter a TLS protocol error when connecting to the Admin
        Console, stating that there are no ciphers in common. This is because older versions of
        OpenJDK may not implement certain TLS ciphers, causing an inability to log into the Cloudera
        Manager Admin Console when TLS is enabled. 
Workaround: 
You can workaround this issue by doing one of the following:
Upgrade OpenJDK to a supported version of OpenJDK that is higher than version
            1.8.0_181.
If it is not possible to upgrade OpenJDK, enable less secure TLS ciphers in Cloudera
            Manager. You can do this by opening the
              /etc/default/cloudera-scm-server in a text editor and adding the
            following
            line:export CMF_OVERRIDE_TLS_CIPHERS=<cipher_list>Where
              <cipher_list> is a list of TLS cipher suites separated by
            colons. For
            example:export CMF_OVERRIDE_TLS_CIPHERS="TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256:TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA:TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384:TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA:TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256:TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA:TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256:TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA:TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA:TLS_EDH_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA:TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256:TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256:TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA:TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA:TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA"


Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-49578

Failed to start server reported by cloudera-manager-installer.bin
"Failed to start server" reported by cloudera-manager-installer.bin.
          /var/log/cloudera-scm-server/cloudera-scm-server.logcontains a message
        beginning Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
          com.mysql.jdbc.Driver...
Possible reason:
You might have SELinux enabled.
Possible solution:
Disable SELinux by running sudo setenforce 0 on the Cloudera Manager
        Server host. To disable it permanently, edit /etc/selinux/config.

Installation interrupted and installer does not restart
Possible reason:
You need to do some manual cleanup. 
Possible solution:
See Uninstalling Cloudera Manager and Managed Software. 

Cloudera Manager Server fails to start with MySQL
Cloudera Manager Server fails to start and the Server is configured to
        use a MySQL database to store information about service
        configuration.
Possible reason:
Tables might be configured with the ISAM engine. The Server does not
        start if its tables are configured with the MyISAM engine, and an error
        such as the following appears in the log file:
        Tables ... have unsupported engine type ... .  InnoDB is required.
Possible solution:
Make sure that the InnoDB engine is configured, not the MyISAM engine.
        To check what engine your tables are using, run the following command
        from the MySQL shell: mysql> show table status;
For more information, see Install and Configure MySQL for CDP.

Agents fail to connect to Server
Agents fail to connect to Server. You get an Error 113 ('No route to host') in
          /var/log/cloudera-scm-agent/cloudera-scm-agent.log.
Possible reason:
You might have SELinux or iptables enabled.
Possible solution:
Check /var/log/cloudera-scm-server/cloudera-scm-server.log on the Server
        host and /var/log/cloudera-scm-agent/cloudera-scm-agent.log on the Agent
        hosts. Disable SELinux and iptables. 

Cluster hosts do not appear
Some cluster hosts do not appear when you click Find Hosts in install or update
        wizard.
Possible reason:
You might have network connectivity problems.
Possible solution:


Make sure all cluster hosts have SSH port 22 open.
Check other common causes of loss of connectivity such as firewalls and interference
            from SELinux.



"Access denied" in install or update wizard
"Access denied" in install or update wizard during database
        configuration for Reports Manager. 
Possible reason:
Hostname mapping or permissions are not set up correctly.
Possible solution:

For hostname configuration, see Configure Network Names.
For permissions, make sure the values you enter into the wizard match those you used
          when you configured the databases. The value you enter into the wizard as the database
          hostname must match the value you entered for the hostname (if any) when you
          configured the database.For example, if you had entered the following when you created
            the
            databasegrant all on activity_monitor.* TO 'amon_user'@'myhost1.myco.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'amon_password';the
            value you enter here for the database hostname must be
            myhost1.myco.com. If you did not specify a host, or used a wildcard to
            allow access from any host, you can enter either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN),
            or localhost. For example, if you
            enteredgrant all on activity_monitor.* TO 'amon_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'amon_password';the
            value you enter for the database hostname can be either the FQDN or
              localhost.


Databases fail to start.
Reports Manager or Service Monitor databases fail to start.
Possible reason:
MySQL binlog format problem.
Possible solution:
Set binlog_format=mixed in
          /etc/my.cnf. For more information, see this MySQL bug report. See also Step 5. Install and Configure Databases. 

Cloudera services fail to start
Possible reason:
Java might not be installed or might be installed at a custom location.
Possible solution:
See Configuring a Custom Java Home Location for more information on resolving
        this issue. 

Create Hive Metastore Database Tables command fails
 The Create Hive Metastore Database Tables command fails due to
        a problem with an escape string.
Possible reason:
PostgreSQL versions 9 and higher require special configuration for Hive
        because of a backward-incompatible change in the default value of the
          standard_conforming_strings property. Versions up to
        PostgreSQL 9.0 defaulted to off, but starting with
        version 9.0 the default is on.
Possible solution:
As the administrator user, use the following command to turn
          standard_conforming_strings
        off:
ALTER DATABASE <hive_db_name> SET standard_conforming_strings = off; 


Oracle invalid identifier
 If you are using an Oracle database and the Cloudera Navigator
            Analytics > Audit > Activity tab displays "No data available" and there is an Oracle
        error about "invalid identifier" with the query containing the reference
        to dbms_crypto in the log.
Possible reason:
You have not granted execute permission to
          sys.dbms_crypto.
Possible solution:
Run GRANT EXECUTE ON sys.dbms_crypto TO
          nav;, where
          nav is the user of the Navigator
        Audit Server database.
