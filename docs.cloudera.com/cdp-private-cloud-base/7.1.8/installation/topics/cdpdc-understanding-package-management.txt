Understanding Package Management
Before you configure a custom package management solution in your environment,
    understand the concepts of package management tools and package repositories.
Package Management Tools
Packages (rpm or deb files) help ensure that
        installations complete successfully by satisfying package dependencies. When you install a
        particular package, all other required packages are installed at the same time. For example,
          hadoop-0.20-hive depends on hadoop-0.20.
Package management tools, such as yum (RHEL),
            zypper (SLES), and
          apt-get (Ubuntu) are tools that can find and install
        required packages. For example, on a RHEL compatible system, you might
        run the command yum install hadoop-0.20-hive. The
          yum utility informs you that the Hive package
        requires hadoop-0.20 and offers to install it for you.
          zypper and apt-get provide similar
        functionality.

Package Repositories
Package management tools rely on package repositories to install software and resolve any
        dependency requirements. For information on creating an internal repository, see
          Configuring a Local Package Repository.


Repository Configuration FilesInformation about package repositories is stored in configuration files, the location of     which varies according to the package management tool.Listing RepositoriesYou can list the enabled repositories by running one of the following     commands:Parent topic: Configuring Local Package and Parcel Repositories
