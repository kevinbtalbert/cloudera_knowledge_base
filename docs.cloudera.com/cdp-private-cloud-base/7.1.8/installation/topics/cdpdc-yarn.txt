Job History Server


Minimum: 1 GB
Increase memory by 1.6 GB for each 100,000 tasks kept in memory. For
                      example:5 jobs @ 100, 000 mappers + 20,000 reducers = 600,000 total tasks
                      requiring 9.6 GB of heap.See the Other Recommendations column for
                    additional tuning suggestions.

Set this value using the Java Heap Size of JobHistory Server in
                    Bytes YARN configuration property.

Minimum: 1 core





Set the
                        mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size property to a
                      total loaded task count. Using the example in the Java Heap column to the
                      left, of 650,000 total tasks, you can set it to 700,000 to allow for some
                      safety margin. This should also prevent the JobHistoryServer from hanging
                      during garbage collection, since the job count limit does not have a task
                      limit.





NodeManager
                  
Minimum: 1 GB.Configure additional heap memory for the following
                  conditions:

Large number of containers
Large shxmluffle sizes in Spark or MapReduce

Set this value using the Java Heap Size of NodeManager in
                    Bytes YARN configuration property.



Minimum: 8-16 cores
Recommended: 32-64 cores




Disks:

Minimum: 8 disks
Recommended: 12 or more disks



Networking:

Minimum: Dual 1Gbps or faster
Recommended: Single/Dual 10 Gbps or faster





ResourceManager
Minimum: 6 GBConfigure additional heap memory for the following
                    conditions:
More jobs
Larger cluster size
Number of retained finished applications (configured with the
                        yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications
                      property.
Scheduler configuration


Set this value using the Java Heap Size of ResourceManager
                    in Bytes YARN configuration property.

Minimum: 1 core



Other Settings


Set the ApplicationMaster Memory YARN configuration
                    property to 512 MB
Set the Container Memory Minimum YARN configuration
                    property to 1 GB.
