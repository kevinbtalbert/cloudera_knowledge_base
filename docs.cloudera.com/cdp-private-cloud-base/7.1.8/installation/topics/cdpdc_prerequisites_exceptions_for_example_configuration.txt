Prerequisites and exceptions for the example configuration
Review the prerequisites and exceptions before adding the example configuration to
        the sudoers file. 

As a root user, you must create the repository file on the Cloudera Manager
                    Server. For instance, as a root user you can create the
                        /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudera-manager.repo file with the
                    following content:

[cloudera-manager]
name=Cloudera Manager 7.x.0
baseurl=https://archive.cloudera.com/p/cm6/7.x.0/redhat7/yum/
gpgkey=https://archive.cloudera.com/p/cm6/7.x.0/redhat7/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-cloudera
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
autorefresh=0
type=rpm-md


To enable Auto-TLS, use the Cloudera Manager user interface:


Administration > Security > Enable Auto-TLS wizard


For information on how to generate an internal CA and corresponding
                            certificates, see Use case 1: Use CM to generate an internal CA and corresponding certificates 



Database Configuration:


 To install the postgreSQL as the Cloudera Manager Database, the root
                            user must run the following commands for the user1:

i) user1@cmsudo-1 ~]$ echo 'LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"' >> /etc/locale.conf
-bash: /etc/locale.conf file

ii) sudo su -l postgres -c "postgresql-setup initdb"



 To enable MD5 authentication, user1 must have root permission: 

 Edit pg_hba.conf , which is usually found in
                                    /var/lib/pgsql/data or
                                    /etc/postgresql/<version>/main. For more
                                information, see step 2, Enable MD5
                                authentication.




 To install Ranger on any host and configure PostgreSQL database for Ranger,
                    you need a new sudoers command list. For more information, see Configuring a PostgreSQL Database for Ranger
                        or Ranger KMS

For the KDC setup, you must manage the krb5.conf file through Cloudera Manager
                    user interface. For more information, see Enable Kerberos using the wizard

 Cloudera Manager Upgrade:

To set up the Cloudera Manager repository, user1 must have write access to
                        the repository file. For more information, see Upgrading the Cloudera Manager
                            Server


If you are setting up a KTS cluster, do the following as root user: 


You must obtain root access to install a file under “/etc/systemd/system/”
                            as a prerequisite for installing rng-tools
                            package. After installing the “rng-tools” package, user1 will require root user to run the following commands: 

i) cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/rngd.service /etc/systemd/system/ 

ii) sed -i -e 's/ExecStart=\ /sbin/rngd -f /ExecStart=\ /sbin\ /rngd -f -r \ / dev \ / urandom/'/etc/systemd/system/rngd.service




Run the rsync command to copy the Key Trustee Server keys.
