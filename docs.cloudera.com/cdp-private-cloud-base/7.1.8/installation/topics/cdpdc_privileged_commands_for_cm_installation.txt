Privileged commands for Cloudera Manager installation

When installing Cloudera Manager using a non-root user, the sudo command is required to
            run specific commands with elevated privilege. 
To restrict the sudo privilege specific commands, add the following list of commands to
            the sudoers file. You can find the sudoers file in /etc/sudoers by
            running the visudo command.
The sudoers file on the host running the Cloudera Manager Server must be modified as
            indicated in the Example configuration to add to the sudoers file. To install
            the Cloudera Manager Agent on CDP cluster hosts as a non root user, you must modify the
            sudoers file on each host. The user who is given sudo privilege must be the non-root
            user specified in the Cloudera Manager Add-Host Wizard when adding new hosts to a
            cluster.
