Deploying Atlas service
Post installation, you must plan to employ either the LDAP or Active Directory (AD)
        authentication mechanism to deploy the Atlas service in your production
        environment.
You can add LDAP or AD authentication configurations
            post-installation of Atlas. 
importantWhen you install Atlas using the Add
                        Service method in the Cloudera Manager instance, you must make
                    sure to “uncheck” Enable File Authentication
                    option.


In your Cloudera Manager instance > Select Clusters >
                        Configuration tab > On the search bar, use the key:
                        atlas.authentication.method.
The list of LDAP and AD
                    configurations are displayed.

In the search, you are allowed to select the type of Atlas installation for
                    LDAP Authentication type:


none
ldap
ad



Selecting “ad”, prompts you to use appropriate active
                    directory values to complete the Atlas authentication type.






Selecting “ldap”, prompts you to use appropriate LDAP
                    values to complete the Atlas authentication type.









You must restart the stale services.
