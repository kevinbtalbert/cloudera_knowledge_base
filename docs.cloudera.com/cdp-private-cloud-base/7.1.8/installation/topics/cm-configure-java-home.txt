Configuring a Custom Java Home Location

noteCloudera strongly recommends installing Oracle JDK at
          /usr/java/<jdk-version> and
      OpenJDK at /usr/lib/jvm, which allows Cloudera Manager to
      auto-detect and use the correct JDK version. If you install the JDK
      anywhere else, you must follow these instructions to configure Cloudera
      Manager with your chosen location. The following procedure only changes
      the JDK location for Cloudera Management Services and cluster processes
      that are launched by the Cloudera Manager agents.
important
The procedure described on this page does not affect the JDK used by
        other non-Cloudera processes, including Hadoop processes such as the
          hdfs command.

Although not recommended, the Java Development Kit (JDK), which Cloudera
      services require, may be installed at a custom location if necessary.
      These steps assume you have already installed the JDK during product
      installation or as part of an upgrade.
To modify the Cloudera Manager configuration to ensure the JDK can be
        found:
Log into the Cloudera Manager server host.
Open the following file in a text editor:
          /etc/default/cloudera-scm-server
Add the following line:
          export JAVA_HOME=path to the Java installation directory For
          example:export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib64/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0
Save the file.
Restart the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server

Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
In the main navigation bar, click the Hosts tab. If you are
          configuring the JDK location on a specific host only, click the link
          for that host.
Click the Configuration tab.
Select
              Category > Advanced. 
Set the Java Home Directory property to the custom
          location.
Click Save Changes.
Restart all services.
