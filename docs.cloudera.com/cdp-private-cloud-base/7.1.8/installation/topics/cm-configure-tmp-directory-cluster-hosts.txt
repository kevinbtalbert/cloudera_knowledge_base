Configuring /tmp directory for cluster hosts
You must ensure that the /tmp directory is writable so that Cloudera Manager can use
        the directory for installing hosts and for generating certificates and credential
        scripts.

By default, the /tmp directory is writable. If you have changed
                the default permissions for the /tmp directory, then you must
                reset the permissions so that the /tmp directory is writable
                (having the drwxrwxrwt permission). Cloudera Manager uses the
                    /tmp directory when you install hosts using the Cloudera
                Manager server and for generating certificates and credential scripts. Cloudera
                Managerâ€™s single file installer also uses the /tmp
                directory.


SSH into the host system as a root user.

Run the following command to set write access permission to the /tmp
                    directory:

chmod 1777 /tmp


Verify the permission of the /tmp directory by running the list command as
                    follows:

ls -la

The permissions of the /tmp directory should show
                        drwxrwxrwt.


Your /tmp directory is now writable on your cluster hosts.

Repeat this task on every host in your cluster.
