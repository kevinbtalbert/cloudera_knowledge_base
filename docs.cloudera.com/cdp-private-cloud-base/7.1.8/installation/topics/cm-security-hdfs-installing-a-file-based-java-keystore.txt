Installing a Java Keystore KMS
The tasks and steps for installing a Java KeyStore Ranger Key Management System (KMS)
        service to the cluster for your HDFS data-at-rest encryption.

Describes how to install a file-based password-protected Java KeyStore KMS service to
                your cluster. The Java KeyStore KMS service uses a password-protected Java KeyStore
                for cryptographic key management. This option does not include HA.
warningThe file-based Java KeyStore root of trust is
                insufficient to provide the security, scalability, and manageability required by
                most production systems. Therefore, Cloudera strongly recommends using the Cloudera
                Ranger KMS backed with a Key Trustee Server and HA option as the root of trust for
                production environments. 
The following image shows the Set up HDFS Data At Rest
                    Encryption page. When you select your encryption keys root of trust
                option, a list of tasks that you must do to enable encryption to-and-from HDFS is
                displayed. 
You complete each task independently from the other tasks. Where, the taskâ€™s
                    Status column indicates whether the step has been
                completed and the Notes column provides additional context
                for the task. If your Cloudera Manager user account does not have sufficient
                privileges to complete a task, the Notes column indicates the
                privileges that are required. 
When selected, each task contains links to wizards or documentation that help you
                complete the task. If a task is unavailable, due to insufficient privileges or an
                incomplete prerequisite step, no links are present and the
                    Notes column displays the reason. 


The Wizard steps are as follows and must be completed in the order listed:
Enable KerberosnoteThe instructions assume that you
                            have enabled Kerberos. If this is not the case, click the link
                            associated with the uncompleted task and follow the Wizard's
                            instructions.
Enable TLS/SSLnoteThe instructions assume that you
                            have enabled TLS. If this is not the case, click the link associated
                            with the uncompleted task and follow the Wizard's
                        instructions.

Verify the following:
The cluster in which Cloudera Manager and the Cloudera Ranger service is
                    installed, is up and running.
Communication through secure connections is enabled with the Transport Layer
                    Security (TLS) protocol and your network authentication is enabled with the
                    Kerberos protocol. 


In a supported web browser on the cluster in which the Ranger service is
                    installed, log in to Cloudera Manager as a user with full administrative
                    privileges.
