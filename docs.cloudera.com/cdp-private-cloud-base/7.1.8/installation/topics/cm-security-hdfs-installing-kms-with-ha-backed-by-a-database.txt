Installing Ranger KMS backed by a Database and HA
The tasks and steps for installing the Ranger Key Management System (KMS) with High
        Availability (HA) service that uses a database as the backing key store.

This task uses the Set up HDFS Data At Rest Encryption wizard
                to install a Ranger KMS with HA service that uses a database as the backing key
                store.
The following image shows the Set up HDFS Data At Rest
                    Encryption page. When you select your encryption keys root of trust
                option, a list of tasks that you must do to enable encryption to-and-from HDFS is
                displayed. 
You complete each task independently from the other tasks. Where, the taskâ€™s
                    Status column indicates whether the step has been
                completed and the Notes column provides additional context
                for the task. If your Cloudera Manager user account does not have sufficient
                privileges to complete a task, the Notes column indicates the
                privileges that are required. 
When selected, each task contains links to wizards or documentation that help you
                complete the task. If a task is unavailable, due to insufficient privileges or an
                incomplete prerequisite step, no links are present and the
                    Notes column displays the reason. 


noteIt is assumed that you have already created a database on a
                server that does not contain the Cloudera Ranger service. For more information on
                    how to create a database for Ranger KMS, see the Related
                        Information links below.
The Wizard steps are as follows and must be completed in the order listed:
