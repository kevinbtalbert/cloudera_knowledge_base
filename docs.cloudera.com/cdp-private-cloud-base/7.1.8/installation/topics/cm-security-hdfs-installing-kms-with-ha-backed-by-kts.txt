Installing Ranger KMS backed with a Key Trustee Server and HA
The tasks and steps for installing the Ranger Key Management System (KMS) with High
    Availability (HA) that uses Key Trustee Server (KTS) as the backing key store.

This task uses the Set up HDFS Data At Rest Encryption wizard to
        install a Ranger KMS with HA that uses KTS as the backing key store.
The following image shows the Set up HDFS Data At Rest Encryption
        page. When you select your encryption keys root of trust option, a list of tasks that you
        must do to enable encryption to-and-from HDFS is displayed. 
You complete each task independently from the other tasks. Where, the taskâ€™s
          Status column indicates whether the step has been completed and the
          Notes column provides additional context for the task. If your
        Cloudera Manager user account does not have sufficient privileges to complete a task, the
          Notes column indicates the privileges that are required. 
When selected, each task contains links to wizards or documentation that help you complete
        the task. If a task is unavailable, due to insufficient privileges or an incomplete
        prerequisite step, no links are present and the Notes column displays
        the reason.

                    service is to be installed.

Click Continue.
The Setup Entropy page opens, which displays a list of commands that determine
                    if the available entropy on the Key Trustee Server service is low and provides
                    instructions and commands for installing an entropy generator that increases the
                    entropy for cryptographic operations.

In a terminal, determine the amount of available entropy on your target
                    machines, by entering the following:

ssh root@Active_FQDN
cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail

Where, Active_FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of
                        the Active host. 

If the result is below 500, consider installing an entropy generator,
                    such as the rng-tools utilities. Before proceeding,
                    consult the security policies, procedures, and practices in your organization.
                

If you require the rng-tools utilities, do the
                    following:


To install the rng-tools utility, in a terminal,
                            enter one of the following:

                    which displays a list of instructions and commands for initializing and
                    generating a private key that will be used by both the Active and Passive Key
                    Trustee Server service.noteFor production environments,
                        Cloudera recommends transferring the private key using offline media, such
                        as a removable USB drive. For environments where maximum security is not
                        required, such as testing or development environments, you can copy the
                        private key over the network using the rsync command.

In a terminal, initialize the Active Key Trustee Server
                    and generate the private key, by entering the following commands:

ssh root@Active_FQDN
ktadmin init
Where, Active_FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of
                        the Active host. 


Copy the Active Key Trustee Server private key to the Passive Key Trustee
                    Server by doing one of the following: 


For production environments, Cloudera recommends transferring the
                            private key using offline media, such as a removable USB drive.

The Set up HDFS Data At Rest Encryption wizard's installation
        step adds the Ranger KMS with Key Trustee Server service.

Describes the steps that add the Ranger KMS with KTS service, which enables the HDFS
                encryption to use the Key Trustee Server for cryptographic key management.


From the Step column in the Set up HDFS Data at Rest
                    Encryption for Cluster page, click Add Ranger KMS with Key Trustee
                        Server Service.
The Add Ranger KMS with Key Trustee Server Service Wizard opens.

In the Getting Started page, verify that the hostnames are the required Key
                    Trustee Server service's Active and
                        Passive hosts that you previously set up. By default,
                    the Key Trustee Server fields are populated by the
                    Wizard. 
If you have an existing Key Trustee Server pair outside of the Cloudera
                    Manager's control, in the External Key Trustee Server
                    field, enter the fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) of the
                        Active and Passive
                    hosts.

Click Continue.
The Assign Roles page opens.

In the Assign Roles page, verify that the hostname is the required server for
                    the Ranger KMS with KTS service role by clicking inside the Ranger
                        KMS Server with KTS field. By default, this field is populated
                    by the Wizard.
The Hosts Selected page opens.

In the Hosts Selected page, scroll down and from the
                        Hostname column, locate the hostname that was
                    selected by the Wizard. Notice in the Added Roles column,
                    the Ranger KMS with Key Trustee Server Ranger KMS Server with KTS (RK...) role
                    icon. This role is added during the installation.

Do one of the following:


If the pre-selected host is correct, confirm the Wizard's choice by
                            clicking OK.
If the pre-selected host is incorrect, deselect the check box of the
                            Wizard's choice, select the hostname check box of the required server,
                            and then click OK.noteFor
                                production environments, Cloudera recommends installing a Ranger KMS
                                with KTS service on at least two dedicated hosts for high
                                availability. These hosts should not run other CDP cluster services.
                                If you proceed with installing Ranger KMS with KTS on only one host,
                                you can enable high availability later. 



Back in the Assign Roles page, click Continue.
The Setup Entropy page opens, which displays a list of commands that determine
                    if the available entropy on the Key Trustee Server service is low and provides
                    instructions and commands for installing an entropy generator that increases the
                    entropy for cryptographic operations.

In a terminal, determine the amount of available entropy on your target
                    machines, by entering the following:

ssh root@Active_FQDN
cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail

Where, Active_FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of
                        the Active host. 

If the result is below 500, consider installing an entropy generator,
                    such as the rng-tools utilities. Before proceeding,
                    consult the security policies, procedures, and practices in your organization.
                

If you require the rng-tools utilities, do the
                    following:


To install the rng-tools utility, in a terminal,
                            enter one of the following:
