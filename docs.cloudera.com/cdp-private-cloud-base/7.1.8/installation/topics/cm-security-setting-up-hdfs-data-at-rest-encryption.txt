Setting Up Data at Rest Encryption for HDFS
This section describes how to enable end-to-end data encryption to-and-from HDFS. For
    optimal performance, High Availability (HA) is also provided.
importantBefore setting up HDFS Data at Rest encryption,
      Cloudera highly recommends reading the Encrypting Data at Rest content, which provides more
      information about HDFS encryption, the supported architecture, planning, encryption
      requirements, and more. If you require a third-party HSM for key storage, Cloudera also
        recommends reading the Integrating Components for Encrypting Data at Rest content.

        below.
Depending on your encryption key root trustee requirements, you can enable HDFS encryption
      with one of the following options:

Ranger Key Management Service backed by Key Trustee Server, which
        sources the encryption zone keys from a backing Ranger Key Trustee Server and includes
        HA.
Ranger Key Management Service backed by Database, which sources the
        encryption zone keys from a backing Database and includes HA.
A file-based password protected Java Keystore, which adds the Java
        KeyStore KMS service to the cluster. The Java KeyStore KMS service uses a password-protected
        Java KeyStore for cryptographic key management. This option does not include HA.warning
Cloudera strongly recommends NOT using this option for production environments. The
            file-based Java KeyStore root of trust is insufficient to provide the security,
            scalability, and manageability required by most production systems. More specifically,
            the Java KeyStore KMS does not provide: 

Scalability. You are limited to having only one Key Management System (KMS), which
              can result in bottlenecks.
High Availability (HA).
Recoverability. If you lose the node where the Java KeyStore is stored, you can lose
              access to all the encrypted data
