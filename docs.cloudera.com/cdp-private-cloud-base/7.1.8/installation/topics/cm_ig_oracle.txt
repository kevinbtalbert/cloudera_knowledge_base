Install and Configure Oracle Database for CDP
You can install an Oracle database for use with Cloudera Manager
    and other components that require a database. 
To use an Oracle database, follow these procedures. For information on
      compatible versions of the Oracle database, see Database Requirements.

Install and Configure Databases
Collecting Oracle Database Information

To configure Cloudera Manager to work with an Oracle database, get the
        following information from your Oracle DBA:

Hostname - The DNS name or the IP address of the host where the
          Oracle database is installed.
SID - The name of the schema that will store Cloudera Manager
          information. 
Username - A username for each schema that is storing information.
          You could have four unique usernames for the four schema.
Password - A password corresponding to each username.




Configuring the Oracle Server

noteIf you are making changes to an existing database, make sure to stop
        any services that use the database before continuing.
Adjusting Oracle Settings to Accommodate Larger
          Clusters
Cloudera Management services require high write throughput. Depending
          on the size of your deployments, your DBA may need to modify Oracle
          settings for monitoring services. These guidelines are for larger
          clusters and do not apply to the Cloudera Manager configuration
          database and to smaller clusters. Many factors help determine whether
          you need to change your database settings, but in most cases, if your
          cluster has more than 100 hosts, you should consider making the
          following changes:
Enable direct and asynchronous I/O by setting the
                FILESYSTEMIO_OPTIONS parameter to
                SETALL.
Increase the RAM available to Oracle by changing the
                MEMORY_TARGET parameter. The amount of memory
              to assign depends on the size of the Hadoop cluster.
Create more redo log groups and spread the redo log members
              across separate disks or logical unit numbers.
Increase the size of redo log members to be at least 1 GB.


Reserving Ports for HiveServer 2
HiveServer2 uses port 10000 by default, but Oracle database changes
          the local port range. This can cause HiveServer2 to fail to start. 
Manually reserve the default port for HiveServer2. For example, the
          following command reserves port 10000 and inserts a comment indicating
          the reason:
echo << EOF > /etc/sysctl.cnf
# HS2 uses port 10000
net.ipv4.ip_local_reserved_ports = 10000
EOF
sysctl -q -w net.ipv4.ip_local_reserved_ports=10000

Modifying the Maximum Number of Oracle Connections
Work with your Oracle database administrator to ensure appropriate
          values are applied for your Oracle database settings. You must
          determine the number of connections, transactions, and sessions to be
          allowed.
Allow 100 maximum connections for each service that requires a database and then add 50
          extra connections. For example, for two services, set the maximum connections to 250. If
          you have four services that require a database on one host (the databases for Cloudera
          Manager Server, Hue, Reports Manager, and Hive metastore), set the maximum connections to
          450.
From the maximum number of connections, you can determine the number
          of anticipated sessions using the following formula:
sessions = (1.1 * maximum_connections) + 5
For example, if a host has a database for two services, anticipate
          250 maximum connections. If you anticipate a maximum of 250
          connections, plan for 280 sessions.
Once you know the number of sessions, you can determine the number of
          anticipated transactions using the following formula:
transactions = 1.1 * sessions
Continuing with the previous example, if you anticipate 280 sessions,
          you can plan for 308 transactions.
Work with your Oracle database administrator to apply these derived
          values to your system.
Using the sample values above, Oracle attributes would be set as
          follows:
alter system set processes=250;
alter system set transactions=308;
alter system set sessions=280;

Ensuring Your Oracle Database Supports UTF8
The database you use must support UTF8 character set encoding. You
          can implement UTF8 character set encoding in Oracle databases by using
          the dbca utility. In this case, you can use the
            characterSet AL32UTF8 option to specify proper
          encoding. Consult your DBA to ensure UTF8 encoding is properly
          configured.




Installing the Oracle JDBC Connector

You must install the JDBC connector on the Cloudera Manager Server host
        and any other hosts that use a database.
Cloudera recommends that you assign all roles that require a database on the same host and
        install the connector on that host. Locating all such roles on the same host is recommended
        but not required. If you install a role, such as Reports Manager, on one host and other
        roles on a separate host, you would install the JDBC connector on each host running roles
        that access the database.

Download the Oracle JDBC Driver from the Oracle website. For
          example, the version 6 JAR file is named
            ojdbc6.jar.For more information about supported
            Java versions, see Java Requirements.To
            download the JDBC driver, visit the Oracle JDBC and UCP
              Downloads page, and click on the link for your Oracle
            Database version. Download the ojdbc6.jar file (or
              ojdbc8.jar, for Oracle Database 12.2).
Copy the Oracle JDBC JAR file to
            /usr/share/java/oracle-connector-java.jar. The
          Cloudera Manager databases and the Hive Mestastore database use this
          shared file. For
          example:sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/java
sudo cp /tmp/ojdbc8-12.2.0.1.jar /usr/share/java/oracle-connector-java.jar
sudo chmod 644 /usr/share/java/oracle-connector-java.jar




Creating Databases for Cloudera
      Software

Create schema and user accounts for components that require databases: 

Cloudera Manager Server
Cloudera Management Service roles:
Reports Manager

Data Analytics Studio (DAS) Supported with PostgreSQL only.
Hue
Each Hive metastore
Oozie
Data Analytics Studio
Schema Registry
Streams Messaging Manager 

You can create the Oracle database, schema and users on the host where
        the Cloudera Manager Server will run, or on any other hosts in the
        cluster. For performance reasons, you should install each database on
        the host on which the service runs, as determined by the roles you
        assign during installation or upgrade. In larger deployments or in cases
        where database administrators are managing the databases the services
        use, you can separate databases from services, but use caution.
The databases must be configured to support UTF-8 character set
        encoding.
Record the values you enter for database names, usernames, and
        passwords. The Cloudera Manager installation wizard requires this
        information to correctly connect to these databases.noteIf you are
          deploying Oracle RAC (for high availability),  enter the database name
          using the following format:
          (DESCRIPTION=(LOAD_BALANCE=off)(FAILOVER=on)(CONNECT_TIMEOUT=5)(TRANSPORT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=3)(RETRY_COUNT=3)(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=[***hostname***])(PORT=[***port***]))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=[***service_name***])))

Log into the Oracle client:
          sqlplus system@localhostEnter password: ******
Create a user and schema for each service you are using from the below
            table:create user <user> identified by <password> default tablespace <tablespace>;
grant CREATE SESSION to <user>;
grant CREATE TABLE to <user>;
grant CREATE SEQUENCE to <user>;You can use any
            value you want for <schema>, <user>, and
              <password>. The following examples are the default names
            provided in the Cloudera Manager configuration settings, but you are not required to use
            them:Table 1. Databases for Cloudera Software
