Installing Postgres JDBC Driver
You must install the required Postgres JDBC driver.
 Download, extract, and copy the JDBC driver, renamed, to
   /usr/share/java/. If the target directory does not yet exist,
   create it. 
Installing the Postgres JDBC Driver

Install the PostgreSQL JDBC driver. Download the JDBC driver from the official PostgreSQL
      JDBC Driver website: https://jdbc.postgresql.org/
Alternatively, if you would like to use the PostgreSQL JDBC driver version shipped with the
      OS repositories, use the following with a driver version compatible with the PostgreSQL Server
      version:yum install postgresql-jdbc<compatible_version>
Rename the Postgres JDBC driver .jar file to
     postgresql-connector-java.jarand copy it to the
     /usr/share/java directory. The following copy command can be used if
     the Postgres JDBC driver .jar file is installed from the OS
     repositories: cp /usr/share/java/postgresql-jdbc.jar /usr/share/java/postgresql-connector-java.jar
Confirm that the .jar file is in the Java share directory:
      ls /usr/share/java/
Change the access mode of the .jar file to 644: chmod 644 /usr/share/java/postgresql-connector-java.jar
