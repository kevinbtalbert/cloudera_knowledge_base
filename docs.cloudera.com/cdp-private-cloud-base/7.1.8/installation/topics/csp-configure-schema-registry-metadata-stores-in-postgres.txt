Configure PostgreSQL for
      Streaming Components
If you are installing Schema Registry or Streams Messaging Manager (SMM), you must
      configure the database to store metadata. 
After you install PostgreSQL, configure the database to
         store: 
Schema Registry data such as the schemas and their metadata, all the versions and
               branches.
SMM data such as Kafka metadata, stores metrics, and alert definitions. 
importantFor the Schema Registry database, you must set collation to be
            case sensitive.. Log in to Postgres:  


sudo su postgres
psql


 For the Schema Registry metadata store, create a database called
                  registry with the password registry: 


create database registry;
CREATE USER registry WITH PASSWORD 'registry';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "registry" to registry;



 For the SMM metadata store, create a database called
                  streamsmsgmgr with the password
                  streamsmsgmgr: 


create database streamsmsgmgr;
CREATE USER streamsmsgmgr WITH PASSWORD 'streamsmsgmgr';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "streamsmsgmgr" to streamsmsgmgr;


If you cannot grant all privileges, grant the following privileges that SMM and
               Schema Registry require at a minimum: 
CREATE/ALTER/DROP TABLE
CREATE/ALTER/DROP INDEX
CREATE/ALTER/DROP SEQUENCE
CREATE/ALTER/DROP PROCEDURE
For example:
                  grant create session to streamsmsgmgr;
grant create table to streamsmsgmgr;
grant create sequence to streamsmsgmgr;
