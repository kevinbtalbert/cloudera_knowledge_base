Configuring the BI tool
After you download an ODBC or JDBC driver and give it to your client, you need to
        provide the information that the BI tool requires to connect to Hive in CDP.
 You have downloaded the JDBC or ODBC driver. 

 Depending on the type of driver you obtain, proceed as follows: 

ODBC driver: follow instructions on the ODBC driver download site, and skip
                        the rest of the steps in this procedure.
JDBC driver: add the driver to the classpath of your JDBC client. For
                        example, check the client documentation about where to put the
                        driver.

In Cloudera Manager (CM), click Clusters > Hive on Tez to go to the Hive on Tez service page.

From the Hive on Tez service page, click Actions and
                    select Download Client Configuration. 






Unpack hive_on_tez-clientconfig.zip, open the
                        beeline-site.xml file, and copy the value of
                        beeline.hs2.jdbc.url.hive_on_tez. This value is the JDBC
                    URL.
 For example
                    jdbc:hive2://my_hiveserver.com:2181/;serviceDiscoveryMode=zooKeeper; \
zooKeeperNamespace=hiveserver2


In the BI tool, configure the JDBC connection using the JDBC URL and driver
                    class name, com.cloudera.hive.jdbc.HS2Driver.
