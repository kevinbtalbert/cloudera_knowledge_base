Kerberos configurations for HWC
You learn how to set up HWC for Kerberos, or not. You set properties and values
  depending on the JDBC_CLUSTER or JDBC_CLIENT option you configure.
In CDP Private Cloud Base, you need to configure HWC options in
    configuration/spark-defaults.conf, depending on the read option you select.
   Alternatively, you can set the properties using the spark-submit/spark-shell
    --conf option. 
Secured cluster configuration
For Spark applications on a kerberized Yarn cluster, set the following property:
    spark.sql.hive.hiveserver2.jdbc.url.principal. This property must be
    equal to hive.server2.authentication.kerberos.principal. 
On a kerberized YARN cluster, set the following property: 
JDBC_CLUSTER option in a secured cluster
Property: spark.security.credentials.hiveserver2.enabled
Value: true
Comment: true by default 

JDBC_CLIENT option in a secured cluster
Property: spark.security.credentials.hiveserver2.enabled
Value: false



Unsecured cluster configuration
In an unsecured cluster, set the following property:

Property: spark.security.credentials.hiveserver2.enabled
Value: false
