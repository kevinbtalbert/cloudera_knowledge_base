HWC integration pyspark, sparklyr, and Zeppelin



Submitting a Python appA step-by-step procedure shows you how to submit a Python app based on the         HiveWarehouseConnector library by submitting an application, and then adding a Python         package.Reading and writing Hive tables in RThe Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC) supports reads and writes to Apache Hive managed         ACID tables in R. Cloudera provides an R package SparklyrHWC that includes all HWC methods,         such as hive.sql, and a spark_write_table method to write to managed tables. The native         sparklyr spark_write_table method supports writes to external tables only.Livy interpreter configurationYou can use the Hive Warehouse Connector in Zeppelin notebooks with the Livy     interpreter by modifying or adding properties to your livy interpreter     settings. The Livy interpreter accesses processing engines and data sources from the Zeppelin     UI.Reading and writing Hive tables in ZeppelinYou can read and write Hive ACID tables from a Spark application using Zeppelin, a         browser-based GUI for interactive data exploration, modeling, and visualization.
