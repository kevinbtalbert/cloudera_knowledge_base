HWC limitations
You need to be aware of HWC limitations, including Kerberos properties that are not
  allowed, and unsupported operations and connections. These limitations are in addition to Direct
  Reader mode, JDBC mode, Secure access mode, and HWC and DataFrames API limitations.
General HWC limitations are:

The spark and livy thrift servers are not supported. 
The Hive Union types are not supported.

Workaround for using the Hive Warehouse Connector with Oozie Spark action
Hive and Spark use different Thrift versions and are incompatible with each other. Upgrading
    Thrift in Hive is complicated and may not be resolved in the near future. Therefore, Thrift
    packages are shaded inside the HWC JAR to make Hive Warehouse Connector work with Spark and
    Oozie Spark action. See the workaround in Cloudera Oozie documentation.

Secured cluster configurations
Set the following configurations in a secured cluster:


--conf "spark.security.credentials.hiveserver2.enabled=true"


--conf "spark.sql.hive.hiveserver2.jdbc.url.principal=hive/_HOST@ROOT.HWX.SITE"
The jdbc url must not contain the jdbc url principal and must be passed as shown here.
