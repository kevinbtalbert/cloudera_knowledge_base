Configuring caching for secure access mode
You can enable or disable caching for the Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC) secure
        access mode to have finer control over read queries and ensure that the content updated
        outside of a Spark session is considered during reads. Caching is enabled by default because
        queries that run with caching enabled tend to run faster.
You must ensure that you are using  the HWC secure access mode for reads:
                spark.datasource.hive.warehouse.read.mode=secure_access

Caching is enabled by default, however, you can choose to disable caching by
                    setting the spark.hadoop.secure.access.cache.disable property
                    to true either at a global-level, session-level, or at a
                    runtime-level when running a query. Queries that run with caching disabled tend
                    to run slower.

Global-level — Specify the property in the
                            spark-defaults.conf file.
Session-level — Specify the property using the --conf
                        option in
                        spark-submit:.bin/spark-submit \
--conf "spark.hadoop.secure.access.cache.disable=true"
Runtime-level — Specify the property just before running your
                            queries:scala> spark.conf.set("spark.hadoop.secure.access.cache.disable","true")
scala> hive.sql("select * from anytable").shownoteThe value specified for the configuration at a
                            runtime-level is valid for all subsequent queries until it is
                            modified.importantYou may
                            encounter issues while setting the property at a runtime-level due to a
                            known issue. See the Release Notes for more information.

The order of preference for configuration is as follows:
Property passed at a run-time level
Property passed at a Spark session-level
Property set in the spark-defaults.conf file
