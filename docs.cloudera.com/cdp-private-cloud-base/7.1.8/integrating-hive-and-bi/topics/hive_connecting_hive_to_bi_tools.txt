Connecting Hive to BI tools
         using a JDBC/ODBC driver

To query, analyze, and visualize data stored in CDP, you use drivers provided by
      Cloudera to connect Apache Hive to Business Intelligence (BI) tools.
 How you connect to Hive depends on a number of factors: the location of Hive inside
         or outside the cluster, the HiveServer deployment, the type of transport, transport-layer
         security, and authentication. HiveServer is the server interface that enables remote
         clients to run queries against Hive and retrieve the results using a JDBC or ODBC
         connection.
         


Choose a Hive authorization model.
Configure authenticated users for querying Hive through JDBC or ODBC driver. For
               example, set up a Ranger
               policy. 



Getting the JDBC driver for connecting to CDP Private Cloud BaseYou learn how to download the Cloudera Hive and Impala JDBC drivers to give clients       outside the cluster access to your SQL engines.Getting the ODBC driver for connecting to CDP Private Cloud BaseYou learn how to download the Cloudera ODBC drivers for Hive and Impala.Configuring the BI toolAfter you download an ODBC or JDBC driver and give it to your client, you need to         provide the information that the BI tool requires to connect to Hive in CDP.Specify the JDBC connection stringYou construct a JDBC URL to connect Hive to a BI tool.JDBC connection string syntaxThe JDBC connection string for connecting to a remote Hive client requires a host,       port, and Hive database name. You can optionally specify a transport type and       authentication.
