Setting consumer and producer table properties
You can use Kafka consumer and producer properties in the TBLPROPERTIES clause of a
        Hive query. By prefixing the key with kafka.consumer or
            kafka.producer, you can set the table properties.

For example, if you want to inject 5000 poll records into the Kafka consumer,
                    use the following syntax. 

ALTER TABLE kafka_table SET TBLPROPERTIES ("kafka.consumer.max.poll.records"="5000");
