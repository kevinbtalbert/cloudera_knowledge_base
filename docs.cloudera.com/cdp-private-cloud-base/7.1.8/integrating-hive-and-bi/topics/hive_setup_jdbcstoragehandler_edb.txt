Setting up JdbcStorageHandler for Postgres
If you use Enterprise PostgreSQL as the backend HMS database, you need to put the
        JdbcStorageHandler JAR in a central place.

The Postgres Enterprise server comes with its own JDBC driver. The driver file is
                installed in the Hive lib directory. When you run a query as a YARN application,
                the Class not found exception is thrown on worker nodes. The YARN container cannot
                include the jar file in the classpath unless you place the JAR in a central
                location. 
Place the JAR in aux jars or provide the path to aux jars.


In CDP Private Cloud Base, click Cloudera Manager > Clusters and select the Hive service, for example, HIVE.

Click
                Configuration and search for Hive
                Auxiliary JARs Directory.

Specify a directory value for the Hive Aux JARs property if
                necessary, or make a note of the path.

Upload the JAR to the specified directory on all HiveServer
               instances.
