Using HWC for streaming
When using HiveStreaming to write a DataFrame to Apache Hive or an Apache Spark
        Stream to Hive, you need to know how to escape any commas in the stream because the Hive
        Warehouse Connector uses the commas as the field delimiter.

Change the value of the default delimiter property
                        escape.delim to a backslash that the Hive Warehouse
                    Connector uses to write streams to mytable.
ALTER TABLE mytable SET TBLPROPERTIES ('escape.delim' =
                        '\\');
