      Processors and Controller Services
Learn about the NiFi Processors and Controller Services that facilitate converting
      events from one file format to another.
The RecordReader and RecordWriter Processors and Controller Services allow you to convert
         events from one file format (JSON, XML, CSV, Avro) to another (JSON, XML, CSV, Avro). These
