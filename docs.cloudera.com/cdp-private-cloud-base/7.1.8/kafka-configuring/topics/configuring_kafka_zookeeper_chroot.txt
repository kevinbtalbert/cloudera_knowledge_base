Configuring Kafka ZooKeeper chroot
By default, the /kafka path is used in ZooKeeper to store Kafka
        related metadata. This path can be changed by configuring the ZooKeeper Root Kafka property. 

Complete the following steps to change the Kafka ZooKeeper chroot on an already
                existing service. You can also configure the ZooKeeper Root
                property when adding a new Kafka service to a cluster. The property can be
                configured on the Review Changes page when using the
                    Add a Service wizard.
importantConfiguring the Kafka ZooKeeper chroot must
                be done during broker setup, before the broker is started for the first time. If the
                property is changed on an already running broker, metadata stored in the previously
                configured paths will not be available to Kafka once Kafka is restarted. This can
                lead to potential data loss.


Select the Kafka service.

Go to Configuration and find the ZooKeeper
                        Root property.

Add the path to use as a chroot environment for the Kafka cluster.
Cloudera recommends that you use /kafka.

Enter a Reason for change and click Save
                        Changes.

Restart the Kafka service.

The Kafka ZooKeeper chroot is configured. Kafka uses the configured path to store
            its metadata in ZooKeeper.
