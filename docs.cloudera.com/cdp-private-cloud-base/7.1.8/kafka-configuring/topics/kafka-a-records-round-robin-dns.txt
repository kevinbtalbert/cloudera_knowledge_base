A records and round robin DNS
Learn about A records and round robin DNS.
A DNS A record is an entry that holds a hostname and the corresponding IP address. You can have
      multiple A records for different IP addresses using the same hostname as follows (the brokers
      also have their own FQDNs):
; PRIMARY CLUSTER
first.primary.kafka.fqdn.          IN  A       1.2.3.4
second.primary.kafka.fqdn.         IN  A       4.5.6.7
third.primary.kafka.fqdn.          IN  A       6.7.8.9

; DNS alias
primary.kafka.cluster.hostname.    IN  A       1.2.3.4
primary.kafka.cluster.hostname.    IN  A       4.5.6.7
primary.kafka.cluster.hostname.    IN  A       6.7.8.9

If you try to resolve primary.kafka.cluster.hostname multiple times with any
   tools (nslookup, dig), you will get different results each time. This is called round robin load
   balancing, which is used by the DNS server automatically.
The /etc/hosts file holds the IP address and hostname mappings (similar to A
      records in DNS servers), but it is not capable of balancing. You always get the same IP if you
      try to resolve the same hostname.
In production environments, a low TTL might be used for DNS records for the clients to detect
   changes as early as possible.
