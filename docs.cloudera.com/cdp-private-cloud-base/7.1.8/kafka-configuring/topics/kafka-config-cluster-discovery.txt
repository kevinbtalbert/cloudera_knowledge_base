Cluster discovery with multiple Apache Kafka clusters
When you have multiple Kafka clusters for load balancing or failover purposes, a client
  can find a suitable cluster either using a DNS server or using a load balancer. 
A common architectural pattern for Kafka is to have redundant Kafka clusters across multiple
   data centers so that applications can either load balance or fail over to the remote data center
   in case the local one becomes unavailable. Finding a suitable cluster by the client is called
   cluster discovery. If you connect to a cluster, you do not need all the brokers, one broker is
   enough. (However, to avoid a single point of failure, it is better to have multiple brokers.)
   This means that your discovery service should provide at least one active broker. The client gets
   metadata of all the cluster members after connecting to the broker it got from the
   service/mechanism. Getting brokers from the discovery service is only useful for the bootstrap
   phase of the connection. The client must connect to all the brokers directly to operate
   properly.
The two options for cluster discovery in case of multiple Apache Kafka clusters are using DNS
   records or load balancers. Cluster discovery using DNS records is the simpler solution.

Cluster discovery using DNS recordsLearn about using a DNS server, which is the simplest cluster discovery   method.Cluster discovery using load balancersIn case of more complex Kafka cluster setups, you might need a cluster discovery   solution more sophisticated than a DNS server. In such cases, you should consider using a load   balancer.
