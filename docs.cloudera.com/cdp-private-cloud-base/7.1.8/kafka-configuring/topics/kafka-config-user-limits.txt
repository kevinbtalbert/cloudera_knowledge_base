Setting user limits for Kafka
Learn more about Kafka User limits and how to monitor them.
Kafka opens many files at the same time. The default setting of 1024 for the maximum number
      of open files on most Unix-like systems is insufficient. Any significant load can result in
      failures and cause error messages such as java.io.IOException...(Too many open
        files) to be logged in the Kafka or HDFS log files. You might also notice
      errors such as
      this:ERROR Error in acceptor (kafka.network.Acceptor)
java.io.IOException: Too many open files
Cloudera recommends setting the value to a relatively high starting point, such as
      32,768.
You can monitor the number of file descriptors in use on the Kafka Broker dashboard. In
      Cloudera Manager:
Go to the Kafka service.
Select a Kafka Broker.
Open Charts Library > Process Resources and scroll down to the File Descriptors chart.
