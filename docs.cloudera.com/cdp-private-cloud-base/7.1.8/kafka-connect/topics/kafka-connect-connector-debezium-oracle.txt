Setting up the Debezium Oracle Source connector
Learn about the CDP specific setup steps required before you can deploy the Debezium
    Oracle Source connector.

In CDP, before deploying an instance of the Debezium Oracle Source connector, you must
        download and deploy the Oracle JDBC driver on all Kafka Connect hosts. Otherwise, you will
        not be able to deploy the connector. The following list of steps walks you through this
        process. 
For more information regarding how the Debezium Oracle Source connector works as well as
        its configuration and properties, see the Debezium Connector for Oracle in the
        Debezium documentation.
noteIn addition to the following configuration steps, appropriately configuring your Oracle
        server is also required. Ensure that you review the Setting up Oracle in the
        Debezium documentation and complete all setup tasks either before or after completing the
        following steps.

Download the Oracle JDBC driver.The JDBC driver can be downloaded from
            Maven Central. Cloudera recommends that you use version 12.2.0.1, 19.8.0.0,
          or 21.1.0.0. Copy and rename the driver to the location specified in the JDBC Driver Jars Path
          For Debezium Kafka property. The default location is /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc. The JDBC
          driver must be renamed to oracle-connector-java.jar. For example: 
cp ./ojdbc8-[***VERSION***].jar /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc/oracle-connector-java.jar
Set correct file permissions. For example: 
chmod 644 /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc/oracle-connector-java.jar

The Oracle JDBC driver is deployed on all Kafka Connect hosts. Deploying an instance
      of the Debezium Oracle Source connector in your cluster is now possible.
Deploy an instance of the Debezium Oracle Source connector. Additionally, review
        Debezium Connector for Oracle in the Debezium documentation to learn more about
      the connector and its features.
