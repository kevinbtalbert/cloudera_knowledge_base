Learn more about the HDFS Sink connector.
The HDFS Sink connector can be used to transfer data from Kafka topics to files on HDFS
      clusters. Each partition of every topic results in a collection of files named in the
      following
      pattern:{topic name}_{partition number}_{end_offset}.{file extension}For
      example, running the HDFS Sink connector on partition 0 of a topic named
        sourceTopic can yield the following series of
      files:sourceTopic_0_50.avro - for record 0 ~ 50
sourceTopic_0_79.avro - holding record 51 ~ 79
...The
      HDFS Sink connector periodically commits records to final result files. Each commit results in
      a separate "chunk" file.
