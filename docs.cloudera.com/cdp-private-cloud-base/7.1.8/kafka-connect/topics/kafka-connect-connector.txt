Connectors 
Cloudera Runtime comes prepackaged with a number of Cloudera developed Kafka Connect
    connectors. In addition, connectors that come packaged with the version of Apache Kafka that is
    included in Cloudera Runtime are also available for use. Manually installing and using your own
    custom connectors is also possible.
