Stateless NiFi Sink properties reference
Review the following reference for a comprehensive list of the connector properties
    that are specific to the Stateless NiFi Sink connector.

 In addition to the properties listed here, this connector also accepts the properties of
        the Kafka Connect framework. For a comprehensive list of these properties, see the Apache Kafka documentation.

attribute.prefix

Description
The prefix to add to the key of each header that matches the regular expression
            specified in headers.as.attributes.regex. For example, if the header
            key is MyHeader, its value is MyValue,
              headers.as.attributes.regex is set to My.*, and this
            property is set to kafka, the FlowFile that is created for the Kafka
            message will have an attribute named kafka.MyHeader with a value of
              MyValue.
Default Value

Accepted Values

Required
false


dataflow.timeout

Description
Specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for the dataflow to complete. If the
            dataflow does not complete before this timeout, the thread is interrupted and the
            dataflow is considered as a failure. The session is rolled back and the connector
            retriggers the flow. Defaults to 30 seconds if not specified.
Default Value
30 seconds
Accepted Values

Required
false


extensions.directory

Description
Specifies the directory that stores downloaded extensions. Because the default
            directory might not be writable, and to aid in upgrade scenarios, Cloudera recommends
            that you always specify an extensions directory.
Default Value
 /tmp/nifi-stateless-extensions
Accepted Values

Required
true


failure.ports

Description
A comma separated list of Output Ports that are considered as failure conditions. If
            any FlowFile is routed to an Output Port specified in this property, the dataflow is
            considered a failure and the session is rolled back. After a set amount of time, the
            dataflow reattempts to process the Kafka record. Any data transferred to an Output Port
            that is not in the list of failure ports is discarded.
Default Value

Accepted Values

Required
false


flow.snapshot

Description
Specifies the dataflow to run. When using SMM to deploy a connector, the value you set
            in this property must be a JSON object. URLs, file paths, or escaped JSON strings are
            not supported when using SMM. Alternatively, if using the Kafka Connect REST API to
            deploy a connector, this can be a file containing the dataflow, a URL that points to a
            dataflow, or a string containing the entire dataflow as an escaped JSON. Cloudera
            however, does not recommend using to Kafka Connect REST API to interact with this
            connector or Kafka Connect.
Default Value

Accepted Values

Required
true


headers.as.attributes.regex

Description
A Java regular expression that is evaluated against all Kafka record headers. Headers
            are added to the FlowFile as an attribute if the header key matches the regular
            expression. The header key is used as the attribute name. The header value is used as
            the attribute value. Additionally, the name of the attribute can also contain an
            optional prefix which is defined by the attribute.prefix property.
Default Value

Accepted Values

Required
false


input.port

Description
The name of the Input Port in the NiFi dataflow that Kafka records are sent to. If the
            dataflow contains exactly one Input Port, this property is optional and can be omitted.
            However, if the dataflow contains multiple Input Ports, this property must be
            specified.
Default Value

Accepted Values

Required
false


krb5.file

Description
Specifies the krb5.conf file to use if the dataflow interacts with
            any services that are secured using Kerberos. Defaults to
              /etc/krb5.conf if not specified.
Default Value
/etc/krb5.conf
Accepted Values

Required
false


name

Description
The name of the connector. On the SMM UI, the connector names are specified using the
              Enter Name field. The name that you enter in the
              Enter Name field is automatically set as the value of the name
            property when the connector is deployed. Because of this, the name property is omitted
            from the configuration template provided in SMM. If you manually add the name property
            to the configuration in SMM, ensure that the value you set matches the connector name
            specified in the Enter Name field. Otherwise, the connector fails
            to deploy.
Default Value

Accepted Values

Required
true


nexus.url

Description
Specifies the Base URL of the Nexus instance to source extensions from. If configuring
            a Nexus instance that has multiple repositories, include the name of the repository in
            the URL. For example,
              https://nexus-private.myorganization.org/nexus/repository/my-repository/.
            If the property is not specified, the necessary extensions (the ones used by the flow)
            must be provided in the extensions directory before deploying the connector.
Default Value

Accepted Values

Required
true


parameter.[***FLOW PARAMETER NAME***]

Description
Specifies a parameter to use in the dataflow. For example, assume that you have the
            following entry in your connector configuration "parameter.Directory":
              "/mydir". In a case like this, any Parameter Context in the dataflow that has
            a parameter named Directory gets the specified value
              (/mydir). If the dataflow has child Process Groups, and those child
            Process Groups have their own Parameter Contexts, the value is used for all Parameter
            Contexts that contain a parameter named Directory. Parameters can also
            be applied to specific Parameter Contexts only. This can be done by prefixing the
            parameter name (Directory) with the name of the Parameter Context
            followed by a colon. For example, parameter.My Context:Directory only
            applies the specified value for the Directory parameter in the
            Parameter Context named My Context.
Default Value

Accepted Values

Required
false


working.directory

Description
Specifies a directory on the Connect server that NiFi should use for unpacking
            extensions that it needs to perform the dataflow. Defaults to
              /tmp/nifi-stateless-working if not specified.
Default Value
/tmp/nifi-stateless-working
Accepted Values

Required
false
