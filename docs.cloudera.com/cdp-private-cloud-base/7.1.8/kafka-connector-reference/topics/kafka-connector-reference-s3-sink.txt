    that are specific to the S3 Sink connector.

The properties listed in this reference must be added to the connector configuration with
        the following
        prefix:parameter.[***CONNECTOR NAME***] Parameters:
In addition to the properties listed here, this connector also accepts certain properties
        of the Kafka Connect framework as well as the properties of the NiFi Stateless Sink
        connector. When creating a new connector using the SMM UI, all valid properties are
        presented in the default configuration template. You can view the configuration template to

Output Filename Pattern

Description
Specifies the structure of the name of the output file (S3 object name including the

            the following expressions:
${filename.uuid}: Inserts a generated UUID in the filename.
${filename.timestamp}: Inserts the current timestamp in the
                filename.
${filename.sequence}: Inserts an incrementing sequence value in
                the filename.
In order to generate unique filenames, either ${filename.uuid}
              or ${filename.sequence} must be used in the pattern. Examples:
data_${filename.uuid}.json
records_${filename.timestamp}_${filename.sequence}.avro


Default Value
${filename.uuid}

Output Filename Sequence Initial Value

Description
This property is used to configure the initial value of the

Default Value
0
Accepted Values

Required
false


Output Filename Sequence Padding Length

Description
Specifies the length of the ${filename.sequence} expression in
            characters. If the sequence has fewer characters than the value set in this property, it
            is padded with zeros (0). Padding is added to the left of the sequence. 
Default Value
6
Accepted Values

Required
false

Schema Access Strategy

Description
Specifies the strategy used for determining the schema of the Kafka record. The value
            you set here depends on the data format set in Kafka Message Data
              Format. If set to Schema Registry, the schema is read from
            Schema Registry. This setting can be used with both Avro and JSON formats. If set to
              Infer Schema, the schema is inferred based on the input file. This
            setting can only be used if Kafka Message Data Format is
              JSON. If set to Embedded Schema, the schema embedded
            in the input is used. This setting can only be used if Kafka Message Data
              Format is Avro. This property is not used if record
            processing is disabled (Kafka Message Data Format is set to Raw)
Default Value
Schema Registry

              Schema Branch and Schema Version cannot be specified
            at the same time. If one is  specified, the other needs to be removed from the
            configuration. If Schema Registry is not used, this property must be completely removed
