Learn how to use the kafka-console-consumer tool. 
The kafka-console-consumer tool can be useful in a couple of ways:

Acting as an independent consumer of particular topics. This can be useful to compare
        results against a consumer program that youâ€™ve written.
To test general topic consumption without the need to write any consumer code.

Examples of usage:
kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server [BROKER1],[BROKER2]... --topic [TOPIC] --from-beginning
[record-earliest-offset]
[record-earliest-offset+1]
Note the following about the tool:

This tool prints all records and keeps outputting as more records are written to the
        topic.
If the kafka-console-consumer tool is given no flags, it displays the
        full help message.
In older versions of Kafka, it may have been necessary to use the
          --new-consumer flag. As of Apache Kafka version 0.10.2, this is no longer
        necessary.
