Configuring log levels for command line tools
Learn how to change the logging level of command line tools.
 In some cases it can prove useful to change the default logging level of the command
      line tools. This can be done by setting the required logging level in the log4j2 properties
      file that the tools use.
Create a copy of the log4j2.properties file that the tools
          use.You are free to change the location where the copy gets created.
          cp /etc/kafka/conf/tools-log4j2.properties /var/tmpOpen the copied file and change the value of the root.logger
          property as required.For
          example:root.logger=TRACE,consolePass the location of the newly created properties file as a JVM
          parameter.You can do this by adding
              -Dlog4j2.configurationFile=file:[PATH_TO_FILE] to
          the KAFKA_OPTS variable. For
          example:export KAFKA_OPTS="-Dlog4j2.configurationFile=file:/var/tmp/tools-log4j2.properties"

The specified logging level is configured.
