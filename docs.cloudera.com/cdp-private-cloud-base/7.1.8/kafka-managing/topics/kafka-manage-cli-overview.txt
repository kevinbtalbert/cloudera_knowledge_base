Command Line Tools
Kafka command line tools overview.
In some situations, it is convenient to use the command line tools available in Kafka to
      administer your cluster. However, it is important to note that not all tools available for
      Kafka are supported by Cloudera. Moreover, certain administration tasks can be carried out
      more easily and conveniently using Cloudera Manager.
When administering Kafka with command line tools, be aware of the following: 

Use Cloudera Manager to start and stop Kafka and Zookeeper services. Do not use the
          kafka-server-start, kafka-server-stop,
          zookeeper-server-start, or zookeeper-server-stop
        commands.
For a parcel installation, all Kafka command line tools are located in
          /opt/cloudera/parcels/KAFKA/lib/kafka/bin/. For a package installation,
        all such tools can be found in /usr/bin/.
Ensure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to your JDK
        installation directory before using the command-line tools. For example:
        
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_144-cloudera

Using any Zookeeper command manually can be very difficult to get right when it comes to
        interaction with Kafka. Cloudera recommends that you avoid doing any write operations or ACL
        modifications in Zookeeper.

noteOutput examples in the command line tool descriptions are cleaned and formatted for easier
      readability.
