kafka-*-perf-test

The kafka-*-perf-test tools can be used in several ways. In general, it is
      expected that these tools should be used on a test or development cluster.
The kafka-*-perf-test tools allow you to:

Measure, read, and write throughput.
Stress test the cluster based on specific parameters (such as message size).
Load test for the purpose of evaluating specific metrics or determining the impact of
        cluster configuration changes.

The kafka-producer-perf-test script can either create a randomly generated
      byte record:
kafka-producer-perf-test --topic TOPIC --record-size SIZE_IN_BYTES
or randomly read from a set of provided records:
kafka-producer-perf-test --topic TOPIC --payload-delimiter DELIMITER --payload-file INPUT_FILE
where the INPUT_FILE is a concatenated set of pre-generated messages
      separated by DELIMITER. This script keeps producing messages or limited
      based on the --num-records flag.
The kafka-consumer-perf-test is:
kafka-consumer-perf-test --broker-list host1:port1,host2:port2,... --zookeeper zk1:port1,zk2:port2,... --topic TOPIC
The flags of most interest for this command are:

--group gid: If you run more than one instance of this
        test, you will want to set different ids for each instance.
--num-fetch-threads: Defaults to 1. Increase if higher throughput testing
        is needed.
--from-latest: To start consuming from the latest offset. May be needed
        for certain types of testing.
