Reassignment examples
A collection of examples that demonstrate how users can modify the proposed
    configuration file generated by the kafka-reassign-partitions.
There are multiple ways to modify the configuration file. The following list of examples
      shows how a user can modify a proposed configuration and what these changes do. 
Suppose that the kafka-reassign-partitions tool generated the following
      proposed reassignment
      configuration:{"version":1,
 "partitions":
   [{"topic":"mytopic1","partition":0,"replicas":[1,2],"log_dirs":["any","any"]}]}Now
      let's look at how this reassignment configuration has to be changed in different reassignment
      scenarios. 
Reassign partitions between brokers

To reassign partitions from one broker to another, change the broker ID specified in
                replicas. For
              example:{"topic":"mytopic1","partition":0,"replicas":[5,2],"log_dirs":["any","any"]}
This reassignment configuration moves partition mytopic1-0 from broker 1 to broker
              5.

Reassign partitions to another log directory on the same broker 
To reassign partitions between log directories on the same broker, change the
            appropriate any entry to an absolute path. For example:
              {"topic":"mytopic1","partition":0,"replicas":[1,2],"log_dirs":["/log/directory1","any"]}This
              reassignment configuration moves partition mytopic1-0 to the
                /log/directory1 log directory.
Reassign partitions between log directories across multiple brokers
To reassign partitions between log directories across multiple brokers, change the
            broker ID specified in replicas and the appropriate
              any entry to an absolute path. For
              example:{"topic":"mytopic1","partition":0,"replicas":[5,2],"log_dirs":["/log/directory1","any"]}This
              reassignment configuration moves partition mytopic1-0 to
                /log/directory1 on broker 5.
Change partition assignment order (elect a new leader)

To change the ordering of the partition assignment list, change the order of the
              brokers in replicas. For
              example:{"topic":"mytopic1","partition":0,"replicas":[2,1],"log_dirs":["any","any"]}
This reassignment configuration elects broker 2 as the new leader.
