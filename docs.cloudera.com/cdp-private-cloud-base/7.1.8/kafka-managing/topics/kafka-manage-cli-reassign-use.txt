Tool usage
Learn how to reassign partitions with the
      kafka-reassign-partitions-tool.Create a topics-to-move JSON file that specifies the topics you want to reassign.
          Use the following
          format:{"topics":  [{"topic": "mytopic1"},
             {"topic": "mytopic2"}],
 "version":1
}Generate the content for the reassignment configuration JSON with the following
          command:
kafka-reassign-partitions --zookeeper hostname:port --topics-to-move-json-file topics to move.json --broker-list broker 1, broker 2 --generate
Running the command lists the distribution of partition replicas on your current
            brokers followed by a proposed partition reassignment configuration. 
Current partition replica assignment
{"version":1,
 "partitions":
   [{"topic":"mytopic2","partition":1,"replicas":[2,3],"log_dirs":["any","any"]},
    {"topic":"mytopic1","partition":0,"replicas":[1,2],"log_dirs":["any","any"]},
    {"topic":"mytopic2","partition":0,"replicas":[1,2],"log_dirs":["any","any"]},
    {"topic":"mytopic1","partition":2,"replicas":[3,1],"log_dirs":["any","any"]},
    {"topic":"mytopic1","partition":1,"replicas":[2,3],"log_dirs":["any","any"]}]
}

Proposed partition reassignment configuration

{"version":1,
 "partitions":
   [{"topic":"mytopic1","partition":0,"replicas":[4,5],"log_dirs":["any","any"]},
    {"topic":"mytopic1","partition":2,"replicas":[4,5],"log_dirs":["any","any"]},
    {"topic":"mytopic2","partition":1,"replicas":[4,5],"log_dirs":["any","any"]},
    {"topic":"mytopic1","partition":1,"replicas":[5,4],"log_dirs":["any","any"]},
    {"topic":"mytopic2","partition":0,"replicas":[5,4],"log_dirs":["any","any"]}]
}In
          this example, the tool proposed a configuration which reassigns existing partitions on
          broker 1, 2, and 3 to brokers 4 and 5. Copy and paste the proposed partition reassignment configuration into an empty JSON
          file.Review, and if required, modify the suggested reassignment configuration.
        Save the file.Start the redistribution process with the following command: 
kafka-reassign-partitions --zookeeper hostname:port  --reassignment-json-file reassignment configuration.json --bootstrap-server hostname:port --execute
noteSpecifying a bootstrap server with the
              --bootstrap-server option is only required when an absolute log
            directory path is specified for a replica in the reassignment configuration JSON file.
          
The tool prints a list containing the original replica assignment and a
          message that reassignment has started. Example output:
          Current partition replica assignment

{"version":1,
 "partitions":
   [{"topic":"mytopic2","partition":1,"replicas":[2,3],"log_dirs":["any","any"]},
    {"topic":"mytopic1","partition":0,"replicas":[1,2],"log_dirs":["any","any"]},
    {"topic":"mytopic2","partition":0,"replicas":[1,2],"log_dirs":["any","any"]},
    {"topic":"mytopic1","partition":2,"replicas":[3,1],"log_dirs":["any","any"]},
    {"topic":"mytopic1","partition":1,"replicas":[2,3],"log_dirs":["any","any"]}]
}

Save this to use as the --reassignment-json-file option during rollback
Successfully started reassignment of partitions.Verify the status of the reassignment with the following command: 
kafka-reassign-partitions --zookeeper hostname:port --reassignment-json-file reassignment configuration.json  --bootstrap-server hostname:port --verify
The tool prints the reassignment status of all partitions.
          Status of partition reassignment: 
Reassignment of partition mytopic2-1 completed successfully
Reassignment of partition mytopic1-0 completed successfully
Reassignment of partition mytopic2-0 completed successfully
Reassignment of partition mytopic1-2 completed successfully
Reassignment of partition mytopic1-1 completed successfullyPartitions are reassigned.
