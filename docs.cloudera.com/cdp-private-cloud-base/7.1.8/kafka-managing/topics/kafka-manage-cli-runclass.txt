Understanding the kafka-run-class Bash Script

Almost all the provided Kafka tools eventually call the kafka-run-class
      script. This script is generally not called directly. However, if you are proficient with bash
      and want to understand certain features available in all Kafka scripts as well as some
      potential debugging scenarios, familiarity with the kafka-run-class script
      can prove highly beneficial. 
For example, there are some useful environment variables that affect all the command line
      scripts:

KAFKA_DEBUG allows a Java debugger to attach to the JVM launched by the
        particular script. Setting KAFKA_DEBUG also allows some further debugging customization: 
JAVA_DEBUG_PORT sets the JVM debugging port.
JAVA_DEBUG_OPTS can be used to override the default debugging
            arguments being passed to the JVM.

KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS can be used to pass memory setting arguments to the
        JVM.
KAFKA_JVM_PERFORMANCE_OPTS can be used to pass garbage collection flags
        to the JVM.
