Handling disk failures
An overview on how to handle disk failures.
 Cloudera Manager has built in monitoring functionalities that automatically trigger alerts
      when disk failures are detected. When a log directory fails, Kafka also detects the failure
      and takes the partitions stored in that directory offline.importantIf there are
        no healthy log directories present in the system, the broker stops working.  The
      cause of disk failures can be analyzed with the help of the kafka-log-dirs
      tool, or by reviewing the error messages of KafkaStorageException entries in
      the Kafka broker log file. To access the log file go to
          Instances > Log
          Files > Role Log File.
In case of a disk failure, a Kafka administrator can carry out either of the following
      actions. The action taken depends on the failure type and system environment: 
Replace the faulty disk with a new one.
Remove the disk and redistribute data across remaining disks to restore the desired
          replication factor. 


noteDisk replacement and disk removal both require stopping the broker. Therefore, Cloudera
        recommends that you perform these actions during a maintenance window.
