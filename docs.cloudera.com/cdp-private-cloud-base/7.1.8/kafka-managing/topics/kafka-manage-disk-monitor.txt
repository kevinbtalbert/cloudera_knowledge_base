Monitoring
Recommendations on what to monitor on clusters.
 Cloudera recommends that administrators continuously monitor the following on a cluster:
Replication Status
Monitor replication status using Cloudera Manager Health Tests. Cloudera Manager
            automatically and continuously monitors both the
              OfflineLogDirectoryCount and OfflineReplicaCount
            metrics. Alters are raised when failures are detected.
Disk Capacity
Monitor free space on mounted disks and open file descriptors. Reassign partitions or
            move log files around if necessary. For more information, see the
              kafka-reassign-partitions tool description.
