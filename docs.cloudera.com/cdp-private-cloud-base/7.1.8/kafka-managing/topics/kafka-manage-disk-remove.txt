Disk Removal
Learn how to remove a disk from the configuration.
In case of a disk failure, a Kafka administrator can remove the disk and
      redistribute data across remaining disks to restore the desired replication factor.
Stop the broker that has a faulty disk:
In Cloudera Manager, go to the Kafka service, select
                  Instances and select the
              broker.
Go to Actions > Gracefully stop
                  this Kafka Broker.
Remove the log directories on the faulty disk from the broker:
Go to Configuration and
              find the Data Directories
              property.
Remove the affected log directories with the Remove
              button.
Enter a Reason for change, and then click
                Save Changes to commit the changes.
Start the broker:
In Cloudera Manager, go to the Kafka service, select
                  Instances and select the
              broker.
Go to Actions > Start this Kafka
                  Broker. 

The disk is removed from the configuration. The Kafka broker redistributes data
      across the cluster.
