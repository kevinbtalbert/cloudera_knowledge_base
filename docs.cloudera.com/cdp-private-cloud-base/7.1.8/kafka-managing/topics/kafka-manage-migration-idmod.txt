Migrate brokers by modifying broker IDs in meta.properties
Learn how to migrate brokers between hosts in a Kafka cluster by modifying broker IDs
    in meta.properties. 

In case of catastrophic hardware failure brokers can be moved to a new host in a Kafka
        cluster. The following steps walk you through broker migration by modifying broker IDs in
          meta.properties. Compared to migration with the help of the
          kafka-reassign-partitions tool, this method involves less manual work,
        but requires modifying an internal configuration file.importantData intensive
          administration operations such as rebalancing partitions, adding a broker, removing a
          broker, or bootstrapping a new machine can cause significant additional load on the
          cluster. Therefore, Cloudera highly recommends that you migrate one broker at a time and
          migrate brokers when there is minimal load on the cluster 




Verify that the cluster is healthy. 
Verify that all replicas are in sync. 


Start up the new broker as a member of the old cluster. 
This creates files in the data directory.
Stop both the new broker and the old broker that it is replacing.Change broker.id of the new broker to the
            broker.id of the old one both in Cloudera Manager and in
              data directory/meta.properties.Optional: Run rsync to copy files from one broker to
          another. Start up the new broker. When started the new broker re-replicates data
          from the other nodes.
The Kafka broker is migrated to a new host.
