Broker migration
Learn more about the options you have when migrating brokers and copying data between
    brokers.
In case of catastrophic hardware failure brokers can be moved to a new host in a Kafka
      cluster. There multiple methods  with which you can move brokers between clusters:
Using kafka-reassign-partitions tool

This method involves more manual work to modify JSON, but does not require manual
              edits to configuration files. 

Modify the broker IDs in meta.properties

This method involves less manual work, but requires modifying an internal
              configuration file.

Using rsync

You can use rsync to copy over all data from an old broker to a new
            broker, preserving modification times and permissions. 

Continue reading for instructions on how to move brokers by modifying broker IDs or using
        rsync. For instructions on how to migrate brokers with
        kafka-reassign-partitions, see the
        kafka-reassign-partitions tool description. For specific instructions on
      how to migrate existing Kafka partitions to JBOD configured disks, see JBOD disk
        migration.
