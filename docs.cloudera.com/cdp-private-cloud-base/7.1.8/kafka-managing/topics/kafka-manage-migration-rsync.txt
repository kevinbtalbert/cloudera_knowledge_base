Use rsync to copy files from one broker to another
Learn how to use rsync to copy over all data from an old broker to a
    new broker.

 You can run rsync command to copy over all data from an old broker to a
        new broker, preserving modification times and permissions. Using rsync
        allows you to avoid having to re-replicate the data from the leader. 



Ensure that the disk structures match between the two brokers, or verify the
            meta.properties file between the source and destination brokers
          (because there is one meta.properties file for each data directory).


Run the following command on destination broker:
rsync -avz
        src_broker:src_data_dir
        dest_data_dir
If you plan to change the broker ID, edit
              dest_data_dir/meta.properties.

Data from the source broker is copied over to the destination broker.
