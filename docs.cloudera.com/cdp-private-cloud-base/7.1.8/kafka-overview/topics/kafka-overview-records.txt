Learn more about Kafka records.
In Kafka, a publish-subscribe message is called a record. A record
     consists of a key/value pair and metadata including a timestamp. The
     key is not required, but can be used to identify messages from the
     same data source. Kafka stores keys and values as arrays of bytes.
     It does not otherwise care about the format.
The metadata of each record can include headers. Headers may store
     application-specific metadata as key-value pairs. In the context of
     the header, keys are strings and values are byte arrays.
For specific details of the record format, see Apache Kafka documentation.
