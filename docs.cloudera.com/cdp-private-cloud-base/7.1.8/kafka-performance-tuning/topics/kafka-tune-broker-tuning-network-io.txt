    threads.
Kafka brokers use network threads to handle client requests. Incoming requests (such as
      produce and fetch requests) are placed into a requests queue from where I/O threads are taking
      them up and process them. After a request is processed, the response is placed into an
      internal response queue from where a network thread picks it up and sends response back to the
      client. 

num.network.threads is an important cluster-wide setting that determines
        the number of threads used for handling network requests (that is, receiving requests and
        sending responses). Set this value mainly based on number of producers, consumers and
        replica fetchers.
queued.max.requests controls how many requests are allowed in the request
        queue before blocking network threads.
num.io.threads specifies the number of threads that a broker uses for
        processing requests from the request queue (might include disk I/O).
