Configure clients on a producer or consumer level
Learn how to configure client authentication using delegation tokens on a producer or
    consumer level.

You can set up client authentication by configuring the JAAS configuration property for
        each client. The JAAS configuration property can be set in the
          producer.properties or consumer.properties file of the
        client. With this configuration method, you have the ability to specify different token
        details for each Kafka client within a JVM. As a result you can configure Kafka clients in a
        way that each of them use a unique token for authentication.

Configure the JAAS configuration property for each client. 
Example
            Configuration:sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule  required \
    username="tokenID" \
    password="lAYYSFmLs4bTjf+lTZ1LCHR/ZZFNA==" \
    tokenauth="true";

There are three options that need to be specified. These are the
              username, password and tokenauth
            options. 
The username and password options specify the token
            ID and token HMAC. The tokenauth option expresses the intent to use
            token authentication to the server.
