Importing Kafka entities into Atlas
Existing Kafka topics and clients can be imported into Atlas as entities using the
    Import Kafka Topics Into Atlas action aqvailable in Cloudera Manager. Importing Kafka entities
    allows you to manage, govern, and monitor your topics and clients in Atlas. 

The following list of steps walk you through how you can import Kafka topics and clients as
        entities (metadata) into Atlas using the Import Kafka Topics Into
          Atlas action in Cloudera Manager. This action only imports existing topics and
        clients. Topics and clients created after the import is completed are not automatically
        imported into Atlas. 
Continuous import can be enabled by configuring the Atlas hook in Kafka. For more
        information, see Configuring the Atlas hook in Kafka.



An Atlas service is deployed on the Kafka cluster or the data context cluster. The Atlas
          service must be started and must be in a healthy state. 
You are logged in to Cloudera Manager as a user that can perform service and role level
          configuration changes (Cluster Administrator, Full Administrator, Configurator, Limited
          Cluster Administrator). 
If authorization is enabled, ensure that the kafka user is authorized
          to create, update, delete, and read Kafka entities in Atlas.


In Cloudera Manager select the Kafka service.Click Actions > Import Kafka Topics
              Into Atlas.Click Import Kafka Topics Into Atlas and wait until the
          process is finished.
