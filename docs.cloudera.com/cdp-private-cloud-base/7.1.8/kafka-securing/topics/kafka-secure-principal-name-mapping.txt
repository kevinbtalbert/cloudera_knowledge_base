Principal name mapping
Kafka can be configured to translate certificate subject names into short names. This is
    done by adding mapping rules to Kafka's configuration. These short names can be used as the
    unique identifier of the user. Compared to subject names, short names are much easier to manage. 
When a client authenticates using a TLS/SSL keystore, by default Kafka assumes that the
      username for that client is the certificate's subject name, which is usually a Distinguished
      Name such as the following:
      cn=alice,cn=groups,cn=accounts,dc=hadoopsecurity,dc=local

Working with these long names is difficult. Security policies and group mappings are usually
      defined in terms of the user's short name (alice) rather than the full
      Distinguished Name. Kafka can be configured to translate the certificate's subject into a
      short name that can be used as the unique identifier of the user.
This can be done by adding the necessary mapping rules to the
        ssl.principal.mapping.rules Kafka property. However, this property is not directly
      configurable in Cloudera Manager. As a result, you need to use the Kafka Broker
        Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for kafka.properties property to
      add it to your configuration. noteThe ssl.principal.mapping.rules property
        is only supported in Kafka 2.4.0 or higher. In older versions of Kafka, a custom principal
        builder needs to be created and provided.
The rule takes the form of a regular expression to match the subject name of the certificate
      and the transformation to apply to the match. The property accepts multiple rules. Each rule
      has to be separated by a comma. The last rule is usually the DEFAULT rule,
      which uses the full subject name.
For example, consider the following
      setting:ssl.principal.mapping.rules=RULE:^.*[Cc][Nn]=([a-zA-Z0-9.]*).*$/$1/L,DEFAULTThis
      configuration has two rules which are processed in the following order:
RULE:^[Cc][Nn]=([a-zA-Z0-9.]*).*$/$1/L
DEFAULT

The first rule to match the certificate's subject name is used, later ones are ignored. The
        DEFAULT rule is a "catch all" rule. It always matches and does not do any
      replacement if none of the previous ones were matched.
The regular expression of the first rule,^[Cc][Nn]=([a-zA-Z0-9.]*).*$,
      matches any subject that starts with CN=,cn=,
        Cn=, or cN=, followed by the user's short name, that
      contains characters ranging between a-z,A-Z, and
        0-9, followed by any string. It then replaces the matched string with the
      user's short name. The short name is the content matched inside the parenthesis and is
      referenced in the second part of the rule as $1. The L at
      the end of the rule converts the resulting string to lowercase. 
For more information and examples on principal mapping rules, see the Apache Kafka
      documentation.
