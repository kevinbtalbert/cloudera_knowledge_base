Configure the resource-based Ranger service used for authorization
Learn how to configure the resource-based Ranger service used by Kafka for
    authorization.

You can configure which resource-based service in Ranger is used by Kafka for
        authorization. This is controlled by the Ranger service name for this Kafka
          cluster property which can be set in Cloudera Manager. The property can be
        configured in two ways:
Set a user defined string
The property accepts a user defined string. Alphanumeric characters as well as
              underscores are allowed, for example, kafka_1. In this case, Kafka
              checks if a resource-based service in Ranger matching the defined string exists. If it
              does, Kafka will use that resource-based service. If it does not, Kafka automatically
              creates and uses a new resource-based service. The name of the newly created
              resource-based service will be the name that was defined in the property.
Set {{GENERATED_RANGER_SERVICE_NAME}}
The property accepts {{GENERATED_RANGER_SERVICE_NAME}} as a valid
              value. When this specific placeholder value is set, Cloudera Manager generates a name
              for a new resource-based service. The generated name is based on the Kafka service
              name and the cluster name. Kafka then checks whether a resource-based service with the
              generated name exists in Ranger. If it does, Kafka will use that resource-based
              service. If it does not, Kafka automatically creates and uses a new resource-based
              service. The name of the newly created resource-based service will be the generated
              name. 

In both scenarios, the creation of the role-based service happens once the Kafka
                service is restarted.
The property by default is set to cm_kafka. However, for clusters
        provisioned with the Streams Messaging cluster definitions in CDP Data Hub, the default is
          {{GENERATED_RANGER_SERVICE_NAME}}.
Configuring this property can prove useful when you have multiple Kafka clusters that
                use the same Ranger service for authorization, but you want to define unique Ranger
                policies for each Kafka cluster.

In Cloudera Manager select the Kafka service.Select Configuration and find the Ranger service
            name for this Kafka cluster property.
Configure the property.
You have two choices:
Set the property to a user defined string.
Set the property to
              {{GENERATED_RANGER_SERVICE_NAME}}.

Click Save Changes.Restart the Kafka service.
The selected resource-based service is configured and is used by Kafka for
      authorization. If the resource-based service does not exist, it will be automatically created
      in Ranger.
