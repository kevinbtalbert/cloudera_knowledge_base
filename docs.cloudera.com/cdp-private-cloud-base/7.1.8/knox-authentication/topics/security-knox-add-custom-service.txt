Add custom service to existing descriptor in Apache Knox Proxy
How to add a custom service to an existing descriptor in Knox proxy using Cloudera
        Manager.

Custom services are unofficial, tech preview, or community feature Knox
                services. You must supply the service definition files (service.xml
                and rewrite.xml) which exist in the
                    KNOX_DATA_DIR/services folder. These are not recommended
                for production environments, and not supported by Cloudera.
In this example, a custom service (MY_SERVICE) is
                added in cdp-proxy with the following attributes:
Version : the service’s version, for example,
                            1.0.0.
URL: the service URL, for example,
                            https://sampleHost:1234.
Service parameter: a sample service parameter,
                        for example, myValue.
importantAdding a custom service only works if you provide the
                    service definition files (service.xml and
                        rewrite.xml) in the
                        KNOX_DATA_DIR/services folder.
To achieve the goals you need to add three new entries with the
                above-listed parameters in Knox Simplified Topology Management - cdp-proxy.
                Then you save the changes, refresh the cluster and check if the newly added custom
                service is available in cdp-proxy.


From Cloudera Manager > Knox > Configuration, add the three new entries with the above-listed
                    parameters.

MY_SERVICE:version=1.0.0
MY_SERVICE:url=https://sampleHost:1234
MY_SERVICE:customServiceParameter=myValue







Save your changes.

The ‘Refresh needed’ stale configuration indicator appears; click it and wait
                    until the refresh process completes.






Validate that MY_SERVICE in cdp-proxy is
                    added by navigating to the following URL:
                            https://$KNOX_GATEWAY_HOST:$PORT/$GATEWAY_PATH/admin/api/v1/topologies/cdp-proxy.
