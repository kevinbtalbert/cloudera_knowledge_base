Management of services for Apache Knox via Cloudera Manager
You can enable or disable known or custom services in Knox proxy via Cloudera
  Manager.
There are two kinds of services in cdp-proxy: 
Known: officially-supported Knox services. Cloudera Manager provides and manages all the
     required service definition files.
Custom: unofficial, tech preview, or community feature Knox services. You must supply the
          service definition files (service.xml and rewrite.xml)
          exist in the KNOX_DATA_DIR/services folder. These are not recommended
          for production environments, and not supported by Cloudera.

These topologies will be deployed by Cloudera Manager only if Knoxâ€™s
        service auto-discovery feature is turned on using the Enable/Disable Service
          Auto-Discovery checkbox on Cloudera Manager UI:



For a comprehensive list of known services that can be enabled, see Knox Supported Services
