Securing Access to Hadoop Cluster: Apache Knox
The Apache Knox Gateway (“Knox”) is a system to extend the reach of Apache™ Hadoop®
        services to users outside of a Hadoop cluster without reducing Hadoop Security. Knox also
        simplifies Hadoop security for users who access the cluster data and execute jobs. The Knox
        Gateway is designed as a reverse proxy.
Establishing user identity with strong authentication is the basis for secure access in
            Hadoop. Users need to reliably identify themselves and then have that identity
            propagated throughout the Hadoop cluster to access cluster resources. 
Layers of Defense for a CDP Private Cloud Base Cluster


Authentication: Kerberos
Cloudera uses Kerberos for authentication. Kerberos is an industry standard
                        used to authenticate users and resources within a Hadoop cluster. CDP also
                        includes Cloudera Manager, which simplifies Kerberos setup, configuration,
                        and maintenance. 


Perimeter Level Security: Apache Knox
Apache Knox Gateway is used to help ensure perimeter security for Cloudera
                        customers. With Knox, enterprises can confidently extend the Hadoop REST API
                        to new users without Kerberos complexities, while also maintaining
                        compliance with enterprise security policies. Knox provides a central
                        gateway for Hadoop REST APIs that have varying degrees of authorization,
                        authentication, SSL, and SSO capabilities to enable a single access point
                        for Hadoop.
