Knox Topology Management in Cloudera Manager
In CDP Private Cloud, you can manage Apache Knox topologies via Cloudera Manager using
      cdp-proxy and cdp-proxy-api. 
Shared providers
The Cloudera Manager configurations where the cdp-proxy and
          cdp-proxy-api topologies can be managed are:
Knox Simplified Topology Management - cdp-proxy
Knox Simplified Topology Management - cdp-proxy-api




The SSO authentication provider is used by the UIs using the Knox SSO capabilities, such
          as the Admin and Home Page UIs.
The API authentication provider is used by predefined topologies, such as
            admin, metadata or
          cdp-proxy-api.
You can add or modify new or existing shared provider configurations.
You can save aliases using a new Knox Gateway command.


Services
You can enable or disable known or custom services in Knox proxy via Cloudera Manager.
There are two kinds of services in cdp-proxy: 
Known: officially-supported Knox services. Cloudera Manager provides and manages all
            the required service definition files.
Custom: unofficial, tech preview, or community feature Knox services. You must supply
            the service definition files (service.xml and
              rewrite.xml) that exist in the
              KNOX_DATA_DIR/services folder. These are not recommended for
            production environments, and not supported by Cloudera.

important
These topologies will be deployed by Cloudera Manager only if Knoxâ€™s
          service auto-discovery feature is turned on using the Enable/Disable Service
            Auto-Discovery checkbox on Cloudera Manager UI:



importantAdding a custom service will only work if you provide the service
        definition files (service.xml and rewrite.xml) in the
          KNOX_DATA_DIR/services folder.

Service parameters
You can add, modify, or remove custom service parameters in Knox proxy via Cloudera
        Manager.
