Disable proxy for a known service in Apache Knox
How to remove auto-discovery for a known service in Knox proxy via Cloudera
        Manager.

Known services are officially-supported Knox services (like Apache Atlas,
                Ranger, Solr, etc.) Cloudera Manager provides and manages all the required service
                definition files.
In this example, we are going to remove the previously added ATLAS
                and ATLAS-UI services from cdp-proxy. We disable
                the gateway_auto_discovery_cdp_proxy_enabled_atlas and
                    gateway_auto_discovery_cdp_proxy_enabled_atlas_ui checkboxes on
                Knox’s Configuration page in CM, save the changes and refresh the cluster.


From Cloudera Manager > Knox > Configuration, uncheck the Gateway Auto Discovery (cdp-proxy) -
                        $Component boxes.
In this example, we disable:
gateway_auto_discovery_cdp_proxy_enabled_atlas

gateway_auto_discovery_cdp_proxy_enabled_atlas_ui







Save your changes.

The ‘Refresh needed’ stale configuration indicator appears; click it and wait
                    until the refresh process finishes.






Validate that custom service got removed by going to the following URL:
                            https://$KNOX_GATEWAY_HOST:$PORT/$GATEWAY_PATH/admin/api/v1/topologies/cdp-proxy.
