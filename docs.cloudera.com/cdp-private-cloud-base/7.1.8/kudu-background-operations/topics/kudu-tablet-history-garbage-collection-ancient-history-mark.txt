Tablet history garbage collection and the ancient history mark
Kudu uses a multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) mechanism to ensure that snapshot
      scans can proceed isolated from new changes to a table. Therefore, periodically, old
      historical data should be garbage-collected (removed) to free up disk space. While Kudu never
      removes rows or data that are visible in the latest version of the data, Kudu does remove
      records of old changes that are no longer visible.
 The specific threshold in time (in the past) beyond which historical
         MVCC data becomes inaccessible and is free to be deleted is called the ancient history mark (AHM). The AHM can be configured by
         setting the --tablet_history_max_age_sec
         property. 
 There are two background tasks that remove historical MVCC data older
         than the AHM: 
 The one that runs the merging compaction, called CompactRowSetsOp (see above). 
 A separate background task deletes old undo delta blocks,
               called UndoDeltaBlockGCOp. Running
                  UndoDeltaBlockGCOp reduces disk
               space usage in all workloads, but particularly in those with a higher volume of
               updates or upserts. The metrics associated with this background task have the prefix
                  undo_delta_block.
