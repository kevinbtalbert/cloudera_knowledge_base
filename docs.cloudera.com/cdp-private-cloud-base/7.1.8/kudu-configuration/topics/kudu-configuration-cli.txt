Configure Kudu processes
You can pass command-line flags when you start a Kudu process to configure its
    behavior or read those options from configuration files by passing them using one or more
      --flagfile=<file> options.
 You can include the --flagfile option
      within your configuration file to include other files. Learn more about gflags by reading
        its documentation. 
 You can
      place options for masters and tablet servers in the same configuration file, and each will
      ignore options that do not apply. 
 Flags can
      be prefixed with either one or two -
      characters. This documentation standardizes on two: --example_flag. 
 Only the
      most common configuration options are documented in this topic. For a more exhaustive list of
      configuration options, see the Kudu Configuration Reference. To see all
      configuration flags for a given executable, run it with the --help option.

Experimental flags Some configuration flags are marked 'unsafe' and 'experimental'. Such flags are   disabled by default. You can access these flags by enabling the additional flags, --unlock_unsafe_flags and --unlock_experimental_flags.
