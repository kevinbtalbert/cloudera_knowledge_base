Directory configurations
Every Kudu node requires the specification of directory flags.
The --fs_wal_dir configuration indicates
      where Kudu will place its write-ahead logs.
The
        --fs_metadata_dir configuration indicates
      where Kudu will place metadata for each tablet. It is recommended, although not necessary,
      that these directories be placed on a high-performance drives with high bandwidth and low
      latency, e.g. solid-state drives. If --fs_metadata_dir is not specified, metadata will be placed in the directory
      specified by --fs_wal_dir. 

        Since a Kudu node cannot tolerate the loss of its WAL or metadata directories, you might
        want to mirror the drives containing these directories in order to make recovering from
        a drive failure easier. However, mirroring may increase the latency of Kudu writes.
      

        The --fs_data_dirs configuration indicates where Kudu will write its
        data blocks. This is a comma-separated list of directories; if multiple values are
        specified, data will be striped across the directories. If not specified, data blocks
        will be placed in the directory specified by --fs_wal_dir.
      
note
        While a single data directory backed by a RAID-0 array will outperform a single data
        directory backed by a single storage device, it is better to let Kudu manage its own
        striping over multiple devices rather than delegating the striping to a RAID-0 array.
      

        Additionally, --fs_wal_dir and --fs_metadata_dir may
        be the same as one of the directories listed in --fs_data_dirs,
        but must not be sub-directories of any of them.
      
warning
        Each directory specified by a configuration flag on a given machine should be used by at
        most one Kudu process. If multiple Kudu processes on the same machine are configured to
        use the same directory, Kudu may refuse to start up.
      
warning Once --fs_data_dirs is
      set, extra tooling is required to change it.
note
      The --fs_wal_dir and --fs_metadata_dir configurations can be changed,
      provided the contents of the directories are also moved to match the flags.

Changing directory configurationFor higher read parallelism and larger volumes of storage per server, you can     configure servers to store data in multiple directories on different devices using the       --fs_data_dirs Gflag configuration.
