This topic provides you information on how to find the API documentation for C++ and
      Java.
warning Use of server-side or private interfaces is not
         supported, and interfaces which are not part of public APIs have no stability guarantees. 
C++ API Documentation

          The documentation for the C++ client APIs is included in the header files in
          /usr/include/kudu/ if you installed Kudu using packages or
          subdirectories of src/kudu/client/ if you built Kudu from source. If
          you installed Kudu using parcels, no headers are included in your installation. and
          you will need to build Kudu from source in order to have access to the headers and
          shared libraries.
        

          The following command is a naive approach to finding relevant header files. Use of any
          APIs other than the client APIs is unsupported.
find /usr/include/kudu -type f -name *.h


Java API Documentation
 View the Java API documentation online. Alternatively,
        after building the Java client, Java API documentation is available in java/kudu-client/target/apidocs/index.html.
