Drop a Kudu table using Impala
 You can drop internal tables in Impala using the DROP TABLE  syntax. If you want to
      drop an external table, you first have to change it to internal.
If the table was created as an internal table in Impala, using CREATE TABLE, the standard DROP TABLE syntax drops the underlying Kudu
         table and all its data.
         DROP TABLE my_first_table;
If the table was created as an external table, using CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE, the mapping between
         Impala and Kudu is dropped, but the Kudu table is left intact, with all its data. To change
         an external table to internal, and the other way around, see Altering table
            properties.
