Failures during INSERT, UPDATE, UPSERT, and DELETE operations
INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements cannot be considered
      transactional as a whole. If one of these operations fails part of the way through, the keys
      may have already been created (in the case of INSERT) or the records may have already been modified or removed by another
      process (in the case of UPDATE or DELETE). You should design your application with
      this in mind.
