Query an existing Kudu table from Impala
Tables created through the Kudu API or other integrations such as Apache Spark are not
      automatically visible in Impala.
To query
         them, you must first create an external table within Impala to map the Kudu table into an
         Impala database:
         CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE my_mapping_table
STORED AS KUDU
TBLPROPERTIES (
  'kudu.table_name' = 'my_kudu_table'
);
