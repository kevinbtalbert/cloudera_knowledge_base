Internal and external Impala tables
When creating a new Kudu table using Impala, you can create the table as an internal
      table or an external table.

 Internal 
 An internal table (created by CREATE TABLE) is managed by Impala, and
               can be dropped by Impala. When you create a new table using Impala, it is generally a
               internal table. When such a table is created in Impala, the corresponding Kudu table
               will be named impala::database_name.table_name. The prefix is always impala::, and the database name and table
               name follow, separated by a dot. 
 External 
 An external table (created by CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE) is not managed by
               Impala, and dropping such a table does not drop the table from its source location
               (here, Kudu). Instead, it only removes the mapping between Impala and Kudu. This is
               the mode used in the syntax provided by Kudu for mapping an existing table to Impala.
