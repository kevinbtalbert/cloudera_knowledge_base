Minimize cluster disruption during temporary planned downtime of a single tablet
    server
If a single tablet server is brought down temporarily in a healthy cluster, all tablets
    will remain available and clients will function as normal, after potential short delays due to
    leader elections. However, if the downtime lasts for more than --follower_unavailable_considered_failed_sec (default
    300) seconds, the tablet replicas on the down tablet server will be replaced by new replicas on
    available tablet servers. This will cause stress on the cluster as tablets re-replicate and, if
    the downtime lasts long enough, significant reduction in the number of replicas on the down
    tablet server, which may require the rebalancer to fix. 
 To work
      around this, in Kudu versions 1.11 onward, the kudu CLI contains a tool to
      put tablet servers into maintenance mode. While in this state, the tablet serverâ€™s replicas
      are not re-replicated due to its downtime alone, though re-replication may still occur in the
      event that the server in maintenance suffers from a disk failure or if a follower replica on
      the tablet server falls too far behind its leader replica. Upon exiting maintenance,
      re-replication is triggered for any remaining under-replicated tablets.
The kudu tserver state enter_maintenance and kudu tserver state
        exit_maintenance tools are added to orchestrate tablet server maintenance. The
      following can be run from a tablet server to put it into
      maintenance:$ TS_UUID=$(sudo -u kudu kudu fs dump uuid --fs_wal_dir=<wal_dir> --fs_data_dirs=<data_dirs>)
$ sudo -u kudu kudu tserver state enter_maintenance <master_addresses> "$TS_UUID"
The tablet server maintenance mode is shown in the "Tablet Servers" page of the Kudu leader
      master's web UI, and in the output of kudu cluster ksck. To exit maintenance
      mode, run the following
      command:sudo -u kudu kudu tserver state exit_maintenance <master_addresses> "$TS_UUID"
