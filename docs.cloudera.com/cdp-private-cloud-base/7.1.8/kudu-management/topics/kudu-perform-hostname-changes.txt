Perform master hostname changes
You need to bring the Kudu clusters down to update the master hostnames. Therefore,
    identify at least a one-hour maintenance window for this task.
 Rewrite each master’s Raft configuration with the following command, executed on each
          master host:

$ sudo -u kudu kudu local_replica cmeta rewrite_raft_config --fs_wal_dir=<master_wal_dir> [--fs_data_dirs=<master_data_dir>] 00000000000000000000000000000000 <all_masters>

For
          example:$ sudo -u kudu kudu local_replica cmeta rewrite_raft_config --fs_wal_dir=/data/kudu/master/wal --fs_data_dirs=/data/kudu/master/data 00000000000000000000000000000000 4aab798a69e94fab8d77069edff28ce0:new-master-name-1:7051 f5624e05f40649b79a757629a69d061e:new-master-name-2:7051 988d8ac6530f426cbe180be5ba52033d:new-master-name-3:7051

 Update the master address:


 In an environment not managed by Cloudera Manager, change the
                gflag file of the masters so the master_addresses
              parameter reflects the new hostnames. 
 In an environment managed by Cloudera Manager, specify the new hostname in the
                Master Address (server.address) field on each Kudu role. 



              Change the gflag file of the tablet servers to update the
              tserver_master_addrs parameter with the new hostnames. In an
              environment managed by Cloudera Manager, this step is not needeed.
            
 Start the masters.

 To verify that all masters are working properly, perform the following checks:


In each master’s Web UI, click Masters on the Status Pages.
              All of the masters should be listed there with one master in the LEADER role
              field and the others in the FOLLOWER role field. The contents of Masters
              on all master should be the same. 


Run the below command to verify all masters are up and listening. The UUIDs are the
              same and belong to the same master as before the hostname change:

$ sudo -u kudu kudu master list new-master-name-1:7051,new-master-name-2:7051,new-master-name-3:7051




              Start all of the tablet servers.
            
 Run a Kudu system check (ksck) on the
          cluster using the kudu command line tool. After startup, some tablets may be unavailable as it
          takes some time to initialize all of them. 
 If you have Kudu tables that are accessed from Impala, update the HMS database manually in the
          underlying database that provides the storage for HMS.  


The following is an example SQL statement you run in the HMS database:

UPDATE TABLE_PARAMSSET PARAM_VALUE =
'new-master-name-1:7051,new-master-name-2:7051,new-master-name-3:7051'
WHERE PARAM_KEY = 'kudu.master_addresses'
AND PARAM_VALUE = 'master-1:7051,master-2:7051,master-3:7051';




In impala-shell, run:

INVALIDATE METADATA;



Verify updating the metadata worked by running a simple SELECT
              query on a Kudu-backed Impala table.
