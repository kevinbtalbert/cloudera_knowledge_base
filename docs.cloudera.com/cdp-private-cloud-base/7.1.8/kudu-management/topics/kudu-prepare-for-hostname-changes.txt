Prepare for master hostname changes
In this step, you need to identify a down-time window, and note the UUID and the RPC
    address of each master.
              Establish a maintenance window during which the Kudu cluster will be unavailable.
              One hour should be sufficient.
            
 On the Masters page in Kudu Web UI, note the UUID and RPC address
          of each master. 

              Stop all the Kudu processes in the cluster.
            
              Set up the new hostnames to point to the masters and verify all servers and
              clients properly resolve them.
