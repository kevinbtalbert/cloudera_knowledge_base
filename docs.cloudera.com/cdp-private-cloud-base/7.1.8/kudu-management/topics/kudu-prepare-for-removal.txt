Prepare for removal
In order to remove the unwanted masters from a multi-master deployment, you need to
    identify them and note their UUID and RPC addresses. 
              Establish a maintenance window (one hour should be sufficient). During this time
              the Kudu cluster will be unavailable.
            
              Identify the UUID and RPC address current leader of the multi-master deployment by
              visiting the /masters page of any masterâ€™s web UI. This master
              must not be removed during this process; its removal may result in severe data
              loss.
            
 Stop the unwanted Kudu master processes.
