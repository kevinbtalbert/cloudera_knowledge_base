Remove Kudu masters
In the event that a multi-master deployment has been overallocated nodes, the
    following steps should be taken to remove the unwanted masters.
important

 In planning the new multi-master configuration, keep in mind that
          the number of masters should be odd and that three or five node master configurations are
          recommended. 
 Dropping the number of masters below the number of masters
          currently needed for a Raft majority can incur data loss. To mitigate this, ensure that
          the leader master is not removed during this process. 



Prepare for removalIn order to remove the unwanted masters from a multi-master deployment, you need to     identify them and note their UUID and RPC addresses. Perform the removalWhen you remove any Kudu masters from a multi-master deployment, you need to rewrite     the Raft configuration on the remaining masters, remove data and WAL directories from the     unwanted masters, and finaly modify the value of the tserver_master_addrs     configuration parameter for the tablet servers to remove the unwanted masters. You need to bring     the Kudu clusters down. Therefore, identify at least a one-hour maintenance window for this     task.
