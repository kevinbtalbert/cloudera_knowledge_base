Use cluster names in the kudu command line tool
When using the kudu command line tool, it can be difficult to remember the precise list
  of Kudu master RPC addresses needed to communicate with a cluster, especially when managing
  multiple clusters. As an alternative, you can use the command line tool to identify clusters by
  name.

Create a new directory to store the Kudu configuration file.

Export the path to this newly created directory in the KUDU_CONFIG
     environment variable.

Create a file called kudurc in the new directory.

Populate kudurc as follows, substituting your own cluster names and RPC
     addresses:

clusters_info:
  cluster_name1:
    master_addresses: ip1:port1,ip2:port2,ip3:port3
  cluster_name2:
    master_addresses: ip4:port4


When using the kudu command line tool, replace the list of Kudu master RPC
     addresses with the cluster name, prepended with the character @. For
     example:

$ sudo -u kudu kudu cluster @cluster_name1


note Cluster names may be used as input in any invocation of the kudu
      command line tool that expects a list of Kudu master RPC addresses.
