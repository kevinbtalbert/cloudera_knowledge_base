Enable core dump for the Kudu service
If Kudu crashes, you can use Cloudera Manager to generate a core dump to get more
    information about the crash.

 Go to the Kudu service.

Click the Configuration tab.

 Search for core
            dump. 

 Check the checkbox for the Enable Core
            Dump property. 

 (Optional) Unless otherwise configured, the dump file is generated in the default core
          dump directory, /var/log/kudu, for both the Kudu master and the tablet servers.


 To configure a different dump directory for the Kudu master, modify the value of
              the Kudu Master Core Dump Directory property. 
 To configure a different dump directory for the Kudu tablet servers, modify the
              value of the Kudu Tablet Server Core Dump Directory property.
