Kudu architecture in a CDP private cloud base deployment
In a CDP Private Cloud Base deployment, Kudu is available as one of the Cloudera
  services. To use Kudu, install Kudu in your cluster along with other services such as Spark and
  Impala, and optional dependencies, such as HDFS or ZooKeeper.
The following diagram shows a typical CDP Private Cloud Base cluster deployed on Bare Metal.
   The base cluster is managed through Cloudera Manager. Kudu shares master and data nodes on the
   base cluster with Kudu Master Services running on master nodes and Kudu Tablet Service running on
   data nodes. The following diagram explains the logical setup of Kudu service:

Recommendations for using Kudu in a CDP Private Cloud Base deployment:
Master nodes
Use two separate disks; one for Kudu Master Data and another for Kudu Master WAL.
If workloads are SLA driven, then consider using NVME/SSD for Kudu Master WAL disk.

Data nodes
Share disks between Kudu Tablet service and HDFS service. An example setup is as
                    follows:
Disk 01
/data01/hdfs-data/
/data01/kudu-data/

Disk 02
/data02/hdfs-data/
/data02/kudu-data/


For Kudu Tablet WAL, a dedicated disk is always recommended.
If workloads are SLA driven, then consider using NVME/SSD for Kudu Tablet WAL
                  disk.


Use the recommendations provided in the Hardware Requirements section while deploying a
          compute cluster with Kudu.
