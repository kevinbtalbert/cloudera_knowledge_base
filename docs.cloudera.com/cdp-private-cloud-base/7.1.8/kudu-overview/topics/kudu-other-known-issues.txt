Other known issues
Some of the known bugs and issues with the current release of Kudu are listedmin this
  topic. These will be addressed in later releases. Note that this list is not exhaustive, and is
  meant to communicate only the most important known issues.

If the Kudu master is configured with the -log_force_fsync_all option, the
    tablet servers and the clients will experience frequent timeouts, and the cluster may become
    unusable.
If a tablet server has a very large number of tablets, it may take several minutes to start
    up. It is recommended to limit the number of tablets per server to 1000 or fewer. Consider this
    limitation when pre-splitting your tables. If you notice slow start-up times, you can monitor
    the number of tablets per server in the web UI.
