File descriptors
Processes are allotted a maximum number of open file descriptors (also referred to as
    fds). If a tablet server attempts to open too many fds, it will typically crash with a message
    saying something like "too many open files".
The
      following table summarizes the sources of file descriptor usage in a Kudu tablet server
      process: 
Table 1. Tablet server file descriptor usage

                File cache
              

                Fixed by --block_manager_max_open_files (default 40% of process
                maximum)
              

                Maximum allowed open fds reserved for use by the file cache.
              



                Hot replicas
              

                2 per WAL segment, 1 per WAL index
              

                Number of fds used by hot replicas. See below for more explanation.
              



                Cold replicas
              

                3 per cold replica
              

                Number of fds used per cold replica: 2 for the single WAL segment and 1 for the
                single WAL index.
              



        Every replica has at least one WAL segment and at least one WAL index, and should have
        the same number of segments and indices; however, the number of segments and indices can
        be greater for a replica if one of its peer replicas is falling behind. WAL segment and
        index fds are closed as WALs are garbage collected.
      

        Using this information for the example load gives the following breakdown of file
        descriptor usage, under the assumption that some replicas are lagging and using 10 WAL
        segments:

                Amount
              




                file cache
              

                40% * 32000 fds = 12800 fds
              



                1600 cold replicas
              

                1600 cold replicas * 3 fds / cold replica = 4800 fds
              



                200 hot replicas
              

                (2 / segment * 10 segments/hot replica * 200 hot replicas) + (1 / index * 10
                indices / hot replica * 200 hot replicas) = 6000 fds
              



                Total
              

                23600 fds
              



        So for this example, the tablet server process has about 32000 - 23600 = 8400 fds to
        spare.
      

        There is typically no downside to configuring a higher file descriptor limit if
        approaching the currently configured limit.
