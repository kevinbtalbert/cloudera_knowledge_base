Memory
The flag --memory_limit_hard_bytes
    determines the maximum amount of memory that a Kudu tablet server may use. The amount of memory
    used by a tablet server scales with data size, write workload, and read concurrency.
The
      following table provides numbers that can be used to compute a rough estimate of memory
      usage:
Table 1. Tablet server memory usage


                Type
              

                Multiplier
              

                Description
              




                Memory required per TB of data on disk
              

                1.5GB per 1TB data on disk
              

                Amount of memory per unit of data on disk required for basic operation of the
                tablet server.
              



                Hot Replicas' MemRowSets and DeltaMemStores
              

                minimum 128MB per hot replica
              

                Minimum amount of data to flush per MemRowSet flush. For most use cases, updates
                should be rare compared to inserts, so the DeltaMemStores should be very small.
              



                Scans
              

                256KB per column per core for read-heavy tables
              

                Amount of memory used by scanners, and which will be constantly needed for
                tables which are constantly read.
              



                Block Cache
              

                Fixed by --block_cache_capacity_mb(default 512MB)
              

                Amount of memory reserved for use by the block cache.
              


Using
      this information for the example load gives the following breakdown of memory usage: 
Table 2. Example tablet server memory usage


                Type
              

                Amount
              




                8TB data on disk
              

                8TB * 1.5GB / 1TB = 12GB
              



                200 hot replicas
              

                200 * 128MB = 25.6GB
              



                1 40-column, frequently-scanned table
              

                40 * 40 * 256KB = 409.6MB
              



                Block Cache
              

--block_cache_capacity_mb=512 = 512MB
              



                Expected memory usage
              

                38.5GB
              



                Recommended hard limit
              

                52GB
              



        Using this as a rough estimate of Kudu’s memory usage, select a memory limit so that
        the expected memory usage of Kudu is around 50-75% of the hard limit.
      

Verifying if a memory limit is sufficientAfter configuring an appropriate memory limit with --memory_limit_hard_bytes, run a workload and       monitor the Kudu tablet server process’s RAM usage. The memory usage should stay around 50-75%       of the hard limit, with occasional spikes above 75% but below 100%. If the tablet server runs       above 75% consistently, the memory limit should be increased.Parent topic: Scaling Kudu
