Partitioning examples
To illustrate the factors and tradeoffs associated with designing a partitioning
    strategy for a table, we will walk through some different partitioning scenarios.
Consider
      the following table schema for storing machine metrics data (using SQL syntax and
      date-formatted timestamps for clarity): 
CREATE TABLE metrics (
    host STRING NOT NULL,
    metric STRING NOT NULL,
    time INT64 NOT NULL,
    value DOUBLE NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (host, metric, time)
);

Range partitioningA natural way to partition the metrics   table is to range partition on the time column.   Letâ€™s assume that we want to have a partition per year, and the table will hold data for 2014,   2015, and 2016. There are at least two ways that the table could be partitioned: with unbounded   range partitions, or with bounded range partitions.Hash partitioningAnother way of partitioning the metrics   table is to hash partition on the host and    metric columns.Hash and range partitioningThe previous examples showed how the metrics table could be range partitioned on the time column, or hash partitioned on the host and metric columns. These   strategies have associated strength and weaknesses: Hash and hash partitioningKudu can support any number of hash partitioning levels in the same table, as long as   the levels have no hashed columns in common.Parent topic: Partitioning
