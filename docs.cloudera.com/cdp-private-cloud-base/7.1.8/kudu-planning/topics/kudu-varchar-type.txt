Varchar type
The varchar type is a UTF-8 encoded string (up to 64KB uncompressed)
  with a fixed maximum character length. This type is especially useful when migrating from or
  integrating with legacy systems that support the varchar type. If a maximum
  character length is not required the string type should be used
  instead.
The varchar type is a parameterized type that takes a length attribute.
Length represents the maximum number of UTF-8 characters allowed. Values with characters
   greater than the limit will be truncated. This value must be between 1 and 65535 and has no
   default. Note that some other systems may represent the length limit in bytes instead of
   characters. That means that Kudu may be able to represent longer values in the case of multi-byte
   UTF-8 characters.
