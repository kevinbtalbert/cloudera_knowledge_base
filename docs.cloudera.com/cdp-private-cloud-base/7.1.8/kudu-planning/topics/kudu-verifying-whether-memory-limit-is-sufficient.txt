Verifying if a memory limit is sufficient
After configuring an appropriate memory limit with --memory_limit_hard_bytes, run a workload and
      monitor the Kudu tablet server process’s RAM usage. The memory usage should stay around 50-75%
      of the hard limit, with occasional spikes above 75% but below 100%. If the tablet server runs
      above 75% consistently, the memory limit should be increased.
Additionally, it’s also useful to monitor the logs for memory rejections, which look like:
         Service unavailable: Soft memory limit exceeded (at 96.35% of capacity)


          And watch the memory rejections metrics:
        



leader_memory_pressure_rejections




follower_memory_pressure_rejections




transaction_memory_pressure_rejections




          Occasional rejections due to memory pressure are fine and act as backpressure to
          clients. Clients will transparently retry operations. However, no operations should
          time out.
