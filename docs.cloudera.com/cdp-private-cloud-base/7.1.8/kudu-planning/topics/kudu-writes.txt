Support for COMMIT_WAIT is
      experimental and requires careful tuning of the time-synchronization protocol, such as NTP
      (Network Time Protocol). Its use in production environments is discouraged.
Recommendation
If external consistency is a requirement and you decide to use COMMIT_WAIT, the time-synchronization protocol
         needs to be tuned carefully. Each transaction will wait 2x the maximum clock error at the
         time of execution, which is usually in the 100 msec. to 1 sec. range with the default
         settings, maybe more. Thus, transactions would take at least 200 msec. to 2 sec. to
         complete when using the default settings and may even time out.


 A local server should be used as a time server. We have performed
               experiments using the default NTP time source available in a Google Compute Engine
               data center and were able to obtain a reasonable tight max error bound, usually
               varying between 12-17 milliseconds. 


 The following parameters should be adjusted in /etc/ntp.conf to tighten the maximum
               error: 



server my_server.org iburst minpoll 1
                        maxpoll 8
