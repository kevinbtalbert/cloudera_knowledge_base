Backup directory structure
The backup directory structure in the rootPath is considered an
  internal detail and could change in future versions of Kudu. Additionally, the format and content
  of the data and metadata files is meant for the backup and restore process only and could change
  in future versions of Kudu. That said, understanding the structure of the backup
   rootPath and how it is used can be useful when working with Kudu
  backups.
The backup directory structure in the rootPath is as
    follows:/<rootPath>/<tableId>-<tableName>/<backup-id>/
   .kudu-metadata.json
   part-*.<format>

rootPath: Can be used to distinguish separate backup groups, jobs, or
      concerns


tableId: The unique internal ID of the table being backed up


tableName: The name of the table being backed up


Note: Table names are URL encoded to prevent pathing issues




backup-id: A way to uniquely identify/group the data for a single backup
      run


.kudu-metadata.json: Contains all of the metadata to support recreating the
      table, linking backups by time, and handling data format changes
Written last so that failed backups will not have a metadata file and will not be considered
      at restore time or backup linking time.


part-*.<format>: The data files containing the tables data.


Currently 1 part file per Kudu partition


Incremental backups contain an additional “RowAction” byte column at the end


Currently the only supported format/suffix is parquet
