Physical backups of an entire node
Kudu does not provide a built-in physical backup and restore functionality yet.
        However, it is possible to create a physical backup of a Kudu node (either tablet server or
        master) and restore it later.


note
The node to be backed up must be offline during the procedure, or else the
                        backed up (or restored) data will be inconsistent.
Certain aspects of the Kudu node (such as its hostname) are embedded in the
                        on-disk data. As such, itâ€™s not yet possible to restore a physical backup of
                        a node onto another machine.




Stop all Kudu processes in the cluster. This prevents the tablets on the backed
                    up node from being rereplicated elsewhere unnecessarily.

If creating a backup, make a copy of the WAL, metadata, and data directories on
                    each node to be backed up. It is important that this copy preserve all file
                    attributes as well as sparseness.

If restoring from a backup, delete the existing WAL, metadata, and data
                    directories, then restore the backup via move or copy. As with creating a
                    backup, it is important that the restore preserve all file attributes and
                    sparseness.

Start all Kudu processes in the cluster.
