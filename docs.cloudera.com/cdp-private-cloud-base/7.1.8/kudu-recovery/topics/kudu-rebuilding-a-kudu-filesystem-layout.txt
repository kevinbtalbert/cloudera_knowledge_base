Rebuild a Kudu filesystem layout
In the event that critical files are lost, i.e. WALs or tablet-specific metadata, all
    Kudu directories on the server must be deleted and rebuilt to ensure correctness. Doing so will
    destroy the copy of the data for each tablet replica hosted on the local server. Kudu will
    automatically re-replicate tablet replicas removed in this way, provided the replication factor
    is at least three and all other servers are online and healthy.

note These steps use a tablet server as an example, but the steps are the same for Kudu
        master servers. 
warning If multiple nodes need their FS layouts rebuilt, wait until all replicas
        previously hosted on each node have finished automatically re-replicating elsewhere before
        continuing. Failure to do so can result in permanent data loss. 
note Before proceeding, ensure the contents of the directories are backed
        up, either as a copy or in the form of other tablet replicas. 


The first step to rebuilding a server with a new directory configuration is emptying
          all of the server’s existing directories. For example, if a tablet server is configured
          with --fs_wal_dir=/data/0/kudu-tserver-wal,
            --fs_metadata_dir=/data/0/kudu-tserver-meta, and
            --fs_data_dirs=/data/1/kudu-tserver,/data/2/kudu-tserver, the following
          commands will remove the WAL directory’s and data directories' contents: 

# Note: this will delete all of the data from the local tablet server.
$ rm -rf /data/0/kudu-tserver-wal/* /data/0/kudu-tserver-meta/* /data/1/kudu-tserver/* /data/2/kudu-tserver/*


If using Cloudera Manager, update the configurations for the rebuilt server to include
          only the desired directories. Make sure to only update the configurations of servers to
          which changes were applied, rather than of the entire Kudu service.

After directories are deleted, the server process can be started with the new directory
          configuration. The appropriate sub-directories will be created by Kudu upon starting
          up.
