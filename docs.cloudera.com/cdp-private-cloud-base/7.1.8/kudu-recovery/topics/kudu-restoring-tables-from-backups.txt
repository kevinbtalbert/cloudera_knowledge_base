Restore tables from backupsCloudera Docs
Restore tables from backups
You can use the KuduRestore Spark job to restore one or more Kudu
  tables. For each backed up table, the KuduRestore job restores the full backup
  and each associated incremental backup until the full table state is restored.
Restoring the full series of full and incremental backups is possible because the backups are
   linked via the from_ms and to_ms fields in the backup metadata.
   By default the restore job will create tables with the same name as the table that was backed up.
   If you want to side-load the tables without affecting the existing tables, you can pass the
    --tableSuffix flag to append a suffix to each restored table.
Following are the common flags that are used when restoring the tables:
--rootPath: The root path to the backup data. Accepts any Spark-compatible
            path.See Backup directory structure  for the directory structure used in
            the rootPath.
--kuduMasterAddresses: Comma-separated addresses of Kudu masters. The
     default value is localhost.
--createTables: If set to true, the restore process creates the tables. Set
     it to false if the target tables already exist. The default value is
      true.
--tableSuffix: If set, it adds a suffix to the restored table names. Only
     used when createTables is true.
--timestampMs: A UNIX timestamp in milliseconds that defines the latest
     time to use when selecting restore candidates. The default is
      System.currentTimeMillis().
<table>…​: A list of tables to restore.
noteYou can see the full list of the job options by passing the --help
    flag.
Following is an example of a KuduRestore job execution which restores the
   tables foo and bar from the HDFS directory
    kudu-backups:spark-submit --class org.apache.kudu.backup.KuduRestore kudu-backup2_2.11-1.12.0.jar \
  --kuduMasterAddresses master1-host,master-2-host,master-3-host \
  --rootPath hdfs:///kudu-backups \
  foo bar
