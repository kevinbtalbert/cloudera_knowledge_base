Kudu authentication tokens
After authenticating to a secure cluster, the Kudu client will automatically request
    an authentication token from the Kudu master. An authentication token encapsulates the identity
    of the authenticated user and carries the Kudu master's RSA signature so that its authenticity
    can be verified. This token will be used to authenticate subsequent connections. 
By
      default, authentication tokens are only valid for seven days, so that even if a token were
      compromised, it cannot be used indefinitely. For the most part, authentication tokens should
      be completely transparent to users. By using authentication tokens, Kudu is able to take
      advantage of strong authentication, without paying the scalability cost of communicating with
      a central authority for every connection. 

          When used with distributed compute frameworks such as Apache Spark, authentication
          tokens can simplify configuration and improve security. For example, the Kudu Spark
          connector will automatically retrieve an authentication token during the planning
          stage, and distribute the token to tasks. This allows Spark to work against a secure
          Kudu cluster where only the planner node has Kerberos credentials.
