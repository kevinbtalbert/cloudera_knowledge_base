Kudu authentication with Kerberos
You can configure authentication on Kudu servers. Authentication in Kudu is designed to interoperate with other secure Hadoop components by utilizing Kerberos. 
The --rpc_authentication flag is used to configure authentication
      on Kudu servers. In a Cloudera Manager managed cluster that flag is configured using the
        Enable Secure Authentication And Encryption property. This property
      can have the following values:
Optional: Kudu will attempt to use strong authentication, but
          will allow unauthenticated connections. The connection between servers will be encrypted.
          This is the default value which is indicated by a clear checkbox.
Required: Kudu will reject connections from clients and servers
          who lack authentication credentials. If you want to secure your cluster you have to set
          the --rpc_authentication flag to this value, meaning that you have to
          select the Enable Secure Authentication And Encryption
          property.
