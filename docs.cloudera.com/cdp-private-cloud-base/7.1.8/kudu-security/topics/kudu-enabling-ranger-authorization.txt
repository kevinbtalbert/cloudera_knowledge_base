Enabling Ranger authorization
You can configure fine-grained authorization using Apache Ranger. This topic provides
        the steps to enable Kudu's integration with Ranger from Cloudera Manager.

From Cloudera Manager, go to Clusters > Kudu > Configurations.

Select the Ranger Service with which Kudu should
                    authorize requests.

If Ranger high-availability is enabled for the cluster, add a Kudu service
                    repository with the following configurations through the Ranger Admin web UI is
                    required: 

# This example setup configures the Kudu service user as a privileged user to be
# able to retrieve authorization policies stored in Ranger.

<property>
  <name>policy.download.auth.users</name>
  <value>kudu</value>
</property>

The name of the added Kudu service repository needs to match the one specified
                    in ranger.plugin.kudu.service.name of the Ranger client
                        ranger-kudu-security.xml configuration file. 

noteWhen a Kudu client opens a table, the Kudu Master
                        will authorize all possible actions the user may want to perform on the
                        given table (ALL, and if it’s not allowed, then INSERT, SELECT, UDPATE,
                        DELETE). This results in auditing these requests when a client opens a
                        table, even if they’ll never do any of these operations.
