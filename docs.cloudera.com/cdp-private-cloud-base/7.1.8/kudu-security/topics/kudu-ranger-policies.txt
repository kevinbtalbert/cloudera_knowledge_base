Ranger policies for Kudu
There are two Kudu related Ranger policies which are applied based on how you are
  accessing Kudu.
There are two resource-based services in Ranger that are used in relation to Kudu:
    cm_kudu and Hadoop SQL.
The Kudu service and its connected clients, such as Spark, native C++, and Java clients, use
   the cm_kudu resource-based service. 
The Hadoop SQL resource-based service is used by Hive and Impala when Kudu is
   accessed through them.
When Kudu is accessed by Impala, the Impala service performs actions as the
    impala user in Kudu. The impala user is set as a trusted user
   in Kudu, meaning that privilege checks are completely bypassed and the impala user is granted
   full access. As a result, the cm_kudu resource-based service is not applied,
   only the Hadoop SQL resource-based service is used to check for permission and
   privileges.
As a result, when you are accessing Kudu through Hive or Impala, you must ensure that all
      applicable permission and privileges are configured in the Hadoop SQL
      resource-based service.noteRanger provides a client side cache that
        uses privileges and can periodically poll the privilege store for any changes. When a change
        is detected, the cache is automatically updated.
