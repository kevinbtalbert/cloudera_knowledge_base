Kudu authorization tokens
Learn about authorization tokens which are used by Ranger to propagate and check privileges.
Rather than having every tablet server communicate directly with the underlying authorization
   service (Ranger), privileges are propagated and checked via authorization tokens. These tokens
   encapsulate what privileges a user has on a given table. Tokens are generated by the master and
   returned to Kudu clients upon opening a Kudu table. Kudu clients automatically attach
   authorization tokens when sending requests to tablet servers.
Authorization tokens are a means to limit the number of nodes directly accessing the
   authorization service to retrieve privileges. As such, since the expected number of tablet
   servers in a cluster is much higher than the number of Kudu masters, they are only used to
   authorize requests sent to tablet servers. Kudu masters fetch privileges directly from the
   authorization service or cache.
Similar to the validity interval for authentication tokens, to limit the window of potential
   unwanted access if a token becomes compromised, authorization tokens are valid for five minutes
   by default. The acquisition and renewal of a token is hidden from the user, as Kudu clients
   automatically retrieve new tokens when existing tokens expire.
When a tablet server that has been configured to enforce fine-grained access control receives a
   request, it checks the privileges in the attached token, rejecting it if the privileges are not
   sufficient to perform the requested operation, or if it is invalid (e.g. expired).
