Kudu security considerations
Kudu includes security features that allow Kudu clusters to be hardened against access
      from unauthorized users. 
Kudu uses strong authentication with Kerberos, and authorization with Ranger.
         Communication between Kudu clients and servers, and between servers to other servers, can
         be encrypted with TLS. Kudu also supports HTTPS on the web UI.
These security features should work seamlessly in Impala as well, as long as Impalaâ€™s user
         is given permission to access Kudu.
