Upgrading Cloudera Manager might fail if Cloudera Manager is running the

                cluster.


Before upgrading Cloudera Manager, you must remove any Storage Operations roles
                from the Core Configuration service as follows:
Log in to the Cloudera Manager server host. 
Run the following command to stop the Cloudera
                      Manager
                    Server.sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-server

                    database using one of the following commands:
MySQL/MariaDB: mysql -u root -p
PostgreSQL: sudo -u postgres psql
Oracle: sqlplus system@localhost

Run the following SQL queries:
select ROLE_ID from ROLES where ROLE_TYPE='STORAGEOPERATIONS';The
                        query returns a set of ROLD_ID values. For each ROLE_ID, run the following
                        SQL
                        commands:delete from CONFIGS where ROLE_ID=<ROLE_ID>;
