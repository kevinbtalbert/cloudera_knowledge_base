OPSAPS-65706: ZooKeeper fails to restart after
            rollback

ZooKeeper server role fails to restart when you perform a rollback from Cloudera
              Manager 7.7.3 version to Cloudera Manager versions lower than 7.7.3.
The reason for ZooKeeper restart to fail is that post a rollback operation the
              previous versionâ€™s ZooKeeper process starts and does not allow to start ZooKeeper
              process after rollback (as only 1 ZooKeeper process is allowed to stay running on the
                host).importantThis behavior is first seen with
                Zookeeper, however, the same problem applies to other roles on the host. After
                fixing Zookeeper role as mentioned in the below workaround, the following service
                role in the startup sequence also fails to start. In order to restart the cluster,
                apply the workaround to all roles on each host.


To restore the ZooKeeper server role to a running state, perform the below steps on
              all the hosts when the ZooKeeper server role fails to restart: 
Run the following command to list the roles on the current
                  host:sudo /opt/cloudera/cm-agent/bin/supervisorctl -c /run/cloudera-scm-agent/supervisor/supervisord.conf status
Find the failing role in the above list, then run the following command to stop
                  the
                  role:sudo /opt/cloudera/cm-agent/bin/supervisorctl -c /run/cloudera-scm-agent/supervisor/supervisord.conf
supervisor> stop 123-zookeeper-server 
supervisor> remove 123-zookeeper-server 
supervisor> exit
Replace the role id "123" with the appropriate number from the list in
                  step 1.
Run the following command to terminate the Zookeeper processes by finding the
                  PIDs:sudo ps -ef | grep -i zookeeper
Run the following command to remove the supervisor.conf of
                  ZooKeeper from
                  supervisor:rm /run/cloudera-scm-agent/supervisor/include/123-zookeeper-server.conf
sudo kill -9 <PIDS obtained from the previous command>
Run the following command to refresh the
                  configurations:sudo /opt/cloudera/cm-agent/bin/supervisorctl -c /run/cloudera-scm-agent/supervisor/supervisord.conf reread
Start the ZooKeeper service from the Cloudera Manager UI.
