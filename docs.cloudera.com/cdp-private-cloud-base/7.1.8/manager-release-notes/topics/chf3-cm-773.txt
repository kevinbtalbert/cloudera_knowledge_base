Following are the list of fixed issues that were shipped for Cloudera Manager 7.7.3 CHF3
      (version: 7.7.3-h3-40765691):

OPSAPS-65999: cert.py has
            Python 3 compatibility issues and an error occurs while performing any certificate
            generation and rotation operations
Fixed an issue in cert-manager code that decoded output
            from native OS commands. When Cloudera Manager attempts operations related to
            certificate generation or rotation, those operations may fail. Errors in the log file
            will indicate problems with string decoding. Running the cert-manager script directly
            from the CLI would also result in string decoding errors.



OPSAPS-67130: Log4J 1.2.17 replaced with
            Reload4J
In this release, Cloudera has replaced all Apache Log4j
            1.2.x logging libraries included with Cloudera Manager 7.7.3 Cumulative hotfix 2 with
            equivalent Reload4j libraries.
