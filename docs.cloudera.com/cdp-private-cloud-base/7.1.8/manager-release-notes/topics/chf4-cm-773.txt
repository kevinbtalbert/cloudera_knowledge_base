OPSAPS-59723: Extra step required when using
              Cloudera Manager Trial installer on SLES 15 SP4
When using
                cloudera-manager-installer.bin to install a trial version of
              Cloudera Manager, the installation will fail.
Before running
                cloudera-manager-installer.bin, run the following command:
SUSEConnect --list-extensions
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-legacy/15.4/x86_64
zypper install libncurses5



OPSAPS-65243: Diagnostic data collection for
              YARN fails
Selecting Collect Diagnostic
                Data from the YARN > Applications page fails to generate the diagnostic data.
None


Following are the list of fixed issues that were shipped for Cloudera Manager 7.7.3 CHF4
        (version: 7.7.3-h2-40943658)

OPSAPS-67130: Log4J 1.2.17 replaced with
              Reload4J
In this release, Cloudera has replaced all Apache Log4j
              1.2.x logging libraries included with Cloudera Manager 7.7.3 Cumulative hotfix 2 with
              equivalent Reload4j libraries.


OPSAPS-51761: YARN task failures after
              upgrading to CDH 6.2.0 (Invalid arguments for cgroups resources:
                /var/log/hadoop-yarn/container)
Fixed an issue during upgrade in YARN, where the
              upgraded container-executor binary is not copied due to the container-executor file
              being used by running applications.


OPSAPS-65242: Alert Server Event cleanup
              issue
Fixed an issue where an Event Server cleanup did not
              work properly and now it works as intended, uses less CPU and keeps the events within
              the requested limits.


OPSAPS-65999: cert.py has Python 3
              compatibility issues and an error occurs while performing any certificate generation
              and rotation operations
Fixed an issue in cert-manager code that decoded output
              from native OS commands. When Cloudera Manager attempts operations related to
              certificate generation or rotation, those operations may fail. Errors in the log file
              will indicate problems with string decoding. Running the cert-manager script directly
              from the CLI would also result in string decoding errors.


OPSAPS-66689: Hue logs get overwritten
              without a clear root cause
In previous implementations, multiple file handlers
              would write to a single log file, causing the Hue logs to be overwritten. Hue now uses
              a socket handler, which solves this problem.


OPSAPS-67080: Earlier, gathering Kudu
              diagnostic information within Cloudera Manager failed.
Now, gathering Kudu diagnostic information within
              Cloudera Manager no longer fails and works as expected..
