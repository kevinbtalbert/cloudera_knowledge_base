Following are the list of fixed issues that were shipped for Cloudera Manager 7.7.1 CHF5
      (version: 7.7.1-h2-38419853)



OPSAPS-61474: Knox token API call failed
                with a 404 error while fetching the Knox token using token API in the Knox homepage
                topology

Fixed an issue where Knox's data/applications folder gets recreated every time
                  when Knox service starts.







OPSAPS-51761: YARN task failures after
                upgrading to CDH 6.2.0 (Invalid arguments for cgroups resources:
                  /var/log/hadoop-yarn/container)

Fixed an issue during upgrade in YARN, where the upgraded container-executor
                  binary is not copied due to the container-executor file being used by running
                  applications.







OPSAPS-59363: TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols
                are out-of-date and contain security vulnerabilities
This issue has been fixed by disabling the old TLS
                (1.0 and 1.1) protocols for every JVM started by Cloudera Manager and upgrading to a
                higher version of the protocol (1.2 or 1.3). Cloudera Manager now only supports TLS
                1.2 for Java 8. For Java 11 and higher versions, Cloudera Manager supports TLS 1.2
                and TLS 1.3.
