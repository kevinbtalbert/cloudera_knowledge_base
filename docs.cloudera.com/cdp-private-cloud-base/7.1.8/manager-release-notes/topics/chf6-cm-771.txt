OPSAPS-63558
Previously, DistCp did not correctly report renames
                and deletes in case of snapshot diff-based HDFS replications. This change extends
                DistCp's output report to contain counters related to snapshot diff-based
                replications beside the already reported counters. These counters are added to the
                following group: com.cloudera.enterprise.distcp.DistCpSyncCounter.
The following new counters are added:
FILES_MOVED_TO_COMMON_TEMP_DIR: Number of files and directories moved to a
                    common temporary directory to be renamed or deleted later in the process. This
                    counter is the sum of FILES_DELETED_VIA_COMMON_TEMP_DIR and
                    FILES_RENAMED_VIA_COMMON_TEMP_DIR.
FILES_DELETED_VIA_COMMON_TEMP_DIR: Number of files moved to a common temporary
                    directory to be deleted later. 
FILES_RENAMED_VIA_COMMON_TEMP_DIR: Number of files moved to a common temporary
                    directory first, then moved to their final place.
FILES_DIRECT_DELETED: Number of files deleted directly. This is a feature
                    introduced in OPSAPS-63759.
FILES_DIRECT_RENAMED: Number of files renamed directly, without moving to an
                    intermediate temporary directory. This is a feature introduced in
                    OPSAPS-63930.
FILES_DIRECT_RENAMED_VIA_TEMP_LOCATION: Number of files moved to an
                    intermediate temporary directory and then renamed. This intermediate temporary
                    directory is different from the common temporary directory referenced in the
                    FILES_RENAMED_VIA_COMMON_TEMP_DIR counter's description. This is also related to
                    OPSAPS-63930.
The common temporary directory is a sibling of the replication target
                directory.
The values of FILES_DELETED_VIA_COMMON_TEMP_DIR and
                FILES_DIRECT_DELETED are also aggregated in the replication result as the number of
                files deleted.






OPSAPS-65131
When you enter incorrect volume or bucket details in
                an Ozone replication policy, an error appears and you are logged out of Cloudera
                Manager. This issue is fixed. 
When you enter incorrect volume or bucket details, an
                error appears and you are not logged out of Cloudera Manager.






OPSAPS-66023: Error message about an
                unsupported ciphersuite while upgrading or installing cluster with the latest FIPS
                compliance

When upgrading or installing a FIPS enabled cluster, Cloudera Manager is unable
                  to download the new CDP parcel from the Cloudera parcel archive.
Cloudera Manager displays the following error message:
HTTP ERROR 400 java.net.ConnectException: Unsupported ciphersuite
                    TLS_EDH_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

This issue is fixed now by correcting the incorrect
                ciphersuite selection.






OPSAPS-66107
Avoiding unnecessary Resource Manager scheduled
                refresh in Global Pools Refresh command. During Autoscaling in the public cloud, the
                scheduled Global Pools refresh command was causing conflicts with the Resource
                Manager refresh command that is triggered by commission and decommission commands of
                Yarn service (which caused Autoscale failures as the Resource Manager refresh
                command was not available). This issue is fixed now.
