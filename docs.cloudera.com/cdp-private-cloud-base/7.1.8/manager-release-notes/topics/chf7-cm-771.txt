Following are the list of fixed issues that were shipped for Cloudera Manager 7.7.1 CHF7
      (version: 7.7.1-h7-39964696):



OPSAPS-64429-Failure on template import if
                StubDFS created before CORE_SETTINGS
If the service of type CORE_SETTINGS was explicitly
                defined in a cluster template, you could run into a failure to import such template.
                This issue is fixed now.






OPSAPS-64526
When Cloudera Manager is configured to use PAM as an
                external authentication provider (for logins to Cloudera Manager), if a valid
                username is denied due to password expiration, then Cloudera Manager will deny all
                future login attempts for any username. This issue is fixed now.






OPSAPS-65267

Cross-site sessions were prohibited in the latest browsers because of SameSite
                  header by default was set to Lax. This issue is fixed now by adding SameSite=None
                  with a secure attribute for the session cookies that are created after login so
                  that cross-site secure cookies are supported.
The secure attribute works only with TLS-configured clusters. You must have a
                  TLS-enabled cluster for cross-site sessions to work.







NAV-7341-Spark extractor issues with HDFS
                namespace

When Navigator is installed and started with CDP installation, the
                  Agent could move Spark lineage files out of the lineage directory which are not
                  processed by Navigator. This issue is fixed now.
