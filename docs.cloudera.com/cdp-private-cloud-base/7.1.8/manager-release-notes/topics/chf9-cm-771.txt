Following are the list of fixed issues that were shipped for Cloudera Manager 7.7.1 CHF9
      (version: 7.7.1-h9-40960082):

OPSAPS-67152: Cloudera Manager does not allow you to update some
            configuration parameters. 

Cloudera Manager does not allow you to set to "0" for the
                dfs_access_time_precision and
                dfs_namenode_accesstime_precision configuration parameters.
You will not be able to update dfs_access_time_precision and
                dfs_namenode_accesstime_precision to "0". If you try to enter "0"
              in these configuration input fields, then the field gets cleared off and results in a
              validation error: This field is required. This issue is
              fixed now.



OPSAPS-59824: Set
              hive.hook.proto.base-directory for HMS by default

The hive.hook.proto.base-directory property, which is present
              for Hive on Tez (HiveServer2) was not available for the Hive metastore. Due to this,
              the HiveProtoEventsCleanerTask does not run and clean the old proto
              data.
This issue is now fixed and the hive.hook.proto.base-directory
              property is available in Cloudera Manager under Clusters  > HIVE-1 > Configuration with a default value of
                /warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive/sys.db/query_data/.
