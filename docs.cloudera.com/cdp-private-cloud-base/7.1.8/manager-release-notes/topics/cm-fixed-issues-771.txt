Fixed an issue where the Event Server failed
          to start after a Cloudera Manager upgrade if the value of any event
          attribute (for example, content, stack trace) was longer than 32766
          UTF-8 bytes. 


Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-63653: Validation
          on HDFS service to show Error if user selects wrong config to Enablegc
          Ranger plugin
An error will display if both RANGER and
          RANGER_AUTH_ENABLED configurations are enabled Only one should be
          enabled at a time. 


Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-63953: The
          authzmigrator authz_export.sh script hardcodes JAVA_HOME to
