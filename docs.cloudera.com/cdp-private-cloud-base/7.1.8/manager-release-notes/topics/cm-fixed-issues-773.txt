Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-64287 New
          configuration parameter for Data Analytics Studio to configure header
          size.
Data Analytics Studio (DAS) has a new,
          optional parameter named
            das_application_connector_configs to configure
          header size. 


Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-63881 Permissions
          of user directories under /var/lib/ is 700 on RHEL 8.4
This issue applies only when RHEL 8.4 or
          higher is used. In these versions the 
            /etc/login.defs file has HOME_MODE configured with 700
          permissions. Due to this, service directories were incorrectly created
          with 700 permissions.
