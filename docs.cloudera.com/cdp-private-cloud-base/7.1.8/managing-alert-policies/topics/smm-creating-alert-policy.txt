You can use Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) to create an alert policy in your
        environment.

Perform the following steps to create an alert policy:


From the left navigation pane, select Alerts.
The Alerts Overview page appears.

Click ALERT POLICIES.

Click ADD NEW to create a new alert policy.
The Alert Policy window appears.

Configure the following properties:

EXECUTION INTERVAL IN SECONDS
Enter the execution interval in seconds to run the alert
                                        policy periodically after the given time interval.


EXECUTION DELAY IN SECONDS
Enter the execution delay in seconds to delay the
                                        execution of the alert policy. This is applicable only when

                                        Ideally, this value should not be less than the value you
