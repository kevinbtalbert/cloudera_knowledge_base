Accessing the License Page
To access the license page, click
        Administration > License.
Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
If you have a license installed, the license page indicates its status (for example, whether
      your license is currently valid) and displays the license details: the license owner, the
      license key, the license start date, the expiration date, and the deactivation date. Typically
      the expiration date is the same as the deactivation date, at which point the Admin Console is
      no longer accessible. If the license expires, your clusters and data are unaffected.
