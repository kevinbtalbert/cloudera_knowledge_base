Adding a Host to a Cluster
Steps to add hosts to a cluster.
Minimum Required Role:
Full
            Administrator. This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
You can add one or more hosts to your cluster using the Add Hosts wizard,
      which installs the Oracle JDK, Cloudera Runtime, and Cloudera Manager
      Agent software. After the software is installed and the Cloudera Manager
      Agent is started, the Agent connects to the Cloudera Manager Server and
      you can use the Cloudera Manager Admin Console to manage and monitor
      Cloudera Runtime on the new host.
noteIf the server on which Cloudera Manager is running is damaged or
      cannot be repaired, Cloudera Manager instance can be recovered by installing Cloudera Manager
      on a new machine and connecting to the Cloudera Manager database. In case the Cloudera Manager
      server is down, refer to the KB article for more information.
The Add Hosts wizard does not create roles on the
      new host; once you have successfully added the host(s) you can either add
      roles, one service at a time, or apply a host template, which can define
      role configurations for multiple roles.
important
Unqualified hostnames (short names) must be unique in a Cloudera
          Manager instance. For example, you cannot have both
            host01.example.com and
            host01.standby.example.com managed by the same
          Cloudera Manager Server.
All hosts in a single cluster must be running the same version of
          Cloudera Runtime.
When you add a new host, you must install the same version of
          Cloudera Runtime to enable the new host to work with the other hosts
          in the cluster. The installation wizard lets you select the version of
          Cloudera Runtime to install, and you can choose a custom repository to
          ensure that the version you install matches the version on the other
          hosts.
If you are managing multiple clusters, select the version of
          Cloudera Runtime that matches the version in use on the cluster where
          you plan to add the new host.
When you add a new host, the following occurs:
YARN topology.map is updated to include the new
              host
Any service that includes topology.map in its configuration—Flume,
              Hive, Hue, Oozie, Solr, Spark,  YARN—is marked stale
At a convenient point after adding the host you should restart
          the stale services to pick up the new configuration.

Use one of the following methods to add a new host:

Parent topic: Managing Hosts
Using the Add Hosts Wizard to Add Hosts
You can use the Add Hosts wizard to install Cloudera Runtime,
      Impala, and the Cloudera Manager Agent on a host. There are additional
      considerations when TLS is enabled.

importantIf you have enabled TLS in the cluster you must
          use one of the following options:
If you enabled TLS using Auto TLS, then you can use the Add
              Hosts wizard in Cloudera Manager. 
If you have manually enabled TLS, you can either:
Install the Cloudera Manager Agent on the new hosts
                  manually. See Alternate Method of Installing Cloudera Manager Agent without Disabling TLS, below.
 Disable TLS before starting the Add Hosts wizard. You can
                  then re-enable TLS after adding the hosts. See Disable TLS Encryption or Authentication,
                  below.



Disable TLS Encryption or Authentication
If you have enabled TLS encryption or authentication for the Cloudera
          Manager Agents, you must disable both of them before starting the Add
          Hosts wizard. Otherwise, skip to the next step. 
If you perform this step, then skip step 2 (Alternate
            Method of Installing Cloudera Manager Agent without Disabling
            TLS).  If you skip step 1 and perform step 2, then continue
          to step 3 (Using the Add Hosts Wizard to Add Hosts).importantThis step temporarily puts the existing cluster
            hosts in an unmanageable state; they are still configured to use TLS
            and so cannot communicate with the Cloudera Manager Server. Roles on
            these hosts continue to operate normally, but Cloudera Manager is
            unable to detect errors and issues in the cluster and reports all
            hosts as being in bad health. To work around this issue, you can
            manually install the Cloudera Manager Agent on the new host. See
              Alternate Method of Installing Cloudera Manager Agent without Disabling TLS.

From the Administration tab, select Settings.
Select the Security category.
Disable TLS by clearing the following options: Use TLS
              Encryption for Agents, and Use TLS Authentication of Agents
              to Server.
Click Save Changes to save the settings.
Log in to the Cloudera Manager Server host.
Restart the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server



Alternate Method of Installing Cloudera Manager Agent without
          Disabling TLS
If you have TLS encryption or authentication enabled in your cluster,
          you must either disable TLS during the installation, or install the
          Cloudera Manager Agent manually using the following procedure:
Copy the repository configuration file from an existing host in
              the cluster to the new host. For example:

OS
Command



RHEL

sudo scp mynode.example.com:/etc/yum.repos.d/cloudera-manager.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudera-manager.repo



SLES

sudo scp mynode.example.com:/etc/zypp/zypper.conf/cloudera-cm.repo /etc/zypp/zypper.conf/cloudera-cm.repo



Ubuntu or Debian

sudo scp mynode.example.com:/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudera.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudera.list



Remove cached package lists and other transient data by running
              the following command:

OS
Command



RHEL

sudo yum clean all



SLES

sudo zypper clean --all



Ubuntu or Debian

sudo apt-get clean



Install the JDK package from the Cloudera Manager repository.
              Install the same version as is used on other cluster hosts. Only
              JDK 1.8 is supported:Table 1. Oracle JDK 1.8

OS
Command



RHEL

sudo yum install jdk1.8.0_144-cloudera



SLES

sudo zypper install jdk1.8.0_144-cloudera



Ubuntu or Debian

sudo apt-get install jdk1.8.0_144-cloudera


Open JDK

OpenJDK
                      11sudo zypper install java-11-openjdk-devel

Set up the TLS certificates using the same procedure that was
              used to set them up on other cluster hosts. See Configuring TLS Encryption for
                Cloudera Manager Using Auto-TLS. If you have set up a
              custom truststore, copy that file from an existing host to the
              same location on the new host. 
Install the Cloudera Manager Agent:

OS
Command



RHEL

sudo yum install cloudera-manager-agent



SLES

sudo zypper install cloudera-manager-agent



Ubuntu or Debian

sudo apt-get install cloudera-manager-agent



Copy the Cloudera Manager Agent configuration file from an
              existing cluster host that is already configured for TLS to the
              same location on the new host. For
              example:sudo scp mynode.example.com:/etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini
Create and secure the file containing the password used to
              protect the private key of the Agent:
Use a text editor to create a file called
                    agentkey.pw that contains the password.
                  Save the file in the /etc/cloudera-scm-agent
                  directory.
Change ownership of the file to
                  root:sudo chown root:root /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/agentkey.pw
Change the permissions of the
                  file:sudo chmod 440 /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/agentkey.pw

Start the Agent on the new host:
              sudo service cloudera-scm-agent start
Log in to Cloudera Manager and go to
                  Hosts > All
                  Hosts page and verify that the new
              host is recognized by Cloudera Manager.


Add Hosts to an Existing Cluster

Click the Hosts tab.
Click the Add Hosts button.
Select Add hosts to cluster.
If the cluster uses Kerberos
            authentication, ensure that the Kerberos packages are installed on
            the new hosts. If necessary, use the package commands provided on
            the Add Hosts screen to install these
            packages.
Select the cluster where you want to add the host from the
            drop-down list.
Click Continue.The
                Specify Hosts page displays. You can
              either add a new host to the cluster, or add an existing managed
              host to the cluster. Do one of the following:
Add a new host:
On the Specify Hosts page, enter a host name or
                      pattern (click "using patterns" for more information) to
                      search for new hosts to add to the cluster. A list of
                        matching hosts displays.
Select the hosts that you want to add.
Click Continue.
Select the Repository Location where
                      Cloudera Manager can find the software to install on the
                      new hosts. Select Public Cloudera
                        Repository or Custom
                        Repository and enter the URL of a custom
                      repository available on your local network. 
Click Continue.
Follow the instructions in the wizard
                      to install the Oracle JDK.
Enter Login Credentials:
Select root for the
                            root account, or select
                            Another user and enter the
                          username for an account that has password-less
                            sudo privileges.
Select an authentication method:
If you choose password authentication, enter and
                              confirm the password.
If you choose public-key authentication, provide
                              a passphrase and path to the required key
                              files.
You can modify the default SSH port if
                            necessary.
Specify the maximum number of host installations to
                          run at once. The default and recommended value is 10.
                          You can adjust this based on your network
                          capacity.
Click Continue.The
                              Install Agents page
                            displays and Cloudera Manager installs the Agent
                            software on the new hosts.
When the agent installation
                          finishes, click Continue.


Add an existing managed host:
Click the Currently Managed Hosts
                      tab. A list of hosts previously added to Cloudera
                        Manager displays.
Select the hosts that you want to add to the
                      cluster.
Click Continue.


Cloudera Manager begins to install the Cloudera Runtime
            parcels.
When the parcel installation finishes, click
              Continue.
The Host Inspector runs and displays any problems with the hosts.
            Correct the problems before continuing.
After correcting any problems, click
              Continue.
To add role instances to the hosts now or select
              None to add them later.
To add roles now:
Select an existing host template, or create a new one.
To create a new host template, click the
                  Create... button. The Create New
                  Host Template screen opens.. See Host Templates for details on
                how you select the role groups that define the roles that should
                run on a host. After you have created the template, it will
                appear in the list of host templates from which you can
                choose.
Select the host template you want to use.
By default Cloudera Manager will automatically start the roles
                specified in the host template on your newly added hosts. To
                prevent this, uncheck the option to start the newly-created
                roles.

When the wizard is finished, you can verify the Agent is
            connecting properly with the Cloudera Manager Server by clicking the
              Hosts tab and checking the health status for the new host.
            If the Health Status is Good and the value for the Last
            Heartbeat is recent, then the Agent is connecting properly with the
            Cloudera Manager Server.

If you did not specify a host template during the Add Hosts wizard,
          then no roles will be present on your new hosts until you add them.
          You can do this by adding individual roles under the Instances
          tab for a specific service, or by using a host template. See Adding a Role Instance for information about
          adding roles for a specific service. See Host Templates to create a host template that specifies a
          set of roles (from different services) that should run on a host.

Add New Hosts To Cloudera Manager
This option allows you to add a host, but without adding them to a
          specific cluster. Later, you can use these hosts to create new
          clusters or expand existing clusters. 


Click the Hosts tab.
Click the Add Hosts button.
Select Add hosts to Cloudera Manager
Specify the hosts to add:
On the Specify Hosts page, enter a host name or
                      pattern (click "using patterns" for more information) to
                      search for new hosts to add to the cluster. A list of
                        matching hosts displays.

Enable TLS Encryption or Authentication
If you previously enabled TLS security on your cluster, you must
          re-enable the TLS options on the Administration page and also
          configure TLS on each new host after using the Add Hosts wizard.
          Otherwise, you can ignore this step. For instructions, see Configuring TLS Encryption for Cloudera Manager and CDH Using
            Auto-TLS.

Enable TLS/SSL for cluster Components
If you have previously enabled TLS/SSL on your
          cluster, and you plan to start these roles on this new host, make sure
          you install a new host certificate to be configured from the same path
          and naming convention as the rest of your hosts. Since the new host
          and the roles configured on it are inheriting their configuration from
          the previous host, ensure that the keystore or truststore passwords
          and locations are the same on the new host. For instructions on
          configuring TLS/SSL, see Configuring TLS Encryption for Cloudera Manager and CDH Using
            Auto-TLS. 

Enable Kerberos
If you have previously enabled Kerberos on your
            cluster:
Install the packages required to kinit on the
              new host (see the list in Enabling Kerberos Authentication for CDH
              ).
If you have set up Cloudera Manager to manage
                krb5.conf, it will automatically deploy the
              file on the new host. Note that Cloudera Manager will deploy
                krb5.conf only if you use the Kerberos wizard.
              If you have used the API, you will need to manually perform the
              commands that the wizard calls.If Cloudera Manager does not
                manage krb5.conf, you must manually update the
                file at /etc/krb5.conf.





Adding a Host by Installing the Packages Using Your Own
      Method
If you used a different mechanism to install the JDK, Cloudera
      Runtime, and Cloudera Manager Agent packages, you can use that same
      mechanism to install the JDK, Cloudera Runtime, Cloudera Manager Agent
      packages and then start the Cloudera Manager Agent.


Install the Oracle JDK, Cloudera Runtime, and Cloudera Manager
            Agent packages using your own method. For instructions on installing
            these packages, see Step 3: Install Cloudera Manager
              Server.
After installation is complete, start the Cloudera Manager Agent.
            For instructions, see Starting, Stopping, and Restarting Cloudera Manager Agents.
After the Agent is started, you can verify the Agent is connecting
            properly with the Cloudera Manager Server by clicking the
              Hosts tab and checking the health status for the new host.
            If the Health Status is Good and the value for the Last
            Heartbeat is recent, then the Agent is connecting properly with the
            Cloudera Manager Server.
If you have enabled TLS security on your cluster, you must enable
            and configure TLS on each new host. Otherwise, ignore this step.
Enable and configure TLS on each new host by specifying
                  1 for the use_tls property
                in the /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini
                configuration file.
Configure TLS security on the new hosts by following the
                instructions in Configuring TLS Encryption for Cloudera Manager and CDH Using
                  Auto-TLS.


If you have previously enabled TLS/SSL on your
          cluster, and you plan to start these roles on this new host, make sure
          you install a new host certificate to be configured from the same path
          and naming convention as the rest of your hosts. Since the new host
          and the roles configured on it are inheriting their configuration from
          the previous host, ensure that the keystore or truststore passwords
          and locations are the same on the new host. For instructions on
          configuring TLS/SSL, see Configuring TLS Encryption for Cloudera Manager and CDH Using
            Auto-TLS. 


If you have previously enabled Kerberos on your
            cluster:
Install the packages required to kinit on the
              new host (see the list in Enabling Kerberos Authentication for CDH
              ).
If you have set up Cloudera Manager to manage
                krb5.conf, it will automatically deploy the
              file on the new host. Note that Cloudera Manager will deploy
                krb5.conf only if you use the Kerberos wizard.
              If you have used the API, you will need to manually perform the
              commands that the wizard calls.If Cloudera Manager does not
                manage krb5.conf, you must manually update the
                file at /etc/krb5.conf.
