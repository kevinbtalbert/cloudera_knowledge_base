Accessing Storage Using Microsoft ADLS Gen 2

These topics focused on Microsoft ADLS from the core Cloudera Enterprise
      documentation library can help you deploy, configure, manage, and secure
      clusters in the cloud. They are listed by broad category: 
Note the following limitations: 
ADLS is not supported as the default filesystem. Do not set the
          default file system property (fs.defaultFS) to an
            abfss:// URI. You can use ADLS as secondary
          filesystem while HDFS remains the primary filesystem. 
Hadoop Kerberos authentication is supported, but it is separate from
          the Azure user used for ADLS authentication.
Directory and file names should not end with a period. Paths that
          end in periods can cause inconsistent behavior, including the period
          disappearing. For more information, see HADOOP-15860.
