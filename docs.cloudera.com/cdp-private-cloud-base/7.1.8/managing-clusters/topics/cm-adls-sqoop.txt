Importing Data into Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store (Gen1 and Gen2) Using Sqoop

Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store (ADLS) is a cloud object store designed for use as a
      hyper-scale repository for big data analytic workloads. ADLS acts as a persistent storage
      layer for CDH clusters running on Azure.
There are two generations of ADLS, Gen1 and Gen2. You can use Apache Sqoop with both
      generations of ADLS to efficiently transfer bulk data between these file systems and
      structured datastores such as relational databases. For more information on ADLS Gen 1 and Gen
      2, see:


Microsoft ADLS Gen1 documentation




Microsoft ADLS Gen2 documentation




You can use Sqoop to import data from any relational database that has a JDBC adaptor such as
      SQL Server, MySQL, and others, to the ADLS file system.
noteSqoop export from the Azure files systems is not supported.
The major benefits of using Sqoop to move data are:
It leverages RDBMS metadata to get the column data types
It ensures fault-tolerant and type-safe data handling
It enables parallel and efficient data movement
