Configuring Cloudera Manager Agents

Minimum Required Role:
Full
            Administrator. This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
Cloudera Manager Agents can be configured globally using properties you set in
      the Cloudera Manager Admin Console and by setting properties in Agent
      configuration files.
Configuring Agent Heartbeat and Health Status Options
You can configure the Cloudera Manager Agent heartbeat interval and timeouts to trigger
        changes in Agent health as follows:

Select Administration > Settings.
Under the Performance category, set the following option:

Property
Description



Send Agent Heartbeat Every
The interval in seconds between each heartbeat that is sent from Cloudera
                    Manager Agents to the Cloudera Manager Server.Default: 15 sec.


Under the Monitoring category, set the following options:

Property
Description



Set health status to Concerning if the Agent heartbeats fail
The number of missed consecutive heartbeats after which a Concerning
                    health status is assigned to that Agent.Default: 5.


Set health status to Bad if the Agent heartbeats fail
The number of missed consecutive heartbeats after which a Bad health
                    status is assigned to that Agent.Default: 10.


Click Save Changes.


Configuring the Host Parcel Directory
importantIf you modify the parcel
        directory location, make sure that all hosts use the same location.
        Using different locations on different hosts can cause unexpected
        problems.
To configure the location of distributed parcels:
Click Hosts in the top navigation
            bar.
Click the Configuration
            tab.
Select
                Category > Parcels.
Configure the value of the Parcel Directory property. The
            setting of the parcel_dir property in the Cloudera
            Manager Agent configuration file overrides this setting (see
            below).
Enter a Reason for
              change, and then click Save
              Changes to commit the changes.
Restart the
            Cloudera Manager Agent on all hosts.


Agent Configuration File
The Cloudera Manager Agent supports different types of configuration options in
        the /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini file. You must
        update the configuration on each host. After changing a property,
        restart the Agent:sudo systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent

[General]
server_host, server_port, listening_port, listening_hostname,
                  listening_ip
Hostname and ports of the Cloudera Manager Server and
                  Agent and IP address of the Agent. Also see Configuring Cloudera
                      Manager Server Ports and Ports used by Cloudera
                      Manager.The Cloudera Manager Agent
                    configures its hostname automatically. You can also manually
                    specify the hostname the Cloudera Manager Agent uses by
                    updating the listening_hostname property.
                    To manually specify the IP address the Cloudera Manager
                    Agent uses, update the listening_ip
                    property in the same file.To have a CNAME used
                    throughout instead of the regular hostname, an Agent can be
                    configured to use
                      listening_hostname=CNAME.
                    In this case, the CNAME should resolve to the same IP
                    address as the IP address of the hostname on that machine.
                    Users doing this will find that the host inspector will
                    report problems, but the CNAME will be used in all
                    configurations where that's appropriate. This practice is
                    particularly useful for users who would like clients to use
                        namenode.mycluster.company.com
                    instead of
                        machine1234.mycluster.company.com.
                    In this case,
                      namenode.mycluster
                    would be a CNAME for
                        machine1234.mycluster,
                    and the generated client configurations (and internal
                    configurations as well) would use the CNAME.


lib_dir
Directory to store Cloudera Manager Agent state that
                  persists across instances of the agent process and system
                  reboots. The Agent UUID is stored here.Default:
                      /var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent.


local_filesystem_whitelist
The list of local filesystems that should always be monitored.Default: ext2,ext3,ext4.


log_file
The path to the Agent log file. If the Agent is being
                  started using the init.d script,
                    /var/log/cloudera-scm-agent/cloudera-scm-agent.out
                  will also have a small amount of output (from before logging
                  is initialized).Default:
                      /var/log/cloudera-scm-agent/cloudera-scm-agent.log.


max_collection_wait_seconds
Maximum time to wait for all metric collectors to finish collecting data.Default: 10 sec.


metrics_url_timeout_seconds
Maximum time to wait when connecting to a local role's web server to fetch
                  metrics.Default: 30 sec.


parcel_dir
Directory to store unpacked parcels.Default:
                      /opt/cloudera/parcels.This
                    property overrides the setting in Cloudera Manager. To use
                    the recommended procedure, you must make sure that this
                    property is commented out in each host
                      config.ini file.


supervisord_port
The supervisord port. A change takes effect the next time supervisord is
                  restarted (not when the Agent is restarted).Default: 19001.


task_metrics_timeout_seconds
Maximum time to wait when connecting to a local TaskTracker to fetch task
                  attempt data.Default: 5 sec.
