Hard Stopping and Restarting Agents
warningThe hard_stop  and
          hard_restart commands stop all running managed
        service processes on the host(s) where the command is run.
To stop or restart Agents, the supervisord process,
        and all managed service processes, use one of the following
          commands:
Hard Stop
RHEL 7, SLES 12, Ubuntu 16.04

sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-supervisord.service

RHEL 5 or 6, SLES 11, Debian 6 or 7, Ubuntu 12.04,
                  14.04

sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-agent


Hard Restart
RHEL 7, SLES 12, Debian 8, Ubuntu 16.04 and higher

sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-supervisord.service
sudo systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent

RHEL 5 or 6, SLES 11, Debian 6 or 7, Ubuntu 12.04,
                  14.04

sudo systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent

Hard restart is useful for the following situations:
You are upgrading Cloudera Manager and the
                  supervisord code has changed between your
                current version and the new one. To properly do this upgrade you
                need to restart supervisor too.
supervisord freezes and needs to be
                restarted.
You want to clear out all running state pertaining to Cloudera
                Manager and managed services.



Checking Agent Status
To check the status of the Agent process, use the
        command:sudo systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent
