Applying a Host Template to a Host
You can use a host template to apply configurations for multiple roles in a single
    operation.

Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
You can apply a template to a host that has no roles on it, or that has
        roles from the same services as those included in the host template. New
        roles specified in the template that do not already exist on the host
        will be added. A role on the host that is already a member of the role
        group specified in the template will be left unchanged. If a role on the
        host matches a role in the template, but is a member of a different role
        group, it will be moved to the role group specified by the template.
For example, suppose you have two role groups for a DataNode (DataNode
        Default Group and DataNode (1)). The host has a DataNode role that
        belongs to DataNode Default Group. If you apply a host template that
        specifies the DataNode (1) group, the role on the host will be moved
        from DataNode Default Group to DataNode (1).
However, if you have two instances of a service, such as MapReduce (for
        example, mr1 and mr2) and the host has a TaskTracker role
        from service mr2, you cannot apply a TaskTracker role from
        service mr1.
A host may have no roles on it if you have just added the host to your
        cluster, or if you decommissioned a managed host and removed its
        existing roles.
Also, the host must have the same version of CDH installed as is
        running on the cluster whose host templates you are applying.
If a host belongs to a different cluster than the one for which you
        created the host template, you can apply the host template if the
        "foreign" host either has no roles on it, or has only management roles
        on it. When you apply the host template, the host will then become a
        member of the cluster whose host template you applied. The following
        instructions assume you have already created the appropriate host
        template.


Click Hosts > All
            Hosts.Select the host(s) to which you want to apply your host template.From the Actions for Selected menu, select Apply
            Host Template.In the pop-up window that appears, select the host template you want to
          apply.Optionally you can have Cloudera Manager start the roles created per the host
          template. To enable this, check the box.Click Confirm to initiate the action.
