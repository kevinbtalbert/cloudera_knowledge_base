Authentication
You must authenticate to an S3 bucket using Amazon Web Service credentials. There are
    three ways to pass these credentials:

Provide them in the configuration file or files manually.
Provide them on the sqoop command line.
Reference a credential store to "hide" sensitive data, so that they do not appear in the
        console output, configuration file, or log files.

Amazon S3 Block Filesystem URI
        example:s3a://bucket_name/path/to/fileS3 credentials can be
        provided in a configuration file (for example,
        core-site.xml):<property>
    <name>fs.s3a.access.key</name>
    <value>...</value>
</property>
<property>
    <name>fs.s3a.secret.key</name>
    <value>...</value>
</property>You
        can also set up the configurations through Cloudera Manager by adding the configurations to
        the appropriate Advanced Configuration Snippet
        property.Credentials can be provided through the command
        line:sqoop import -Dfs.s3a.access.key=... -Dfs.s3a.secret.key=... --target-dir s3a://For
        example:sqoop import -Dfs.s3a.access.key=$ACCES_KEY -Dfs.s3a.secret.key=$SECRET_KEY
--connect $CONN --username $USER --password $PWD --table $TABLENAME --target-dir s3a://example-bucket/target-directory
noteEntering
        sensitive data on the command line is inherently insecure. The data entered can be accessed
        in log files and other artifacts. Cloudera recommends that you use a credential provider to
        store credentials.
