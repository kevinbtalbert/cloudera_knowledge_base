Changing Hostnames
After you have installed Cloudera Manager and created a cluster, you may need to update
    the names of the hosts running the Cloudera Manager Server or cluster services.
Minimum Required Role:
Full
            Administrator. This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.important

The process described here requires Cloudera Manager and cluster downtime.
If any user-created scripts reference specific hostnames, those must also be
            updated.
Due to the length and complexity of the following procedure, changing cluster
            hostnames is not recommended by Cloudera.

To update a deployment with new hostnames, follow these steps:
Verify if TLS/SSL certificates have been issued for any of the services and make
          sure to create new TLS/SSL certificates in advance for services protected by
          TLS/SSL.Export the Cloudera Manager configuration using one of the following methods:
Open a browser and go to this URL
                http://cm_hostname:7180/api/api_version/cm/deployment.
            Save the displayed configuration.
From terminal type:$ curl -u admin:admin
                  http://cm_hostname:7180/api/api_version/cm/deployment
                > cme-cm-export.jsonIf Cloudera Manager SSL is in use, specify
              the -k switch and the port number as 7183:$ curl -k -u
                admin:admin
                  https://cm_hostname:7183/api/api_version/cm/deployment
                > cme-cm-export.jsonwhere cm_hostname is the name
            of the Cloudera Manager host and api_version is the correct version
            of the API for the version of Cloudera Manager you are using. For example,
                http://tcdn5-1.ent.cloudera.com:7180/api/v49/cm/deployment.
Stop all services on the cluster.Stop the Cloudera Management Service.Stop the Cloudera Manager Server.Stop the Cloudera Manager Agents on the hosts that you want to change the hostname
          of.Back up the Cloudera Manager Server database using mysqldump,
            pg_dump, or another preferred backup utility. Store the backup in a
          safe location.Update names and principals:
Update the target hosts using standard per-OS/name service methods
                (/etc/hosts, dns,
                /etc/sysconfig/network, hostname, and so on).
              Ensure that you remove the old hostname.
If you are changing the hostname of the host running Cloudera Manager Server
              do the following:

Change the hostname per Step 8.a.
Update the Cloudera Manager hostname in
                    /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini on all Agents.


If the cluster is configured for Kerberos security, do the following:

Remove the old hostname cluster principals.
If you are using an MIT KDC, remove old hostname cluster service principals
                      from the KDC database using one of the following:
Use the delprinc command within
                            kadmin.local interactive shell.OR
From the command
                            line:kadmin.local -q "listprincs" | grep -E "(HTTP|hbase|hdfs|hive|httpfs|hue|impala|mapred|solr|oozie|yarn|zookeeper)[^/]*/[^/]*@" > cluster-princ.txtOpen
                              cluster-princ.txt and remove any noncluster service
                            principal entries. Make sure that the default krbtgt
                            and other principals you created, or that were created by Kerberos by
                            default, are not removed by running the following: for i in `cat
                              cluster-princ.txt`; do yes yes | kadmin.local -q "delprinc $i";
                              done.

For an Active Directory KDC, an AD administrator must manually delete the
                      principals for the old hostname from Active Directory.

Start the Cloudera Manager database and Cloudera Manager Server.
Start the Cloudera Manager Agents on the newly renamed hosts. The Agents should
                  show a current heartbeat in Cloudera Manager.
Within the Cloudera Manager Admin Console click the Hosts
                  tab.
Select the checkbox next to the host with the new name.
Select Actions > Regenerate
                      Keytab.


If one of the hosts that was renamed has a NameNode configured with high
          availability and automatic failover enabled, reconfigure the ZooKeeper Failover Controller
          znodes to reflect the new hostname.
Start ZooKeeper Servers.
warningAll other services, and most importantly HDFS, and the ZooKeeper
                Failover Controller (FC) role within the HDFS, should not be running.

On one of the hosts that has a ZooKeeper Server role, run
                zookeeper-client.

If the cluster is configured for Kerberos security, configure ZooKeeper
                  authorization as follows:
Go to the HDFS service.
Click the Instances tab.
Click the Failover Controller role.
Click the Process tab.
In the Configuration Files column of the hdfs/hdfs.sh
                        ["zkfc"] program, expand Show.
Inspect core-site.xml in the displayed list of files and
                      determine the value of the ha.zookeeper.auth property, which
                      will be something like:
                        digest:hdfs-fcs:TEbW2bgoODa96rO3ZTn7ND5fSOGx0h. The part
                      after digest:hdfs-fcs: is the password (in the example it is
                        TEbW2bgoODa96rO3ZTn7ND5fSOGx0h)
Run the addauth command with the
                      password:addauth digest hdfs-fcs:TEbW2bgoODa96rO3ZTn7ND5fSOGx0h

Verify that the HA znode exists: ls /hadoop-ha.
Delete the HDFS znode: rmr /hadoop-ha/nameservice1.
If you are not  running JobTracker in a high availability configuration,
                  delete the HA znode: rmr /hadoop-ha.


In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to the HDFS
            service.
Click the Instances tab.
Select Actions > Initialize High
                  Availability State in ZooKeeper....
Update the Hive metastore:
Back up the Hive metastore database.
In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to the Hive
            service.
Select Actions > Update Hive
                  Metastore NameNodes and confirm the
            command.
Update the Database Hostname property for each of the cluster roles for
          which a database is located on the host being renamed. This is required for both Cloudera
          Management Service roles (Reports Manager, Activity Monitor, Navigator Audit and Metadata
          Server) and for cluster services such as Hue, Hive, and so on.Start all cluster services.Start the Cloudera Management Service.Deploy client configurations.
