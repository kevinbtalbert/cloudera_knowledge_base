Guidelines for Choosing Data Compression

GZIP compression uses more CPU resources than Snappy or LZO, but
          provides a higher compression ratio. GZip is often a good choice for
            cold data, which is accessed infrequently. Snappy or LZO are
          a better choice for hot data, which is accessed
          frequently.
BZip2 can also produce more compression than GZip for some types of
          files, at the cost of some speed when compressing and decompressing.
          HBase does not support BZip2 compression.
Snappy often performs better than LZO. It is worth running tests to
          see if you detect a significant difference.
