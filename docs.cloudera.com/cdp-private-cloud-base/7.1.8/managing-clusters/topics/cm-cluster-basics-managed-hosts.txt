Step 2: Cluster Basics

The Cluster Basics page allows you to specify the Cluster
        Name and select the Cluster Type:
Regular Cluster: A Regular Cluster contains storage nodes, compute nodes, and
          other services such as metadata and security collocated in a single cluster.
Compute Cluster: A Compute Cluster consists of only compute nodes. To connect to
          existing storage, metadata or security services, you must first choose or create a Data
          Context on a Base Cluster.

importantIf you will be including the
      Apache Atlas or Apache Ranger services along with the Solr service, note
      the following:

During this initial cluster setup install only Apache Atlas and/or Apache Ranger (or
            one of the Data Engineering, Data Mart, or Operational Database Base cluster
            options).
Ranger requires Kerberos, as the wizard reminds you:



After the cluster setup is complete, use the Cloudera Manager
            Admin Console to add the Solr service to the cluster. See Adding a Service.


For more information on regular and compute clusters, and data contexts, see Virtual
        Private Clusters and Cloudera SDX.
If you are adding a compute cluster to an existing base cluster, click Choose Data
        Context... to create or select a Data Context.
After selecting a cluster type and data context (if applicable), enter a cluster name and
      then click Continue.
After a cluster is created, you can change the cluster display name using the
        Rename Cluster operation, but the internal name remains same. For
      more information, see Renaming a cluster.
