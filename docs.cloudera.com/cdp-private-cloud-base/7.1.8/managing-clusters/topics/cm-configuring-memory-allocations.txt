Configuring Memory Allocations
To configure memory allocations, determine how many entities are being monitored and
    then consult the tables below for required and recommended memory configurations. 
To determine the number of entities being monitored:

Go to Clusters > Cloudera Management
              Service.Locate the chart with the title Cloudera Management Service Monitored
            Entities.The number of monitored entities for the Host Monitor
          and Service Monitor displays at the bottom of the chart. In the following example, the
          Host Monitor has 46 monitored entities and the Service Monitor has 230 monitored
          entities.


Use the number of monitored entities for the Host Monitor to determine its memory
          requirements and recommendations in the tables below.Use the number of monitored entities for the Service Monitor to determine its
          memory requirements and recommendations in the tables below.Clusters with
            HDFS, YARN, or ImpalaUse the recommendations in this table for clusters where the
            only services having worker roles are HDFS, YARN, or Impala.

Clusters with HBase, Solr, Kafka, or KuduUse the
            recommendations when services such as HBase, Solr, Kafka, or Kudu are deployed in the
            cluster. These services typically have larger quantities of monitored
            entities.
