Configuring Built-in TLS Acceleration

For ADLS Gen2, TLS is enabled by default using the Java
         implementation of TLS. For better performance, you can use the built-in
          OpenSSL implementation of TLS. 
Perform the following steps to use the built-in OpenSSL implementation
          of TLS:

Verify the location of the OpenSSL libraries on the hosts with the
            following
            command:whereis libssl

In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console,
            search for the following property: Gateway Client Environment Advanced
              Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
              hadoop-env.sh.
Add the following parameter to the
            property:HADOOP_OPTS="-Dorg.wildfly.openssl.path=<path to OpenSSL libraries> ${HADOOP_OPTS}"
For
              example, if the OpenSSL libraries are in
              /usr/lib64, add the following
              parameter:HADOOP_OPTS="-Dorg.wildfly.openssl.path=/usr/lib64 ${HADOOP_OPTS}"



Save the change.
Search for the following property: HDFS Client Environment Advanced
            Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
            hadoop-env.sh

Add the following parameter to the
            property:HADOOP_OPTS="-Dorg.wildfly.openssl.path=<path to OpenSSL libraries> ${HADOOP_OPTS}"
For
              example, if the OpenSSL libraries are in
              /usr/lib64, add the following
              parameter:HADOOP_OPTS="-Dorg.wildfly.openssl.path=/usr/lib64 ${HADOOP_OPTS}"


Save the change.

Restart the stale services. 

Deploy
          the client configurations.

Verify that you configured built-in TLS acceleration successfully by
            running the following command from any host in the
            cluster:hadoop fs -ls abfss://<container>@<account>.dfs.core.windows.net/
A
            message similar to the following should
            appear:org.wildfly.openssl.SSL init
INFO: WFOPENSSL0002 OpenSSL Version OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013
The
            message may differ slightly depending on your operating system and
            OpenSSL version.
