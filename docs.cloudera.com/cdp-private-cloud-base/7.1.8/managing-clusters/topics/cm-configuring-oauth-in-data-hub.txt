Configuring OAuth in Data Hub

To connect a DataHub cluster to ADLS Gen2 with OAuth,
      you must configure the Hadoop CredentialProvider or core-site.xml directly.
      Although configuring core-site.xml is convenient, it is insecure since the contents
      of core-site.xml are not
      encrypted. For this reason, Cloudera recommends using a credential
      provider.
Before you start, ensure that you have configured OAuth for Azure.
