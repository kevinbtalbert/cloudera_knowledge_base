Data Granularity and Time-Series Metric Data
The Service Monitor and Host Monitor store time-series metric data in a variety of
    ways. 
When the data is received, it is written as-is to the metric store. Over time, the raw data
      is summarized to and stored at various data granularities. For example, after ten minutes, a
      summary point is written containing the average of the metric over the period as well as the
      minimum, the maximum, the standard deviation, and a variety of other statistics. This process
      is summarized to produce hourly, six-hourly, daily, and weekly summaries. This data
      summarization procedure applies only to metric data. When the Impala query and YARN
      application monitoring storage limit is reached, the oldest stored records are deleted.
The Service Monitor and Host Monitor internally manage the amount of overall storage space
      dedicated to each data granularity level. When the limit for a level is reached, the oldest
      data points at that level are deleted. Metric data for that time period remains available at
      the lower granularity levels. For example, when an hourly point for a particular time is
      deleted to free up space, a daily point still exists covering that hour. Because each of these
      data granularities consumes significantly less storage than the previous summary level, lower
      granularity levels can be retained for longer periods of time. With the recommended amount of
      storage, weekly points can often be retained indefinitely.
Some features, such as detailed display of health results, depend on the presence of raw
      data. Health history is maintained by the event store dictated by its retention policies.
