Data Storage for Monitoring Data

The Service Monitor and Host Monitor roles in the Cloudera Management Service
      store time series data, health data, and Impala query and YARN application
      metadata.

Configuring Service Monitor Data StorageThe Service Monitor stores time series data and health data, Impala query metadata, and     YARN application metadata. Configuring Host Monitor Data StorageThe Host Monitor stores time series data and health data. Viewing Host and Service Monitor Data StorageThe Cloudera Management Service page shows the current disk space consumed and its     rate of growth, categorized by the type of data stored. For example, you can compare the space     consumed by raw metric data to daily summaries of that data.Data Granularity and Time-Series Metric DataThe Service Monitor and Host Monitor store time-series metric data in a variety of     ways. Moving Monitoring Data on an Active ClusterHost Monitor and Service Monitor Memory ConfigurationYou can configure Java heap size and non-Java memory size. The memory recommended for     these configuration options depends on the number of hosts in the cluster, the services running     on the cluster, and the number of monitored entities.
