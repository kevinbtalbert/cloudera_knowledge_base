Decommissioning Hosts
Cloudera Manager manages the host decommission and recommission
    process and allows you the option to specify whether to replicate the data
    to other DataNodes, and whether or not to suppress alerts. 

Decommissioning a host decommissions and stops all roles on the host
        without requiring you to individually decommission the roles on each
        service. Decommissioning applies to only to HDFS DataNode, MapReduce
        TaskTracker, YARN NodeManager, and HBase RegionServer roles. If the host
        has other roles running on it, those roles are
            stopped.noteHosts with DataNodes and DataNode roles themselves can
            only be decommissioned if the resulting action leaves enough
            DataNodes commissioned to maintain the configured HDFS replication
            factor (by default 3). If you attempt to decommission a DataNode or
            a host with a DataNode in such situations, the decommission process
            will not complete and must be aborted. 


Minimum Required Role:
Limited
          Operator (also provided by
          Operator, Configurator,
          Cluster Administrator, Limited
          Cluster Administrator , or Full
          Administrator). 

To decommission one or more hosts: 
If the host has a DataNode, and you are planning to replicate data
          to other hosts (for longer term maintenance operations or to
          permanently decommission or repurpose the host), perform the steps in
            Tuning HDFS Prior to Decommissioning
            DataNodes.

In Cloudera Manager, select the cluster where you want to
          decommission hosts.In the left menu, click Hosts > All
              Hosts.Select the hosts that you want to decommission.Select Actions for
              Selected > Begin Maintenance (Suppress
              Alerts/Decommission. (If you
          are logged in as a user with the Limited
            Operator or Operator role, the
          menu item is labeled Decommission Host(s) and
          you will not see the option to suppress alerts.)The
            Begin Maintenance (Suppress
            Alerts/Decommission) dialog box opens. The role
          instances running on the hosts display at the top.
        To decommission the hosts and suppress alerts, select
            Decommission Host(s). When you select this
          option for hosts running a DataNode role, choose one of the following
          (if the host is not running a DataNode role, you will only see the
          Decommission Host(s) option:):
Decommission DataNodesThis option
              re-replicates data to other DataNodes in the cluster according to
              the configured replication factor. Depending on the amount of data
              and other factors, this can take a significant amount of time and
              uses a great deal of network bandwidth. This option is appropriate
              when replacing disks, repurposing hosts for non-HDFS use, or
              permanently retiring hardware. 
Take DataNode OfflineThis option does not re-replicate HDFS data to other DataNodes until the
              amount of time you specify has passed, making it less disruptive
              to active workloads. After this time has passed, the DataNode is
              automatically recommissioned, but the DataNode role is not
              started. This option is appropriate for short-term maintenance
              tasks such not involving disks, such as rebooting, CPU/RAM
              upgrades, or switching network cables. cautionTaking
                multiple DataNodes offline simultaneously increases the chances
                that some HDFS data may become unavailable during maintenance.
                Configuring the proper value for the Maintenance
                  State Minimal Block Replication HDFS configuration
                property will avoid risking data availability. 
Click Begin Maintenance.
          The Host Decommission Command
          dialog box opens and displays the progress of the
          command.

note

You cannot start roles on a decommissioned host.
When a DataNode is decommissioned, although HDFS data is
            replicated to other DataNodes, local files containing the original
            data blocks are not automatically removed from the storage
            directories on the host. If you want to permanently remove these
            files from the host to reclaim disk space, you must do so
            manually.



Perform the necessary maintenance on the
      hosts.
