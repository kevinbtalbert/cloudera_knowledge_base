Decrease Reserve Space
By default, the ext3 and ext4 filesystems reserve 5%
    space for use by the root user. This reserved space counts as Non DFS
    Used.
To view the reserved space use the tune2fs command:
# tune2fs -l /dev/sde1 | egrep "Block size:|Reserved block count"
Reserved block count:  36628312
Block size:            4096
The Reserved block count is the number of ext3/ext4
      filesystem blocks that are reserved. The block size is the size in bytes. In this example, 150
      GB (139.72 Gigabytes) are reserved on this filesystem.
Cloudera recommends reducing the root user block reservation from 5% to 1% for the DataNode
      volumes. To set reserved space to 1% with the tune2fs command:
# tune2fs -m 1 /dev/sde1
