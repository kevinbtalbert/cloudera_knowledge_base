            Administrator. This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
You can remove a host from a cluster in two ways:
Delete the host entirely from Cloudera Manager.
Remove a host from a cluster, but leave it available to other clusters managed by
          Cloudera Manager.
 Both methods decommission the hosts, delete roles, and remove managed service software,
      but preserve data directories.
