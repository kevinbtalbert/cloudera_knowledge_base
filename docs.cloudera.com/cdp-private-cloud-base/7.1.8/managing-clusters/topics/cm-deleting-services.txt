Deleting Services
You can delete a service from the Status
    tab.

Minimum Required Role:
Limited Cluster
            Administrator  (also provided by Full
          Administrator and Cluster
          Administrator)

Stop the service.On the
              Home > Status
          tab, click  to the right of the service
          name and select Delete.
Click Delete to confirm the deletion. 
Deleting a service does not clean up the associated client configurations that
          have been deployed in the cluster or the user data stored in the cluster. For a given
          "alternatives path" (for example /etc/hadoop/conf) if there exist both
          "live" client configurations (ones that would be pushed out with deploy client
          configurations for active services) and ones that have been "orphaned" client
          configurations (the service they correspond to has been deleted), the orphaned ones will
          be removed from the alternatives database. 
You must check the dependencies for a service to be deleted in the service matrix. For
          more information, see Service Dependencies in Cloudera Manager.
Note that to trigger cleanup of client configurations associated with a deleted
          service you must create a service to replace it. To remove user data, see the topic
            Remove Cloudera Manager and User Data.
