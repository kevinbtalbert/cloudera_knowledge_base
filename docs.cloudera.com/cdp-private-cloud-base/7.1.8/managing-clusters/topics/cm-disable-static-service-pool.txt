Disabling Static Service Pools
To disable static service pools, disable cgroup-based resource management for all
    hosts in all clusters.

Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.

In the main navigation bar, click Hosts.Click the Configuration
        tab.Select
              Scope > Resource
              Management.Clear the Enable Cgroup-based Resource Management
          property.Click Save Changes.Restart all services.
Static resource management is disabled, but the percentages you set when you
      configured the pools, and all the changed settings (for example, heap sizes), are
        retained by the services. The percentages and settings will also be used when you
      re-enable static service pools. If you want to revert to the settings you had before static
      service pools were enabled, follow the procedures in Viewing and Reverting Configuration
        Changes.
