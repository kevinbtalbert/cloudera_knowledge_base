Disabling Transparent Hugepages (THP)
Most Linux platforms supported by Cloudera Runtime include a
    feature called transparent hugepages, which interacts poorly
    with Hadoop workloads and can seriously degrade performance. 


Symptom:
top and other system monitoring tools show a large percentage of the CPU
        usage classified as "system CPU". If system CPU usage is 30% or more of the total CPU usage,
        your system may be experiencing this issue. 
 To see whether transparent hugepages are enabled, run the following commands and check the
        output: 
$ cat defrag_file_pathname
$ cat enabled_file_pathname


[always] never means that transparent hugepages is enabled. 

always [never] means that transparent hugepages is disabled. 


To disable Transparent Hugepages, perform the following steps on all cluster hosts:



(Required for hosts running RHEL/CentOS 7.x.) To disable transparent hugepages
          on reboot, add the following commands to the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file on
          all cluster hosts: 

RHEL/CentOS 8.x:
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag


RHEL/CentOS 7.x:
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag


RHEL/CentOS 6.x 
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/defrag
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled


Ubuntu/Debian, OL, SLES:
              echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

Modify the permissions of the rc.local
          file:chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local

If your cluster hosts are running RHEL/CentOS 7.x or 8.x, modify the GRUB configuration
          to disable THP: 


Add the following line to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX options in the
                /etc/default/grub file: 

transparent_hugepage=never



Run the following command: 

grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg



Disable the tuned service, as described above. 
 You can also disable transparent hugepages interactively (but remember this will not
            survive a reboot). 

To disable transparent hugepages temporarily as root:

# echo 'never' > defrag_file_pathname
# echo 'never' > enabled_file_pathname 

To disable transparent hugepages temporarily using sudo:

$ sudo sh -c "echo 'never' > defrag_file_pathname"
$ sudo sh -c "echo 'never' > enabled_file_pathname"
