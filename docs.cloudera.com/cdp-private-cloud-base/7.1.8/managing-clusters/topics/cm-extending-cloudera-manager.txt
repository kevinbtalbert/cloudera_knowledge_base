Extending Cloudera Manager

In addition to the set of software packages and services managed by
      Cloudera Manager, you can also define and add new types of services using
        custom service descriptors. When you deploy a custom service
      descriptor, the implementation is delivered in a Cloudera Manager parcel or other software
      package. For information on the extension mechanisms provided by Cloudera
      Manager for creating custom service descriptors and parcels, see Cloudera Manager Extensions.
