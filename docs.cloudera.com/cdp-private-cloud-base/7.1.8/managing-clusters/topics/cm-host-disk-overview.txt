Hosts Disks Overview
How to view the status of all disks in a cluster. 
In the left menu, click
          Hosts > Disks
          Overview to display an overview of the
      status of all disks in the deployment. The statistics exposed match or
      build on those in iostat,
      and are shown in a series of histograms that by default cover every
      physical disk in the system. 
Adjust the endpoints of the time line to see the
      statistics for different time periods. Specify a filter in the box to
      limit the displayed data. For example, to see the disks for a single rack
      rack1, set the filter to: logicalPartition = false and rackId = "rack1" and click
        Filter. Click
      a histogram to drill down and identify outliers. Mouse over the graph and
      click  to display additional
      information about the chart.
