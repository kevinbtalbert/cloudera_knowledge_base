Performing Maintenance on a Cluster HostCloudera Docs
Performing Maintenance on a Cluster Host
You can perform minor maintenance on cluster hosts by using Cloudera Manager to manage
    the host decommission and recommission process. 
In this process, you can specify whether to suppress alerts from the decommissioned host and,
      for hosts running the DataNode role, you can specify whether or not to replicate
      under-replicated data blocks to other DataNodes to maintain the cluster's replication factor.
      This feature is useful when performing minor maintenance on cluster hosts, such as adding
      memory or changing network cards or cables where the maintenance window is expected to be
      short and the extra cluster resources consumed by replicating missing blocks is
      undesirable.
You can also place hosts into Maintenance Mode, which suppresses unneeded alerts during a
      maintenance window but does not decommission the hosts.
To perform host maintenance on cluster hosts:
Decommission the hosts.
Perform the necessary maintenance on the hosts.
Recommission the hosts.


Decommissioning HostsCloudera Manager manages the host decommission and recommission     process and allows you the option to specify whether to replicate the data     to other DataNodes, and whether or not to suppress alerts. Recommissioning HostsTuning and Troubleshooting Host DecommissioningMaintenance ModeMaintenance mode allows you to suppress alerts for a host, service,     role, or an entire cluster. This can be useful when you need to take actions     in your cluster (make configuration changes and restart various elements)     and do not want to see the alerts that will be generated due to those     actions.Viewing the Maintenance Mode Status of a ClusterFor any cluster, you can view the components (service, roles, or hosts) that are in     maintenance mode.Parent topic: Managing Hosts
