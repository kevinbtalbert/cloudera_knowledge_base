Host Monitor and Service Monitor Memory Configuration
You can configure Java heap size and non-Java memory size. The memory recommended for
    these configuration options depends on the number of hosts in the cluster, the services running
    on the cluster, and the number of monitored entities. 
Monitored entities are the objects monitored by the Service Monitor or Host Monitor. As the
      number of hosts and services increases, the number of monitored entities also increases.
 In addition to the memory configured, the Host Monitor and Service Monitor use the Linux
      page cache. Memory available for page caching on the Host Monitor and Service Monitor hosts
      improves performance.

Configuring Memory AllocationsTo configure memory allocations, determine how many entities are being monitored and     then consult the tables below for required and recommended memory configurations. Parent topic: Data Storage for Monitoring Data
