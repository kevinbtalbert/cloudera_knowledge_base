Step 11: Inspect Cluster
The Inspect Cluster page provides a tool for inspecting
    network performance as well as the Host Inspector to search for common configuration problems.
    Cloudera recommends that you run the inspectors sequentially.

          Administrator and Cluster
          Administrator)


Run the Inspect Network Performance tool. You can click
            Advanced Options to customize some ping
          parameters.After the network inspector completes, click Show Inspector
            Results to view the results in a new tab.Address any reported issues, and click Run Again (if
          applicable).Click Inspect Hosts to run the Host Inspector
        utility.After the host inspector completes, click Show Inspector
            Results to view the results in a new tab.Address any reported issues, and click Run Again (if
          applicable).If the reported issues cannot be resolved in a timely manner, and you want to
          abandon the cluster creation wizard to address them, select the radio button labeled
            Quit the wizard and Cloudera Manager will delete the temporarily created
            cluster and then click Continue. Otherwise, after
          addressing any identified problems, select the radio button labeled I
            understand the risks, let me continue with cluster creation, and then click
            Continue.
This completes the Add Cluster -
        Installation wizard and launches the Add Cluster -
        Configuration wizard. For further instructions, see Set up a Cluster Using
