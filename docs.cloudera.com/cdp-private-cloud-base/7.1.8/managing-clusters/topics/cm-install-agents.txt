Step 8: Install Agents
The Install Agents page displays the progress of the
    installation. 
You can click on the Details link for any host to view the
      installation log. If the installation is stalled, you can click the Abort
        Installation button to cancel the installation and then view the installation
      logs to troubleshoot the problem.
If the installation fails on any hosts, you can click the Retry Failed
        Hosts to retry all failed hosts, or you can click the
        Retry link on a specific host.
If you selected the option to manually install agents, see Manually Install Cloudera
        Manager Agent Packages for the procedure and then continue with the next steps on
      this page.
After installing the Cloudera Manager Agent on all hosts, click
        Continue.
If you are using parcels, the Install Parcels page displays. If you
      chose to install using packages, the Detecting CDH Versions page
      displays.
