Linux Control Groups (cgroups)
Cloudera Manager can use Linux Control Groups (cgroups) to manage
    cluster resources. 
Minimum Required Role:
Full
            Administrator. This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
Cloudera Manager supports the Linux control groups (cgroups) kernel
      feature. With cgroups, administrators can impose per-resource restrictions
      and limits on services and roles. This provides the ability to allocate
      resources using cgroups to enable isolation of compute frameworks from one
      another. You configure resource allocations by setting Service
      configuration properties for cluster services and roles.
If you have configured cgroups in the Linux environment for your cluster
      hosts, you can choose to use those custom cgroups instead of the default
      cgroup configurations provided by Cloudera Manager. You cannot mix these
      Cloudera Manager-managed cgroups with custom cgroups managed in your Linux
      environment. 

Enabling Resource Management with Control GroupsEnabling Linux Control Groups (cgroups) using Cloudera Manager. Configuring Resource ParametersAfter enabling cgroups, you can restrict and limit the resource consumption of roles     (or role groups) on a per-resource basis. Configuring Custom CgroupsInstead of using the default Cloudera Manager cgroups for resource     management, you can configure Custom Cgroups. You must configure these     cgroups in the Linux environments of your cluster hosts before enabling     Custom Cgroups in Cloudera Manager. You can configure Custom cgroups for all     or selected roles of a service.Parent topic: Resource Management
