Setting the Cloudera Manager Agent Log Location
By default. the Cloudera Manager Agent log is stored in
        /var/log/cloudera-scm-agent/. If there is not enough space in that
      directory, you can change the location of the log file.
Set the log_file property in the Cloudera Manager Agent
            configuration file:
log_file=/opt/log/cloudera-scm-agent/cloudera-scm-agent.log
Create log/cloudera-scm_agent directories
            and set the owner and group to cloudera-scm. For
            example, if the log is stored in
              /opt/log/cloudera-scm-agent, do the
            following:
sudo su
cd /opt
mkdir log
chown cloudera-scm:cloudera-scm log
mkdir /opt/log/cloudera-scm-agent
chown cloudera-scm:cloudera-scm log/cloudera-scm-agent
Restart the Agent:
sudo service cloudera-scm-agent restart
