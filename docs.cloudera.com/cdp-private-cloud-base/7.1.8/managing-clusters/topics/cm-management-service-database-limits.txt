Configuring Management Service Database Limits
Configuring database service limits lets you control the amount
    of retained monitoring data. 

Minimum Required Role:
Limited Cluster
            Administrator  (also provided by Full
          Administrator and Cluster
          Administrator)


Each Cloudera Management Service role maintains a database for
        retaining the data it monitors. These databases (as well as the log
        files maintained by these services) can grow quite large.  Limits on
        these data sets are configured when you create the management services,
        but you can modify these parameters through the Configuration settings
        in the Cloudera Manager Admin Console. For example, the Event Server
        lets you set a total number of events to store.
There are also settings for the logs that these various services
        create. You can throttle how big the logs are allowed to get and how
        many previous logs to retain.
