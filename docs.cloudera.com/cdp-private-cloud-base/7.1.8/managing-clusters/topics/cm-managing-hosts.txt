Managing Hosts
How to use Cloudera Manager to configure and manage the hosts in
    your clusters.
Viewing Host StatusYou can view summary information about the hosts managed by Cloudera Manager. You can     view information for all hosts, the hosts in a cluster, or individual hosts.Adding a Host to a ClusterSteps to add hosts to a cluster.ParcelsConfiguring HostsThe Configuration tab lets you set properties     related to parcels and to resource management, and also monitoring properties for the hosts     under management. Viewing Host Role AssignmentsHost TemplatesThe Host Templates page lets you create and     manage host templates, which provide a way to specify a set of role     configurations that should be applied to a host. Hosts Disks OverviewHow to view the status of all disks in a cluster. Deleting HostsStopping All the Roles on a HostYou can stop all of the roles on a host from the Hosts     page.Starting All the Roles on a HostYou can start all the roles on a host from the Hosts     page.Changing HostnamesAfter you have installed Cloudera Manager and created a cluster, you may need to update     the names of the hosts running the Cloudera Manager Server or cluster services.Moving a Host Between ClustersTo move a host between clusters, you must first decommission the host, remove roles     from the host, and complete other tasks.Configuring Upgrade DomainsUpgrade Domains allow to group cluster hosts for optimal performance     during restarts and upgrades.Specifying Racks for HostsTo get maximum performance, it is important to configure Cloudera     Manager so that it knows the topology of your network. Network locations     such as hosts and racks are represented in a tree, which reflects the     network “distance” between locations. HDFS will use the network location to     place block replicas more intelligently to trade off performance and     resilience.Performing Maintenance on a Cluster HostYou can perform minor maintenance on cluster hosts by using Cloudera Manager to manage     the host decommission and recommission process.
