When you install Cloudera Manager, you can either upload your CDP Private Cloud Base license or select a 60-day trial
    version. 
CDP Private Cloud Base offers the following two
      types of licenses:

            the license expires, you will no longer be able to access the
            Cloudera Manager Admin console to manage your clusters until you

              clusters will continue to function, your data will remain intact,
              and your jobs will keep running.
