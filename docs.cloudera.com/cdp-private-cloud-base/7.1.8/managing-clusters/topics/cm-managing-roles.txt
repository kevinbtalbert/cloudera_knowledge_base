Managing Roles

When Cloudera Manager configures a service, it configures hosts in your cluster
      with one or more functions (called roles in Cloudera Manager) that are
      required for that service. The role determines which Hadoop daemons run on
      a given host. For example, when Cloudera Manager configures an HDFS
      service instance it configures one host to run the NameNode role, another
      host to run as the Secondary NameNode role, another host to run the
      Balancer role, and some or all of the remaining hosts to run DataNode
      roles.
Configuration settings are organized in role groups. A role group
      includes a set of configuration properties for a specific group, as well
      as a list of role instances associated with that role group. Cloudera
      Manager automatically creates default role groups.
For role types that allow multiple instances on multiple hosts, such as
      DataNodes, TaskTrackers, RegionServers (and many others), you can create
      multiple role groups to allow one set of role instances to use different
      configuration settings than another set of instances of the same role
      type. In fact, upon initial cluster setup, if you are installing on
      identical hosts with limited memory, Cloudera Manager will (typically)
      automatically create two role groups for each worker role â€” one group for
      the role instances on hosts with only other worker roles, and a separate
      group for the instance running on the host that is also hosting master
      roles.
The HDFS service is an example of this: Cloudera Manager typically creates one
      role group (DataNode Default Group) for the DataNode role instances
      running on the worker hosts, and another group (HDFS-1-DATANODE-1) for the
      DataNode instance running on the host that is also running the master
      roles such as the NameNode, JobTracker, HBase Master and so on. Typically
      the configurations for those two classes of hosts will differ in terms of
      settings such as memory for JVMs.
Cloudera Manager configuration screens offer two layout options: classic
      and new. The new layout is the default; however, on each configuration page you can easily
      switch between layouts using the Switch to XXX
        layout link at the top right of the page.
Gateway Roles
A gateway is a special type of role whose sole purpose is to designate a host
        that should receive a client configuration for a specific service, when the host does not
        have any roles running on it. Gateway roles enable Cloudera Manager to install and manage
        client configurations on that host. There is no process associated with a gateway role, and
        its status will always be Stopped. You can configure gateway roles for HBase, HDFS, Hive,
        Kafka, MapReduce, Solr, Spark, Sqoop 1 Client, and YARN.
