Managing Cloudera Runtime Services
Cloudera Manager service configuration features let you manage the deployment and
    configuration of Cloudera Runtime and managed services.
Using Cloudera Manager, you can add new
        services and roles if needed, gracefully start, stop and restart
      services or roles, and decommission and
          delete roles or services if necessary. Further, you can
      modify the configuration properties for services or for individual role
      instances. You can also view past configuration
        changes and roll back to a previous revision. You can also generate
      client configuration files, enabling you to easily distribute them to the
      users of a service.
The topics in this chapter describe how to configure and use the services on your cluster.
      Some services have unique configuration requirements or provide unique features. See the
      documentation for an individual service for more information.

Adding a ServiceAfter initial installation, you can       use the Add a Service wizard to add and configure new       service instances. For example, you may want to add a service such as       Oozie that you did not select in the wizard during the initial       installation.Comparing Configurations for a Service Between ClustersYou can compare the configuration settings for a particular service between two     different clusters in a Cloudera Manager deployment.Starting a Cloudera Runtime Service on All HostsStarting and Stopping Cloudera Runtime services.Stopping a Cloudera Runtime Service on All HostsRestarting a Cloudera Runtime ServiceRolling RestartAborting a Pending CommandDeleting ServicesYou can delete a service from the Status     tab.Renaming a ServiceA service is given a name upon installation, and that name is used as an identifier     internally. However, Cloudera Manager allows you to provide a display name for a service, and     that name will appear in the Cloudera Manager Admin Console instead of the original (internal)     name.Configuring Maximum File DescriptorsYou can set the maximum file descriptor parameter for all daemon roles. When not     specified, the role uses whatever value it inherits from supervisor. When specified, configures     soft and hard limits to the configured value.Extending Cloudera ManagerConfiguring Services to Use LZO Compression
