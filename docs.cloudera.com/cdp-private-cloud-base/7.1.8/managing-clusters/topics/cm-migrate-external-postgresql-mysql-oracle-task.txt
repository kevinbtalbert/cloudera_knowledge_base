 Migrate from the Cloudera Manager External PostgreSQL Database Server to a MySQL/Oracle
    Database Server 
When you migrate from the Cloudera Manager external PostgreSQL database server to a
    MySQL or Oracle database server, you export the Cloudera Manager configuration, prepare the
    target database for Cloudera Manager, and complete other tasks.

Minimum Required Role:
Operator
        (also provided by Configurator,
          Cluster Administrator, Limited
          Cluster Administrator , Full
          Administrator) 



Migrate from the embedded PostgreSQL database server to an external PostgreSQL database
          server as described in the topic Migrating from the Cloudera Manager Embedded
            PostgreSQL Database Server to an External PostgreSQL Database.important Migrating directly from the Cloudera Manager
            embedded PostgreSQL to a MySQL or Oracle database is not supported. You must first
            migrate from the Cloudera Manager embedded PostgreSQL database server to the external
            PostgreSQL database server. After performing this migration, you can use this procedure
            to migrate from the external PostgreSQL database server to MySQL or Oracle database
            servers.
Upgrade the Cloudera Manager enterprise license by navigating to Administration >  Licenses and installing a valid Cloudera Manager license.


Export your Cloudera Manager Configuration. First, get the latest supported API
          version:
curl -u <admin_username>:<admin_password> "http://<cm_server_host>:7180/api/version"
curl -u <admin_username>:<admin_password> "http://<cm_server_host>:7180/api/<api_version> /cm/deployment" > <path_to_file>/cm-deployment.json
The following is an example of the API version command:
curl -u admin:admin "http://10.17.103.191:7180/api/v19/cm/deployment" > /root/cm-deployment.json
important
If you have Cloudera Manager with TLS for the Admin Console enabled, retrieve the
              certificate file and use curl with the --cacert
              option:
curl --cacert <certificate_file> -u admin:admin "https://<cm_server_host>:7183/api/version"


Preserve Cloudera Manager's GUID by running the following command on the Cloudera
          Manager server to create a /etc/cloudera-scm-server/uuid file:

sudo -u postgres psql -qtAX scm -c "select GUID from CM_VERSION" > uuid
importantConfirm the name of your Cloudera Manager database in
              /etc/cloudera-scm-server/db.properties.
Move the UUID file to Cloudera Manager server's
              /etc/cloudera-scm-server
            directory.sudo mv uuid /etc/cloudera-scm-server/


Stop the cluster and the Cloudera Management services. For details, see Starting,
            Stopping, Refreshing, and Restarting a Cluster and Stopping the Cloudera
            Management Service.

Run the following command to stop the Cloudera Manager server:

sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-server


Prepare the target database for Cloudera Manager. For details, see Install and
            Configure MySQL for Cloudera Software or Install and Configure Oracle
            Database for Cloudera Software. 

Run the following command to obtain the value of the GUID:

cat /etc/cloudera-scm-server/uuid


Insert the GUID returned from the previous command into MySQL or Oracle as
          follows:


Run the following command to login to MySQL:

sudo -u mysql -p <name_of_cm_database>



Run the following command to login to Oracle:

sqlplus system@localhost
Enter password: [***password***]



Run the following command to update the GUID:

update cm_version set guid = '[***GUID***]â€™




The process directory (/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/) must
          be cleaned out for all hosts with agents running on them. The agent completes this cleanup
          with a server reboot. However, if a server reboot is not a viable option, do the following
          steps to accomplish the same task.


Run the following command on all hosts to stop the agent and supervisor:

sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-agent



Run the following command to confirm that the agent and supervisor processes are
              stopped:

ps -ef | grep -i cmf-agent; ps -ef | grep -i supervisor



Move the existing /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/
              directory:

mv /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent-BU
The agent recreates the directory. Delete the backed-up copy after confirming that
                the migration was successful. 



Run the following command on all hosts to start the agent and supervisor:

sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-agent




Run the following command to start the Cloudera Manager server:

sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-server


Login to Cloudera Manager. Exit the installation wizard by clicking the product logo in
          the upper-left corner to stop the wizard and return to the Cloudera Manager home
          page.

Run the following command to restore the Cloudera Manager configuration: 
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --upload-file <path_to_file>/cm-deployment.json -u <admin_username>:<admin_password> "http://<cm_server_host>:7180/api/<api_version>/cm/deployment?deleteCurrentDeployment=true"The
          following example shows how to restore a Cloudera Manager configuration:
          curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --upload-file /root/cm-deployment.json -u admin:admin "http://172.31.113.146:7180/api/v19/cm/deployment?deleteCurrentDeployment=true"

Start the following: Cloudera Management Service, Host Monitor, and Services Monitor.
          Verify that all the services in the Cloudera Management Service started and are Healthy.
          For details, see Starting the Cloudera Management Service and Starting
            and Stopping Cloudera Management Service Roles.

Go to Home >  Status and select the cluster(s) that you previously stopped, and select
            Start from the Actions drop-down
          menu.
