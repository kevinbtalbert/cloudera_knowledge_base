Optimizing Performance in Cloudera Runtime


      This section provides solutions to some performance problems, and
      describes configuration best practices.
    
important
      Work with your network administrators and hardware vendors to ensure that
      you have the proper NIC firmware, drivers, and configurations in place and
      that your network performs properly. Cloudera recognizes that network
      setup and upgrade are challenging problems, and will do its best to share
      useful experiences.
    

Disable the tuned Service If your cluster hosts are running RHEL/CentOS 7.x, disable the "tuned" service by     running the following commands: Disabling Transparent Hugepages (THP)Most Linux platforms supported by Cloudera Runtime include a     feature called transparent hugepages, which interacts poorly     with Hadoop workloads and can seriously degrade performance. Setting the vm.swappiness Linux Kernel ParameterThe Linux kernel parameter, vm.swappiness, is a value from 0-100 that     controls the swapping of application data (as anonymous pages) from physical memory to virtual     memory on disk. You can set the value of the vm.swappiness parameter for     minimum swapping.Improving Performance in Shuffle Handler and IFile ReaderThe MapReduce shuffle handler and IFile reader use native Linux calls,       (posix_fadvise(2) and sync_data_range), on Linux systems     with Hadoop native libraries installed.Tips and Best Practices for JobsThis section describes changes you can make at the job level. Decrease Reserve SpaceBy default, the ext3 and ext4 filesystems reserve 5%     space for use by the root user. This reserved space counts as Non DFS     Used.Parent topic: Performance Management
