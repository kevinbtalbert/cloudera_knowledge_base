If all data for a cluster is stored on EBS volumes, you can pause the
      cluster and stop your AWS EC2 instances during periods when the cluster
      will not be used. The cluster will not be available while paused and canâ€™t
      be used to ingest or process data, but you won't be billed by Amazon for
      the stopped EC2 instances. Provisioned EBS storage volumes will continue
      to accrue charges.importantPausing a cluster requires using
        EBS volumes for all storage, both on management and worker nodes. Data
        stored on ephemeral disks will be lost after EC2 instances are
        stopped.

Shutting Down and Starting Up the ClusterTo pause an AWS cluster, follow the shutdown procedure. To restart the cluster after a     pause, follow the startup procedure.
