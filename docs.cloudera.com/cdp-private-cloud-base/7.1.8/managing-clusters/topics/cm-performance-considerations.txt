Performance Considerations
Decommissioning a DataNode does not happen instantly because the process requires
    replication of a potentially large number of blocks. During decommissioning, the performance of
    your cluster may be impacted. 
This section describes the decommissioning process and suggests solutions for several common
      performance issues.
Decommissioning occurs in two steps:
The Commission State of the DataNode is marked as
            Decommissioning and the data is replicated from this node to
          other available nodes. Until all blocks are replicated, the node remains in a
            Decommissioning state. You can view this state from the NameNode
          Web UI. (Go to the HDFS service and select Web
              UI > NameNode Web UI.)
When all data blocks are replicated to other nodes, the node is marked as
            Decommissioned.

Decommissioning can impact performance in the following ways:

There must be enough disk space on the other active DataNodes for the data to be
        replicated. After decommissioning, the remaining active DataNodes have more blocks and
        therefore decommissioning these DataNodes in the future may take more time.
There will be increased network traffic and disk I/O while the data blocks are
        replicated.
Data balance and data locality can be affected, which can lead to a decrease in
        performance of any running or submitted jobs.
Decommissioning a large numbers of DataNodes at the same time can decrease
        performance.
If you are decommissioning a minority of the DataNodes, the speed of
        data reads from these nodes limits the performance of decommissioning
        because decommissioning maxes out network bandwidth when reading data
        blocks from the DataNode and spreads the bandwidth used to replicate the
        blocks among other DataNodes in the cluster. To avoid performance
        impacts in the cluster, Cloudera recommends that you only decommission a
        minority of the DataNodes at the same time. 
You can decrease the number of replication threads to decrease the performance impact of
        the replications, but this will cause the decommissioning process to take longer to
        complete.

Cloudera recommends that you add DataNodes and decommission DataNodes in parallel, in smaller
      groups. For example, if the replication factor is 3, then you should add two DataNodes and
      decommission two DataNodes at the same time.
