Referencing Amazon S3 in URIs

By default, files are still placed on the local HDFS and not on S3 if
        the protocol is not specified in the URI. When you have added the Amazon
        S3 service, use one of the following options to construct the URIs to
        reference when submitting jobs:

Amazon S3:
            s3a://bucket_name/path


HDFS: 
hdfs://path

or/path
