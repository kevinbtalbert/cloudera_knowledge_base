Renaming a Cluster
Renaming the cluster allows you to change the display name of the cluster after you
    have created the cluster. However, this does not change the clusterâ€™s actual, internal
    name.

Cloudera Manager does not allow you to change the internal name of the cluster because the
        internal name is used as part of different identifiers throughout the cluster, and it is not
        possible to change all the configurations safely.
Minimum Required Role:
Full
            Administrator. This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.

Log into Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

On the Cloudera Manager home page, navigate to the Status tab,
          click  to the right of the cluster name and select Rename Cluster
          from the list view.

Enter the new cluster name and click Rename Cluster.

note
In the Configuration tab, the cluster name still appears as
              the original cluster name that was used when the cluster was created.
