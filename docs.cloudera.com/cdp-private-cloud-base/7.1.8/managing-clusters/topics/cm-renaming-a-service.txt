Renaming a Service
A service is given a name upon installation, and that name is used as an identifier
    internally. However, Cloudera Manager allows you to provide a display name for a service, and
    that name will appear in the Cloudera Manager Admin Console instead of the original (internal)
    name.

Minimum Required Role:
Full
            Administrator. This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
note
The original service name will still be used internally, and may appear or be required in
          certain circumstances, such as in log messages or in the API.

On the Home > Status tab, click  to the right of the service name and select Rename.Type the new name.Click Rename.The rename action is recorded as an Audit
            event.When looking at Audit or Event search results for the renamed service, it is
            possible that these search results might contain either only the original (internal)
            name, or both the display name and the original name.
