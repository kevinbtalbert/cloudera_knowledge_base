importantIf you have changed a
        configuration property that requires a redeployment of the client
        configurations, note that refreshing or restarting a cluster does not
        automatically re-deploy the client configurations. A service or cluster
        displays a staleness icon () next to the cluster or service name that
        indicates that you must redeploy the client configuration. Click the
        icon to open the Stale
            Configurations page and follow the prompts to
        refresh the cluster and redeploy the client
          configuration.Alternatively, after a restart is completed, you can
          select Deploy Client Configuration from the
            Actions menu for either a service or cluster.
        



In the left menu, click Clusters and select a service.
        Click  to the right of the service name and select
            Restart.
Click Start on the next screen to confirm. 
When you see a Finished status, the service has
      restarted.
To restart all services, restart the cluster.
