Creating a Role Group


Minimum Required Role:
Configurator (also provided by
          Cluster Administrator,
Limited Cluster Administrator , and
          Full Administrator)

Go to a service status page.Click the Instances
          or Configuration tab.Click Role
          Groups.Click Create new group....Provide a name for the group.Select the role type for the group. You can select role types
          that allow multiple instances and that exist for the service you have
          selected.In the Copy From field, select the source of the basic
          configuration information for the role group:
An existing role group of the appropriate type.
None.... The role group is set up with generic default
            values that are not the same as the values Cloudera Manager sets in the default
            role group, as Cloudera Manager specifically sets the appropriate configuration
            properties for the services and roles it installs. After you create the group you must
            edit the configuration to set missing properties (for example the TaskTracker Local Data
            Directory List property, which is not populated if you select None) and clear other
            validation warnings and errors.
