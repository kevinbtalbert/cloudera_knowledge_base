Role Groups

Minimum Required Role:
Configurator (also provided by
          Cluster Administrator,
Limited Cluster Administrator , and
          Full Administrator)
A
      role group
      is a set of configuration properties for a role type, as well as a list of
      role instances associated with that group. Cloudera Manager automatically
      creates a default role group named Role Type Default
      Group for each role type.Each role instance can be associated with only a single role group.
Role groups provide two types of properties: those that affect the configuration of the
      service itself and those that affect monitoring of the service, if applicable (the
        Monitoring subcategory). Not all services have monitoring properties.
When you run the installation or upgrade wizard,
      Cloudera Manager configures the default role groups it adds, and adds any
      other required role groups for a given role type. For example, a DataNode
      role on the same host as the NameNode might require a different
      configuration than DataNode roles running on other hosts. Cloudera Manager
      creates a separate role group for the DataNode role running on the
      NameNode host and uses the default configuration for DataNode roles
      running on other hosts.
You can modify the settings of the default role group, or you can create new role groups and
      associate role instances to whichever role group is most appropriate. This simplifies the
      management of role configurations when one group of role instances may require different
      settings than another group of instances of the same role typeâ€”for example, due to differences
      in the hardware the roles run on. You modify the configuration for any of the service's role
      groups through the Configuration tab for the service. You can also override the settings
      inherited from a role group for a role instance.
If there are multiple role groups for a role type, you can move role instances
      from one group to another. When you move a role instance to a different
      group, it inherits the configuration settings for its new group.
