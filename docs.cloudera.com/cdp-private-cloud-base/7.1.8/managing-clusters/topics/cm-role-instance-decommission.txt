Decommissioning Role Instances
You can remove a role instance such as a DataNode from a cluster while the cluster is
    running by decommissioning the role instance. 

Minimum Required Role:
Operator
        (also provided by Configurator,
          Cluster Administrator, Limited
          Cluster Administrator , Full
          Administrator) 
When you decommission a role instance, Cloudera Manager performs a procedure so that you
        can safely retire a host without losing data. Role decommissioning applies to HDFS DataNode,
        MapReduce TaskTracker, YARN NodeManager, and HBase RegionServer roles.
Hosts with DataNodes and DataNode roles themselves can
          only be decommissioned if the resulting action leaves enough DataNodes
          commissioned to maintain the configured HDFS replication factor (by
          default 3). If you attempt to decommission a DataNode or a host with a
          DataNode in such situations, the decommission process will not
          complete and must be aborted. 
A role will be decommissioned if its host is decommissioned. 
To remove a DataNode from the cluster, you decommission the DataNode
        role as described here and then perform a few additional steps to remove
        the role. See the topic Delete a DataNode.

To decommission role instances:If you are decommissioning DataNodes, perform the steps in the topic Tuning
            HDFS Prior to Decommissioning DataNodes.Click the service instance that contains the role instance you
          want to decommission.Click the Instances tab.Check the checkboxes next to the role instances to
          decommission.Select Actions for
              Selected > Decommission,
          and then click Decommission again to start the process.
        
A Decommission Command pop-up displays that
      shows each step or decommission command as it is run. In the Details area,
      click  to see the subcommands that are run. Depending
      on the role, the steps may include adding the host to an "exclusions list"
      and refreshing the NameNode, JobTracker, or NodeManager; stopping the
      Balancer (if it is running); and moving data blocks or regions. Roles that
      do not have specific decommission actions are stopped. You can abort
        the decommission process by clicking the Abort
        button, but you must recommission and restart the role.The
        Commission State facet in the Filters list displays  Decommissioning while decommissioning is in
        progress, and  Decommissioned when the
        decommissioning process has finished. When the process is complete, a
          
        is added in front of Decommission Command.
