Running the Prune Command Using the Cloudera Manager APICloudera Docs
Running the Prune Command Using the Cloudera Manager API

Cloudera recommends that you automate running the Prune command by
          creating a script that uses the Cloudera Manager API to run the
          command. You can run the command using a REST command, a Python
          script, or Java class. Configure the script using the Linux
            cron command or another scheduling mechanism to run
          on a regular schedule. 

REST

See the
      Rest API documentation.
You can run the Prune command by issuing the following REST
          request:
curl -X POST -u username:password
 'Cloudera_Manager_server_URL:port_number/api/vAPI_version_number/externalAccounts/account/Credential_Name/commands/S3GuardPrune'
For example, the following request runs the S3Guard prune command on the data associated
          with the johnsmith credential. The response from Cloudera Manager is also
          displayed (within the curly
          brackets):curl -X POST -u admin:admin 'http://clusterhost-1.gce.mycompany.com:7180/api/v16/externalAccounts/account/johnsmith/commands/S3GuardPrune'

      }
