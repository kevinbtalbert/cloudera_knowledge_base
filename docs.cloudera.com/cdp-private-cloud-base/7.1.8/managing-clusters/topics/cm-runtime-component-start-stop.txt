Starting and Stopping Cloudera Runtime services.

Minimum Required Role:

          Administrator) 
It is important to start and stop services that have dependencies in
        the correct order. For example, because MapReduce and YARN have a
        dependency on HDFS, you must start HDFS before starting MapReduce or
        YARN. The Cloudera Management Service and Hue are the only two services
        on which no other services depend; although you can start and stop them
        at anytime, their preferred order is shown in the following procedures.
        The Cloudera Manager cluster actions start and stop services in the
        correct order. To start or stop all services in a cluster, follow the
        instructions in Starting, Stopping, Refreshing, and Restarting a
        Cluster.


The order in which to start services is:
Cloudera Management Service
ZooKeeper
HDFS
Solr
HBase
Key-Value Store Indexer
MapReduce or YARN
Hive
Impala
Oozie
Sqoop
Hue



In the left menu, click Clusters and select a service.
        Click  to the right of the service name and select
            Start.
Click Start in the next screen to confirm.
          When you see a Finished status, the service has
          started.

noteIf you are unable to start the HDFS service, it's possible that one of the roles
        instances, such as a DataNode, was running on a host that is no longer connected to the
        Cloudera Manager Server host, perhaps because of a hardware or network failure. If this is
        the case, the Cloudera Manager Server will be unable to connect to the Cloudera Manager
        Agent on that disconnected host to start the role instance, which will prevent the HDFS
        service from starting. To work around this, you can stop all services, abort the pending
        command to start the role instance on the disconnected host, and then restart all services
        again without that role instance.
