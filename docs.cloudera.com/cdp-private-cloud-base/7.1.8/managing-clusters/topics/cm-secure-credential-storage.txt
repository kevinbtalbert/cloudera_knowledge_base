Configuring a Secure Credential Storage Provider for Cloudera Manager
    (Technical Preview)
Steps to configure Cloudera Manager to encrypt sensitive
    information stored in the Cloudera Manager database by configuring a
    Credential Storage Provider (CSP).

importantThis feature is in technical preview and should not
        be used in a production environment.
Minimum Required Role:
Full
            Administrator. This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.

IMPORTANT – You must complete all of the
      steps below, including uploading the certificates, before the final step
      to restart the Cloudera Manager server. Failure to do so will mean that
      you will not be able to restart the Cloudera Manager server. 
If you are using the Vault, install and configure the Vault on
          a host with network connectivity to the Cloudera Manager server:
Install and configure the Vault
                from Hashicorp.
Configure
            TLS.
Enable the Vault secrets engine at a path that will be
              dedicated to Cloudera Manager’s use. Any Vault secrets engine is
              supported. See https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets
              for more information. For example, the following enables a
                kv type secrets engine at path cm-secrets/:
vault cm-secrets enable -path=secret kv

A certificate authentication method must be configured
              at the path certs/cert1. This is how Cloudera
              Manager will authenticate with Vault. The method must have a
              policy that allows Create/Update/List/Read/Delete at the
              applicable secrets path. See https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/cert for
              more information on certificate authentication and https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies
              for more information on vault policies.Example setup:
              vault auth enable cert 1
vault write auth/cert/certs/cert1 display_name=example policies=example-policy certificate=@your-ca-cert.pem Example
              policy: path "cm-secrets/*" 
{
 capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "list", "delete"] 
} 
The Vault must be unsealed by the user whenever Cloudera
              Manager is running. See https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/seal
              for instructions on unsealing Vault.
Configure the Secure Credential Store in Cloudera
          Manager:
Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
Go to
                  Administration > Settings
              and select the Security
            category.
Select the Credential Storage Provider
                Type. Choose one of the following: 

None – Sensitive information is not encrypted in the Cloudera
          Manager database. 
Vault – You can install and configure an external Vault, located on
          a different host, if desired. Cloudera recommends Vault from
          Hashicorp.
Embedded – The credentials are stored on disk, on the Cloudera
          Manager server host that is protected by file permissions. This type
          is less secure than using a Vault, but is easier to set up and
          manage.

importantAfter you configure the CSP, do not select
                the None option to disable the CSP. See
                  Disabling or changing the Credential Storage Provider (Technical Preview).

If you selected Vault, configure the
          following parameters:

Credential Storage Provider Address –
              enter the URL of the host where the Vault is installed. 
Secrets Store Path – the path, on the
              host where the Vault is installed where credentials are written.
              The directory specified here must not be used for anything
              else.
Credential Storage Provider Storage Path
              – the location on the Cloudera Manager server host where
              certificates for the Vault are stored. You can keep the default
              location of /opt/cloudera/csp-data or change it
              if needed.

Upload the following certificates, by copying them to the
          Cloudera Manager server host to the directory specified with the
            Credential Storage Provider Storage Path
          parameter, using the exact file name shown below, or you can use the
          Cloudera Manager API to upload the certificates using the
            CspResource endpoint. (You can use the
          Cloudera Manager API Explorer to do this. Go to
              Support > API Explorer
            . 


Certificate
File name on the Cloudera Manager Host



Certificate authority
csp-ca.pem


Client certificate
csp-client.pem


Client key
csp-client.key


Restart the Cloudera Manager Server:
importantDo not restart the Cloudera Manager server if
            you have not completed all of the above steps. 
sudo service cloudera-scm-server restart

Sensitive information is now encrypted in
      the Cloudera Manager database.
