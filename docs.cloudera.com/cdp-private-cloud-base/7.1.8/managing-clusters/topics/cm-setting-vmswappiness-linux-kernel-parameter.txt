Setting the vm.swappiness Linux Kernel Parameter
The Linux kernel parameter, vm.swappiness, is a value from 0-100 that
    controls the swapping of application data (as anonymous pages) from physical memory to virtual
    memory on disk. You can set the value of the vm.swappiness parameter for
    minimum swapping.
 The higher the parameter value, the more aggressively inactive processes are swapped out
      from physical memory. The lower the value, the less they are swapped, forcing filesystem
      buffers to be emptied. 
 On most systems, vm.swappiness is set to 60 by default. This is not
      suitable for Hadoop clusters because processes are sometimes swapped even when enough memory
      is available. This can cause lengthy garbage collection pauses for important system daemons,
      affecting stability and performance. 
 Cloudera recommends that you set vm.swappiness to a value between 1 and 10,
        preferably 1, for minimum swapping on systems where the RHEL kernel is 2.6.32-642.el6
      or higher. 
 To view your current setting for vm.swappiness, run:
      cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

 To set vm.swappiness to 1, run:
      sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=1

To ensure persistence of the vm.swappiness value after
      reboot:
      echo 'vm.swappiness=1' > /etc/sysctl.d/90-cloudera-swappiness.conf
