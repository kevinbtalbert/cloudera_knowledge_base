Step 3: Setup Auto-TLS
The Setup Auto-TLS page provides instructions for initializing
    the certificate manager for auto-TLS if you have not done so already.
importantAuto-TLS is only available with an Enterprise license. 
If you already initialized the certificate manager in Step 3: Install Cloudera Manager
        Server, the wizard displays a message indicating that auto-TLS has been initialized.
      Click Continue to proceed with the installation.
If you have not already initialized the certificate manager, and you want to enable auto-TLS,
      follow the instructions provided on the page before continuing. When you reload the page as
      instructed, you are redirected to
        https://<server_host>:7183, and a security warning is
      displayed. You might need to indicate that you trust the certificate, or click to proceed to
      the Cloudera Manager Server host. You might also be required to log in again and re-complete
      the previous steps in the wizard.
For more information, see Configuring TLS Encryption for Cloudera Manager Using
        Auto-TLS.
If you do not want to enable auto-TLS at this time, click Continue to
      proceed.
