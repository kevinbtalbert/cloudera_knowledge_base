Step 4: Specify Hosts
This section covers the procedure for creating a cluster from existing managed hosts
    only. For instructions using new (currently unmanaged) hosts, see Adding a Cluster Using
      New Hosts.
Select the hosts for your cluster by clicking the Currently Managed
        Hosts tab. This tab does not appear if you have no unassigned managed hosts. You
      cannot select a mixture of new hosts and currently managed hosts.
If you are installing CDH and other services using packages instead of parcels, make sure
      that you have manually installed the CDH packages on each host before continuing.
Select the hosts you want to add to the cluster, and then click
        Continue.
