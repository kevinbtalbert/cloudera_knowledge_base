Static Service Pools
Static service pools isolate the services in your cluster from one
    another, so that load on one service has a bounded impact on other services.
 Services are allocated a static percentage of total resources—CPU, memory,
      and I/O weight—which are not shared with other services. When you configure static service
      pools, Cloudera Manager computes recommended memory, CPU, and I/O configurations for the
      worker roles of the services that correspond to the percentage assigned to each service.
      Static service pools are implemented per role group within a cluster, using Linux control
      groups (cgroups) and cooperative memory limits (for example, Java maximum heap sizes). Static
      service pools can be used to control access to resources by HBase, HDFS, Impala, MapReduce,
      Solr, Spark, YARN, and add-on services. Static service pools are not enabled by default.
note
I/O allocation only works when short-circuit reads are enabled.
I/O allocation does not handle write side I/O because cgroups in the Linux
          kernel do not currently support buffered writes.

Viewing Static Service Pool Status
Select
              Clusters > Cluster
                name > Static Service
              Pools. If the cluster has a YARN
        service, the Static Service Pools Status tab displays and shows whether
        resource management is enabled for the cluster, and the currently
        configured service pools.


Enabling and Configuring Static Service PoolsTo enable and configure static service pools, you enter the percentage of resources     to allocate to each service and then restart the cluster.Disabling Static Service PoolsTo disable static service pools, disable cgroup-based resource management for all     hosts in all clusters.Parent topic: Resource Management
