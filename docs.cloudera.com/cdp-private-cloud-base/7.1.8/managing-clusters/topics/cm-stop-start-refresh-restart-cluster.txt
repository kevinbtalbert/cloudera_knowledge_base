Minimum Required Role:
Operator
        (also provided by Configurator,
          Cluster Administrator, Limited
          Cluster Administrator , Full
          Administrator) 
Complete the steps below to start, stop, refresh, and restart a cluster. 
Starting a Cluster

On the
              Home > Status
          tab, click  to the right of the cluster name and select Start.
Click Start that appears in the next screen to confirm. The
            Command Details window shows the progress of starting services.When All
              services successfully started appears, the task is complete and you can close the
              Command Details window.

noteThe cluster-level Start action starts only Cloudera Runtime and other product services
        (Impala, Cloudera Search). It does not start the Cloudera Management Service. You must start
        the Cloudera Management Service separately if it is not already running.

Stopping a Cluster

On the
              Home > Status
          tab, click  to the right of the cluster name and select Stop.
Click Stop in the confirmation screen. The Command
            Details window shows the progress of stopping services.When All services
              successfully stopped appears, the task is complete and you can close the
              Command Details window.

noteThe cluster-level Stop action does not stop the Cloudera Management Service. You must
        stop the Cloudera Management Service separately.

Refreshing a ClusterRuns a
      cluster refresh action to bring the configuration up to date without
      restarting all services. For example, certain masters (for example
      NameNode and ResourceManager) have some configuration files (for example,
        fair-scheduler.xml,
        mapred_hosts_allow.txt, topology.map)
      that can be refreshed. If anything changes in those files then a refresh
      can be used to update them in the master. importantIf you have changed a
        configuration property that requires a redeployment of the client
        configurations, note that refreshing or restarting a cluster does not
        automatically re-deploy the client configurations. A service or cluster
        displays a staleness icon () next to the cluster or service name that
        indicates that you must redeploy the client configuration. Click the
        icon to open the Stale
            Configurations page and follow the prompts to
        refresh the cluster and redeploy the client
          configuration.Alternatively, after a restart is completed, you can
          select Deploy Client Configuration from the
            Actions menu for either a service or cluster.
        
Here is a summary of the operations performed in a refresh action:
        

To refresh a cluster, in the
          Home > Status
      tab, click  to the right of the cluster name
      and select Refresh Cluster. 
Restarting a Cluster

        configurations, note that refreshing or restarting a cluster does not

On the
            Home > Status tab,
          click  to the right of the cluster name and select Restart.
Click Restart that appears in the next screen to confirm. If you have enabled
          high availability for HDFS, you can choose Rolling Restart instead
          to minimize cluster downtime. The Command Details window shows the progress of
          stopping services. When All services successfully started appears, the task is
            complete and you can close the Command Details window.
