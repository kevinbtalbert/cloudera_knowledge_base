Tuning and Troubleshooting Host Decommissioning

Decommissioning a host decommissions and stops all roles on the host without requiring you to
      individually decommission the roles on each service. The decommissioning process can take a
      long time and uses a great deal of cluster resources, including network bandwidth. You can
      tune the decommissioning process to improve performance and mitigate the performance impact on
      the cluster. 
You can use the Decommission and Recommission features to perform minor maintenance on
      cluster hosts using Cloudera Manager to manage the process.

Tuning HDFS Prior to Decommissioning DataNodesWhen a DataNode is decommissioned, the NameNode ensures that every block from the     DataNode will still be available across the cluster as dictated by the replication factor. This     procedure involves copying blocks from the DataNode in small batches. If a DataNode has     thousands of blocks, decommissioning can take several hours. Before decommissioning hosts with     DataNodes, you should first tune HDFS:Tuning HBase Prior to Decommissioning DataNodesTo increase the speed of a rolling restart of the HBase service, set the       Region Mover Threads property to a higher value. Performance ConsiderationsDecommissioning a DataNode does not happen instantly because the process requires     replication of a potentially large number of blocks. During decommissioning, the performance of     your cluster may be impacted. Troubleshooting Performance of DecommissioningSeveral conditions can impact performance when you decommission DataNodes.Parent topic: Performing Maintenance on a Cluster Host
