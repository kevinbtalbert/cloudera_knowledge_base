Tuning HBase Prior to Decommissioning DataNodes
To increase the speed of a rolling restart of the HBase service, set the
      Region Mover Threads property to a higher value. 
Minimum Required Role:
Configurator (also provided by
          Cluster Administrator,
Limited Cluster Administrator , and
          Full Administrator)
This increases the number of regions that can be moved in parallel, but
      places additional strain on the HMaster. In most cases, Region Mover
        Threads should be set to 5 or lower.
