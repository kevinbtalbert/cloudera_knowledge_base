Set Up an Environment
Set up an environment to run this tutorial.
Set up your environment with Compute and Base clusters
      as follows:
Create clusters where the Cloudera Manager and
          Cloudera Runtime version match, for example both are Cloudera Runtime
          7.1.1. The clusters must use Kerberos and TLS.
If Base cluster has Sentry, then make sure the
          user executing cross cluster queries is added to the correct role that
          has all the necessary privileges to create/insert data into tables.
          (more in workflow #3).
Configure a Regular cluster called Cluster 1 to
          be used as a Base cluster. This cluster must have high availability
          enabled. 
Create two Compute clusters called Compute 1 and
          Compute 2. 
Configure services for the three clusters as
          shown below:
