Dynamically loading a custom filter
Cloudera Runtime by default has the ability to dynamically load a custom
    filter.
It adds a JAR with your filter to the directory specified by the
        hbase.dynamic.jars.dir property (which defaults to the
        lib/ directory under the HBase root directory).
To disable automatic loading of dynamic JARs, set
    hbase.use.dynamic.jars to false in the
   advanced configuration snippet for hbase-site.xml if you use
   Cloudera Manager, or to hbase-site.xmlotherwise.
