Gracefully shut down the HBase service
You can gracefully shut down the HBase Service using Cloudera Manager.

In Clouder Manager, select the HBase service.

Click the Actions button.

Select Stop.
Cloudera Manager tries to perform an HBase Master-driven graceful
                    shutdown for the length of the configured Graceful Shutdown Timeout, after which
                    it abruptly shuts down the whole service. The default value of Graceful Shutdown
                    Timeout is three minutes.
