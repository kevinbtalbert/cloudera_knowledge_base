Writing data to HBase
To write data to HBase, you use methods of the Table
  class.
You can use the Java API directly, or use the HBase Shell, the REST API, the Thrift API, , or
   another client which uses the Java API indirectly. When you issue a Put, the coordinates of the
   data are the row, the column, and the timestamp. The timestamp is unique per version of the cell,
   and can be generated automatically or specified programmatically by your application, and must be
   a long integer.

Variations on PutThere are several different ways to write data into HBase.VersionsWhen you put data into HBase, a timestamp is required.DeletionWhen you request for HBase to delete data, either explicitly using a Delete method or   implicitly using a threshold such as the maximum number of versions or the TTL, HBase does not   delete the data immediatelyExamplesThese abbreviated example writes data to an HBase table.
