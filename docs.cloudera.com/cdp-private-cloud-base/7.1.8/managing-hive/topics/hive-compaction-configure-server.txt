Configuring compaction in Cloudera Manager
You see how to configure compaction properties exposed in Cloudera Manager. You rarely need to 
    configure other compaction properties, but need to know how to do this.

You can configure Hive metastore (HMS) and HiveServer (HS2) properties. Compaction
                properties you typically configure appear in Cloudera Manager. You search for a
                property to change it. Occasionally, you might add a property to hive-site or
                core-site using the Cloudera Manager Safety Valve.


In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > Hive > Configuration, and search for a property, such as hive.compactor.worker.threads.


Change the value, and save.

Restart the Hive cluster.
