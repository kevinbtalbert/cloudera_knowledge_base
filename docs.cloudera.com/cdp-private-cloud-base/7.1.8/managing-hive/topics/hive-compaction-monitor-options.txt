Options to monitor compactions
You can view the progress of compactions using the SHOW COMPACTIONS
  statement or by querying the COMPACTIONS view within the SYS
  database.
The query statement displays the following details about compactions:

C_ID: Unique internal compaction ID
C_DATABASE: Hive database name
C_TABLE: Table name
C_PARTITION: Partition name (if the table is partitioned)
C_TYPE: Major or minor compaction
C_STATE: Compaction state
initiated: waiting in queue to be compacted
working: currently being compacted
ready for cleaning: compaction completed and old files scheduled for removal 
failed: compaction job failed. Details are printed to the metastore log.
succeeded: compaction job completed successfully
attempted: initiator attempted to schedule a compaction but failed or
       hive.compactor.initiator.failed.compacts.threshold is breached and
      compaction is skipped . Details are printed to the metastore log.

C_WORKER_HOST: Thread ID of the worker thread performing the
    compaction
C_WORKER_ID: Unique internal worker ID
C_WORKER_VERSION: Version of distribution with running worker
C_ENQUEUE_TIME: Time when compaction request was placed 
C_START: Start time of the compaction job
C_DURATION: Duration (in ms) of the compaction job
C_HADOOP_JOB_ID: ID of the submitted MapReduce job for MR
    compaction. 'None' for query-based compaction.
C_INITIATOR_HOST: Host where initiator is configured
C_INITIATOR_ID: Unique internal initiator ID
C_INITIATOR_VERSION: Version of distribution with active initiator

noteDetails about "initiators" and "workers" are new additions that you
   can use to investigate the compaction setup in an environment. If you are unable to retrieve
   these details using the options listed here, you can run the following query on the backend
   database:SELECT activity.pid, 
       activity.usename, 
       activity.client_addr, 
       activity.client_hostname, 
       activity.query, 
       blocking.pid AS blocking_pid, 
       blocking.query AS blocking_query, 
       blocking.client_addr AS blocking_client_addr, 
       blocking.client_hostname AS blocking_client_hostname 
FROM pg_stat_activity AS activity
JOIN pg_stat_activity AS blocking
    ON blocking.pid = ANY(pg_blocking_pids(activity.pid))
WHERE blocking.query like '%AUX_TABLE%';

The following sections describe the various options that you can use to monitor
   compactions.
SHOW COMPACTIONS
You can run the SHOW COMPACTIONS statement to view details about all the
    compaction jobs.
SHOW COMPACTIONS;
Authorization is not required to use the SHOW COMPACTIONS statement.
    Therefore, every user can view compactions and their current state.
Since the statement lists all the compaction jobs, you cannot filter or limit the results as
    required. Alternatively, you can use the SYS database to query and filter
    specific compactions.

Querying the SYS database
The SYS database in the Hive metastore contains the following sources that
    you can use to monitor compactions:

COMPACTION_QUEUE: Stores information about compaction requests - both
     explicit user submitted and compactions discovered by the initiator and enqueued.
COMPLETED_COMPACTIONS: Stores the same information present in
      COMPACTION_QUEUE along with the compactionâ€™s end time. Records are moved to
     the completed table when the cleaner finishes the job on the compaction request.
COMPACTIONS: A view over the COMPACTION_QUEUE and
      COMPLETED_COMPACTIONS tables that resolves the column values to human
     readable format.

The SYS database tables and views are treated as normal Hive external tables
    or views, and therefore, standard access policies can be configured against these sources.
The following examples illustrate how you can run queries on the
     SYS.COMPACTIONS view to monitor compactions:

Query to display the last 10 failed compactions

SELECT * 
FROM SYS.COMPACTIONS
WHERE C_STATE='failed'
ORDERBY C_ID DESC
LIMIT 10;


Query to check the status of a specific compaction using the compaction ID

SELECT *
	FROM SYS.COMPACTIONS
	WHERE C_ID='1234';


Query to view the total number of compactions in a particular state

SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM SYS.COMPACTIONS
	WHERE C_STATE='ready for cleaning';



noteSimilarly, you can also query the
          INFORMATION_SCHEMA database for details about compactions. You must use
        the Ranger service and set up access policies for Hive users on this database to make it
        accessible.
