Monitoring compaction health in Cloudera Manager
Using Cloudera Manager, you can view compaction health checks for the Hive Metastore
        (HMS) and Hive on Tez services, view actions and advice related to configurations and
        thresholds, and use the Compaction tab from the Hive Metastore service to view
        compaction-related charts based on the collected metrics.


You must have enabled compaction health checks.
You must have enabled the Hive ACID metrics service to collect ACID-related
                    metrics.



Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to the HMS service by clicking Clusters > Hive.
The Health Tests panel in the
                        Status tab displays the compaction health test results,
                    typically with the specific metrics that the test returned.Similarly, you can
                        view the compaction health test results for the HiveServer (HS2) service by
                        going to Clusters > Hive on Tez.

From the HMS service page, click the Compactions tab to
                    view dashboards of compaction-related charts of various metrics.
You can create triggers for the charts that allow you to define actions to be
                    taken when a specified condition is met.
