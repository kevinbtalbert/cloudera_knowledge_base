Data compaction
As administrator, you need to manage compaction of
  delta files that accumulate during data ingestion. Compaction is a process that performs critical
  cleanup of files.
Hive creates a set of delta files for each transaction that alters a table or partition. By
   default, compaction of delta and base files occurs at regular intervals. Compactions occur in the
   background without affecting concurrent reads and writes. 
There are two types of compaction:
        

MinorRewrites a set of delta files to a single delta file for a bucket.
MajorRewrites one or more delta files and the base file as a new base file for a
    bucket.Carefully consider the need for a major compaction as this process can consume
    significant system resources and take a long time. Base and delta files for a table or partition
    are compacted.You can configure automatic compactions or do manual compactions. Start a major
     compaction during periods of low traffic. You use an ALTER TABLE statement to start compaction
     manually. A manual compaction either returns the accepted compaction request ID or shows the ID
     (and current state) of a compaction request for the very same target. The request is stored in
     the COMPACTION_QUEUE table. 


The compactor initiator must run on only one HMS instance at a time.

Compaction is not, however, necessarily required for Hive ACID. You need to understand     when you want, or do not want, compaction to occur.Initiating automatic compaction in Cloudera ManagerSeveral properties in the Hive and Hive metastore service configurations must be set         to enable automatic compaction. You need to check that the property settings are correct and         to add one of the properties to the Hive on Tez service. Automatic compaction will then         occur at regular intervals, but only if         necessary.Starting compaction manuallyYou manually start         compaction when automatic compaction fails for some reason. You can start compaction by         running a Hive statement.Options to monitor compactionsYou can view the progress of compactions using the SHOW COMPACTIONS   statement or by querying the COMPACTIONS view within the SYS   database.Disabling automatic compactionYou can disable automatic compaction of a particular Hive ACID table by setting a Hive       table property. By default, compaction is enabled, so you must enter an ALTER TABLE command to       disable it.Configuring compaction using table propertiesYou see how to configure compaction using table properties and learn about the advantage   of using this method of configuration. Configuring compaction in Cloudera ManagerYou see how to configure compaction properties exposed in Cloudera Manager. You rarely need to      configure other compaction properties, but need to know how to do this.Configuring the compaction check intervalYou need to know when and how to control the compaction process checking, performed in   the background, of the file system for changes that require compaction.Compactor propertiesYou check and change a number of Apache Hive properties to configure the compaction of     delta files that accumulate during data ingestion. You need to know the defaults and valid     values.
