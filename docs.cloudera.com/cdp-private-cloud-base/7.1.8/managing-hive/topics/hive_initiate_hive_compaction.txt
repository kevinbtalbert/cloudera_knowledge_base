Starting compaction
        manually
You manually start
        compaction when automatic compaction fails for some reason. You can start compaction by
        running a Hive statement.
You can run compaction pseudo-synchronously using the AND WAIT
            clause. Compaction actually occurs asynchronously, but seems synchronous. The compaction
            request is recorded and queued, and remains in a waiting cycle, querying the status of
            the compaction in the background until a failure, success, or timeout occurs. The
                hive.compactor.wait.timeout (default: 300s) property sets the
            timeout. Start compaction using a queryYou use the following syntax to
            issue a query that starts compaction: ALTER TABLE tablename [PARTITION (partition_key='partition_value' [,...])] COMPACT 'compaction_type'




Tables or partitions you are compacting must be full ACID or insert-only ACID
                    tables.
Compaction must be enabled (initiator
                        hive.compactor.initiator.on=true)



Run a query to start a major compaction of a table. 
 ALTER TABLE mytable COMPACT 'major'
Use the COMPACT 'minor' clause to run a minor compaction.
                        ALTER TABLE compacts tables even if the
                        NO_AUTO_COMPACTION table property is set. 

Start compaction in a pseudo-synchronous way.

ALTER TABLE mydb.mytable PARTITION (mypart='myval') COMPACT 'MAJOR' AND WAIT;
