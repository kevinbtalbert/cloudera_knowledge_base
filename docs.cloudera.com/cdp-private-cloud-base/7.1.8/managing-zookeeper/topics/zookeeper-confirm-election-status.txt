Confirm the election status of a ZooKeeper service
You can determine the election status of a ZooKeeper host if you have installed telnet
  ot netcat and it runs from a host with network access to the ZooKeeper host.
The default ZooKeeper client port is 2181. Run the following command against each ZooKeeper
   host:echo "stat" | nc server.example.org 2181 | grep ModeFor example, a
   follower host would return the message:
Mode: follower
You can use telnet, if you prefer:$ telnet server.example.org 2181
Sample output would be similar to the
   following:Trying 10.1.2.154...
Connected to server.example.org.
Escape character is '^]'.
