Impala Daemon Resource Pool Metrics
Reference information for Impala Daemon Resource Pool Metrics

In addition to these base metrics, many aggregate metrics are available.
If an entity type has parents defined, you can formulate all possible
aggregate metrics using the formula
base_metric_across_parents.
In addition, metrics for aggregate totals can be formed by adding the prefix
total_ to the front of the metric name.

Use the type-ahead feature in the Cloudera Manager chart browser to find the exact aggregate metric name,
in case the plural form does not end in "s".

For example, the following metric names may be valid for Impala Daemon Resource Pool:


impala_admission_controller_local_backend_mem_reserved_across_clusters


total_impala_admission_controller_local_backend_mem_reserved_across_clusters


Some metrics, such as alerts_rate, apply to nearly every metric context. Others only apply to a
certain service or role.
