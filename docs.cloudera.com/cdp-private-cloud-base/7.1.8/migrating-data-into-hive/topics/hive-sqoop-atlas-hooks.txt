Atlas Hook for Sqoop
Cloudera Manager configures the Atlas Hook for Sqoop automatically, but if you are
  upgrading, you need to know how to enable the Hook.
Cloudera Manager takes care of setting up the Atlas Hook for Sqoop in the following ways: 
Includes the required Atlas JARS in the correct location in your cluster.
Configures the Sqoop Atlas Hook in sqoop-site.xml.
Generates the atlas-application.properties file for Sqoop.  

If you are installing a fresh cluster that includes Atlas, Cloudera Manager enables the
      Sqoop Atlas Hook. 


If you are upgrading from an older cluster, you need to enable the Hook manually.
Enabling the Sqoop Atlas Hook after upgrading
The upgrade process does not enable the Atlas Hook. To enable the hook:
Go to Sqoop's configuration page.
Search for Atlas. 
Check the checkbox.
Re-deploy the client configurations using Cloudera Manager.
