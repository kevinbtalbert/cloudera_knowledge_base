Converting an HDFS file to ORCCloudera Docs
Converting an HDFS file to
        ORC
In CDP Private Cloud Base, to
        use Hive to query data in HDFS, you apply a schema to the data and then store data in ORC
        format.
To convert data stored in HDFS into the recommended format for querying in Hive, you
            create a schema for the HDFS data by creating a Hive external table, and then create a
            Hive-managed table to convert and query the data in ORC format. The conversion is a
            parallel and distributed action, and no standalone ORC conversion tool is necessary.
            Suppose you have the following CSV file that contains a header line that describes the
            fields and subsequent lines that contain the following data:
            Name,Miles_per_Gallon,Cylinders,Displacement,Horsepower,Weight_in_lbs, \
  Acceleration,Year,Origin
"chevrolet chevelle malibu",18,8,307,130,3504,12,1970-01-01,A
"buick skylark 320",15,8,350,165,3693,11.5,1970-01-01,A
"plymouth satellite",18,8,318,150,3436,11,1970-01-01,A
"amc rebel sst",16,8,304,150,3433,12,1970-01-01,A
"ford torino",17,8,302,140,3449,10.5,1970-01-01,A

You removed the header from the CSV file.
Create an external
            table:CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Cars(
    Name STRING, 
    Miles_per_Gallon INT,
    Cylinders INT,
    Displacement INT,
    Horsepower INT, 
    Weight_in_lbs INT,
    Acceleration DECIMAL,
    Year DATE,
    Origin CHAR(1))
COMMENT 'Data about cars from a public database'
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE
location '/user/<username>/visdata';

Create a Hive-managed table to convert the data to ORC.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mycars(
Name STRING, 
Miles_per_Gallon INT,
Cylinders INT,
Displacement INT,
Horsepower INT, 
Weight_in_lbs INT,
Acceleration DECIMAL,
Year DATE,
Origin CHAR(1))
COMMENT 'Data about cars from a public database'
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS ORC;


Insert the data from the external table into the Hive-managed table.

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE mycars SELECT * FROM cars;


Verify that you imported the data into the ORC-formatted table correctly:

hive> SELECT * FROM mycars LIMIT 3;
OK
