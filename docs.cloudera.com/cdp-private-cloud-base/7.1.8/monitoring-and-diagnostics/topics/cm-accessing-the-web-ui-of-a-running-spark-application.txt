Accessing the Web UI of a Running Spark Application
You can access the web UI of a running Spark application from a web browser.
 To access the web application UI of a running Spark application, open
        http://spark_driver_host:4040 in a web
      browser. If multiple applications are running on the same host, the web application binds to
      successive ports beginning with 4040 (4041, 4042, and so on). The web application is available
      only for the duration of the application.
