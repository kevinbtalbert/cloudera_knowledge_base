Adding a Filter
You can filter audit events by a chosen property.

Add the filter:

Click the  icon that displays next to a property
            when you hover in one of the event entries. A filter containing the property, operator,
            and its value is added to the list of filters at the left and Cloudera Manager
            redisplays all events that match the filter.
Click the Add a filter
            link. A filter control is added to the list of filters.

Choose a property in the drop-down list. You can search by properties such as
                  Username, Service, Command, or Role. The properties vary depending on the service
                  or role.
If the property allows it, choose an operator in the operator drop-down
                  list.
Type a property value in the value text field. To match a substring, use the
                    like operator and specify
                    % around the string. For
                  example, to see all the audit events for files created in the folder /user/joe/out specify Source like %/user/joe/out%.
Click Search. The log
                  displays all events that match the filter criteria.
