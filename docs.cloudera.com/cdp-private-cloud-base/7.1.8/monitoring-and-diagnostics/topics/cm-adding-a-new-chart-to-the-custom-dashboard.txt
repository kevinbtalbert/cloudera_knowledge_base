Adding a New Chart to the Custom Dashboard
You can add new charts to the custom dashboard on the Status tab of a service, host,
    or role.

Click  and select one of the following:
Add From Charts Library:
            Displays the charts page.
Select one or more charts.

Add From Chart Builder:
            Displays the Add Chart To
Dashboard page, with variables
            preset for the specific service, role, or host where you want to add the dashboard.
Click the question mark icon  to the right of the Build Chart button and select a metric from the List of Metrics, type a metric name or description
                into the Basic text field, or type a query into
                the Advanced field.
Click Build Chart. The
                charts that result from your query are displayed, and you can modify their chart
                type, combine them using facets, change their size and so on.


Click Add.
noteIf the query you've chosen has resulted in multiple charts,
            all the charts are added to the dashboard as a set. Although the individual charts in
            this set can be copied, you can only edit the set as a whole.
