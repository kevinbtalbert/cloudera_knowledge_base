Adding and Removing Charts from a Dashboard
You can add a chart to a dashboard or remove a chart from a custom dashboard. When
    you add a chart to a dashboard, you can add it to an existing dashboard or a new custom
    dashboard, which creates a new dashboard at the same time.

Minimum Required Role:
Configurator (also provided by
          Cluster Administrator,
Limited Cluster Administrator , and
          Full Administrator)


On the
            Home > Status tab,
          hover over the chart that you want to export data from.
To add a chart to a custom dashboard, click the  icon in
          the upper right corner of the chart and then click Add to
          Dashboard.
To add the chart to an existing dashboard, select Add chart to an
              existing custom or system dashboard and then the dashboard name.
To add the chart to a new dashboard, select Add chart to a new custom
              dashboard and enter a name for the dashboard in the Dashboard
              Name field. 
To remove a chart from a custom dashboard, click the  icon in
          the upper right corner of the chart and then click Remove. The
            Remove button does not appear in the menu when the default
          dashboard is used because the default dashboard does not allow removing the original
          charts. Use the edit button  to the upper right of the chart to switch
          between custom and default dashboards. The Remove button is only
          available to users with the required roles.
