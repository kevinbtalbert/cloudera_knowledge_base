Configuring Custom Alert Scripts 
You can configure the Alert Publisher to call a user-provided
    script in response to an alert. 
Minimum Required Role:
Limited Cluster
            Administrator  (also provided by Full
          Administrator and Cluster
          Administrator)
You can configure the Alert Publisher to run a user-written script in
      response to an alert. The
      Alert Publisher passes a single argument to the script that is a UTF-8
      JSON file containing a list of alerts. The script runs on the host where
      the Alert Publisher service is running and must have read and execute
      permissions for the cloudera-scm user. Only one
      instance of a script runs at a time. The standard out and standard error
      messages from the script are logged to the Alert Publisher log file. 
You use the Alert Publisher: Maximum Batch Size and Alert
        Publisher: Maximum Batch interval  to configure when the Alert Publisher
      delivers alerts. 
To configure the Alert Publisher to deliver alerts using a script:
Save the script on the host where the Alert Publisher role is
          running. 
Change the owner of the file to cloudera-scm and
          set its permissions to read and
          execute:sudo chown cloudera-scm:cloudera-scm path_to_script
sudo chmod u+rx path_to_script
Open the Cloudera Manager Admin console and
          select Clusters > Cloudera
              Management Service.
Click the Configuration tab.
Select Scope > Alert
              Publisher .
Enter the path to the script in the Custom Alert
            Script property.
Enter a Reason for
            change, and then click Save
            Changes to commit the changes.

A sample Python script is available that parses the alert file and sends
      alerts to different email addresses based on the content of the alert. See
        Sample Custom Alert Script.
Sample JSON Alert File
When a custom script runs, it passes a JSON file that contains the
        alerts. For example: [ {
  "body" : {
    "alert" : {
      "content" : "The health test result for MAPREDUCE_HA_JOB_TRACKER_HEALTH has become bad: JobTracker summary: myCluster.com (Availability: Active, Health: Bad). This health test reflects the health of the active JobTracker.",
