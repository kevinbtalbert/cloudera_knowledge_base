          System or SNMP server) with the Cloudera MIB.
Do one of the following:
Select Clusters > Cloudera Management Service.
On the
                  Home > Status
              tab, in Cloudera Management Service table,
              click the Cloudera Management Service link.

Click the Configuration
          tab.
Select Scope > Alert
              Publisher
           > SNMP.
Select
            Category > SNMP
Enter the DNS name or IP address of the Network Management System (SNMP server)
              acting as the trap receiver in the SNMP NMS Hostname
              property.
In the SNMP Security Level property, select the version of
              SNMP you are using: SNMPv2, SNMPv3 without authentication and without privacy
                (noAuthNoPriv), or SNMPv3 with authentication and without privacy
                (authNoPriv) and specify the required properties:
SNMPv2 - SNMPv2 Community String.
SNMPv3 without authentication (noAuthNoPriv) - SNMP Server
                  Engine Id and SNMP Security UserName.
SNMPv3 with authentication (authNoPriv) - SNMP Server Engine
                  Id, SNMP Security UserName, SNMP Authentication Protocol, and SNMP Authentication
                  Protocol Pass Phrase.

You can also change other settings such as the port, retry, or timeout values.
To apply this configuration property to other role groups as
            needed, edit the value for the appropriate role group. See the topic Modifying
              Configuration Properties Using Cloudera Manager.
Click Save Changes when you are done.
Restart the Alert Publisher role.

To disable SNMP traps, remove the hostname from the SNMP NMS Hostname
        property (alert.snmp.server.hostname).
