Alerts

An alert is an event that is considered especially noteworthy
      and is triggered by a selected event. Alerts are shown with an  badge when they
      appear in a list of events. You can configure the Alert Publisher to send alert notifications
      by email or by SNMP trap to a trap receiver.
Service instances of type HDFS, MapReduce, and HBase (and their associated
      roles) can generate alerts if so configured. Alerts can also be configured
      for the monitoring roles that are a part of the Cloudera Management
      Service.
The settings to enable or disable specific alerts are found under the Configuration tab for
      the services to which they pertain.
