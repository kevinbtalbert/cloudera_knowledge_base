Chart Properties
By default, the time-series data retrieved by the tsquery is displayed on its own
    chart, using a Line style chart, a default size, and a default
    minimum and maximum for the Y-axis. You can change the chart type, facet the data, set the chart
    scale and size, and set X- and Y-axis ranges.
Changing Scale
You can set the scale of the chart to linear, logarithmic, and power.

Changing Dimensions
You can change the size of your charts by modifying the values in the
          Dimension fields. They change in 50-pixel increments when you
          click the up or down arrows, and you can type values in as long as
          they are multiples of 50. If you have multiple charts, depending on
          the dimensions you specify and the size of your browser window, your
          charts may appear in rows of multiple charts. If the Resize
          Proportionally checkbox is checked, you can modify one dimension
          and the other will be modified automatically to maintain the chart's
          width and height proportions.
The following chart shows the same query as the
        previous chart, but with All Combined
        selected (which shows all time series in a single chart) and with the
        Dimension values increased to expand the chart.




Changing Axes
You can change the Y-axis range using the Y Range minimum and maximum
          fields.
The X-axis is based on clock time, and by default shows the last hour
        of data. You can use the Time Range Selector or a duration link (  ) to set
          the time range.



Changing the Chart TypeYou can change a chart from one type to another.Grouping (Faceting) Time SeriesA time-series plot for a service, role, or host may actually be a composite of multiple     individual time series. Using facets, you can combine time series based their attributes. Parent topic: Charting Time-Series Data
