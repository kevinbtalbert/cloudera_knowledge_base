Charting Time-Series Data
Cloudera Manager enables you to enter a query for a time series, chart the time-series
    data, group (facet) individual time series if your query produced multiple time series, and save
    the results as a dashboard.
The following sections have more details on the terminology used, how to query
      for time-series data, displaying chart details, editing charts, and
      modifying chart properties.

TerminologyThe list below describes the terminology used when creating     Charts.Building a Chart with Time-Series DataUse the Chart Builder to build a chart with time-series data.Configuring Time-Series Query ResultsA time-series query returns one or more time series or scalar values. By default a     maximum of 250 time series will be returned.Using Context-Sensitive Variables in ChartsWhen editing charts from a service, role or host status or charts page, or when adding     a chart to a status page, a set of context-sensitive variables (each beginning with '$') will be     displayed below the query box on the Chart Builder page.Chart PropertiesBy default, the time-series data retrieved by the tsquery is displayed on its own     chart, using a Line style chart, a default size, and a default     minimum and maximum for the Y-axis. You can change the chart type, facet the data, set the chart     scale and size, and set X- and Y-axis ranges.Displaying Chart DetailsYou can interact with a chart to display various chart details.Editing a ChartYou can edit a chart from the custom dashboard and save it back into the same or     another existing dashboard, or to a new custom dashboard. Saving a ChartAfter you edit a chart, you can save it to a new or existing custom     dashboard.Obtaining Time-Series Data Using the APIYou can obtain time-series data using the Cloudera Manager API. For details about     using a tsquery statement to obtain time-series data, see the /timeseries API documentation at http:// cmServerHost:7180/static/apidocs/path__timeseries.html.DashboardsA dashboard is a set of charts. This section covers     creating, configuring, and managing dashboards. tsquery LanguageThe tsquery language is used to specify statements for retrieving time-series data from     the Cloudera Manager time-series datastore.Metric AggregationIn addition to collecting and storing raw metric values, the Cloudera Manager Service     Monitor and Host Monitor produce a number of aggregate metrics from the raw metric data. Filtering MetricsMetric Filters limit the amount of metric data reported to the     Cloudera Manager server to avoid gaps in the reported data.
