Terminology
The list below describes the terminology used when creating
    Charts.
Entity
A Cloudera Manager component that has metrics associated with it,
          such as a service, role, or host. 
Metric
A property that can be measured to quantify the state of an entity
          or activity, such as the number of open file descriptors or CPU
          utilization percentage. For a list of all the metrics supported by
          Cloudera Manager, see the Cloudera Manager Metrics reference
          documentation.
Time Series
A list of (time, value) pairs that is associated with some (entity,
          metric) pair such as, (datanode-1, fd_open),
              (hostname, cpu_percent). In
          more complex cases, the time series can represent operations on other
          time series. For example, (datanode-1 , cpu_user +
            cpu_system). 
Facet
A display grouping of a set of time series. By default, when a query
          returns multiple time series, they are displayed in individual charts.
          Facets allow you to display the time series in separate charts, in a
          single chart, or grouped by various attributes of the set of time
          series.
