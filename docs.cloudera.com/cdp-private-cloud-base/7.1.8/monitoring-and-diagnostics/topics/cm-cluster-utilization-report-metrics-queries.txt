Metrics and queries
You can use metrics and queries to create a custom Cluster Utilization Report in
    Cloudera Manager.
Many of the metrics described below use a data granularity of
          hourly. This is not required, but is recommended because some
        of the YARN utilization metrics are only available hourly and using the
        hourly granularity allows for consistent reporting.

Yarn memory usage. The
                  yarn_reports_containers_used_memory metric
