Overview Tab
The overview tab of the cluster utilization report provides a summary of CPU and memory
  utilization.
The Overview tab provides a summary of CPU and
   memory utilization for the entire cluster and also for only YARN
   applications and Impala queries. Two sections, CPU
    Utilization and Memory
     Utilization, display the following information:

CPU Utilization
Memory Utilization



Overall Cluster Utilization

Total CPU Cores – Average
            number of CPU cores available during the reporting
            window. 
Average Utilization – Average CPU utilization for the entire
                    cluster, including resources consumed by user applications and Cloudera Runtime
                    services.
Maximum Utilization – Maximum CPU utilization
                    for the entire cluster during the reporting window, including resources consumed
                    by user applications and Cloudera Runtime services. If this value is high,
                    consider adding more hosts to the cluster. Click the drop-down menu next to
                      the date and select one of the following to view details about jobs running
                      when maximum utilization occurred:

Average Daily Peak – Average daily peak CPU
                    consumption for the entire cluster during the reporting window. This includes
                    resources consumed by user applications and Cloudera Runtime services. The
                    number is computed by averaging the maximum resource consumption for each day of
                    the reporting period.Click View Time Series Chart to
                      view a chart of peak utilization. 

Overall Cluster Utilization 
Total Physical Memory – Average
           physical memory available in the cluster during the
           reporting window. 
Average Utilization – Average memory consumption for the entire
                    cluster, including resources consumed by user applications and Cloudera Runtime
                    services. 
Maximum Utilization – Maximum memory consumption for the entire
                    cluster during the reporting window, including resources consumed by user
                    applications and Cloudera Runtime services. If this value is high, consider
                    adding more hosts to the cluster. Click the drop-down menu next to the date

Average Daily Peak – Average daily peak memory consumption for
                    the entire cluster during the reporting window, including resources consumed by
                    user applications and Cloudera Runtime services. The number is computed by
                    averaging the maximum memory utilization for each day of the reporting
                      period.Click View Time Series Chart to view a chart
                      of peak utilization. 



YARN + Impala Utilization
         
Average Utilization – Average
           resource consumption by YARN applications and Impala
           queries that ran on the cluster. 
Maximum Utilization – Maximum resource consumption by YARN
          applications and Impala queries that ran on the cluster. Click the drop-down menu next
           to the date and select one of the following to view details about jobs running when
           maximum utilization occurred:

View Impala Queries Running at the Time


Average Daily Peak – Average
           daily peak resource consumption by YARN applications and
           Impala queries during the reporting window. The number
           is computed by finding the maximum resource consumption
           per day and calculating the mean. Click

            view a chart of peak utilization. 

YARN + Impala Utilization 
Average Utilization – Average
           memory consumption by YARN applications and Impala
           queries that ran on the cluster. 
Maximum Utilization – Maximum memory consumption for the entire
                    cluster during the reporting window, including resources consumed by user
                    applications and Cloudera Runtime services. If this is high, consider adding
                    more hosts to the cluster. Click the drop-down menu next to the date and
