Retrieving metric data
You can vire the Cloudera Manager Service Monitor data storage granularities in Cloudera
  Manager.
There is a Time series endpoint exposed by the Cloudera Manager REST API. The API
   accepts tsquery statements as input for which metrics need to be retrieved during the specified
   time window. The API provides functionality to specify the desired data granularity (for example,
   raw metric values, TEN_MINUTES, HOURLY etc.). Each granularity level of data is maintained in a
   leveldb table. This data is aggregated from raw metric values such as minimum, maximum, etc.
   within the corresponding data window. For example, if you do not need the metric data at a specific
    timestamp but care more about the hourly usage, HOURLY data should be
    good enough. In general, the longer the granular window it is, the less
    storage it is taking, and thus the longer period of time you are able to
    keep that level of data without being purged when the storage raches the
    configured limit. In the case of Cloudera Manager Cluster Utilization
    Reports, Cloudera Manager generates the reports based on an hourly
    window. 
To view the Cloudera Manager Service Monitor data storage
   granularities, go to
   Clusters > Cloudera
    Management Service > Service
     Monitor > Charts
      Library > Service Monitor
       Storage and scroll down to see the
   Data Duration Covered table to see the earliest
   available data points for each level of granularity. The value in the
   last(duration_covered)  column indicates the
   age of the oldest data in the table. To configure the Time series storage used by the Service Monitor, go to
          Clusters > Cloudera
          Management
        Service > Configuration
      and search for "Time-Series Storage".
