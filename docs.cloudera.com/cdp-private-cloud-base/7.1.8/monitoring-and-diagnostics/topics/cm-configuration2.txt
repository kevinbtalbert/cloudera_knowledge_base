Configuration
The Configuration page for a host lets you set properties for the
    selected host. 
You can
      set properties in the following categories:

Advanced - Advanced configuration properties. These
          include the Java Home Directory, which explicitly sets the value of JAVA_HOME for all processes. This overrides the
          auto-detection logic that is normally used.

Monitoring - Monitoring properties for this host. The
          monitoring settings you make on this page will override the global host monitoring
          settings you make on the Configuration tab of the Hosts page. You can configure monitoring
          properties for:
Health check thresholds
The amount of free space on the filesystem containing the
              Cloudera Manager Agent's log and process directories 
A variety of conditions related to memory usage and other
              properties
Alerts for health check events 

For some monitoring properties, you can set thresholds as either a
            percentage or an absolute value (in bytes). 


Other - Other configuration properties

Parcels - Configuration properties
          related to parcels. Includes the Parcel
            Director property, the directory that parcels will be installed
          into on this host. If the parcel_dir variable is set in the Agent's config.ini file, it will
          override this value.

Resource Management - Enables resource management using
          control groups (cgroups)
