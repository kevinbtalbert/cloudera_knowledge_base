Configuring Directory Monitoring
Cloudera Manager can perform threshold-based monitoring of free space in the various
    directories on the hosts it monitor, such as log directories or checkpoint directories (for the
    Secondary NameNode).
These thresholds can be set in one of two waysâ€”as absolute thresholds
        (in terms of MiB and GiB, and so on) or as percentages of space. As with
        other threshold properties, you can set values that trigger events at
        both the Warning and Critical levels.
If you set both thresholds, the Absolute Threshold setting is used.
