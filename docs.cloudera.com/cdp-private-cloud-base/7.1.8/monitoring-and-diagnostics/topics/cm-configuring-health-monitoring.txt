Configuring Health Monitoring
Depending on the service or role you select, and the configuration category, you can
    enable or disable health tests, determine when health tests cause alerts, or determine whether
    specific health tests are used in computing the overall health of a role or service. In most
    cases you can disable these "roll-up" health tests separately from the individual health
    tests.
The initial health monitoring configuration is handled during the installation and
      configuration of your cluster, and most monitoring parameters have default settings. However,
      you can set or modify these at any time.
As a rule, a health test whose result is considered "Concerning" or "Bad" is forwarded as an
      event to the Event Server. That includes health tests whose results are based on configured
      Warning or Critical thresholds, as well pass-fail type health tests. An event is also
      published when the health test result returns to normal.
You can control when an individual health test is forwarded as an event or as an alert by
      modifying the threshold values for the relevant health test.
