Configuring Impala Query Data Store Maximum Size
You can configure the Impala query data store size. The query store stores enough
    information to make the query searchable through the filter language.

Minimum Required Role:
Configurator (also provided by
          Cluster Administrator,
Limited Cluster Administrator , and
          Full Administrator)


Do one of the following:
Select Clusters > Cloudera Management
                Service > . 
On the
              Home > Statustab,
            in the Cloudera Management Service table, click the
              Cloudera Management Service link.

Click the Configuration tab.Select Scope > Service
              Monitor.Click the Main category.In the Impala Storage section, set the
            firehose_impala_storage_bytes property. The default is 1
          GiB.The firehose_impala_storage_bytes property determines the
          approximate amount of disk space dedicated to storing Impala query data. Once the store
          reaches its maximum size, older data is deleted to make room for newer queries. The disk
          usage is approximate because data deletion begins only when the limit has been
          reached.Enter a Reason for change, and then click Save
            Changes to commit the changes.Click the Cloudera Manager logo to return to the Home page.Click the 
          icon that is next to any stale services to invoke the cluster restart wizard.
