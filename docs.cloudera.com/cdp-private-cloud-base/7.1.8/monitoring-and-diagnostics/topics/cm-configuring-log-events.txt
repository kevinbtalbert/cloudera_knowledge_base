Configuring Log Events
You can enable or disable the forwarding of selected log events to the Event
    Server.
 This
      functionality is enabled by default, and is a service-wide setting (Enable Log Event Capture) for each service
      for which monitoring is provided. You can enable and disable event capture for Cloudera
      Runtime services or for the Cloudera Management Service.
importantCloudera does not recommend logging to a network-mounted file system. If
      a role is writing its logs across the network, a network failure or the failure of a remote
      file system can cause that role to freeze up until the network recovers.
