Configuring Logging Thresholds
A logging threshold determines what level of log message is reported.

Minimum Required Role:
Configurator (also provided by
          Cluster Administrator,
Limited Cluster Administrator , and
          Full Administrator)
The available levels are:



TRACE - Informational events
            finer-grained than DEBUG. 

DEBUG - Informational events useful to
            debug an application.

INFO - Informational events that
            highlight progress at coarse-grained level.

WARN - Events that indicate a potential
            problem which is handled by the application.

ERROR - Error events that allows the
            application to continue running.

FATAL - Very severe error events that
            typically lead the application to abort.


 The number of messages is greater and severity is least for TRACE. The default setting is INFO.
