Configuring the Frequency of Diagnostic Data Collection
By default, Cloudera Manager collects diagnostic data on a weekly basis. You can
    change the frequency to daily, weekly, monthly, or never. If you are a Cloudera Enterprise
    customer and you set the schedule to never, you can still
    collect and send data to Cloudera on demand. If you are a Cloudera Enterprise customer and you
    set the schedule to never, data is not collected or sent to
    Cloudera.
