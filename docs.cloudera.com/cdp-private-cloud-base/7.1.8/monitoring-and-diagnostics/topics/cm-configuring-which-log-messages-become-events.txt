Configuring Which Log Messages Become Events
You can configure rules to determine which log messages become events. 

Cloudera defines a number of rules by default. For example:

The line {"rate": 10,
            "threshold":"FATAL"}, means log entries with severity FATAL should be forwarded as events, up to 10 a
          minute.
The line {"rate": 0,
            "exceptiontype": "java.io.EOFException"}, means log entries with the exception
            java.io.EOFException should
          always be forwarded as an event.

The syntax for these rules is defined in the Description field for this property: the
        syntax lets you create rules that identify log messages based on log4j severity, message
        content matching, or the exception type. These rules must result in valid JSON.
noteEditing these rules is not recommended. Cloudera Manager provides
        a default set of rules that should be sufficient for most users.
Minimum Required Role:

Click the Configuration tab.Enter Rules to Extract Events from Log
            Files in the Search text field.Click the Monitoring category.Select the role group for the role for which you want to configure log events, or
          search for "Rules to Extract Events from Log Files." Note that for some roles
          there may be more than one role group, and you may need to modify all of them. The easiest
          way to ensure that you have found all occurrences of the property you need to modify is to
          search for the property by name. Cloudera Manager shows all copies of the property that
          matches the search filter.In the Content field, edit the rules as needed. Rules can be written as regular
          expressions.Enter a Reason for change, and then click Save
            Changes to commit the changes.Click the Cloudera Manager logo to return to the Home page.Click the 
          icon that is next to any stale services to invoke the cluster restart wizard.
