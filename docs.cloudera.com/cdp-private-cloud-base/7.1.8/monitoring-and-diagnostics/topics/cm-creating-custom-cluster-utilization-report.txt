Creating a Custom Cluster Utilization Report
 You can create a custom Cluster Utilization Report using different metrics and
  queries.
Cloudera Manager provides a Cluster Utilization Report that displays aggregated
   utilization information for YARN and Impala jobs. If you wish to export the data from this
   report, you can build custom reports based on the same metrics data using the Cloudera Manager
   Admin console or the Cloudera Manager API. These reports all use the tsquery Language to chart
   time-series data.
