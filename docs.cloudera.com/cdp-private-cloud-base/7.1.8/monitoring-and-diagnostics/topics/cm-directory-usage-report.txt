Directory Usage Report
The directory usage report allows you to browse the HDFS filesystem in a way that is
    similar to the HDFS File Browser. However, the Directory Usage Report also allows you to sort the listings and select multiple
    items and perform actions on them.

You can
      also view the last access time, the last modified time of any file in a directory, and the
      total size of all files in the directory. This usage information is updated on an hourly
      basis.
You can customize the report by adding filters. A number of preconfigured
      filters are available, and you can create a custom filter.
