Disk Usage Reports
The disk usage reports show HDFS disk usage statistics, either current or historical,
    by user, group, or directory.
The By Directory reports display information about the
      directories in the Watched list, so if you are not watching any directories there will be no
      results found for these reports. You can also specify which directories to watch by selecting
      them from the Directory Usage Report.
