Displaying Chart Details
You can interact with a chart to display various chart details.
When you move your mouse over a chart, its background turns gray, indicating
        that you can act upon it.

Moving the mouse to a data point on a line, stack area, or bar chart shows the
          details about that data point in a pop-up tooltip.

Click a line, stack area, scatter, or bar
        chart to expand it into a full-page view with a legend for the
        individual charted entities as well more fine-grained axes
        divisions.

If there are multiple entities in the chart, you can
Check and uncheck the legend item to hide or show the
                time series for the entities on the chart.

If there are service, role, or host instances in the
                chart, click the 
View link to display the instance's Status page.


Click the Close button to return to the regular chart view.



Heatmap - Clicking a square in a heatmap displays a line chart of the
          time series for that entity.

Histogram -
Mousing over the upper right corner of a
            histogram and clicking 
            opens a pop-up containing the query that generated the chart, an
            expanded view of the chart, a list of entity names and links to the
            entities whose metrics are represented by the histogram bars, and
            the value of the metric for each entity. For example, clicking the
            following histogram 


displays the following:




Clicking a bar in the expanded histogram
            displays a line chart of the time series from which the histogram
            was generated:


Clicking the < Back link at the bottom left of the line chart returns
