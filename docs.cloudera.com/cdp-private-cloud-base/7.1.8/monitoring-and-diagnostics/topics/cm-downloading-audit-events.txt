Downloading Audit Events
You can download audit events in CSV formats.Specify desired filters and time range.Click the Download CSV button. A file with the following fields is
          downloaded: service, username, command,
            ipAddress, resource, allowed,
            timestamp, operationText. The structure of the
            resource field depends on the type of the service:

HDFS - A file path
Hive, Hue, and Impala - database:tablename

HBase - table
family:qualifier


For Hive, Hue, and Impala query and load commands, operationText
            is the query string.
HDFS Service Audit Log
service,username,command,ipAddress,resource,allowed,timestamp
hdfs1,cloudera,setPermission,10.20.187.242,/user/hive,false,"2013-02-09T00:59:34.430Z"
hdfs1,cloudera,getfileinfo,10.20.187.242,/user/cloudera,true,"2013-02-09T00:59:22.667Z"
hdfs1,cloudera,getfileinfo,10.20.187.242,/,true,"2013-02-09T00:59:22.658Z"
In this example, the first event access was denied, and therefore the
          allowed field has the value false.
