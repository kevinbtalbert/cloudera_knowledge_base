Exporting Data from Charts
You can export data from charts in either JSON or CSV format.

On the
            Home > Status tab,
          hover over the chart that you want to export data from.
Click the  icon in the upper right corner of the chart.
Click Export JSON to display the chart data in JSON format in a new browser
            window.
Click Export CSV to open a Save dialog box enabling you to save the
            data as a CSV file. Choose a program to open the CSV, or open the file with your
            system's default program for editing and displaying CSV files.


noteTime values that appear in Cloudera Manager charts reflect the time zone setting
              on the Cloudera Manager client machine, but time values returned by the Cloudera
              Manager API (including those that appear in JSON and CSV files exported from charts)
              reflect Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For more information on the timestamp
              format, see the Cloudera Manager API documentation, for example,
                ApiTimeSeriesData.java.
