The following topic covers frequently asked questions about charting time-series
    data.

How do I compare information across hosts?


Click Hosts in the top navigation bar and click a host link.
In the Charts pane, choose a chart, for example Host CPU Usage and select  and then Open in Chart Builder.
In the text box, remove the where entityName=$HOSTID clause and
                click Build Chart.
In the Facets list, click hostname to compare the values across hosts.
Configure the time scale, minimums and
              maximums, and dimension. For example:





How do I compare all disk IO for all the DataNodes that belong to a specific
            HDFS service?
Use a query of the
          form:select bytes_read, bytes_written where roleType=DATANODE and serviceName=hdfs1replacing
            hdfs1 with your HDFS service name. Then
          facet by metricDisplayName and compare all DataNode
            byte_reads and byte_writes metrics at once.
When would I use a derivative function?
Some metrics represent a counter, for example, bytes_read. For
            such metrics it is sometimes useful to see the rate of change
            instead of the absolute counter value. Use dt or
            dt0 derivative functions.
When should I use the dt0 function?
Some metrics, like bytes_read represent a counter that always
            grows. For such metrics a negative rate means that the counter has
            been reset (for example, process restarted, host restarted, and so
            on). Use dt0 for these metrics.
How do I display a threshold on a chart?
Suppose that you want to retrieve the
          latencies for all disks on your hosts, compare them, and show a
          threshold on the chart to easily detect outliers. Use the following
          query to retrieve the metrics and the threshold:select await_time, await_read_time, await_write_time, 250 where category=disk
Then choose All
              Combined (1) in the Facets list. The scalar threshold 250 will also be rendered
            on the chart:




I get the warning "The query hit the maximum results limit". How do I work
            around the limit?
There is a limit on the number of results that can be returned
          by a query. When a query results in more time-series streams than the limit a warning for
          "partial results" is issued. To circumvent the problem, reduce the number of metrics you
          are trying to retrieve or see the topic Configuring Time-Series Query
          Results. You can use the rlike operator to limit the query to a subset
            of entities. For example, instead
            ofselect await_time, await_read_time, await_write_time, 250 where category=DISK
you can
          useselect await_time, await_read_time, await_write_time, 250 where category=DISK and hostname rlike "host1[0-9]?.cloudera.com"The
          latter query retrieves the disk metrics for ten hosts.
How do I discover which metrics are available for which entities?


Type Select in the text box and then press Space or continue
                typing. Metrics matching the letters you type display in a
                drop-down list.
Select Charts > Chart Builder, click the question mark icon  to the right of the Build Chart button and click the List of Metrics link
Retrieve all metrics for the type of entity:select * where roleType=DATANODE
