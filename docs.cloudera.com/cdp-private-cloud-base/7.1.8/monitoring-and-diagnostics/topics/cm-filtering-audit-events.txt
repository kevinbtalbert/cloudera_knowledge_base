Filtering Audit Events
You filter audit events by selecting a time range and adding filters.

You can use the Time Range Selector or a duration link (  ) to set the
        time range.  When you select the time range, the log displays all events in that range.
      The time it takes to perform a search will typically increase for a longer time range, as the
      number of events to be searched will be larger.
