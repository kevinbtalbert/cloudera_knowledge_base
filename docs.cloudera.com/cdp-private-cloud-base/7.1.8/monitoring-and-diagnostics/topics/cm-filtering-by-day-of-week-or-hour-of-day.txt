Filtering by Day of Week or Hour of Day
You can add an expression to the predicate of a tsquery statement that limits the stream
    to specified days of the week or to a range of hours in each day. 

By Day – Limits the stream to selected days of the week. 
The day in () expression
      takes an argument with a comma-separated list of days of the week, enclosed in parentheses.
      The days of the week are numbered 1 through 7; 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, and so on. Use the
      following
      syntax:day in (#, #, ...)

For example, the following expression limits the stream to events that
      occurred only on
      weekdays:day in (1,2,3,4,5)


By Hour – Limits the stream to a range of hours each
      day.
The hour in expression
      takes an argument with a range of hours separated by a colon and enclosed in square brackets.
      Valid values are integers
      0–23:hour in [#:#]

For example, the following expression limits the stream to events that
      occur only between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00
      p.m.:hour in [9:17]

Add the day or time range expression after the WHERE clause. Do not use the AND keyword. For example:
select fd_open where category = ROLE and roleType = SERVICEMONITOR day in (1,2,3,4,5) 
You can also combine day
        in and hour in expressions. Always
      put the day expression before the hour expression. The following example limits the
      stream to weekdays between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00
      p.m.:select fd_open where category = ROLE and roleType = SERVICEMONITOR day in (1,2,3,4,5) hour in [9:17]
