Filtering Events

You filter events by selecting a time range and adding filters.

You can use the Time Range Selector or a duration link (  ) to set the
        time range.  The time it takes to perform a search will typically increase for a longer
      time range, as the number of events to be searched will be larger.
To re-run a recently performed search, click  to the right
      of the Search button and select a search.
