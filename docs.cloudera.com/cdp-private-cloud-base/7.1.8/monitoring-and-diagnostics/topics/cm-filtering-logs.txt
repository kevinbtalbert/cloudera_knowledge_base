Filtering Logs
You filter logs by selecting a time range and specifying filter
    parameters.
You can use the Time Range Selector or a duration link (
         ) to set the time range.
      See for details. However, logs are, by definition, historical, and are meaningful only in that
      context. So the Time Marker, used to pinpoint status at a specific point in time, is not
      available on this page. The Now button () is available.Specify any of the log filter parameters: 


Search Phrase - A string to match against the log message content. The search
              is case-insensitive, and the string can be a regular expression, such that wildcards
              and other regular expression primitives are supported.

Select Sources - A list of all the service instances and roles currently
              instantiated in your cluster. By default, all services and roles are selected to be
              included in your log search; the All Sources checkbox lets you select or clear all
              services and roles in one operation. You can expand each service and limit the search
              to specific roles by selecting or clearing individual roles.

Hosts - The hosts to be included in the search. As soon as you start typing a
              hostname, Cloudera Manager provides a list of hosts that match the partial name. You
              can add multiple names, separated by commas. The default is to search all hosts.

Minimum Log Level - The minimum severity level for messages to be included in
              the search results. Results include all log entries at the selected level or higher.
              This defaults to WARN (that is, a search will return log entries with severity of
              WARN, ERROR, or FATAL only.

Additional Settings


Search Timeout - A time (in seconds) after which the search will time out.
                  The default is 20 seconds.

Results per Page - The number of results (log entries) to be displayed per
                  page.



Click Search. The Logs list displays the log entries that
          match the specified filter.
