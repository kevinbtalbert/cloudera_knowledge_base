Filtering the Tasks List
You can filter the list of tasks based on values of any of the metrics that are
    available.
To use one of the predefined filters, click the  to the right of the Search button and
          select the filter you want to run. There are predefined filters to search by job type (for
          example Pig activities, MapReduce jobs, and so on) or for running, failed, or long-running
          activities.To create a filter, click the  to the right of the
            Search button and select Custom.Select a metric from the drop-down list in the first field; you can create a filter
          based on any of the available metrics.Once you select a metric, fill in the rest of the fields; your choices depend on
          the type of metric you have selected. Use the percent character % as a
          wildcard in a string; for example, Id matches job%0001 will look for any
          MapReduce job ID with suffix 0001.To create a compound filter, click the plus icon at the end of the filter row to
          add another row. If you combine filter criteria, all criteria must be true for an activity
          to match.To remove a filter criteria from a compound filter, click the minus icon at the end
          of the filter row. Removing the last row removes the filter.To include any children of a Pig, Hive, or Oozie activity in your search results,
          check the Include Child Activities checkbox. Otherwise, only the top-level activity
          will be included, even if one or more child activities matched the filter
        criteria.Click the Search button (which appears when you start creating the filter)
          to run the filter.
noteThe filter persists only for this user session â€” when you log out, tasks list filter
            is removed.
