Grouping (Faceting) Time Series
A time-series plot for a service, role, or host may actually be a composite of multiple
    individual time series. Using facets, you can combine time series based their attributes. 
For example, the query SELECT
        jvm_heap_used_mb where clusterId = 1 returns time-series data for the JVM heap
      used. Each time series has hostname, role type, metric, and entity name attributes. By default
      each attribute is displayed all on a single chart.
To change the organization of the chart data, click
      one of the facets in the facet section in the upper part of the screen.
      The number in parentheses indicates how many charts will be displayed for
      that facet. As shown in the image below if the serviceName facet is
      selected for the JVM heap query, the time series is grouped into six
      charts, one chart each for each service name. The charts for service types
      with multiple roles contain multiple lines (for example, HBase, HDFS)
      while services that have only one role (for example, ZooKeeper) contain
      just a single line. When a chart contains multiple lines, each entity is
      identified by a different color line.
