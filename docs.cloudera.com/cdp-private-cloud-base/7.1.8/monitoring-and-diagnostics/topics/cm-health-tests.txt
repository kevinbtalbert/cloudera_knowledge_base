Health Tests
Cloudera Manager monitors the health of the services, roles, and hosts that are
    running in your clusters using health tests. 
The Cloudera Management Service also provides health tests for its roles.
      Role-based health tests are enabled by default. For example, a simple health test is whether
      there's enough disk space in every NameNode data directory. A more complicated health test may
      evaluate when the last checkpoint for HDFS was compared to a threshold or whether a DataNode
      is connected to a NameNode. Some of these health tests also aggregate other health tests: in a
      distributed system like HDFS, it's normal to have a few DataNodes down (assuming you've got
      dozens of hosts), so we allow for setting thresholds on what percentage of hosts should color
      the entire service down.
Health tests can return one of three values:
        Good, Concerning, and Bad. A test returns
        Concerning health if the test falls below a warning threshold. A
      test returns Bad if the test falls below a critical
      threshold. The overall health of a service or role instance is a roll-up
      of its health tests. If any health test is Concerning (but none are
        Bad) the role's or service's health is Concerning; if any
      health test is Bad, the service's or role's health is
      Bad.
In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, health tests results are indicated
      with colors: Good
, Concerning
, and Bad
.

There are two types of health tests:

Pass-fail tests - there are two types:
Compare a property to a yes-no value. For example,
                whether a service or role started as expected, a DataNode is connected to its
                NameNode, or a TaskTracker is (or is not) blocked.
Exercise a service lightly to confirm it is working and responsive. HDFS
                (NameNode role), HBase, and ZooKeeper services perform these
                tests, which are referred to as "canary" tests.
Both types of pass-fail tests result in the health reported as being either
            Good or Bad.

Metric tests - compare a property to a numeric value. For example, the
            number of file descriptors in use, the amount of disk space used or
            free, how much time spent in garbage collection, or how many pages
            were swapped to disk in the previous 15 minutes. In these tests the
            property is compared to a threshold that determine whether
            everything is Good, (for example, plenty of disk space
            available), whether it is Concerning (disk space getting
            low), or is Bad (a critically low amount of disk space).


By default most health tests are enabled and (if appropriate)
        configured with reasonable thresholds. You can modify threshold values by editing the
        monitoring properties under the entity's Configuration
        tab. You can also enable or disable individual or summary health tests, and in some cases
        specify what should be included in the calculation of overall health for the service, role
        instance, or host.
