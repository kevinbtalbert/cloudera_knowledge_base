Impala query counter metrics
Use Impala query counter metrics to get information about the rate of Impala
  queries.
Include the following in the SELECT statement of the tsquery:
counter_delta(queries_ingested_rate)
counter_delta(queries_successful_rate)
counter_delta(queries_rejected_rate)
counter_delta(queries_oom_rate)
counter_delta(queries_timed_out_rate)
counter_delta(impala_query_admission_wait_rate)
counter_delta(impala_query_memory_spilled_rate)

For example:
SELECT
   counter_delta(queries_ingested_rate)
   WHERE
   category=IMPALA_POOL
   AND clusterName=Cluster_Name
   AND serviceName=Service_Name
