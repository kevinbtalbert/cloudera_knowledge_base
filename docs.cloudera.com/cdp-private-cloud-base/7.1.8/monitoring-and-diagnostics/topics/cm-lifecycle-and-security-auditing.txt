Lifecycle and Security Auditing
An audit event is an event that describes an action
    that has been taken for a cluster, host, license, parcel, role, service or user.

Cloudera Manager records cluster, host, license,
        parcel, role, and service lifecycle
          events (activate, create, delete, deploy, download, install, start, stop, update,
        upgrade, and so on), user security-related events (add
        and delete user, login failed and succeeded), and provides an audit UI and API to view,
        filter, and export such events. The Cloudera Manager audit log does not track the
      progress or results of commands (such as starting or stopping a service or creating a
      directory for a service), it just notes the command that was executed and the user who
      executed it. To view the progress or results of a command, follow the procedures in the topic
        Viewing and Running Recent Commands. 

In CDP, Ranger performs auditing against the data
        access policies defined for each service. Ranger provides an audit UI and API to view,
        filter, and export service access audit logs. For information about auditing features,
      see the Ranger Auditing documentation.
