Log Details
The Log Details page presents a portion of the full log, showing
    the selected message (highlighted), and messages before and after it in the log. 
The
        Log Details page shows you:

The host
The role
The full path and name of the log file you are viewing.
Messages before and after the one you selected.

The log displays the following information for each message:

Time - the time the entry was logged
Log Level - the severity of the entry
Source - the source class that logged the entry
Log Message

You can
      switch to display only messages or all columns using the  buttons.
In addition, from the Log Details page you can:

View the log entries in either expanded or contracted form using the buttons to
          the left of the date range at the top of the log.
Download the full log using the Download Full Log button at the top right
          of the page.
View log details for a different host or for a different role on the current
          host, by clicking the Change... link next to the host or role
          at the top of the page. In either case this shows a pop-up where you
          can select the role or host you want to see.
