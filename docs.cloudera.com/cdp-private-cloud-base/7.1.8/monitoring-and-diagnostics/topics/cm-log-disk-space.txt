Managing Disk Space for Log Files 
All CDH cluster hosts write out separate log files for each role
    instance assigned to the host. Cluster administrators can monitor and manage
    the disk space used by these roles and configure log rotation to prevent log
    files from consuming too much disk space.

Disk Space Requirements

For each role assigned to a host, you should generally provision 2GB of
        disk space for log files. This recommendation is based on the default
        values of configuration properties that set the maximum log file size
        (200MB) and the maximum number of files (10). To calculate the disk
        space required for each host, multiply the configured maximum size of
        the log file by the configured maximum number of logs. Perform this
        calculation for each role on a host and add them together. (Note that
        Gateway roles do not generate log files.)
To determine the roles assigned to each host, open the Cloudera Manager
        Admin Console and go to
            Hosts > All
            Hosts and expand the list of roles in the
          Roles column.



Managing Log Files

To manage log file configurations for all role instances of a
          service:
Go to Service
                Name > Configuration. 
Select
                Category > Logs.
Edit the logging parameters.
Click Save Changes.
noteYou can also manage these configurations using
            Role Groups, which you can use to configure
          similar hosts with the same configuration values.
There are the parameters you use to manage log files:Table 1. Log File Properties
