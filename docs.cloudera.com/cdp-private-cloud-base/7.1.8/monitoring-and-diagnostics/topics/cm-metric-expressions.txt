Metric Expressions
A metric expression generates the time series. It
    is a comma-delimited list of one or more metric expression statements.
 A metric expression statement is the name of a metric, a metric
      expression function, or a scalar value, joined by one or more metric expression operators.
See the
      FAQ which answers questions concerning how to discover metrics and use cases for scalar
      values. For a list of all the supported metrics, see
        the Cloudera Manager Metrics reference documentation.

Metric expressions support the binary operators: +,
        -, *, /.
Here are some examples of metric expressions:

jvm_heap_used_mb, cpu_user, 5

1000 * jvm_gc_time_ms / jvm_gc_count


total_cpu_user + total_cpu_system


max(total_cpu_user)
