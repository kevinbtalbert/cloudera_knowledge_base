Monitoring Activities
Cloudera Manager's activity monitoring capability monitors the
    Hive, Oozie, and streaming jobs, Impala queries, and YARN applications
    running or that have run on your cluster. 
When the individual jobs are part of larger workflows (using Oozie, or
      Hive), these jobs are aggregated into MapReduce jobs that can be monitored
      as a whole, as well as by the component jobs.
If you are running multiple clusters, there will be a separate link in the
        Clusters tab for each cluster's MapReduce activities, Impala queries,
      and YARN applications. 
The following sections describe how to view and monitor
      activities that run on your cluster.

Selecting Columns to Show in the Activities ListIn the Activities list, you can display or hide any of the statistics that Cloudera     Manager collects. By default only a subset of the possible statistics are displayed.Sorting the Activities ListYou can sort the Activities list by the contents of any column.Filtering the Activities ListYou can filter the list of activities based on values of any of the metrics that are     available. You can also easily filter for certain common queries from the drop-down menu next to     the Search button at the top of the Activities list. By default, it is set to show All Activities.Activity ChartsBy default the charts show aggregated statistics about the performance of the cluster:     Tasks Running, CPU Usage, and Memory Usage. There are additional charts you can enable from a     pop-up panel. You can also superimpose individual job statistics on any of the displayed     charts.Viewing the Jobs in a Pig, Oozie, or Hive ActivityThe Activity Children tab shows the same information as does the Activities tab,     except that it shows only jobs that are children of a selected Pig, Hive or Oozie activity. In     addition, from this tab you can view the details of the Pig, Hive or Oozie activity as a whole,     and compare it to similar activities.Task AttemptsThe Tasks tab contains a list of the Map and Reduce task attempts     that make up a job.Viewing Activity Details in a Report FormatThe Details tab for an activity shows the job or activity     statistics in a report format.Comparing Similar ActivitiesIt can be useful to compare the performance of similar activities if, for example, you     suspect that a job is performing differently than other similar jobs that have run in the past.     The Compare tab shows you the performance of the selected job compared with the     performance of other similar jobs.Viewing the Distribution of Task AttemptsThe Task Distribution tab provides a graphical view of the     performance of the Map and Reduce tasks that make up a job.Monitoring Impala QueriesThe Impala Queries page displays information about Impala queries that are running and     have run in your cluster. You can filter the queries by time period and by specifying simple     filtering expressions.Query DetailsThe Query Details page contains the low-level details of how a     SQL query is processed through Impala. Monitoring YARN ApplicationsThe YARN Applications page displays information about the YARN jobs that are running     and have run in your cluster. You can filter the jobs by time period and by specifying simple     filtering expressions.Monitoring Spark ApplicationsTo obtain information about Spark application behavior you can consult cluster manager     logs and the Spark web application UI. These two methods provide complementary information.
