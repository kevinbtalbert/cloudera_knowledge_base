Cloudera Manager's Service Monitoring feature monitors dozens of service health and
    performance metrics about the services and role instances running on your cluster.
Service Monitoring includes the following functions:
Presents health and performance data in a variety of formats, including interactive
          charts.
Monitors metrics against configurable thresholds.
Generates events related to system and service health and critical log entries and makes
          them available for searching and alerting.
Maintains a complete record of service-related actions and configuration changes.

      instances installed on your cluster:
