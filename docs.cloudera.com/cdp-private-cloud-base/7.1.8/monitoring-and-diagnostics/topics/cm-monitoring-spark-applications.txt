Monitoring Spark Applications
To obtain information about Spark application behavior you can consult cluster manager
    logs and the Spark web application UI. These two methods provide complementary information. 
 Logs
      enable you to see fine grained events in the lifecycle of an application. The web UI provides
      both a broad overview of the various aspects of Spark application behavior and fine grained
      metrics. This section provides an overview of both methods. 
 For
      further information on Spark monitoring, see the Spark documentation on monitoring and
      instrumentation.
