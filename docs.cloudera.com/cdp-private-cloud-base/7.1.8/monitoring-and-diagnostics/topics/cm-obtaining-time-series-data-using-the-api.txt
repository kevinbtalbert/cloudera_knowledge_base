Obtaining Time-Series Data Using the API
You can obtain time-series data using the Cloudera Manager API. For details about
    using a tsquery statement to obtain time-series data, see the /timeseries API documentation at http:// cmServerHost:7180/static/apidocs/path__timeseries.html.
Click Charts > Chart
              Builder to access the chart, or click the chart on the
          Cloudera Manager home page and then click View Entity
        Chart.To see the API call that returns the time-series data for an existing chart, click
          the blue down-arrow at the upper-right corner of the chart and click Export
            JSON. A new web browser window opens, displaying the
          time-series data in JSON format. The query string of the URL for that window displays the
          API call that retrieved the time-series data.
