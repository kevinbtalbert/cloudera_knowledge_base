Periodic Stacks Collection
Periodic stacks collection allows you to enable and configure the periodic collection
    of thread stack traces in Cloudera Manager. 
When
      stacks collection is enabled for a role, call stacks are output to a log file at regular
      intervals. The logs can help with diagnosis of performance issues such as deadlock, slow
      processing, or excessive numbers of threads.
Stacks collection may impact performance for the processes being collected as
      well as other processes on the host, and is turned off by default. For
      troubleshooting performance issues, you may be asked by Cloudera Support
      to enable stacks collection and send the resulting logs to Cloudera for
      analysis.
Stacks collection is available for the majority of roles in Cloudera Manager.
      For the HDFS service, for example, you can enable stacks collection for
      the DataNode, NameNode, Failover Controller, HttpFS, JournalNode, and NFS
      Gateway. If the Stacks Collection category does not appear in the
      role's configuration settings, the feature is not available for that role.
