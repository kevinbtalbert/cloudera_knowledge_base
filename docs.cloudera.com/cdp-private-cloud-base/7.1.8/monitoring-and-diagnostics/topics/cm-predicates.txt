Predicates
A predicate limits the number of streams in the
    returned series.
A predicate can take one of the following forms:



time_series_attribute
operator
value, where

time_series_attribute is one
              of the supported attributes.

operator is one of = and
                rlike


value is an attribute value
              subject to the following constraints:
For attributes values that contain spaces or values of
                  attributes of the form 
xxxName such
                  as displayName, use quoted
                  strings.
The value for the rlike operator must be specified in quotes. For example: hostname rlike "host[0-3]+.*".

value can be any regular
                  expression as specified in regular expression constructs in the Java Pattern class
                  documentation.






scalar_producing_function(metric_expression) comparator
number
, where

scalar_producing_function is
              any function that takes a time series and produces a scalar. For example, min or max.

metric_expression is a valid
              metric expression. For example, total_cpu_user
                + total_cpu_system.

comparator is a comparison
              operator: <, <=, =, !=, >=, >.

number is any number
              expression or a number expression with units. For example, 5, 5mb, 5s are all valid
              number expressions. The valid units are:
Time - ms
                  (milliseconds), s (seconds),
                    m (minutes), h (hours), and d (days).
Bytes -b
                  (bytes), kb or kib (kilobytes), mb or mib (megabytes), gb or gib (gigabytes), tb or tib (terabytes), and pb or pib (petabytes)
Bytes per second - Bytes and Time: bps, kbps, kibps, mbps, mibps, and so on. For example, 5
                  kilobytes per second is 5
                  kbps.
Bytes time - Bytes and Time combined: bms, bs, bm, bh, bd, kms, ks, and so on. For example, 5 kilobytes
                  seconds is 5 ks or 5 kis.






You use the AND and OR operators to compose
        compound predicates.
Example Statements with Compound Predicates

Retrieve all time series for all metrics for DataNodes or TaskTrackers.select * where roleType=DATANODE or roleType=TASKTRACKER

Retrieve all time series for all metrics for DataNodes or TaskTrackers that are
            running on host named "myhost".select * where (roleType=DATANODE or roleType=TASKTRACKER) and hostname=myhost

Retrieve the total_cpu_user metric time series for all hosts
            with names that match the regular expression "host[0-3]+.*"select total_cpu_user where category=role and hostname rlike "host[0-3]+.*" 



Example Statements with Predicates with Scalar Producing Functions

Return the entities where the last count of Java VM garbage collections was
            greater than 10:select jvm_gc_count where last(jvm_gc_count) > 10

Return the number of open file descriptors where processes have more than 500Mb
            of mem_rss:select fd_open where min(mem_rss) > 500Mb
