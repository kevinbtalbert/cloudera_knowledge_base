Redaction of Sensitive Information from Diagnostic Bundles
By default, Cloudera Manager redacts known sensitive information from inclusion in
    diagnostic bundles. Cloudera Manager uses a set of standard rules to redact passwords and
    secrets. You can add additional redaction rules using regular expressions to specify data you
    want to be redacted from the bundles. 

To specify redaction rules for diagnostic bundles, go to Administration > Settings and search for the Redaction
            Parameters for Diagnostic Bundles parameter.The edit
          screen for the property displays.To add a new rule, click the  icon. You can add one of the
          following:
Credit Card numbers (with
              separator)

Social Security Card numbers (with
              separator)
Email addresses
Custom rule (You must
            supply values for the Search
            and Replace fields, and
            optionally, the Trigger
            field.)
To modify a new rule, click the 
          icon.Edit the redaction rules as needed. Each rule has a description field where you can
          enter free text describing the rule and you can modify the following three fields:

Search - Regular expression to compare against the data. For example, the
              regular expression \d{4}[^\w]\d{4}[^\w]\d{4}[^\w]\d{4}
              searches for a credit card number pattern. Segments of data that match the regular
              expression are redacted using the Replace string.
Replace - String used to redact (obfuscate) data, such as a pattern of Xs to
              replace digits of a credit card number:
                XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.
Trigger - Optional simple string to be searched before applying the regular
              expression. If the string is found, the redactor searches for matches using the Search
              regular expression. Using the Trigger field improves performance: simple string
              matching is faster than regular expression matching.

To delete a redaction rule, click the  icon.Click Save Changes.
