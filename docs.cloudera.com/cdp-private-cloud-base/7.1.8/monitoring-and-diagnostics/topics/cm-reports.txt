Reports

The Reports page lets you create reports about the usage of HDFS in your
      clusterâ€”data size and file count by user, group, or directory. It also
      lets you report on the MapReduce activity in your cluster, by user.
To display the Reports page, select Clusters > Cluster name > Reports.
For users with the Administrator role, the Search Files and Manage
      Directories button on the Reports page opens a file browser for
      searching files, managing directories, and setting quotas.
If you are managing multiple clusters, or have multiple nameservices
      configured (if high availability or federation is configured) there will
      be separate reports for each cluster and nameservice.
See the following pages for more details:
