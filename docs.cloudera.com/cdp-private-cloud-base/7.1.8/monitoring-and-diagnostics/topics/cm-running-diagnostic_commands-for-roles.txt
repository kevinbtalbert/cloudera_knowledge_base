Running Diagnostic Commands for Roles
You can run diagnostic utility tools such as "collect stack traces" and "heap dump"
    against most role processes.

Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
Cloudera Manager allows administrators to run the following diagnostic utility tools
        against most Java-based role processes:
List Open Files (lsof) - Lists the open files of the process.
Collect Stack Traces (jstack) - Captures Java thread stack traces for
            the process.
Heap Dump (jmap) - Captures a heap dump for the process.
Heap Histogram (jmap -histo) - Produces a histogram of the heap for
            the process.

These commands are found on the Actions menu of the Cloudera Manager page for the
        instance of the role. For example, to run diagnostics commands for the HDFS active NameNode,
        perform these steps:
Click the HDFS service on the Home > Status tab or select it on the Clusters menu.Click Instances > NameNode
        (Active).Click the Actions menu.Choose one of the diagnostics commands listed in the lower section of the menu.Click the button in the confirmation dialog box to confirm your
        choice.When the command is executed, click Download Result Data and save the
        file to view the command output.
