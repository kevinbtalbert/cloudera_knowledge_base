Running the Host Inspector
You can run the host inspector to inspect all hosts and display a list of validations
    and their results.
Click Hosts > All
            Hosts.Click the Inspect All Hosts button. Cloudera Manager begins
          several tasks to inspect the managed hosts.After the inspection completes, click Download Result Data
          or Show Inspector Results to review the
          results.The results of the inspection displays a list of all the validations and their results,
          and a summary of all the components installed on your managed hosts. If the validation
            process finds problems, the Validations section will indicate the
            problem. In some cases the message may indicate actions you can take to resolve the
            problem. If an issue exists on multiple hosts, you may be able to view the list of
            occurrences by clicking a small triangle that appears at the end of the
            message.The Version Summary section shows all the components
            that are available from Cloudera, their versions (if known) and the Cloudera Runtime
            distribution to which they belong.
