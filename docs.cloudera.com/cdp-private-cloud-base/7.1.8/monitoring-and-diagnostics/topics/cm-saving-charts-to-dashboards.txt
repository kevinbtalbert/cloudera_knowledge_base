Saving Charts to Dashboards
You can save the charts and their configurations (type, dimension, and y-axis minimum
    and maximum) to a new dashboard or to an existing dashboard.
Minimum Required Role:
Configurator (also provided by
          Cluster Administrator,
Limited Cluster Administrator , and
          Full Administrator)
If your tsquery statement resulted in multiple charts, those charts are saved as
        a unit (either to a new or existing dashboard). You cannot edit the
        individual plots in that set of charts, but you can edit the set as a
        whole. A single edit button appears for the set that you saved â€”
        typically on the last chart in the set.
You can edit a copy of the individual charts in the set, but the edited copy
        does not change the original chart in the dashboard from which it was
        copied.
