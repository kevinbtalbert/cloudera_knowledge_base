Searching Within the File System
When you search within the file system, you can select from custom search criteria
    such as filename, owner, file size, and more.
To search
      the file system, click Custom report in the Reports section. The file and directory listings are taken
      from the fsimage stored on the NameNode, so
      the listings will be only as current as the last checkpoint. Typically the checkpoint interval
      is (by default) once per hour, but if checkpoints are not being performed as frequently, the
      listings may not be up to date.

To search the file system:


From the HDFS service page, select the File Browser tab.
Click Choose and do one of the following:
Select a predefined query. Depending on what you select, you may be presented
              with different fields to fill in or different views of the file
              system. For example, selecting Size will provide a choice
              of arithmetic operators and fields where you provide the size to
              be used as the search criteria.
Select a property in the Choose... drop-down.
Select an operator.
Specify a value.
Click  to add another criteria (all of which must be satisfied for a file to be
                  considered a match) and repeat the preceding steps.




Click the Generate Report button to generate a custom
          report containing the search results.

If you search within a directory, only files within that directory will be
        found. For example, if you browse /user and do a
        search, you might find /user/foo/file, but you will not
        find /bar/baz.
