Service Summary
Some services (specifically HDFS, MapReduce, HBase, Flume, and ZooKeeper) provide
    additional statistics about their operation and performance. These are shown in a Summary panel
    at the left side of the page.
The
      contents of this panel depend on the service:
The HDFS Summary shows disk space usage.
The MapReduce Summary shows statistics on slot usage, jobs and so
          on.
The Flume Summary provides a link to a page of Flume metric
          details.
The ZooKeeper Summary provides links to the ZooKeeper role instances
          (nodes) as well as Zxid information if you have a ZooKeeper Quorum (multiple ZooKeeper
          servers).


For example:



Other services such as Hue, Oozie, Impala, and Cloudera Manager itself, do not
        provide a Service Summary.
