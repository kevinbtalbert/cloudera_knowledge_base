Suppressing Health Test Results
Cloudera Manager displays warnings when health tests indicate a problem in the
    cluster. Sometimes these warnings are expected or do not indicate a real problem in your
    deployment. You can suppress display of these warnings in Cloudera Manager. 
Minimum Required Role:
Configurator (also provided by
          Cluster Administrator,
Limited Cluster Administrator , and
          Full Administrator)
You can suppress health test warnings as they appear or before any
        tests run. Suppressed health tests are hidden in Cloudera Manager and
        their status does not affect the roll-up of health tests that display
        for a service, host, or role instance. Suppressed health test warnings
        remain available in Cloudera Manager, and the tests continue to run but
        the results are hidden. You can unsuppress a suppressed health test at
        any time.
On pages where you have suppressed validations, you will see a link that
      says Show # Suppressed Test. On this
      screen, you can: 
Click the Show
              # Suppressed Test
          link to view all suppressed health tests for the page.
Click the Unsuppress... link to unsuppress the health test. 
Click Hide Suppressed
            Tests to re-hide the suppressed tests. 


note
Suppressing a health test is different than disabling
        a health test. A disabled health test never runs, whereas a suppressed
        health test runs but its results are hidden.
