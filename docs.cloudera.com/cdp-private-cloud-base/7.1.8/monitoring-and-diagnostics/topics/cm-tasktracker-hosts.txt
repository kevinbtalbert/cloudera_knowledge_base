TaskTracker Hosts
To the right of the chart is a table that shows the TaskTracker hosts that processed
    the tasks in the selected cell, along with the number of task attempts each host
    executed.
You can select a cell in the table to view the TaskTracker hosts that correspond
        to the tasks in the cell.

The area above the TaskTracker table shows the type of task and range of data
          volume (or User CPUs) and duration times for the task attempts that
          fall within the cell.
The table itself shows the TaskTracker hosts that executed the tasks that are
          represented within the cell, and the number of task attempts run on
          that host.

Clicking
      a TaskTracker hostname takes you to the Role Status page for that
      TaskTracker instance.
