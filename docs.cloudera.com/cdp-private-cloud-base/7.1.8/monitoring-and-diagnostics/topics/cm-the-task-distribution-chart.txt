The Task Distribution Chart
The Task Distribution chart shows the distribution of attempts according to their
    duration on the X-axis and a number of different metrics on the Y-axis. 
Each cell
      of the chart represents the number of tasks whose performance statistics fall within the
      parameters of the cell. The Task Distribution chart is useful for detecting tasks that are
      outliers in your job, either because of skew, or because of faulty TaskTrackers. The chart can
      clearly show if some tasks deviate significantly from the majority of task attempts.
Normally, the distribution of tasks will be fairly concentrated. If, for
        example, some Reducers receive much more data than others, that will be
        represented by having two discrete sections of density on the graph.
        That suggests that there may be a problem with the user code, or that
        there's skew in the underlying data. Alternately, if the input sizes of
        various Map or Reduce tasks are the same, but the time it takes to
        process them varies widely, it might mean that certain TaskTrackers are
        performing more poorly than others.
You can click in a cell and see a list of the TaskTrackers that correspond to
        the tasks whose performance falls within the cell.
The X-axis show the task duration is seconds. From the drop-down you can chose
        different metrics for the Y-axis: Input or Output records or bytes for
        Map tasks, or the number of CPU seconds for the user who ran the job:

Map Input Records vs. Duration
Map Output Records vs. Duration
Map Input Bytes vs. Duration
Map Output Bytes vs. Duration
Map Total User CPU seconds vs. Duration
Reduce Input Records vs. Duration
Reduce Output Records vs. Duration
Reduce Total User CPU seconds vs. Duration
