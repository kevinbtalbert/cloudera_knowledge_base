Time Series AttributesCloudera Docs
Time Series Attributes
You can use time series attributes when you build a predicate.

Attribute names and most attribute values are case insensitive. displayName and serviceType are two attributes whose values are
          case sensitive.



Name
Description




active

Indicates whether the entities to be retrieved must be
              active. A nonactive entity is an entity that has been removed or deleted from the
              cluster. The default is to retrieve only active entities (that is, active=true). To access time series for
              deleted or removed entities, specify active=false in the query. For
              example:SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType=DATANODE and active=false




agentName

A Flume agent name.



applicationName

One of the Cloudera Manager monitoring daemon
              names.



cacheId

The HDFS cache directive ID.



category

The category of the entities returned by the query:
                CLUSTER, DIRECTORY, DISK, FILESYSTEM, FLUME_SOURCE, FLUME_CHANNEL, FLUME_SINK, HOST, HTABLE, IMPALA_QUERY_STREAM, NETWORK_INTERFACE, ROLE, SERVICE, USER, YARN_APPLICATION_STREAM, YARN_QUEUE.Some
                metrics are collected for more than one type of entity. For example, total_cpu_user is collected for entities
                of category HOST and ROLE. To retrieve the data only for hosts
                use:select total_cpu_user where category=HOST

The ROLE
                category applies to all role types (see roleType attribute). The SERVICE category applies to all service types (see serviceType attribute). For example, to
                retrieve the committed heap for all roles on host1 use:
select jvm_committed_heap_mb where category=ROLE and hostname="host1"
