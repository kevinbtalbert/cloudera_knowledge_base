Creating a Trigger for CPU Capacity
In Cloudera Manager, go to the Hosts page.Click a link in the Name column to open a host
        status page.In the Health Tests section, click
          Create Trigger. On the New Trigger page, enter the name
          CPU Capacity.In Expression, set these metric
          conditions.

Scalar Function:
                Min.
Metric:
                cpu_percent.
Comparator: >
              (greater than).
Scalar Value:
              90.

Set Action to Mark as
          concerning.Click Create Trigger.

This trigger fires whenever the CPU percentage exceeds 90%. However,
        just exceeding 90% of available CPU resources is not necessarily a bad
        thing. What would be of more concern is if CPU resources were to
        consistently exceed 90% over an extended period. You can modify the
        trigger to evaluate the average CPU usage over time.
To modify the trigger to capture high CPU usage in a five minute
        window, do the following.


In Cloudera Manager, go to the Hosts
            page.
Click a link in the Name column to open the
            host status page.
In the Health Tests section, click the
              Show n Good link.
Click the link for CPU Capacity.
Choose Actions > Edit Trigger.The metric expression function for average over time, moving_avg, is not available from the pop-up menu in the editor. You can edit the expression directly using tsquery language.
Above the Expression editor, click
              Edit manually.
Revise the expression as follows.IF (select cpu_percent where entityName=$HOSTID and min(moving_avg(cpu_percent, 300) ) > 90)
      DO health:concerning




Click Save Trigger.
