Creating a Trigger for Memory Capacity 

A common use case is to monitor memory usage, and trigger a warning
      if your system is approaching its upper limit.To create a memory usage trigger:In Cloudera Manager, go to the Hosts page.Click a link in the Name column to open a host
        status page.In the Health Tests section, click
          Create Trigger. On the New Trigger page, enter the name
          Resident Memory In Use.In Expression, set these metric
          conditions:

Scalar Function:
                Min.
Metric:
              mem_rss.
Comparator: >
              (greater than).
Scalar Value:
                1.75GB. (This is a low value for
              demonstration purposes, so that it will trigger the action. In
              practice, use a value that more accurately reflects the memory
              limits of your cluster.)

Set Action to Mark as
            bad.As you work, the Preview shows the resulting chart
          and current status of your host.
