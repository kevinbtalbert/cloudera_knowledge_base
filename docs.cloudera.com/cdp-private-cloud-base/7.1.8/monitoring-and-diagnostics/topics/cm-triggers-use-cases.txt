Cloudera Manager Trigger Use Cases

Cloudera Manager allows you to monitor cluster performance. Some
      indicators require timely attention to keep your data safe. Triggers let
      you track occurrence and severity of issues so that you can fix problems
      before they result in system failures.
The conditions you create for your trigger can
      be quite complex, but they do not need to be in order to be useful. This
      topic describes two triggers that alert you when you are approaching
      capacity limits for your cluster.
