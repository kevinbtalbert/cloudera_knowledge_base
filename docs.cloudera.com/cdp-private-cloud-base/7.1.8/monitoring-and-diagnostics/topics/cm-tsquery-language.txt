tsquery Language
The tsquery language is used to specify statements for retrieving time-series data from
    the Cloudera Manager time-series datastore.
Below are some common queries using the tsquery language:
Retrieve time series for all metrics for all
          DataNodes:select * where roleType=DATANODE
Retrieve cpu_user_rate metric time series for all
          DataNodes:select cpu_user_rate where roleType=DATANODE
Retrieve the jvm_heap_used_mb metric time series divided by 1024 and
          the jvm_heap_committed metric time series divided by 1024 for all roles
          running on the host named "my
          host":select jvm_heap_used_mb/1024, jvm_heap_committed_mb/1024 where category=ROLE and hostname="my host"
Retrieve the jvm_total_threads and jvm_blocked_threads
          metric time series for all entities for which Cloudera Manager collects these two
          metrics:select jvm_total_threads,jvm_blocked_threads

tsquery SyntaxA tsquery statement has a specific structure.Metric ExpressionsA metric expression generates the time series. It     is a comma-delimited list of one or more metric expression statements.Metric Expression FunctionsMetric expressions support the functions listed in the following table. A function can     return a time series or a scalar computed from a time series. Functions that return scalars must     be used for heatmap charts.PredicatesA predicate limits the number of streams in the     returned series.Filtering by Day of Week or Hour of DayYou can add an expression to the predicate of a tsquery statement that limits the stream     to specified days of the week or to a range of hours in each day. Time Series AttributesYou can use time series attributes when you build a predicate.Time Series Entities and their AttributesThe following table shows the entities and associated attributes that can appear in the     predicate ("where" clause) of a tsquery statement.FAQThe following topic covers frequently asked questions about charting time-series     data.Parent topic: Charting Time-Series Data
