tsquery Syntax
A tsquery statement has a specific structure.
SELECT [metric expression]FROM
            collection
WHERE [predicate]
Note the following properties of tsquery statements:
The statement select * is invalid.
Tokens are case insensitive. For example, Select,
            select, and SeLeCt are all equivalent to
            SELECT.
Multiple statements can be concatenated with semi-colons. Thus example 3 in the
            tsquery Language topic can be written
          as:select jvm_heap_used_mb/1024 where category=ROLE and hostname=myhost; select jvm_heap_commited_mb/1024 where category=ROLE and hostname=myhost
The metric expression can be replaced with an asterisk (*), as shown in
          example 1 of the tsquery Language topic. In that case, all metrics that are
          applicable for selected entities, such as DATANODE in example 1, are
          returned.
The collection can be omitted.
The predicate can be omitted, as shown in example 4 of the tsquery Language
          topic. In such cases, time series for all entities for which the metrics are appropriate
          are returned. For this query you would see the jvm_new_threads metric for
          NameNodes, DataNodes, TaskTrackers, and so on.
