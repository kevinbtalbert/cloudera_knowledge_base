You can view summary information about all the hosts managed by Cloudera Manager on
    the All Hosts page.

To display summary information about all the hosts managed by Cloudera Manager, click

The list of hosts shows the overall status of the Cloudera Manager-managed hosts in
          your cluster. 
Optionally, to change the columns, click the Columns:
              n Selected drop-down and select the checkboxes next to
          the columns to display.The information provided varies depending on which
          columns are selected.Optionally, click  to the left of the number of roles to list all the role
          instances running on that host. Optionally, filter the hosts list by entering search terms (hostname, IP address,
          or role) in the search box separated by commas or spaces. Use quotes for exact matches
          (for example, strings that contain spaces, such as a role name) and brackets to search for
          ranges. Hosts that match any of the search terms are displayed. For example: 
hostname[1-3], hostname8 hostname9, "hostname.example.com"
hostname.example.com “HDFS DataNode”
You can also search for hosts by selecting a value from the facets in the
            Filters section at the left of the page.

                      y
Set health status to Bad if the Agent heartbeats fail
                    z
The value v for a host's Last Heartbeat facet is computed as
                  follows:
v < x * y = Good
v >= x * y and <= x *
                      z = Concerning
