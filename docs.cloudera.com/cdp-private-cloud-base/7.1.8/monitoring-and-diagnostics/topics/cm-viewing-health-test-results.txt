Viewing Health Test Results
You can view health test results in multiple locations.
Health test results are available in the following locations:

Home > Status tab where various health results determine an overall health
            assessment of the service or role. The overall health of a role or
            service is a roll-up of its health tests; if any health test is
            Bad, the service's or role's health will be Bad. If
            any health test is Concerning (but none are Bad) the
            role's or service's health will be Concerning.

Hosts tab, which shows summary result for the hosts.

Status tab - which shows metrics for services, role instances, and hosts.
            These are reflected in the results shown in the Health Tests
            panel when you have selected a service, role instance, or host.
The All Health Issues tab of the
              Home page displays all health issues. You
            can sort the display by entity or by Health Test.


For some
      health test results, you can chart the associated metrics over a time range. See the related
      information for details.
