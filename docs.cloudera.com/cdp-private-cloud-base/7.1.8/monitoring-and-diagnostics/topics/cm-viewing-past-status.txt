Viewing Past Status
You can expand the Time Range Selector to view historical
    health, status, and chart data. 
The
      health and status information on the Status page represents the state of
      the service or role instance at a given point in time. The
      charts (and the Logs and Events under Diagnostics) represent the time range selected on the
        Time Range Selector, which defaults to the past 30 minutes. You can
      view health, status, and chart historical data by expanding the Time Range
        Selector. Click the mini line chart under "admin" and move the time marker
        () to a point in the past.
When you
      move the time marker to a point in the past (for services and roles that support health
      history), the entire Status page updates to the time selected. A
        Now button () allows you to quickly
      return to the current state of the service. The Actions menu is
      disabled while viewing a past status to ensure that you cannot accidentally act on outdated
      status information.
