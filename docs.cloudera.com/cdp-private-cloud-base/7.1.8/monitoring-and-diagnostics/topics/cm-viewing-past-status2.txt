Viewing Past Status
You can expand the Time Range Selector to view historical health, status, and chart
    data. 
The
      status and health information shown on this page represents the state of the service or role
      instance at a given point in time. The exceptions are the charts tabs, which show information
      for the time range currently selected on the Time Range Selector, which defaults to the past
      30 minutes. By default, the information shown on this page is for the current time. You can
      view status for a past point in time by moving the time marker () to
      a point in the past.
When you
      move the time marker to a point in the past (for Services/Roles that support health history),
      the Health Status clearly indicates that it is referring to a past time. A
        Now button () enables you to quickly
      switch to view the current state of the service. In addition, the
        Actions menu is disabled while you are viewing status in the past â€“
      to ensure that you cannot accidentally take an action based on outdated status information. 
You can
      also view past status by clicking the Show link in the Health Tests and Health History
      panel.
