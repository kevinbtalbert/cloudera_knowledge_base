Viewing Running and Recent Commands for a Service or Role
You can view running and recent commands for a service or role instance in the
      Commands tab.
For a selected service or role instance, the
        Commands tab shows which commands are running or have been run for that
      instance, and what the status, progress, and results are. For example, if you go to the HDFS
      service shortly after you have installed your cluster and look at the
        Commands tab, you will see recent commands that created the
      directories, started the HDFS role instances (the NameNode, Secondary NameNode, and DataNode
      instances), and the command that initially formatted HDFS on the NameNode. This information is
      useful if a service or role seems to be taking a long time to start up or shut down, or if
      services or roles are not running or do not appear to have been started correctly. You can
      view both the status and progress of currently running commands, as well as the status and
      results of commands run in the past.Click the Clusters tab on the top navigation
        bar.Click the service name to go to the Status tab for that service.For a role instance, click the Instances tab
          and select the role instance name to go to its Status
        tab.Click the Commands tab.
