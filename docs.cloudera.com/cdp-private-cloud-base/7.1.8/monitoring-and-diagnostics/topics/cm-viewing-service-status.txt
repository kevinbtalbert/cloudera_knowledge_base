For all service types there is a Status Summary that shows, for each configured
          role, the overall status and health of the role instance(s).noteNot all service types
            provide complete monitoring and health information. Hive, Hue, Oozie, Solr, and YARN
            only provide the basic Status Summary.Each service that supports monitoring
            provides a set of monitoring properties where you can enable or disable health tests and
            events, and set thresholds for tests and modify thresholds for the status of certain
            health tests. The HDFS, MapReduce, HBase, ZooKeeper, and Flume services also
            provide additional information: a snapshot of service-specific metrics, health test
            results, health history, and a set of charts that provide a historical view of metrics
            of interest.
