Viewing the Disks Overview

    displayed match or build on those in iostat, and are shown in a series of
    histograms that by default cover every physical disk in the system.

Optionally, adjust the endpoints of the time line to see the statistics for
          different time periods. Optionally, specify a filter in the box to limit the displayed data. For example,
          to see the disks for a single rack rack1, set the filter to: logicalPartition =
            false and rackId = "rack1" and click
        Filter.Optionally, click a histogram to drill down and identify outliers. Mouse over the
          graph and click  to
          display additional information about the chart.
