Viewing the Health and Status of a Role Instance
You can view the health and status of a role instance by clicking the role instance
    under the Role Counts column.
If there
      is just one instance of this role, this opens the Status tab for the role
      instance.
If there
      are multiple instances of a role, clicking the role link under Role
        Counts will open the Instances tab for the service, showing
      instances of the role type you have selected.
If you are viewing a point in time in the past, the Role Count links will be
        greyed out, but still functional. Their behavior will depend on whether
        historical data is available for the role instance.
