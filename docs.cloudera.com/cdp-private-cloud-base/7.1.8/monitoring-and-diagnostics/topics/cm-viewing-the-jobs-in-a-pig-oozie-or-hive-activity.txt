The Details tab shows Activity details in a report form. 
The Compare tab compares this activity to other similar activity. The main
              difference between this and a comparison for a single MapReduce activity is that the
              comparison is done looking at other activities of the same type (Pig, Hive or Oozie)
              but does include the child jobs of the activity. See the topic Comparing Similar
                Activities for an explanation of that tab.
