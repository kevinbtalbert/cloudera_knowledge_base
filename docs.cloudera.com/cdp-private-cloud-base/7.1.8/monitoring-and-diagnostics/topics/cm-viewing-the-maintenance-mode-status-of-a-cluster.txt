For any cluster, you can view the components (service, roles, or hosts) that are in
    maintenance mode.

Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.

From the Cloudera Manager Home page, select the cluster that you want to view the
          maintenance mode status for.Click Actions > View Maintenance Mode Status.... This pops up a dialog box that shows the components in your cluster that are in
          maintenance mode, and indicates which are in effective maintenance mode as well as those
          that have been explicitly placed into maintenance mode.From this dialog box you can
            select any of the components shown there and remove them from maintenance mode.If
            individual services are in maintenance mode, you will see the maintenance mode icon
               next to the Actions button for that
            service.noteThe Actions button is not enabled if you are viewing status for a
            point of time in the past.
