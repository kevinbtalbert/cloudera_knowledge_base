Viewing the URLs of the Client Configuration Files
To allow Hadoop client users to work with the services you created, Cloudera Manager
    generates client configuration files that contain the relevant configuration files with the
    settings from your services. 
These files are deployed automatically by
      Cloudera Manager based on the services you have installed, when you add a
      service, or when you add a Gateway role on a host. You can manually
      download and distribute these client configuration files to the users of a
      service, if necessary.
Go to the Status page for a cluster.
              (Clusters > cluster
                name).Click
