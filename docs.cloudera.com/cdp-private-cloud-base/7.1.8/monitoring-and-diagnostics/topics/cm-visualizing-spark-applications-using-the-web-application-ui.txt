Visualizing Spark Applications Using the Web Application UI
Every Spark application launches a web application UI that displays useful information
    about the application.
 The web
      application UI includes the following information: 


          An event timeline that displays the relative ordering and interleaving of application
          events. The timeline view is available on three levels: across all jobs, within one
          job, and within one stage. The timeline also shows executor allocation and
          deallocation.
        

          A list of stages and tasks.
        

          The execution directed acyclic graph (DAG) for each job.
        

          A summary of RDD sizes and memory usage.
        

          Environment - runtime information, property settings, library paths.
        

          Information about Spark SQL jobs.
        


        The web UI is available in different ways depending on whether the application is
        running or has completed.
