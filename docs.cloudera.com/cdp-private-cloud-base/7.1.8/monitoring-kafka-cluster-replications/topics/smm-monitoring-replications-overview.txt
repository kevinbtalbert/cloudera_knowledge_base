Introduction to monitoring Kafka cluster replications in SMM
You can use Streams Replication Manager (SRM) to implement cross-cluster Kafka topic
  replication in Streams Messaging Manager (SMM). You need to configure SRM properties in SMM. After
  you configure SRM in SMM, you can use SMM to monitor all of the Kafka cluster replications
  targeting the configured cluster.
SRM is an enterprise-grade replication solution that enables fault tolerant, scalable
   and robust cross-cluster Kafka topic replication. SRM provides the ability to dynamically change
   configurations and keeps the topic properties in sync across clusters at high performance. SRM
   also delivers custom extensions that facilitate installation, management and monitoring making
   SRM a complete replication solution that is built for mission critical workloads. For more
   information about SRM, see the Streams Replication Manager for HDF and HDP document
   library.
You can view all replication details in SMM. You can monitor status of the Kafka cluster
   replications, number of topics associated with the replication, throughput, replication latency,
   and checkpoint latency of Kafka cluster replications in SMM.
noteYou can also create alerts to receive notifications based on the conditions that you
   configure in the alert policy for monitoring Kafka cluster replications in your system. For more
   information about creating alerts to monitor Kafka cluster replications, see the Managing
    Alert Policies guide.
