Monitoring status of the clusters to be replicated
You can monitor the status of Kafka cluster replications in the Status column in the
  Cluster Replications page. You can see whether a cluster replication is active, inactive, or
  showing a warning.
The status has three variations:
ActiveIndicates that the cluster replication is running.
InactiveIndicates that the cluster replication is not running.
WarningIndicates that the cluster replication is facing issues.

If the status of a Kafka cluster replication shows inactive or warning, check the
   logs, and troubleshoot the replication.
