Searching Kafka cluster replications by source
Learn how to filter your Kafka cluster replications by source cluster after you
        select the Kafka cluster which acts as the target cluster.

You can use the Search By Source bar at the top right of the page to search cluster
                replications by the source cluster name. For example, if the destination cluster is
                amsterdam, and you enter scottsdale in the Search By Source bar, SMM displays the
                Kafka cluster replication between scottsdale and amsterdam, as shown in the
                following image:
