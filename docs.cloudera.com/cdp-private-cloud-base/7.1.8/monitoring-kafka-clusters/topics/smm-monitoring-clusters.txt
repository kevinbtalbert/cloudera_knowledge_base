Monitoring Kafka clustersCloudera Docs
Monitoring Kafka clusters
The overview page provides you with tools to see a snapshot of the Kafka cluster you are
  monitoring. After you select the Kafka cluster to monitor, you can see the total number of
  producers, brokers, topics, and consumer groups in that cluster. You can also monitor producer and
  consumer metrics.
Configure Apache Kafka for SMM
After you have installed and configured Apache Kafka, you must set one configuration parameter
    to enable Kafka and SMM to communicate.
Select Kafka from your cluster drop-down, and then select the
       Configuration tab.
Ensure that the Enable Producer Metrics check box is selected.


Viewing cluster overview information
You can use the Overview tab to review information about your Kafka
    cluster. This page gives you information about total number of producers, brokers, topics, and
    consumer groups. It also provides more detailed metrics about producers and consumers.
Review the Producers, Brokers, Topics, and Consumer Groups information at the top of your page
    to understand how many of each are contained in your Kafka cluster. 



You can click the drop-down arrow in any of the boxes to view a list of Kafka resource. Select
    one or more Kafka resource to filter your view to just those resource. You can also search for a
    specific resource. You can click clear at any time to return to the full overview. 



You can select the time period you want to view the metrics for, on the top-right corner of
    the page. If Cloudera Manager is configured as a metrics backend, the metrics (for example,
    topic > partition > producermetrics) which are used for time periods larger than 6 hours are
    calculated asynchronously, and take time to refresh.
