Monitoring Kafka producers
By monitoring Kafka producers, you can track the active and inactive producers in your
  cluster. You can also change the period of time after which a producer is considered
  inactive.
Understanding producer naming conventions
The producers you interact with in Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) are named based on the
     client.id property you added when creating Kafka producers. 

Active vs. passive producers
On the Overview page, producers are referred to as active or passive.
    Producers are active when they are producing messages over a designated time period. 
On the Producers page, passive producers are referred to as inactive. 
You can set the period of time after which a producer is considered inactive in the Streams
    Messaging Manager Configs screen.


Select Streams Messaging Manager from the services pane.
Click Configs and select Advanced
       streams-messaging-manager-common from the Advanced
      tab.
Update inactive.producer.timeout.ms to change the period of time
      after which a producer is considered inactive. This value is specified in milliseconds. 






Identifying a producer state
There are two ways to identify whether a producer is active or passive. 
From the Producer pane in the Overview page, use
    the Active, Passive, and
     All tabs to view only active producers, only passive producers, or all
    of them. This allows you to see the total number of active and passive producers.



From the Producers page, each producer is listed with the status
    visible.
