Validating connector configuration
Learn how to validate your connector configuration.

Perform the following steps to validate the configurations of a connector:


Click the New Connector option in the upper right corner
                    of the Connect Cluster page.
The Select A Template screen appears. 

Go to Source Templates or Sink
                    Templates tab based on your requirement.

Select a connector.
The Connector Form appears.



Configure your connector properties or import them in JSON format.

Click Validate.
Error messages might appear below the properties where the validator found
                    errors. If the error message is bigger than usual, then only part of the message
                    appears in the UI, and you need to click the see more button to get the full
                    view.
If you delete a mandatory property for a connector and validate the
                    configuration, the error message with the missing property name (Key) appears on
                    top of all properties.

Resolve the errors until validation passes, and then click
                        Next.
