Add secure Accumulo on CDP service to your cluster
To ensure data availability to diverse sets of users with varying levels of
        permissions and security clearance, add a secure Accumulo on CDP service.

If your secure Accumulo on CDP service needs to be FIPS compliant, ensure that you
                have followed the FIPS specific deployment setup steps provided in Installing and Configuring CDP with
                    FIPS.




Install OpDB CSD file.
Install CDP.
Add the HDFS and ZooKeeper services to your CDP deployment.
Install the OpDB parcel.
Ensure that you have a SASL enabled Kerberized cluster.




Navigate to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console home
                    page.

Select the action menu of the cluster to which you want to add the Accumulo on
                    CDP service (for example, Cluster 1), and select Add
                        Service.






Select Accumulo on CDP and click
                        Continue.

Select the dependent services and click Continue.

Assign the Accumulo roles to the hosts in your cluster:


Assign a Table Server role on each host to which
                            the DataNode role is assigned.
Assign the Monitor, Garbage
                                Collector, Tracer, and
                                Master role to
                                non-DataNodes.
Assign the Gateway role to any hosts here you
                            want to use the OpDB service and that do not already have other OpDB
                            roles assigned.



Click Continue.

Configure the Accumulo Instance Secret.

importantCloudera recommends to protect this  information, because
                        the security of the Accumulo service relies on it.


Set the Accumulo Instance Name.

Select Enable Kerberos Authentication.

noteThis setting overwrites the trace user with the default
                        Accumulo Kerberos principal.


If this is the first installation of OpDB, ensute that the Initial
                        Accumulo option is selected.

Click Continue.

Wait while Cloudera Manager does the initial service setup.

Click Continue.

Click Finish.

Restart all role except Tracers.

Create a client configuration file for the admin user.

This step needs to be performed on each Gateway machine where you will run an
                        OpDB client.
Client configuration can be created by editing the configuration file in the
                        following
                        way:auth.principal=accumulo/[***HOSTNAME***]
auth.type=kerberos
auth.token=/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/[***TIMESTAMP***]-[***SERVICE NAME***]-[***INSTANCE NAME***]/accumulo_on_cdp.keytab
sasl.enabled=true
sasl.qop=auth-conf

By default the Accumulo principal on which master is running becomes the
                        administrator principal. You can set up a different administrative user. For
                        more information, see the Administrative User section of the
                                user manual. In this case you need to change the
                            auth.principal and auth.token
                        configuration properties accordingly.


Ensure that the trace table exists.
