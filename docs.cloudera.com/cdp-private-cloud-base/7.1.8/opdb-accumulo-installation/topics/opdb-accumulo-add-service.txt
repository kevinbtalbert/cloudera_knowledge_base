Add  Accumulo on CDP service
After you have installed the Operational Database powered by Apache Accumulo (OpDB) CSD,
  the required CDP cluster and services, and the OpDB parcel, you can add the Accumulo on CDP
  service to your cluster.
You can add a secure or an unsecure Accumulo on CDP service to your CDP Private Cloud Base
   deployment when installing OpDB. A secure Accumulo on CDP service requires a secure cluster,
   which means an SASL-enabled Kerberized cluster.

   unsecure Accumulo on CDP service. If you require a FIPS compliant OpDB service, follow the steps
