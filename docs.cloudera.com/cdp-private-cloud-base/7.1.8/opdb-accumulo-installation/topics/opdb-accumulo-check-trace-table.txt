Check trace table
After you have added the Accumulo on CDP service as a part of the Operational
        Database powered by Apache Accumulo (OpDB) installation, you have to check if the trace
        table, that records the time span of operations, exists.

OpDB records the time that various operations take when tracing is turned on. It
                follows all the requests made on behalf of the user throughout the distributed
                infrastructure of Accumulo, and across all threads of execution.
These timespans are inserted into the trace table in OpDB. You can
                browse recent traces from the Accumulo monitor page. You can also read the
                    trace table directly like any other table.




Install the OpDB CSD file.
Install CDP and add the HDFS and ZooKeeper services to your deployment.
Install the OpDB parcel.
