Creating trace user in unsecure Operational Database powered by Apache Accumulo
        deployment
After you  add an unsecure Accumulo on CDP service, you have to ensure that the trace
        user exists. This step is only required if you have an unsecure Operational Database powered
        by Apache Accumulo (OpDB) deployment. 

This step is not required if you have a secure OpDB deployment, because in that case
                the trace user is automatically created when the Accumulo on CDP service is added to
                the cluster.



Install the OpDB CSD file.
Install CDP and add the HDFS and ZooKeeper services to your deployment.
Install the OpDB parcel.
Add an unsecure Accumulo on CDP to your deployment.
Ensure that you have added an unsecure OpDB service to your cluster. 


Launch the Accumulo shell for the admin user.

$ accumulo shell -u root
Password: ******
Shell - Apache Accumulo Interactive Shell
-
- version: [***ACCUMULO VERSION NUMBER***]
- instance name: [***ACCUMULO INSTANCE NAME***]
- instance id: [***ACCUMULO INSTANCE ID***]
-
- type 'help' for a list of available commands
-
root@accumulo>



List the existing users and check if trace user exists:
                        users
If the trace user exists, you can continue your OpDB
                    installation.

If the trace user does not exist, create it with the following
                    command: createuser trace

Ensure that the trace table exists.
