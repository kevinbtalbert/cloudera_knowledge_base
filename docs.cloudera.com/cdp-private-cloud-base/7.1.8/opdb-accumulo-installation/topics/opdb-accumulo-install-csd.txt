Install Operational Database powered by Apache Accumulo CSD file
As Operational Database powered by Apache Accumulo (OpDB) is an add-on service, you
        have to install its Custom Services Descriptor (CSD) file to mananage the Accumulo on CDP
        service.

A Custom Services Descriptor (CSD) file contains all the configuration needed to
                describe and manage a new service. A CSD is provided in the form of a JAR file. For
                more information about CSD files, see the Custom Service Descriptor
                    Files section in the Add-on Services documentation.

Install Cloudera Manager.

Download the ACCUMULO_CDP-1.0.0 jar file for the CSD that
                    provides the Accumulo on CDP service. 
You can download that JAR file from:
                    archive.cloudera.com/p/accumulo7/1.0.0/csd

Copy the ACCUMULO_CDP-1.0.0.jar file to the location where
                    Cloudera Manager is configured to look for the CSD files. That is by default in
                    the /opt/cloudera/csd folder on the host where Cloudera Manager
                    is running.

Restart Cloudera Manager as described in the Configuring the Location of
                        Customer Service section in the Add-on Services
                    documentation.

Install CDP cluster and services.
