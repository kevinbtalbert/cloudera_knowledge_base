Change root user password
The Accumulo shell allows you to change the root userâ€™s password after installation.
        Changing the password is recommended if a custom password was not set for the root user
        during installation because using the default password can lead to security
        issues.


noteThis task does not apply to secure clusters because user root
                    is not created in that case.

You can run the Accumulo shell on server hosts and hosts that have the Gateway role
                in your cluster.
By default, in an unsecure Accumulo on CDP service, the user root is
                created and assigned the password secret. If you did not set a
                different password during installation, Cloudera recommends that you change the root
                user password.


Have an unsecure Accumulo on CDP service added to your cluster.


Launch the Accumulo shell for the default root user.

$ accumulo shell -u root
Password: ******
Shell - Apache Accumulo Interactive Shell

- instance name: [***ACCUMULO INSTANCE NAME***]
- instance id: [***ACCUMULO INSTANCE ID***]

root@accumulo>



Use the passwd command to set a new password for the root
                    user.

root@accumulo> passwd
Enter current password for 'root': ******
Enter new password for 'root': *********
Please confirm new password for 'root': *********
root@accumulo>



Relaunch the shell with this new password.

root@accumulo> exit
$ accumulo shell -u root
Password: ******
