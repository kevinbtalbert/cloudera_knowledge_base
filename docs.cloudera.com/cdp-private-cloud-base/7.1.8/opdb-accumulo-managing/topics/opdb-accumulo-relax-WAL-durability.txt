Relax WAL durability
You can tune the performance of Operational Database powered by Apache Accumulo
        (OpDB) by relaxing Write Ahead Log (WAL) durability. 

For increased write throughput, use the BatchWriter API to ingest data into OpDB.
                However, using this API reduces data durability. Use this setting only in
                environments with reliable UPS. 
For more information about durability performance, see Durability Performance
                    Implications.


In Cloudera Manager, select the Accumulo on CDP
                    service.

Click Configuration and then click View and
                        Edit.

Search for Tablet Server accumulo.properties.

Find Tablet Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        accumulo.properties property.

Set the following:

table.durability=flush


Save your changes.
