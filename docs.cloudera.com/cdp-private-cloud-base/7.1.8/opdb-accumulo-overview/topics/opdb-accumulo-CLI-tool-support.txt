OpDB CLI tool support
The Accumulo CLI toolset is different in Apache Accumulo 2.0 and later versions than it
  was in Accumulo 1.x. As the initial Operational Database powered by Apache Accumulo (OpDB) release
  is based on the Apache Accumulo 2.0.1 version, it is important to learn about these
  differences.
Before Apache AccumuloTM 2.0 the following toolsets were available:
accumulo
accumulo-tool

Since Apache AccumuloTM 2.0 the following toolsets are availabe:
accumulo
accumulo-cluster
accumulo-service
accumulo-util
noteDo not use accumulo-cluster and accumulo-service with the OpDB
    service. These cluster and service manager tools are not compatible with Cloudera Manager. If
    you use them, your OpDB service can become unavailable.
