OpDB powered by Apache Accumulo overview
Apache AccumuloTM is an ideal solution for government agencies looking for a
  secure, distributed NoSQL data store to serve their most performance-intensive Big Data
  applications. The Operational Database powered by Apache Accumulo (OpDB) service is the Cloudera
  package of Apache Accumulo.
Apache AccumuloTM is an open source project integrated with Hadoop that provides the
   ability to store data in massive tables (billions of rows / millions of columns) for fast and
   random access. Accumulo was created and contributed to the Apache Software Foundation by the
   National Security Agency (NSA). It has quickly gained adoption as a Hadoop-based key/value store
   for applications that have unique and stringent information security requirements.
For more information about Apache AccumuloTM, see the Apache Accumulo
   project.
