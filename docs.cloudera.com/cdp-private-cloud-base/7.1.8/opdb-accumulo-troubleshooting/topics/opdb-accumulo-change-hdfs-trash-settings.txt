Change the HDFS trash settings in Cloudera Manager
You can tune the amount of time HDFS retains trash to control how much data

                unrelated to OpDB.


In Cloudera Manager, select the HDFS service.

Click Configuration.

Search for trash.

Change the Filesystem Trash Interval to a smaller value.
