Disable Operational Database powered by Apache Accumulo's use of  HDFS trash
Using Cloudera Manager, you can configure Operational Database powered by Apache
        Accumulo (OpDB) to skip the saving of the HDFS trash.

In some deployments, changing the system-wide retention period for HDFS trash may not
                be an option. If that is the case, you can disable Accumuloâ€™s use of the HDFS trash
                entirely. If you do so, any deletions through the Accumulo APIs are
                unrecoverable.


In Cloudera Manager, select the Accumulo on CDP
                    service.

Click Configuration.

Search for accumulo.properties.

Find Tablet Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        accumulo.properties property.

Set the following:

gc.trash.ignore=true


Save your changes.

Click Restart Stale Services.
