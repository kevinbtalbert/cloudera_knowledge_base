HDFS storage demands due to retained HDFS trash
Using Cloudera Manager you can either change the HDFS trash setting or disable the use
  of the HDFS trash entirely, for your Operational Database powered by Apache Accumulo (OpDB)
  deployment.
By default, if HDFS trash is enabled, Accumulo uses it for all
   files it deletes. This includes write‐ahead logs and long‐term storage files that were blocked
   due to compaction. By default, the retention period for the HDFS trash is 24 hours. On Accumulo
   installations with a heavy write workload, this can result in a large amount of data accumulating
   in the trash folder for the service user. 
There are three workarounds:
Periodically run the hdfs dfs ­-expunge command as the Accumulo service
     user. The command must be run twice each time you want to purge a backlog of data. On the first
     run, a trash checkpoint is created. On the second run, the checkpoint created with the first
     run is removed with immediate effect.
Change the HDFS trash settings in Cloudera Manager.
Disable OpDB’s use of the HDFS trash entirely.
