Introduction to Apache HBase
Apache HBase is a scalable, distributed, column-oriented datastore. Apache HBase
  provides real-time read/write random access to very large datasets hosted on HDFS.
HBase is sparse, distributed, persistent, multidimensional sorted map, which is indexed by
   rowkey, column key,and timestamp. Fundamentally, it is a platform for storing and retrieving data
   with random access. HBase is designed to run on a cluster of computers, built using commodity
   hardware. HBase is also horizontally scalable, which means you can add any number of columns
   anytime.
