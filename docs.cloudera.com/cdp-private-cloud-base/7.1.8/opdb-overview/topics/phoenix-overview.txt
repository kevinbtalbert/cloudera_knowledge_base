Introduction to Apache Phoenix
Apache Phoenix is is a SQL layer for Apache HBase that provides a programmatic ANSI SQL
    interface.
Apache Phoenix implements best-practice optimizations to enable software engineers to develop
      HBase based next-generation applications that operationalize big data. Using Phoenix, you can
      create and interact with tables in the form of typical DDL/DML statements using the Phoenix
      standard JDBC API.
Apache HBase timestamps are the core part of the Apache Phoenix functionality. It is used as
      part of the Travel in time functionality and by the Transactional engines. Due to
      this, we expect that the data must have valid timestamps that signifies the time when the
      record is created. Invalid timestamps cause incorrect behavior for most Apache Phoenix
      functionalities, such as secondary indexes or CRUD operations. If your data is relying on the
      special behavior of the record's timestamps or future timestamps, you must not use such data
      with Apache Phoenix.

Apache Phoenix and SQLYou can use the Apache Phoenix SQL commands to create, drop, or modify an Apache         HBase table. You can also create Apache Phoenix views that are virtual tables that share the         same Apache HBase table. Parent topic: Operational Database overview
