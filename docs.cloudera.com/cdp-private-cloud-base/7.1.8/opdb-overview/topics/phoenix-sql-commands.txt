Apache Phoenix and SQL 
You can use the Apache Phoenix SQL commands to create, drop, or modify an Apache
        HBase table. You can also create Apache Phoenix views that are virtual tables that share the
        same Apache HBase table. 
The Apache Phoenix commands enable you to use standard SQL data definition
            language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) commands to interact with Apache
            HBase tables. You can create a new Apache HBase table using the standard CREATE
                TABLE SQL command or create a view on an existing Apache HBase table using
            the VIEW command. View enables you to have multiple virtual tables that
            share the same physical Apache HBase table. 
Apache HBase tables and Apache Phoenix tables have a one-to-one relationship.
            This means each Apache HBase table is associated with a corresponding Apache Phoenix
            table.

warningAlthough you can modify Apache Phoenix tables using the Apache
                HBase native APIs, this is not supported and results in errors, inconsistent
                indexes, incorrect query results, and sometimes corrupt data.

Using Apache Phoenix commands you can do the following tasks:


Create or alter Apache HBase tables using DDL commands like
                        CREATE TABLE


Modify contents in an Apache HBase table using DML commands like
                        UPSERT VALUES
