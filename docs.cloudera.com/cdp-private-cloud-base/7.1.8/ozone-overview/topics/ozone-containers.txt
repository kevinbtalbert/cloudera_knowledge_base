Ozone containers
Containers are the fundamental replication unit of Ozone and are managed by the Storage
  Container Manager (SCM) service. Containers are big binary units (5 Gb by default) that can
  contain multiple blocks. 
Blocks are local information that are not managed by SCM. Therefore, even if billions of small
   files are created in the system (which means billions of blocks are created), only the status of
   the containers will be reported by the DataNodes and the containers will be replicated. 
Whenever Ozone Manager requests a new block allocation from the SCM, SCM identifies the
   suitable container and generates a block id which contains a ContainerId and a LocalId. The
   client connects to the DataNode which stores the container, and the DataNode manages the
   separated block based on the LocalId.
