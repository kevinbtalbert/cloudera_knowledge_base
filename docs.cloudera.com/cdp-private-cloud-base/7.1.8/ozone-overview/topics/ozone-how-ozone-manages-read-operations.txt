How Ozone manages read operations
The client requests the block locations corresponding to the key it wants to read. The
    Ozone Manager (OM) returns the block locations if the client has the required read
    privileges.
The following steps explain how Ozone manages read operations:

The client requests OM for block locations corresponding to the key to read.
OM checks the ACLs to confirm whether the client has the required privileges, and
        returns the block locations and the block token that allows the client to read data from the
        DataNodes.
The client connects to the DataNode associated with the returned Block ID and reads the
        data blocks.
