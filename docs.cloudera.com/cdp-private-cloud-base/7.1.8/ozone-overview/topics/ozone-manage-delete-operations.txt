How Ozone manages delete operations
Ozone is a consistent object store and hence delete operations in Ozone are synchronous.
  When the delete request is complete, Ozone Manager deletes the key from the active namespace and
  marks the file for garbage collection.
Ozone also follows the principle of asynchronous deletion. Garbage collection and the mechanism
   to recover a storage space is managed asynchronously on most file systems to ensure that the
   delete operations do not compete with the read and write operations. 
The files marked as deleted in Ozone Manager are aggregated by containers and the request is
   sent to SCM to delete the blocks. SCM then forwards the requests to the DataNode to recover the
   actual space from the disk. A block deletion happens only over closed containers. For example, if
   you delete objects in the namespace, the deletion reflects only for the corresponding blocks in
   the closed containers. For blocks present in containers with state other than CLOSED, the
   deletion happens only after the container reaches a CLOSED state.
