Configure S3 credentials for working with Ozone
For the users or client applications that use S3 APIs to access Ozone buckets, Ozone
        provides the AWS access key ID and AWS secret key. You can add the access key ID and secret
        key in the AWS config file for Ozone to ensure that a particular user or
        client application can get automatic access to the Ozone buckets.
The user or the client application accessing Ozone must be
            authenticated against your cluster's KDC.

Display the access key ID and the secret key for a particular user or client
                    application.

ozone s3 getsecret

The command communicates with Ozone, validates the user credentials through
                    Kerberos, and generates the AWS credentials. These credentials are printed on
                    the screen. noteThese S3 credentials are like Kerberos passwords that give
                        complete access to the Ozone buckets.

Add the generated credentials to the AWS config file.
The following example shows how you can add the
                    credentials.aws configure set default.s3.signature_version s3v4
aws configure set aws_access_key_id ${accessId}
aws configure set aws_secret_access_key ${secret}
aws configure set region us-west-1
