Configuring Transparent Data Encryption for Ozone
Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) allows data on the disks to be encrypted-at-rest
        and automatically decrypted during access. For Ozone, you can enable TDE at the
        bucket-level.


The Key Management Server must be installed and running. Ozone uses the same Key
                    Management Server as HDFS.
If you are using Ranger Key Management Server, then you must ensure that the key
                    management admin user has assigned the om service user with the
                        Get Metadata and Generate EEK
                    permissions. Further, you must ensure that any user attempting to create an
                        encryption key has the required permissions in Ranger.
For information about adding or editing permissions on Ranger, see Add or edit permissions.



Create a bucket encryption key.

hadoop key create enck1


This command creates an encryption key for the bucket you want to protect.
                        After the key is created, Ozone can use that key when you are reading and
                        writing data into a bucket.


Assign the encryption key to a bucket.
The following example shows how you can assign the key enck1
                    to the bucket
                    encbucket1:ozone sh bucket create -k enck1 /vol/encbucket1
After you run this command, all data written to encbucket1
                    will be encrypted using encKey. During the read process, the
                    client applications interact with the Key Management Server to read the key and
                    decrypt it.The encryption of data is completely transparent to users and
                        client applications.
