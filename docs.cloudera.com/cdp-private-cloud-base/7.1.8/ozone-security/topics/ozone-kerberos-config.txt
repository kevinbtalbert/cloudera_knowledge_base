Kerberos configuration for OzoneCloudera Docs
Kerberos configuration for Ozone
Ozone depends on Kerberos to make the clusters secure. To enable security in an Ozone
        cluster, you must set the parameters ozone.security.enabled to
            true and hadoop.security.authentication to
            kerberos.


Security tokens in OzoneOzone issues delegation and block tokens to users or client applications         authenticated with the help of Kerberos such that they can perform specified operations         against the cluster, as if they have kerberos tickets.Kerberos principal and keytab properties for Ozone service daemonsFor the Kerberos-authenticated users or client applications to access Ozone, each of         the Ozone components requires a Kerberos service principal name and a corresponding kerberos         keytab file. You must set the corresponding in ozone-site.xml.Securing DataNodesYou can secure Ozone DataNodes by creating keytab files on each of the DataNodes. You         must ensure that certain properties are configured in hdfs-site.xml to         provide the Kerberos-authenticated users or client applications with access to the         DataNodes.Configure S3 credentials for working with OzoneFor the users or client applications that use S3 APIs to access Ozone buckets, Ozone         provides the AWS access key ID and AWS secret key. You can add the access key ID and secret         key in the AWS config file for Ozone to ensure that a particular user or         client application can get automatic access to the Ozone buckets.Configuring custom Kerberos principal for OzoneThe Kerberos principal for Ozone is configured by default to use the same service         principal as the default process user. However, you can change the default setting by         providing a custom principal in Cloudera Manager.
