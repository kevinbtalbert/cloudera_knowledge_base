Configuring TLS/SSL encryption manually for Ozone
You can use Cloudera Manager to configure TLS/SSL encryption for all the Ozone role
        instances such as Ozone Manager, Storage Container Manager, DataNode, S3 Gateway and Recon.
        Cloudera recommends that you configure TLS/SSL for all the Ozone role instances to avoid
        errors when one role instance tries to connect with another.
You must ensure that your Ozone deployment meets the
            following requirements:
The keystores containing certificates that are bound to the proper domain names
                    are accessible on all the hosts on which at least one Ozone role instance is
                    running.
The hdfs user has read permissions to the keystore files for
                    Ozone.
You must specify absolute paths to the keystore file. These settings apply to
                    all hosts on which the various Ozone role instances run. Therefore, the paths
                    that you specify must be valid on all the hosts. In addition, the keystore file
                    names for Ozone must be the same on all hosts. Consider an example
                        where you have separate certificates for the Ozone role instances on hosts
                            node1.example.com and
                            node2.example.com, and you have chosen to store the
                        certificates in files with names ozone-node1.jks and
                            ozone-node2.jks respectively. When deploying these
                        keystores, you must provide them both with the same name on the target host,
                        for example, ozone.jks.


In Cloudera Manager, go to Ozone > Configuration.

Search for tls/ssl.

Enter the TLS/SSL properties for the various Ozone roles.
Provide the values for the properties corresponding to the following fields on
                    the Ozone configuration page:

CA File PathnoteEnsure that you configure the
                                    ozone.prometheus.ca.file property when
                                configuring TLS/SSL encryption for Ozone. If the location of the
                                root CA certificate is not specified, the location of the auto-TLS
                                CA certificate is considered as the default value for this property.
