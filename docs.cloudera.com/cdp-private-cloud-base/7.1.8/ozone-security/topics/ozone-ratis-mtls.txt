Configuration for enabling mTLS in Ozone
You can enable mutual TLS (mTLS) over gRPC for secure communication among the
        different elements of an Ozone cluster, such as an within an Ozone Manager (OM) High
        Availability (HA) deployment or among the DataNodes.
To enable gRPC, you must ensure that the value of the
                hdds.grpc.tls.enabled configuration property is set to
                true.important

The hdds.grpc.tls.enabled property will not be
                        effective unless the value of the
                            ozone.security.enabled is also set to
                            true.
gRPC TLS configuration for Ozone is supported only on new CDP 7.1.7 clusters
                        and not on clusters upgraded from CDP 7.1.6 to CDP 7.1.7. If you want to
                        enable gRPC TLS on the upgraded CDP 7.1.7 clusters, you must contact
                        Cloudera Support for more information.
