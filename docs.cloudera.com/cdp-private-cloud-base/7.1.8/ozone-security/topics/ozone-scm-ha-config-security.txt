Configuring security for Storage Container Managers in High Availability
Configuring security and issuing certificates to Storage Container Managers (SCMs)
        along with Ozone Managers (OMs) and the DataNodes ensures secured communication in the Ozone
        cluster.
How the SCM issues certificates



The primordial SCM in the HA configuration starts a root Certificate Authority (CA)
                with self-signed certificates. The primordial SCM issues signed certificates to
                itself and the other bootstrapped SCMs in the HA configuration. The primordial SCM
                also has a subordinate CA with a signed certificate from the root CA. 
When an SCM is bootstrapped, it receives a signed certificate from the primordial SCM
                and starts a subordinate CA of its own. The subordinate CA of any SCM that becomes
                the leader in the HA configuration issues signed certificates to Ozone Managers and
                the DataNodes in the Ozone cluster. 


Considerations for enabling SCM HA securityThere are certain factors that you must consider when enabling security for Storage         Container Managers (SCMs) in High Availability (HA).
