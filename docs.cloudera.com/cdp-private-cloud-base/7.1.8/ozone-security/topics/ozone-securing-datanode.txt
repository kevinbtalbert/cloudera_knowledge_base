Securing DataNodes
You can secure Ozone DataNodes by creating keytab files on each of the DataNodes. You
        must ensure that certain properties are configured in hdfs-site.xml to
        provide the Kerberos-authenticated users or client applications with access to the
        DataNodes.
Configure the following parameters in hdfs-site.xml to enable DataNode
                access:
Property
Description

dfs.datanode.kerberos.principal
The DataNode service principal. You can specify this value, for
                        example, in the following
                        format:dn/_HOST@REALM.COM

dfs.datanode.kerberos.keytab.file
The keytab file that the DataNode daemon uses to log in as its service
                        principal.

hdds.datanode.http.auth.kerberos.principal
The service principal of the DataNode http server.

hdds.datanode.http.auth.kerberos.keytab
The keytab file that the DataNode http server uses to log in as its
                        service principal.

Certificate request and approval
When a DataNode boots up, it creates a private key and sends an DataNode identity
                certificate request to Storage Container Manager (SCM). If the DataNode has a
                Kerberos keytab, SCM trusts the Kerberos credentials and automatically issues a
                certificate.
