Security tokens in Ozone
Ozone issues delegation and block tokens to users or client applications
        authenticated with the help of Kerberos such that they can perform specified operations
        against the cluster, as if they have kerberos tickets.
Delegation tokens
Delegation tokens allow a user or client application to impersonate a users kerberos
                credentials. This token is based on verification of kerberos identity and is issued
                by the Ozone Manager. Delegation tokens are enabled by default when security is
                enabled.

Block tokens
Block tokens allow a user or client application to read or write a block. This
                ensures that only users or client applications with the required permissions can
                read or write to blocks in DataNodes. Block tokens are issued to authenticated
                clients and signed by Ozone Manager. They are validated by the DataNode using the
                certificate or public key of the issuer (Ozone Manager).

S3 tokens
Users or client applications accessing Ozone using S3 APIs with S3 credential tokens.
                These tokens are also enabled by default when security is enabled.noteOzone
                    supports the AWS Signature Version 4 protocol.
