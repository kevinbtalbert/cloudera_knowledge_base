Ozone trash overview
The Ozone trash feature helps prevent accidental deletion of files and
        directories.
When you delete a file in Ozone, the file is not immediately removed from Ozone. The
            deleted files are first moved to the /user/<username>/.Trash/Current
            directory, with their original filesystem path being preserved. After a
            user-configurable period of time (fs.trash.interval), a process known
            as trash checkpointing renames the Current directory to the current
            timestamp, that is, /user/<username>/.Trash/<timestamp>. The
            checkpointing process also checks the rest of the .Trash directory for
            any existing timestamp directories and removes them from Ozone permanently. You can
            restore files and directories in the trash simply by moving them to a location outside
            the .Trash directory.
