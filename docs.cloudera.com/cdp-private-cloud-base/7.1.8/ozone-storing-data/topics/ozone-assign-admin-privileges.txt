Assigning administrator privileges to users
You must assign administrator privileges to users before they can create Ozone
        volumes. You can use Cloudera Manager to assign the administrative privileges.


On Cloudera Manager, go to the Ozone service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Search for the Ozone Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                        Valve) for ozone-conf/ozone-site.xml property.
Specify values for the selected properties as follows:
Name: Enter
                            ozone.administrators.
Value: Enter the ID of the user that you want as
                            an administrator. In case of multiple users, specify a comma-separated
                            list of users.
Description: Specify a description for the
                            property. This is an optional value.


Enter a Reason for Change, and then click
                        Save Changes to commit the change.
