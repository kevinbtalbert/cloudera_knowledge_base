Commands for managing keys
The Ozone shell commands enable you to upload, download, view, delete, and list keys.
    Before running these commands, you must have configured the Ozone Service
      ID for your cluster from the Configuration tab of the Ozone
    service on Cloudera Manager.
Downloading a key from a bucket

ozone sh key get URI <local_filename>



Purpose
Downloads the specified key from a bucket in the Ozone cluster to the local
                file system.


Arguments


URI: The name of the key to download in the
                      <prefix>://<Service
                      ID>/<volumename>/<bucketname>/<keyname> format.
filename: The name of the file to which you want to write the key.




Example
ozone sh key get o3://ozone1/hive/jun/sales.orc sales_jun.orcThis
                command downloads the sales.orc file from the
