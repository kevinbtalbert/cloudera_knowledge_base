Configuration to expose buckets under non-default volumes
Ozone S3 Gateway allows access to all the buckets under the default
            /s3v volume. To access the buckets under a non-default volume, you must
        create a symbolic link to that bucket. 
Consider a non-default volume /vol1 that has a bucket
                /bucket1 in the following example:
            ozone sh volume create /s3v
ozone sh volume create /vol1

ozone sh bucket create /vol1/bucket1
ozone sh bucket link /vol1/bucket1 /s3v/common-bucket
As shown in the example, you can expose /bucket1 as an s3-compatible
                /common-bucket bucket through the Ozone S3 Gateway.
