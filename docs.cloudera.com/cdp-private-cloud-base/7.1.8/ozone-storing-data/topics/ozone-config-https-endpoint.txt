Configuring an https endpoint in Ozone S3 Gateway to work with AWS CLI 
For Ozone S3 Gateway to work with Amazon Web Services (AWS) command-line interface
        (CLI), you must perform specific configurations, especially if the S3 Gateway has https
        endpoints.
You must export the CA certificate required on all the client nodes for running the
            shell commands, and convert the certificate to PEM format because the Python SSL
            supported with AWS CLI honors certificates in the PEM format.

Run keytool to view the associated CA certificate and
                    determine the srcalias from the output of the command.

/usr/java/default/bin/keytool -list -v -keystore <ssl.client.truststore.location>


Export the CA certificate to PEM format.

keytool -export -alias <alias> -file <s3g-ca.crt> -keystore <ssl.client.truststore.location>
openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -in <s3g-ca.crt> -out /tmp/s3gca.pem


Run the ozone s3 getsecret command for the values of the
                    access key and secret key.

ozone s3 getsecret --om-service-id=<ozone service id>


Run the aws configure command to configure the access key and
                    the secret key.

aws configure accesskey/secret


You can pass the certificate in PEM file format to the
                aws s3api command and perform various tasks, such as managing
            buckets, keys, and so on. The following example shows how you can create a bucket using
            the aws s3api
            command:aws s3api --endpoint https://bv-hoz-1.bv-hoz.abc.site:9879 --ca-bundle "/tmp/s3gca.pem" create-bucket --bucket=wordcount
