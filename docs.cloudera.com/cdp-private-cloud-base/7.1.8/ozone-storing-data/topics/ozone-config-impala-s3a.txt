Configuring Impala access for S3A
You must configure specific properties for client applications such as Impala to
        access the Ozone data store using S3A.


You must import the CA certificate to run Ozone S3 Gateway from the S3A
                        filesystem. 
You must configure the following Impala properties using the
                        Cluster-wide Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        core-site.xml:fs.s3a.bucket.<<bucketname>>.access.key = <accesskey>
fs.s3a.bucket.<<bucketname>>.secret.key = <secret>
fs.s3a.endpoint = <Ozone S3 endpoint url>
fs.s3a.bucket.probe = 0
fs.s3a.change.detection.version.required = false
fs.s3a.path.style.access = true
fs.s3a.change.detection.mode = nonenoteIn
                        the list of configurations, replace the values of access
                            key and secret from the output of
                            ozone s3 getsecret --om-service-id=<ozone service
                                id> and replace the Ozone S3 endpoint URL with
                        the S3 Gateway URL of the Ozone cluster.
You must provide the required permissions in Ranger to the user running the
                    queries. Consider the following example of providing a user with
                        all permissions. You can change the permissions based on
                    your requirements.
Assign the user with all permissions to the
                                Database, table/udf, and
                                URL resources in a HadoopSQL resource-based
                            policy.
Assign the user with S3_VOLUME_POLICY in an Ozone
                            policy.




Create an Ozone bucket.
The following example shows how you can create a bucket named
                        s3impala:ozone sh bucket create /s3v/s3impala

Log on to the Impala shell and perform the specified steps.


Create a table on Ozone using S3A.

bv-hoz-1.bv-hoz.abc.site:25003> create external table mytable2(key string, value int) location 's3a://s3impala/mytable1';



Add data to the table.

bv-hoz-1.bv-hoz.abc.site:25003> insert into mytable2 values("cldr",1);
bv-hoz-1.bv-hoz.abc.site:25003> insert into mytable2 values("cldr-cdp",1);




View the data added to the table.

bv-hoz-1.bv-hoz.abc.site:25003> select * from mytable2;
