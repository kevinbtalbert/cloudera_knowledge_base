Configuring the Ozone trash checkpoint values
You can use Cloudera Manager to configure the time period after which an Ozone trash
        checkpoint directory is deleted and the time interval between the creation of  trash
        checkpoint directories.
You must ensure that you have set the Filesystem Trash
            Interval property. For details, see Setting the trash interval.

In Cloudera Manager, go to the Ozone service.

Click Configuration.

Search for the Ozone Filesystem Trash Interval property
                    and set its value.
This property specifies the time period after which an Ozone trash checkpoint
                    directory is deleted. The default value is 1 day. Setting the value to 0
                    disables the trash feature.

Search for the Ozone Filesystem Trash Checkpoint
                        Interval property and set its value.
This specifies the time period between trash checkpoints, and its value must
                    be less than the value of the Ozone Filesystem Trash
                        Interval property. Setting the value to 0 implies that the value
                    of Ozone Filesystem Trash Interval is used to determine
                    the interval between trash checkpoints.
