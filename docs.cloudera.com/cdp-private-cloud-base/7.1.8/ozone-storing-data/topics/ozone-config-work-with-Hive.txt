Configuration options to store Hive managed tables on Ozone
If you want to store Hive managed tables with ACID properties on Ozone, you must
        configure specific properties in hive-site.xml.
You can consider either of the following options to store Hive managed tables with ACID
            support on Ozone:
Set the value of the hive.metastore.warehouse.dir property to
                    point to the path of the Ozone directory where you want to store the Hive
                    tables.
Set the value of the metastore.warehouse.tenant.colocation
                    property to true. You can then set the
                        MANAGEDLOCATION of your Hive database to point to an Ozone
                    directory so that the Hive tables can reside at the specified location.

noteDynamic partitioning in Hive with the default settings can generate an unexpected load
            on the filesystem when bulk loading data into tables because Hive creates a number of
            files for every partition. To avoid this issue, consider updating the following
            properties and tuning them further based on your requirements:
                hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition and
                hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition.threshold.From
                a
                filesystem
                perspective, the recommended values are as follows:
hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition = true
hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition.threshold = 0
If you notice that some queries are taking a longer time to complete or
                failing entirely (usually noticed in large clusters), you can choose to revert the
                value of hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition.threshold to "-1".
                The performance issue is related to HIVE-26283.
