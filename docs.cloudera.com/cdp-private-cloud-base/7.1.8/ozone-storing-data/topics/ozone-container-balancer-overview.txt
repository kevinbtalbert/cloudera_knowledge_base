Container Balancer overview
Container balancer is a service in Storage Container Manager that balances the
    utilization of datanodes in an Ozone cluster. 
A cluster is considered balanced if for each datanode, the utilization of the datanode (used
      space to capacity ratio) differs from the utilization of the cluster (used space to capacity
      ratio of the entire cluster) no more than the threshold. This service balances the cluster by
      moving containers among over-utilized and under-utilized datanodes.
