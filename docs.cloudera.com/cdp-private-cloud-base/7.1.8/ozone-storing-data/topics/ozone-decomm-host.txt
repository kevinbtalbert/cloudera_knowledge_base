Decommissioning Ozone DataNodes
You can remove Ozone DataNodes from the cluster by decommissioning the DataNode
        instances using Cloudera Manager.
Ensure that the cluster has sufficient space to hold the
            additional storage containers of the DataNodes that you are decommissioning. 

In Cloudera Manager, go to the Ozone service.

Click Instances.

Select the DataNode instances that you want to decommission.

Select Actions for
                        Selected>Decommission.

Click Decommission to confirm.
Ozone initiates decommissioning of the selected DataNodes. The process takes
                    time depending on the number of storage containers to replicate. After the
                    process is complete, the Instances page shows the Commissioned
                        State of the selected DataNodes as
                        Decommissioned.
