Delete Objects 
Use the following code snippet to delete objects. 

response = s3_client.delete_objects(
    Bucket='bucket1',
    Delete={
        'Objects': [
            {
                'Key': 'README4.md',
            },
            {
                'Key': 'README3.md',
            },
        ],
        'Quiet': False,
    },
)

This will delete objects ‘README3.md’ and ‘README4.md’ from Ozone volume ‘s3v’ in
   bucket ‘bucket1’.
