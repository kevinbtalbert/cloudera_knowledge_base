Enabling EC replication configuration on bucket
You can enable EC replication configuration at bucket level.

You can set the bucket level EC Replication configuration through CLI by executing
                    the command ozone sh bucket create <bucket path> --type EC --replication
                        rs-6-3-1024k

To reset the EC Replication configuration, execute the following command
                    ozone sh bucket set-replication-config <bucket path> --type EC
                        --replication rs-3-2-1024k

note

The new configuration applies only to the keys created after
                                resetting the EC Replication configuration. Keys created before
                                resetting the EC Replication configuration will have the older
                                configuration. 
If you set EC Replication configuration on RATIS (while writing at a
                                bucket level) and you are using Ozone File System (ofs/o3fs), there is a
                                timeout of 10 minutes where you will continue to write on RATIS as a
                                caching process in place at the bucket level. For fresh buckets, if
                                you set EC Replication configuration on RATIS, the new configuration
                                is immediately available for the bucket. However, for ofs/o3fs/s3
                                you can only use bucket level settings as you cannot allow EC
                                setting on key creation.
