Enabling EC replication configuration on keys or files
You can enable EC configuration replication at key level.

You can set the key level EC Replication configuration command through CLI
                    while creating the keys irrespective of bucket Replication configuration
                        ozone sh key put <Ozone Key Object Path> <Local File> --type
                        EC --replication rs-6-3-1024k

noteIf you have already configured the default EC Replication configuration
                        for a bucket, you do not have to configure the EC Replication configuration
                        while creating a key.
