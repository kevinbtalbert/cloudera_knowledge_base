Configuration to create bucket with default layout
You must set the following configuration in Cloudera Manager to create a bucket with
        default layout.
In Cloudera Manager, you must configure ozone-site.xml to define the
            default value for bucket layout during bucket creation if the client has not specified
            the bucket layout argument. Supported values are OBJECT_STORE,
                FILE_SYSTEM_OPTIMIZED, and LEGACY. By
                default, this config value is empty. Ozone will default to LEGACY bucket layout if
                it finds an empty config value. You must add the below property and provide the
                value.
