Delete and Rename Operation
Currently, in the Legacy Ozone file system to delete or rename dir 1, you have to
    delete or rename dir 1 in all the rows. This is expensive, time consuming, and not
    scalable.



Now, there is an object ID allocated for every path created. Deleting or renaming dir 1 now updates all rows based on the Object ID. The images below explain how rename and delete operations work.
