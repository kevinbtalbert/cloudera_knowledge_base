Metadata layout format
In the File System Optimized (FSO) buckets, OM metadata format stores intermediate
    directories into DirectoryTable and files into FileTable as shown in the below picture. The key
    to the table is the name of a directory or a file prefixed by the unique identifier of its
    parent directory <parent unique-id>/<filename>
