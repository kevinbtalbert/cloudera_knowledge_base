Multi Protocol Aware System overview
The overview helps you to understand Ozone file system support, differences between
    flat namespace and hierarchical namespace, different bucket layouts, and their use cases. 
Ozone natively provides Amazon S3 and Hadoop Filesystem compatible endpoints and is designed
      to work seamlessly with enterprise scale Data Warehousing, Batch Analytics, Machine Learning,
      Streaming Workloads, and so on. The prominent use cases based on the integration with storage
      service are mentioned below:
Ozone as a pure S3 object store semantics 
Ozone as a replacement filesystem for HDFS to solve the scalability issues 
Ozone as a Hadoop Compatible File System (HCFS) with limited S3 compatibility. For
          example, for key paths with “/” in it, intermediate directories will be created. 
Multiprotocol access - Interoperability of the same data for various workloads. 


Upgrading this feature from older Ozone version to 7.1.8You must first upgrade Ozone and perform the pre and post finalization steps to use         this feature.Files and Objects togetherBucket Layout concept is now introduced in Ozone that helps you with the unified design     representing files, directories, and objects stored in a single system.Bucket LayoutApache Ozone now supports bucket layout feature. This helps you in categorising     different Ozone buckets like FSO, OBS, and Legacy.Configuration to create bucket with default layoutYou must set the following configuration in Cloudera Manager to create a bucket with         default layout.Performing Bucket Layout operations in Apache Ozone using CLIRun the below commands to get an understanding of the basic operations like create,         list, move, read, write, and deleteOzone Ranger policyUsing the Ozone Ranger policy integration, you can set new Ozone Ranger         policies.
