Interoperability Between S3 and FS APIs
FSO Bucket Layout supports interoperability of data for various use cases. For example,
    You can create an FSO Bucket type and ingest data into Apache Ozone using FileSystem API. The
    same data can be accessed through the Ozone S3 API (Amazon S3 implementation of the S3 API
    protocol) and vice versa. 
Multi-protocol client access - read/write operations using Ozone S3 and Ozone FS client.
