Upgrading this feature from older Ozone version to 7.1.8
You must first upgrade Ozone and perform the pre and post finalization steps to use
        this feature.

Pre-Finalization Phase: You can only create buckets with a LEGACY layout. If
                    any client (old or new) tries to create a new bucket with OBJECT_STORE or
                    FILE_SYSTEM_OPTIMIZED layout, this request is blocked.

Post-Finalization Phase:


New Clients: Full Bucket Layout feature is available.


Old Clients: You cannot interact with any buckets that are not in
                            LEGACY layout. This means they cannot talk to FSO or OBS buckets. Ozone
                            displays the UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION exception in all such cases. For
                            example, attempts to create directories and keys, list status, read
                            bucket info, and so on will also display an UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION
                            exception
