Considerations for configuring High Availability on the Ozone Manager 
There are various factors that you must consider when configuring High Availability
        (HA) for the Ozone Manager (OM). 


OM HA is automatically enabled when you set up Ozone on a CDP cluster with at
                    least three nodes as OM hosts.
You must define the OM on at least three nodes so that one OM node is the leader
                    and the remaining nodes are the followers. The OM nodes automatically elect a
                        leader.The following command lists the OM leader node and the follower
                        nodes:ozone admin om getserviceroles -id=<ozone service id>
