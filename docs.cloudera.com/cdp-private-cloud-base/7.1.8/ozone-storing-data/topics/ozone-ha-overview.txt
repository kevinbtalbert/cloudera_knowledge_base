Overview of the Ozone Manager in High Availability
Configuring High Availability (HA) for the Ozone Manager (OM) enables you to run
        redundant Ozone Managers on your Ozone cluster and prevents the occurrence of a single point
        of failure in the cluster from the perspective of namespace management. In addition, Ozone
        Manager HA ensures continued interactions with the client applications for read and write
        operations.
Ozone Manager HA involves a leader OM that handles read and write requests from the
            client applications, and at least two follower OMs, one of which can take over as the
            leader in situations such as the following: 
Unplanned events such as a crash involving the node that contains the leader OM. 
Planned events such as a hardware or software upgrade on the node that contains
                    the leader OM.


Considerations for configuring High Availability on the Ozone ManagerThere are various factors that you must consider when configuring High Availability         (HA) for the Ozone Manager (OM). Ozone Manager nodes in High AvailabilityA High Availability (HA) configuration of the Ozone Manager (OM) involves one leader         OM node and two or more follower nodes. The leader node services read and write requests         from the client. The follower nodes closely keep track of the updates made by the leader so         that in the event of a failure, one of the follower nodes can take over the operations of         the leader.
