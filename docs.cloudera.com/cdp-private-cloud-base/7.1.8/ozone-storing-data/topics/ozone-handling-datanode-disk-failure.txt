Handling datanode disk failure
If there is a disk failure on a datanode, you must place the node in offline mode,
        stop the node, replace the disk, start the node, and recommission the node to remove it from
        offline mode. Perform the following steps:

Log in to Cloudera Manager UI

Navigate to Clusters.

Select the Ozone service

Place the datanode in offline mode. See Placing Ozone DataNodes in offline
                        mode.

Stop the node.

Replace the failed disk(s). If the new disk is mounted to a different location
                    than the old disk, you will need to update the configurations accordingly.


Go to Configurations


To update the path to a Ratis storage disk, update the corresponding
                            entry in dfs.container.ratis.datanode.storage.dir
                            to point to the new disk’s mount point.


To update the path to a data storage disk, update the corresponding
                            entry in hdds.datanode.dir to point to the new
                            disk’s mount point.



Restart the node.

Recommission the Datanode to remove it from offline mode. See Recommissioning an Ozone
                    DataNode.

noteIn the event of complete node failure, you must decommission the node. For
                        more information on decommissioning the node, see Decommissioning Ozone
                        DataNodes.
