Placing Ozone DataNodes in offline mode
You can temporarily remove Ozone DataNodes from the cluster by placing the DataNode
        instances in offline mode using Cloudera Manager.
Ensure that the cluster has sufficient space to hold the
            additional storage container copies belonging to the DataNode that you are placing in
            offline mode. 

In Cloudera Manager, go to the Ozone service.

Click Instances.

Select the DataNode instances that you want to place in offline mode.

Select Actions for Selected>Enter Offline
                        mode.

Click Enter Offline mode to confirm.
Ozone starts preparing the selected DataNodes for offline mode. The process
                    takes time depending on the number of storage containers to replicate. After the
                    process is complete, the DataNode is stopped, and the Instances page shows the
                        Commissioned State of the selected DataNodes as
                        Offlined.
