Configuring the number of storage container copies for a DataNode
By default, Ozone ensures that at least two copies of any container stored on a
        DataNode entering the offline mode are available on other nodes in the cluster. To reduce
        the time for nodes to enter offline mode, you can reduce the number of copies to
        one.

In Cloudera Manager, go to the Ozone service.

Click Configuration.

Search for the Storage Container Manager Advanced Configuration
                        Snippet (Safety Valve) for ozone-conf/ozone-site.xml property,
                    and specify the following values:


Name:
hdds.scm.replication.maintenance.replica.minimum
Value:
1



Click Save.

Restart the Storage Container Manager (SCM) instances from the Instances
                    page.
