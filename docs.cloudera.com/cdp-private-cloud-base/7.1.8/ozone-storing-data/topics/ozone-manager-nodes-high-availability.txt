Ozone Manager nodes in High Availability
A High Availability (HA) configuration of the Ozone Manager (OM) involves one leader
        OM node and two or more follower nodes. The leader node services read and write requests
        from the client. The follower nodes closely keep track of the updates made by the leader so
        that in the event of a failure, one of the follower nodes can take over the operations of
        the leader.
The leader commits a transaction only after at least one of the followers acknowledges to
            have received the transaction.

Read and write requests with Ozone Manager in High AvailabilityRead requests from the client applications are directed to the leader Ozone Manager         (OM) node. After receiving an acknowledgement to its request, the client caches the details         of the leader OM node, and routes subsequent requests to this node.Parent topic: Overview of the Ozone Manager in High Availability
