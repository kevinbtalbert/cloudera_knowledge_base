Read and write requests with Ozone Manager in High Availability
Read requests from the client applications are directed to the leader Ozone Manager
        (OM) node. After receiving an acknowledgement to its request, the client caches the details
        of the leader OM node, and routes subsequent requests to this node.
If repeated requests to the designated leader OM node start failing or fail
            with a NonLeaderException, it could mean that the particular node is no
            longer the leader. In this situation, the client must identify the correct leader OM
            node and reroute the requests accordingly.
The following command lists the OM leader node and the follower
            nodes:ozone admin om getserviceroles -id=<ozone service id>
In the case of write requests from clients, the OM leader services the request after
            receiving a quorum of acknowledgements from the follower.
noteThe read and write requests from clients could fail in situations such as a failover
            event or network failure. In such situations, the client can retry the requests.
