Multi-Raft configuration for efficient write performances
Multi-Raft configuration improves write performances in Ozone by including DataNodes
        in multiple pipelines.
Ozone uses the Raft protocol for replicating data across the cluster and providing
            consistent write performances among the DataNodes. Ozone stores data in a number of
            containers throughout the cluster and each container allocates data blocks on DataNodes.
            In addition, Ozone creates pipelines, as logic groups, to assemble containers from
            several DataNodes for redundancy purposes. Each pipeline consists of DataNodes in a Raft
            group such that there are three DataNodes with one of them being the leader. Through the
            pipeline, data is written to the leader, which replicates the same to the followers. A
            pipeline uses RaftLog to spread the write load on disks.
In a single-Raft configuration, a DataNode can join only one pipeline. This can
            slow down the write performance to the DataNodes and impact the efficiency with which
            disks are used on various DataNodes. Starting with CDP 7.1.6, a multi-Raft configuration
            is available on Ozone by default. A multi-Raft configuration is beneficial because it
            increases the write efficiency by providing for more containers and pipelines without
            increasing the number of nodes or disks. Further, multi-Raft configuration also leads to
            more efficient use of DataNodes and disks in spreading the writes throughout the
            cluster.
Configuration properties for pipeline limits
To configure the pipeline limits for a multi-Raft configuration, you can set up
                certain properties as advanced configuration snippets using the Ozone
                    Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                    ozone-conf/ozone-site.xml property.


Property
Description
Default value



ozone.scm.datanode.pipeline.limit
Limit for the number of 3-node pipelines that a DataNode can
                                join.
2If you want to increase the number of pipelines based on the
                                    number of RaftLog disks, then you can set this value to
                                0.


ozone.scm.pipeline.per.metadata.disk
Number of pipelines to create for a Raft-log disk.
