Key management using ofs
When using ofs, Ozone administrators and users can perform various
        operations on Ozone keys with the help of the Hadoop shell commands such as creating keys,
        recursively listing keys, and renaming keys in a bucket.
Creating keys
You must consider the following when creating Ozone keys using
                    ofs:
You cannot create files (keys) under the root or the first-level directory
                        (volume) except in the /tmp/ directory.
You can add keys to the second-level directory (bucket) or lower-level
                        directories.


Recursively listing keys
You must consider the following when using the ls -R command to
                recursively list Ozone keys under volumes and buckets:
Running the ls -R command...
Recursively lists the following...

For a bucket
All the keys that belong to the particular bucket

For a volume
All the buckets that belong to the specified volume and the keys
                            that belong to each bucket

At the root 
All the volumes under the root, all the buckets that belong to each
                            volume, and all the keys that belong to each bucket


Renaming keys
You can rename only the keys that belong to a bucket. The ofs file
                system does not allow you to rename the keys across volumes or buckets.
For example, ofs allows renaming of the key
                    ofs:///volume1/bucket1/key1.txt to
                    ofs:///volume1/bucket1/key2.txt. However,
                    ofs:///volume1/bucket1/key1.txt cannot be renamed to
                    ofs:///volume1/bucket2/key11.txt.
