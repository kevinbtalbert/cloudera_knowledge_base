Volume and bucket management using ofs
When using ofs, Ozone administrators and users can perform various
        volume and bucket operations with the help of the Hadoop shell commands such as creating
        volumes and buckets and using ACLs on the volumes and buckets.
Creating volumes and buckets
Ozone administrators can create directories under the root and first-level
                directories using the Hadoop shell. Creating a directory under the root is
                equivalent to creating an Ozone volume. Creating a directory under a first-level
                directory is equivalent to creating a bucket. In addition, Ozone users can create
                buckets under volumes to which they have the write access.
In the following example, you create a volume named volume1 using
                the -mkdir command of the Hadoop
                shell:ozone fs -mkdir ofs://ozservice1/volume1/
The equivalent Ozone command to create a volume is as
                follows:ozone sh volume create o3://ozservice1/volume1/
Similarly, the Hadoop shell command for creating a bucket is as
                    follows:ozone fs -mkdir ofs://ozservice1/volume1/bucket1/noteIf
                    you use the -mkdir -p command to create volumes and buckets
                    that do not exist, Ozone creates the specified volumes and buckets.

Using the /tmp directory
The ofs root contains a special tmp volume mount
                for backward compatibility with legacy Hadoop applications that use the
                    /tmp/ directory. To use the volume mount, the Ozone
                administrator must first create a tmp volume and set its Access
                Control List (ACL) to ALL. This administrator needs to perform this process once for
                every cluster. 
The following example shows how to create the tmp volume and assign
                it the required
                ACLs:ozone sh volume create tmp
ozone sh volume setacl tmp -al world::a
After the administrator has created the tmp volume, each user must
                initialize their respective tmp bucket once. The following example
                shows how to initialize the tmp
                bucket.ozone fs -mkdir ofs://ozservice1/tmp/
The user can then write to the /tmp/ bucket just as they would to a
                regular bucket.

Using ACLs on volumes and buckets
You must consider the following when setting Access Control Lists (ACLs) on Ozone
                volumes and buckets:
Setting ACLs on a first-level directory except /tmp/ is the
                        same as setting ACLs on a volume.
Setting ACLs on a second-level directory is the same as setting ACLs on a
                        bucket.
The ACLs on the /tmp/ directory are the same as those on
                        the bucket from which the /tmp/ directory is mapped.For
                            example, if you map ofs:///tmp/ from
                            ofs:///tmp/<tmp-bucket-for-current-user>/, the
                            ACLs on ofs:///tmp/<tmp-bucket-for-current-user>/
                            are the same as those on ofs:///tmp/bucket1/.noteBy default, the
                                name of a user's temp bucket under the /tmp/ volume is
                                the MD5 hash of the username.
You cannot set ACLs on the root (/) because it is only a
                        logical root.


Renaming volumes and bucketsThe
                    ofs file system does not support renaming of volumes and
                buckets. Any attempt to rename a volume or a bucket results in an exception. You can
                only rename directories inside a bucket.
For example, ofs
            supports renaming of ofs:///volume1/bucket1/dir1 to
                ofs:///volume1/bucket1/dir2.
