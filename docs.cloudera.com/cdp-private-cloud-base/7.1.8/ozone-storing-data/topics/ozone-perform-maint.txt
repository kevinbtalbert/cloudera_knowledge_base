Removing Ozone DataNodes from the cluster
You can remove Ozone DataNodes from the CDP cluster in a controlled manner using
        Cloudera Manager for performing maintenance operations. If you want to remove the DataNodes
        permanently or for an unknown duration, you can decommission them. If you want to make the
        DataNodes unavailable for a short period of time, such as, for a few days or hours, you can
        place them in offline mode.
When you initiate the process of decommissioning a DataNode, Ozone automatically ensures
            that all the storage containers on that DataNode have an additional copy created on
            another DataNode before the decommission completes. Similarly, when you initiate the
            process of placing a DataNode in offline mode, Ozone ensures that at least two copies of
            the DataNode's storage containers are present on other nodes before the particular
            DataNode enters offline mode.note

Before a DataNode enters offline mode, you can reduce the minimum number of
                        online copies of the storage container from two to one. This process reduces
                        the time to complete the offline mode operation. However, the process
                        increases the risk of data becoming temporarily unavailable if another
                        DataNode fails. For details on how to reduce the minimum number of
                            storage container copies, see Configuring the number of storage
                                container copies for a DataNode.
Ozone does not specify any upper limit on the number of DataNodes you can
                        simultaneously decommission or place in offline mode. However, there must be
                        enough space on the cluster to hold the additional storage containers.
                        Otherwise, the DataNodes cannot complete the decommissioning or offline mode
                        processes.


You can also recommission a DataNode that is already decommissioned or placed in offline
            mode. When you recommission such a DataNode, Ozone automatically removes any excess
            containers created during the decommission or offline process. 

Decommissioning Ozone DataNodesYou can remove Ozone DataNodes from the cluster by decommissioning the DataNode         instances using Cloudera Manager.Placing Ozone DataNodes in offline modeYou can temporarily remove Ozone DataNodes from the cluster by placing the DataNode         instances in offline mode using Cloudera Manager.Configuring the number of storage container copies for a DataNodeBy default, Ozone ensures that at least two copies of any container stored on a         DataNode entering the offline mode are available on other nodes in the cluster. To reduce         the time for nodes to enter offline mode, you can reduce the number of copies to         one.Recommissioning an Ozone DataNodeYou can add an Ozone DataNode that is already decommissioned or in offline mode back         to the cluster using Cloudera Manager.Handling datanode disk failureIf there is a disk failure on a datanode, you must place the node in offline mode,         stop the node, replace the disk, start the node, and recommission the node to remove it from         offline mode.
