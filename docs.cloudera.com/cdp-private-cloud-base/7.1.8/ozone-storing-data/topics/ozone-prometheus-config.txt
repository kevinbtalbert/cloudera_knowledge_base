Configuring Ozone to work with Prometheus
You can configure your Ozone cluster to enable Prometheus for real time monitoring of the cluster.
To enable Prometheus to work on your Ozone cluster, use
            Cloudera Manager to add the Ozone Prometheus role instance.

In Cloudera Manager, go to the Ozone service.

Add the Ozone Prometheus role instance to the Ozone
                    service.
For more information about adding role instances using Cloudera Manager, see
                        Adding a role instance.

noteIf you do not see Ozone Prometheus in the list of
                        role instances to configure, it means that the role instance is not
                        configured correctly. In this situation, the Prometheus logs
                            (/var/log/hadoop-ozone/ozone-prometheus.log) on the
                        Prometheus instance host show a FileNotFound error.


Start the Ozone Prometheus role instance.
For information about starting role instances using Cloudera Manager, see
                        Starting, stopping, and restarting role
                        instances.
After starting the role instance, the Prometheus Web UI
                    quick link is added to the Ozone Prometheus page on Cloudera Manager.

Click the Prometheus Web UI  quick link to launch the
                    web user interface on a separate browser window.
The metrics drop-down list displays various metrics from the Ozone
                    daemons.

Select any metric from the drop-down list or enter the name of a metric and
                    click Execute.
Click the Graph or Console tab
                    to view further details.
