Configuring Ozone to work as a pure object store
Depending on your requirement, you can configure Ozone to use the Amazon S3 APIs and
        perform the various volume and bucket operations.
You must modify the ozone.om.enable.filesystem.paths property in
                ozone-site.xml by using Cloudera Manager to configure Ozone as an
            object store.

Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.

Go to the Ozone service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select Category > Advanced.

Configure the Ozone Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                        Valve) for ozone-conf/ozone-site.xml property as
                    specified.


Name:
                                ozone.om.enable.filesystem.paths
Value: False



Enter a Reason for Change and then click Save
                        Changes.

Restart the Ozone service.

You must also configure the client applications accessing
            Ozone to reflect the Ozone configuration changes. If you have applications in Spark,
            Hive or other services interacting with Ozone through the S3A interface, then you must
            make specific configuration changes in the applications.
