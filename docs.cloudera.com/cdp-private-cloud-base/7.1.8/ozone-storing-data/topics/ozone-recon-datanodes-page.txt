DataNodes page
The DataNodes page displays information about the state of the DataNodes in a tabular
        format. You can load this page either by clicking the DataNodes tab on the left pane or the
        DataNodes card on the Overview page.




The following columns of the table provide details of the DataNodes: 
Status: The health status of the particular DataNode.
                        The status can be either of the following: 
HEALTHY: Indicates a normal functional DataNode.
STALE: Indicates that the SCM has not received a heartbeat from the
                                DataNode for a certain period of time after the previous heartbeat. 
DEAD: Indicates that the SCM has not received a heartbeat beyond a
                                certain period of time since receiving the previous heartbeat. The
                                time period beyond which the DataNode can be categorized as DEAD is
                                configurable. The default value is five minutes. Until this
                                threshold is reached, the DataNode is in a STALE state.
DECOMMISSIONING: Indicates that the DataNode is being
                                decommissioned. 

Hostname: The cluster host that contains the
                        particular DataNode. 
Storage Capacity: The storage capacity of the
                        particular DataNode. The capacity information includes the amount of storage
                        used by Ozone, by services other than Ozone, and any remaining storage
                        capacity of the host. Hovering your mouse pointer over a particular entry
                            displays the detailed capacity information as a tool tip.


Last Heartbeat: The timestamp of the last heartbeat
                        sent by the particular DataNode to the SCM.
Pipeline ID(s): The IDs of the pipelines to which the
                        particular DataNode belongs. 
Containers: The number of storage containers inside
                        the particular DataNode.
