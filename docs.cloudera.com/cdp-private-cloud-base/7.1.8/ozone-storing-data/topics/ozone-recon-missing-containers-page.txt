Missing Containers page
There can be situations when a storage container or its replicas are not reported in
        any of the DataNode reports to the SCM. Such containers are flagged as missing containers to
        Recon. Ozone clients cannot read any blocks that are present in a missing container. 

The Containers card on the Overview page of the Recon web user interface is
                highlighted with a red border in the case of missing containers. Clicking the card
                loads the Missing Containers page.






The page displays information about missing containers in a tabular format. The
                following columns provide the required information:
Container ID: The ID of the storage container that is
                        reported as missing due to the unavailability of the container and its
                        replicas. Expanding the + sign next to a Container ID displays the following
                        additional information:
Volume: The name of the volume to which the
                                particular key belongs.
Bucket: The name of the bucket to which the
                                particular key belongs.
Key: The name of the key.
Size: The size of the key.
Date Created: The date of creation of the
                                key.
Date Modified: The date of modification of
                                the key.

No of Keys: The number of keys that were a part of
                        the particular missing container. 
DataNodes: A list of DataNodes that had a replica of
                        the missing storage container. Hovering your mouse pointer on the
                        information icon shows a tool tip with the timestamp when the container
                        replica was first and last reported on the DataNode.
