Pipelines page
The Pipelines page displays information about active pipelines including their IDs,
        the corresponding replication factors and the associated DataNodes. The page does not
        display any inactive pipelines.

An active pipeline is one that continues to participate in the replication process.
                In contrast, an inactive pipeline contains DataNodes that are dead or inaccessible,
                leading to the removal of its metadata from the Recon database, and eventually the
                destruction of the pipeline itself. 



The page displays Pipeline information in a tabular format. The following columns
                provide the required information:
Pipeline ID(s): The ID of a particular pipeline.
Replication Type & Factor: The type of
                        replication and the corresponding replication factor associated with a
                        particular pipeline. The replication types are Standalone and Ratis.
                        Accordingly, the default replication factor is three for Ratis and one for
                        Standalone.
Status: Specifies whether the particular pipeline is
                        open or closed.
DataNodes: The DataNodes that are a part of the
                        particular pipeline.
Leader: The DataNode that is elected as the Ratis
                        leader for the write operations associated with the particular
                        pipeline.
Lifetime: The period of time for which the particular
                        pipeline is open.
Last Leader Election: The timestamp of the last
                        election of the leader DataNode associated with this pipeline. noteThis
                            field does not show any data for the current release.
No. of Elections: The number of times the DataNodes
                        associated with the pipeline have elected a leader.noteThis field does not
                            show any data for the current release.
