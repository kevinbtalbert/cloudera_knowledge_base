Working with the Recon web user interface
Recon is a centralized monitoring and management service within an Ozone cluster that
        provides information about the metadata maintained by different Ozone components such as the
        Ozone Manager (OM) and the Storage Container Manager (SCM).
Recon keeps track of the metadata as the cluster is operational, and displays the
            relevant information through a dashboard and different views on the Recon web user
            interface. This information helps in understanding the overall state of the Ozone
            cluster.
The metadata that components such as the OM and the SCM maintain are quite different from one
            another. For example, the OM maintains the mapping between keys and containers in an Ozone
            cluster while the SCM maintains information about containers, DataNodes, and pipelines. The
            Recon web user interface provides a consolidated view of all these elements.

Access the Recon web user interfaceYou can launch the Recon web user interface from Cloudera Manager. Recon starts its         HTTP server over port 9888 by default. The default port is 9889 when auto-TLS is enabled. Elements of the Recon web user interfaceThe Recon web user interface displays information about the Ozone cluster on the         following pages: Overview, DataNodes, and Pipelines. In addition, a separate page displays         information about any missing storage containers.
