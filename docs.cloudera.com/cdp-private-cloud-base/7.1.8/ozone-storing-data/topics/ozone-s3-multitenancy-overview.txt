    compartmentalize the resources and create multiple tenants. 
Technical Preview: This is a technical preview feature and considered under
      development. Do not use this in your production systems. To share your feedback, contact

You can access multiple S3-accessible Ozone volumes available over AWS S3 using CLI or APIs.
      You can control each of these volumes with Ozone administrator privileges or tenant
      administrator privileges. You can use Apache Ranger to control the volume, bucket and key
      access.
Each tenant by default has a volume assigned. An administrator can provide the volume access
      to a user. An Access ID & Secret Key pair is generated for every user to access the
      volume. An Ozone administrator can then assign one or more tenant users with the tenant
      administrator privilege in a tenant, so these tenant administrators can assign and revoke
      users from the tenant without involving the Ozone administrators.
