Storage Container Manager operations in High Availability
When an Ozone cluster has Storage Container Manager (SCM) High Availability (HA)
        configured, the important SCM operations; for example, managing client requests such as
        allocating containers, local operations such as destroying pipelines, and processing
        DataNode updates, are handled differently from a non-HA Ozone cluster.
Client request management
SCM clients are the different Ozone elements that interact with the SCM such as
                DataNodes, the Ozone Manager (OM) and so on.
On receiving client requests such as allocating a container or a pipeline, the leader
                SCM performs all the required operations. The leader also performs metadata changes
                that result from executing the client request, and accordingly updates Ratis. The
                changes are replicated to the followers through Ratis.

Performing operations local to the SCM
SCM performs local operations such as destroying pipelines, deleting stale DataNodes,
                and so on, when it stops receiving heartbeats or reports from DataNodes. The
                followers log the occurrences of these operations and their results. The leader
                performs any metadata changes that result from these local operations, and
                accordingly updates Ratis. The changes are replicated to the followers through
                Ratis.

Processing DataNode updates
The DataNodes send heartbeats and reports to all the SCMs so that they maintain
                consistent information about the health of the DataNodes. If the SCMs require to
                interact with the DataNodes, only the leader sends the required information while
                the followers update their states accordingly.noteBecause newer heartbeats and
                    reports can overwrite the existing information, the SCMs are eventually
                    consistent with the DataNode heartbeats and reports.
