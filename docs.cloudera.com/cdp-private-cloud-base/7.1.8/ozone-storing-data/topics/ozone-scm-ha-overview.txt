Overview of Storage Container Manager in High Availability
 Configuring High Availability (HA) for the Storage Container Manager (SCM) prevents
        the occurrence of a single point of failure in an Ozone cluster to manage the various types
        of storage metadata, and ensures continued interactions of the SCM with the Ozone Manager
        (OM) and the DataNodes.
SCM HA involves the following:
A leader SCM that interacts with the OM for block allocations, and works with
                    the DataNodes to maintain the replication levels required by the Ozone
                    cluster.
At least two follower SCMs that closely keep track of the updates made by the
                    leader so that in the event of a failure, one of the follower nodes can take
                    over the operations from the leader.


Considerations for configuring High Availability on Storage Container ManagerSimilar to configuring High Availability (HA) for the Ozone Manager (OM), there are         various factors that you must consider when configuring HA for  the Storage Container         Manager (SCM). Storage Container Manager operations in High AvailabilityWhen an Ozone cluster has Storage Container Manager (SCM) High Availability (HA)         configured, the important SCM operations; for example, managing client requests such as         allocating containers, local operations such as destroying pipelines, and processing         DataNode updates, are handled differently from a non-HA Ozone cluster.
