Setting up o3fs
Select the Ozone bucket to configure o3fs.

Select the Ozone bucket on which you want o3fs to reside.
If you do not have a designated volume or bucket for o3fs, create
          them using the required
          commands:ozone sh volume create /volume
            ozone sh bucket create /volume/bucketnoteCloudera
              Manager currently does not support Ozone as the default file system.

The o3fs file system implementation classpath is added to CDP services
          by default. But if an application is unable to instantiate the o3fs file
          system class, add the ozone-filesystem-hadoop3.jar to the classpath.

export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/opt/ozone/share/ozonefs/lib/hadoop-ozone-filesystem-hadoop3-*.jar:$HADOOP_CLASSPATH


After setting up o3fs, you can run HDFS commands such as the following
          on Ozone: (Assuming Ozone Service ID is
          “ozone”)
hdfs dfs -ls o3fs://bucket.volume.ozone/  and hdfs dfs
          -mkdir o3fs://bucket.volume.ozone/users 
Now, applications such as Hive and Spark can run on this file system after some basic
          configuration changes. noteAny keys that are created or deleted in the bucket using
            methods other than o3fs are displayed as directories and files in
            o3fs.
noteo3fs is deprecated. It is recommended to use ofs instead. See Setting up ofs.
