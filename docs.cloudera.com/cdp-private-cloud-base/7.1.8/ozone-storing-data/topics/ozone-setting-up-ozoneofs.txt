Setting up ofsCloudera Docs
Setting up ofs
Select the Ozone bucket to configure ofs.

Select the Ozone bucket on which you want ofs to reside.
If you do not have a designated volume or bucket for ofs, create them
          using the required
            commands:ozone sh volume create /volume
ozone sh bucket create /volume/bucketnoteCloudera
            Manager currently does not support Ozone as the default file system.

The ofs file system implementation classpath is added to CDP services
          by default. But if an application is unable to instantiate the ofs file
          system class, add the ozone-filesystem-hadoop3.jar to the classpath.

export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/opt/ozone/share/ozonefs/lib/hadoop-ozone-filesystem-hadoop3-*.jar:$HADOOP_CLASSPATH


After setting up ofs, you can run HDFS dfs CLI commands such as the following
          on Ozone FS: (Assuming Ozone Service ID is
          “omservice1”)
hdfs dfs -ls ofs://omservice1/volume/bucket and hdfs dfs -mkdir ofs://omservice1/volume/bucket/users
Now, applications such as Hive and Spark can run on this file system after some basic
          configuration changes. noteAny keys that are created or deleted in the bucket using
            methods other than ofs are displayed as directories and files in
              o3fs.
