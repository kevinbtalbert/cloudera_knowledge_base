Tenant Commands

The following commands assume that the cluster is Kerberized and Ranger enabled.
noteIf you have enabled Ozone Manager HA on the Ozone service, then you must append
        --om-service-id= to the commands.
After setting up the S3 Multi-Tenancy feature, you can create and list tenants, assign
    users to tenants and also assign admin privileges, revoke admin access or even delete a tenant
    and so on.
Creating a tenant
To create a new tenant in the Ozone cluster, you must have cluster admin privileges defined
        in ozone.administrators configuration. When you create a tenant, a volume with the same name
        will be created. However, tenant name and volume name must be the same and tenant volume
        cannot be changed after the tenant is created.
To create a new tenant, execute the following command: ozone tenant [--verbose]
          create <TENANT_NAME>

Listing a tenant
To list all tenants in an Ozone cluster, execute the following command: ozone
          tenant list [--json]

Assiging a user to a tenant
Only an Ozone cluster administrator can assign the first user to a tenant. After the first
        user gets admin privileges, the first user can create and assign new users. A user can be
        assigned multiple tenants.
To assign a user to a tenant, execute the following command: ozone tenant
          [--verbose] user assign <USER_NAME> --tenant=<TENANT_NAME>

Assigning a user as a tenant admin
Only an Ozone cluster administrator can assign the first user to a tenant along with access
        key ID/secret pair. After the first user gets admin privileges, the first user can create
        and assign new users. A user can be assigned multiple tenants.
Both delegated and non-delegated tenant admins can assign and revoke tenant users from
        their tenant. However, only a delegated admin can assign and revoke the tenant admins from a
        tenant.
You can be a tenant admin in multiple tenants. However, you will be assigned different
        access IDs under each tenant.
To assign a user as a tenant admin (the current logged-in user must have Ozone cluster
        administrator or tenant delegated administrator privilege), execute the following command:
        ozone tenant user assignadmin <ACCESS_ID> [-d|--delegated]
    --tenant=<TENANT_NAME>

Listing users in a tenant
To list users in a tenant, execute the following command: ozone tenant user list
          [--json] <TENANT_NAME>

Getting tenant user info
To get tenant userâ€™s information, execute the following command: ozone tenant user
          info [--json] <USER_NAME>

Revoking a tenant admin
To revoke a tenant admin, execute the following command: ozone tenant [--verbose]
          user revokeadmin <ACCESS_ID>

Revoking user access from a tenant 
To revoke the user access from a tenant, execute the following command: 
ozone tenant [--verbose] user revoke <ACCESS_ID>

Deleting a tenant
The tenant must be empty and all admin user access revoked before deleting a tenant. This
        is a safety design to ensure that even if a tenant is deleted, the volume created for the
        tenant is intact. 
To delete a tenant, execute the following command: ozone tenant [--verbose] delete
          <TENANT_NAME>noteAfter a successful tenant delete command, the tenant
          information is removed from the Ozone Manager database and default tenant policies are
          removed from Ranger, but the volume itself along with its data is not removed. An admin
          can delete a volume manually using CLI.
