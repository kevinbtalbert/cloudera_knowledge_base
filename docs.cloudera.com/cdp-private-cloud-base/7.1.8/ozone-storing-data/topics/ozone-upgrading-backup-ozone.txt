Backing up Ozone
You must shutdown the cluster and take the backup of OM and SCM metadata. 

noteTo locate the hostnames required to backup OM and SCM, open the
                Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to the Ozone service, and click the Instances
                tab.


On each OM, copy the directories indicated by the
                        ozone.om.db.dirs and
                        ozone.om.ratis.storage.dir config keys to the backup
                    location by running the command cp -r <config_directory>
                        <backup_directory>.

On each SCM, copy the directories indicated by the
                        ozone.scm.db.dirs and
                        ozone.scm.ha.ratis.storage.dir config keys to the
                    backup location by running the command cp -r <config_directory>
                        <backup_directory>.

noteYou must take a backup of
                            ozone.scm.ha.ratis.storage.dir only if
                            ozone.scm.ratis.enable is set to
                            true.
