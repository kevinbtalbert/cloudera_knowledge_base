Upgrading Ozone overview
You must understand the overview of the upgrade feature. By upgrading the CDP Runtime
    parcels using Cloudera Manager, Ozone is also upgraded. This Ozone upgrade provides you with new
    features that are made available with the 7.1.8 release.
This feature helps you upgrade or downgrade Ozone. Ozone upgrade from Cloudera Manager is
      managed by upgrading the CDP parcels. Before upgrading the CDP parcels, as a pre-upgrade step,
      you must take a backup of OM metadata and SCM metadata. Ozone will be brought to a read-only
      state before the upgrade and this helps the OMs to synchronize before the upgrade. The upgrade
      is completely managed by Cloudera Manager. 
When the new version of Ozone starts, new features are not yet available. This allows you to
      downgrade to an older version. In case you wish to downgrade, then the older version of Ozone
      is restored. However, data written in the newer version is still readable by the older version
      of Ozone.
If you wish to finalize the upgrade and enable the new features, you must run the
        Finalize Upgrade command. This updates the metadata layout of Ozone
      services, persists the changes required for the new version, and enables the new features. 

noteAfter running the Finalize Upgrade command, it is not possible to
        downgrade.
