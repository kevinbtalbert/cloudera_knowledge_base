Upgrading Ozone parcels
You must upgrade the CDP Runtime parcels which in turn updates Ozone. To complete the
        upgrade of Ozone services, you must finalize the upgrade. This allows you to access the
        latest features available for this release.

Using Cloudera Manager, upgrade the CDP parcels. This upgrades Ozone as well.

Click the Finish Upgrade option. In this state you can
                    read and write to ensure that the Ozone cluster is working as expected. At this
                    stage, you can decide to finalize the upgrade or downgrade to the previous
                    version.

Click the Finalize Upgrade option. At this stage, the
                    cluster will be in the read-only state. After sufficient DataNodes finalize to
                    serve writes, the cluster will leave the read-only state. 

noteAfter running the Finalize Upgrade command, it is
                        not possible to downgrade.
