Using Ozone S3 Gateway to work with storage elements
Ozone provides S3 Gateway, a REST interface that is compatible with the Amazon S3 API. You can use S3 Gateway to work with the Ozone storage
    elements.
In addition, you can use the Amazon Web Services CLI to use S3 Gateway. 
After starting Ozone S3 Gateway, you can access it from the following link:
        http://localhost:9878noteFor the users or client applications that
        use S3 Gateway to access Ozone buckets on a secure cluster, Ozone provides the AWS access
        key ID and AWS secret key. See the Ozone security documentation for more
      information.

Configuration to expose buckets under non-default volumesOzone S3 Gateway allows access to all the buckets under the default             /s3v volume. To access the buckets under a non-default volume, you must         create a symbolic link to that bucket. REST endpoints supported on Ozone S3 GatewayIn addition to the GET service operation, Ozone S3 Gateway supports various bucket and object operations that the Amazon S3 API provides.Configuring Ozone to work as a pure object storeDepending on your requirement, you can configure Ozone to use the Amazon S3 APIs and         perform the various volume and bucket operations.Access Ozone S3 Gateway using the S3A filesystemIf you want to run Ozone S3 Gateway from the S3A filesystem, you must import the         required CA certificate into the default Java truststore location on all the client nodes         for running shell commands or jobs. This is a prerequisite when the S3 Gateway is configured         with TLS.Using the AWS CLI with Ozone S3 GatewayYou can use the Amazon Web Services (AWS) command-line interface (CLI) to interact         with S3 Gateway and work with various Ozone storage elements.
