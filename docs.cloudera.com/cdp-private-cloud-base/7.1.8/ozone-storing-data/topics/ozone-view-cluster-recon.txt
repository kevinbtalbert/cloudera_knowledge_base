Elements of the Recon web user interface
The Recon web user interface displays information about the Ozone cluster on the
        following pages: Overview, DataNodes, and Pipelines. In addition, a separate page displays
        information about any missing storage containers. 
Overview pageThe Overview page displays information about different elements on the Ozone cluster         in the form of a consolidated dashboard. This page loads by default when you launch the         Recon web user interface. DataNodes pageThe DataNodes page displays information about the state of the DataNodes in a tabular         format. You can load this page either by clicking the DataNodes tab on the left pane or the         DataNodes card on the Overview page.Pipelines pageThe Pipelines page displays information about active pipelines including their IDs,         the corresponding replication factors and the associated DataNodes. The page does not         display any inactive pipelines.Missing Containers pageThere can be situations when a storage container or its replicas are not reported in         any of the DataNode reports to the SCM. Such containers are flagged as missing containers to         Recon. Ozone clients cannot read any blocks that are present in a missing container.
