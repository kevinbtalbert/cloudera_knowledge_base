Configuration options for Spark to work with Ozone File System (ofs)
After setting up ofs, you can make configuration updates specific to
        components such as Spark to ensure that they work with Ozone.
To run Spark jobs with ofs on a secure Kerberos-enabled cluster, ensure
            that you assign a valid URI by setting the value of the Spark Client Advanced
                Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) property for the
                spark.conf or the spark-defaults.conf file through
            the Cloudera Manager web UI.
