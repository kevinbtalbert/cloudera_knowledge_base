Working with Ozone File System (o3fs)
The Ozone File System (o3fs) is a Hadoop-compatible file system.
    Applications such as Hive, Spark, YARN, and MapReduce run natively on o3fs
    without any modifications.
The Ozone File System resides on a bucket in the Ozone cluster. All the files created through
        o3fs are stored as keys in that bucket. Any keys created in the particular
      bucket without using the file system commands are shown as files or directories on
        o3fs.
noteo3fs is deprecated. It is recommended to use ofs instead. See Working with Ozone File System (ofs).
