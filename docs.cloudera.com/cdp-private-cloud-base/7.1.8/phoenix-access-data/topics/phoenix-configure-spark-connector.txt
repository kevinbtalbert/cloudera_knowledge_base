Configuring Phoenix-Spark connector using Cloudera Manager when both are on same
        cluster
Learn how to configure the Phoenix-Spark connector when both the Phoenix and Spark
        are on the same cluster.
Go to the Spark or Spark3 service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Ensure that the HBase service is selected in Spark
                        Service as a dependency.

Select Scope > Gateway.

Select Category > Advanced.

Locate the Spark Client Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                        for spark-conf/spark-defaults.conf property or search for it by
                    typing its name in the Search box.

Add the following properties to ensure that all required Phoenix and HBase
                    platform dependencies are available on the classpath for the Spark executors and
                    drivers:

Phoenix client JARs for Spark2:
spark.executor.extraClassPath=/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/phoenix_connectors/phoenix5-spark-shaded.jar
spark.driver.extraClassPath=/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/phoenix_connectors/phoenix5-spark-shaded.jar
If you are using the Phoenix Spark3 pursers, consider the following client
                        JARs: 
spark.executor.extraClassPath=/opt/cloudera/parcels/SPARK3/lib/spark3/phoenix_connectors/phoenix5-spark3-shaded.jar
spark.driver.extraClassPath=/opt/cloudera/parcels/SPARK3/lib/spark3/phoenix_connectors/phoenix5-spark3-shaded.jar


Enter a Reason for change, and then click Save Changes
                    to commit the changes.

Restart the role and service when Cloudera Manager prompts you to
                    restart.


Build a Spark or Spark3 application using the dependencies that you provide when
                    you run your application. If you follow the previous instructions, Cloudera
                    Manager automatically configures the connector. If you have not, add the
                    necessary parameters to the command line when running the
                        spark-submit or spark3-submit command.
                    spark-shell --conf spark.executor.extraClassPath=/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/phoenix_connectors/phoenix5-spark-shaded.jar --conf spark.driver.extraClassPath=/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/phoenix_connectors/phoenix5-spark-shaded.jar
Consider the following example while using a Spark3
                    application.spark3-shell --conf spark.executor.extraClassPath=/opt/cloudera/parcels/SPARK3/lib/spark3/hbase_connectors/lib/hbase-spark3-*shaded.jar --conf spark.driver.extraClassPath=/opt/cloudera/parcels/SPARK3/lib/spark3/hbase_connectors/lib/hbase-spark3-shaded.jar
