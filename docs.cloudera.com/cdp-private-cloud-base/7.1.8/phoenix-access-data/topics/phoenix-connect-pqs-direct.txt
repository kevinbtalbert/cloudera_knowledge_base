Connect to Phoenix Query Server
You can connect to Phoenix Query Server (PQS) using the JDBC thin client without
        using a gateway such as Apache Knox. You must use the JDBC URL syntax to form the URL and
        connect to PQS.

Ensure that you have access to Apache Phoenix and Apache HBase, and you have the
                required permissions configured in Ranger to connect to PQS.
Ensure that you have safely noted down your Kerberos principal and keytab information
                used to connect to PQS.


You can use the JDBC URL syntax to form the URL and connect to PQS.


To connect to the PQS directly, you must use the JDBC URL syntax as shown here:
                        jdbc:phoenix:thin:[key=value[;key=value...]]

You must provide the correct URL, serialization, and authentication
                        key-values to interact with the Phoenix Query Server. For more information
                        about optional parameters, see Client Reference.



jdbc:phoenix:thin:url=http://localhost:8765;serialization=PROTOBUF; authentication=SPNEGO;
principal=[***Prinicpal@EXAMPLE.com***];keytab=[***PATH TO THE KEYTAB FILE***]
