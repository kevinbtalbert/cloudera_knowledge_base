Connect to Phoenix Query Server through Apache Knox
You can connect to Phoenix Query Server (PQS) using the JDBC thin client through the
        Apache Knox gateway. Apache Knox requires your thin client connection to be over HTTPS. 

Ensure that you have access to Apache Phoenix and Apache HBase, and you have the
                required permissions configured in Ranger to connect to PQS.


Get the PQS Knox endpoint to connect to PQS from the CDP Data Hub user
                    interface. Go to Data Hub cluster  >  Endpoints >  Cloudera Manager Info  >  Endpoints >  Phoenix Query Server.






Use the JDBC URL in the following sytax to connect to PQS through the Apache
                    Knox gateway:

jdbc:phoenix:thin:url=https://[***KNOX
                            ENDPOINT***]:[***PORT***]/[***CLUSTER
                            NAME***]/cdp-proxy-api/avatica/;serialization=PROTOBUF;authentication=BASIC;avatica_user=[***WORKLOAD
                            USERNAME*];avatica_password=[***WORKLOAD
                            PASSWORD***];truststore=[***PATH TO THE KNOX
                            TRUSTSTORE .jks
                            FILE***];truststore_password=[***TRUSTSTORE
                            PASSWORD***]
The standard Oracle Java JDK distribution includes a default
                        truststore (cacerts) that contains root certificates for many well-known
                        CAs, including Symantec. Rather than using the default truststore, Cloudera
                        recommends using the alternative truststore, jssecacerts. The alternative
                        truststore is created by copying cacerts to that filename (jssecacerts).
                        Certificates can be added to this truststore when needed for additional
                        roles or services. This alternative truststore is loaded by Hadoop daemons
                        at startup. Password (if there is one for the truststore) stored in a
                        plaintext file readable by all (OS filesystem permissions set to 0440). For
                        more information about truststores, see Understanding Keystores and
                                Truststores.
noteThe user name and password are for the Apache Knox gateway, and the
                        authentication must always be set to BASIC. The
                            truststore and truststore_password 
                        the Knox public certificate.
