Connecting to Apache Phoenix Query Server using the JDBC client
You can interact with Apache Phoenix using your client and Apache Phoenix Query
        Server (PQS). 
PQS is automatically configured when you create an Operational Database Data
            Hub cluster. There are two ways in which you can use the thin client to interact with
                Phoenix:
Connect to PQS directly
Connect to PQS using the Apache Knox gateway
