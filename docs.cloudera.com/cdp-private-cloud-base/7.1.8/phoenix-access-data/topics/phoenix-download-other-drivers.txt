Using non-JDBC drivers with Apache PhoenixCloudera Docs
Using non-JDBC drivers with Apache Phoenix
Based on your application development requirements, you can obtain one of the other
        non-JDBC drivers.
The list of supported programming languages to access data stored in your operational
            database:

Apache Groovy
C
C++
Go
Java
Jython
Python
PHP
Scala

You can also use REST for API support.
The following drivers are supported:
ODBC driver
Use the Database Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) interface to access the
            operational database. The ODBC driver is provided by Cloudera as an additional download,
            but you can also use ODBC drivers from third-party providers.
You can download the Phoenix ODBC Driver from here: Phoenix ODBC Connector for CDP Operational Database.
Note
You must have a Cloudera Enterprise Support Subscription to download the ODBC
            driver.
Python driver for Phoenix
Download the Python Driver for Apache Phoenix from the Apache Phoenix website.
            For more information, see Python Driver for Phoenix.
Other drivers that are not supported by Cloudera
You can use other non-JDBC Drivers for Phoenix as add-ons, but they are not
            supported by Cloudera. You can find compatible client drivers by searching on the web
            for avatica and the name of an application programming language that you want to use.
            For example, Apache Phoenix/Avatica SQL driver for Go language. For more information and
            links to driver download, see Apache Calcite Avatica.
You can use the Phoenix ODBC driver and the C# client library to develop .Net
            applications that interact with Phoenix Query Server.
The applications that you develop will interact with the Phoenix Query Server
            using the Avatica API and Google Protocol Buffers serialization format.
