Mapping Apache Phoenix schemas to Apache HBase namespaces
You can map a Apache Phoenix schema to an Apache HBase namespace to gain multitenancy
        features in Apache Phoenix.
importantYou must configure this feature only in a CDP Private Cloud Base deployment. This feature is configured
            automatically in a CDP Public Cloud deployment.
Apache HBase namespaces are a logical grouping of tables, similar to a database
            in a relational database system. Apache HBase, the underlying storage engine for Apache
            Phoenix, has namespaces to support multi-tenancy features. Multitenancy helps an Apache
            HBase user or administrator to perform access control and quota management tasks.
            Namespaces enable tighter control of where a particular data set is stored on the Apache
            HBase RegionsServers. 

Enable namespace mappingYou can enable namespace mapping by configuring a set of properties using Cloudera         Manager.
