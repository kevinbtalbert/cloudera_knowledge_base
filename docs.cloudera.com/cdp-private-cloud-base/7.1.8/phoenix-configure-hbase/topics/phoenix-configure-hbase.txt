Configure HBase for use with Phoenix
Before you start using Phoenix with HBase, you must configure HBase to recognize
        Phoenix operations.

importantYou must configure HBase for use with Phoenix only for the CDP Private Cloud Base deployments. This configuration is done
                automatically for CDP Public Cloud deployments.
 Configure the following HBase properties using Cloudera Manager:


Go to the HBase service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select Scope > RegionServer.

Select Category > Advanced.

Locate WAL Codec class property or search for
                        hbase.regionserver.wal.codec.
Click View as XML and add the following property value:
                    org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.wal.IndexedWALEditCodec

Set the HBase Service Advanced Configuration Snippet and
                        HBase Client Advanced Configuration Snippet
                    properties to enable user-defined functions. Locate the property or search for
                        HBase Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        hbase-site.xml and HBase Client Advanced Configuration
                        Snippet (Safety Valve) for hbase-site.xml.
Add the following property value:
                    <property>
  <name>phoenix.functions.allowUserDefinedFunctions</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>

Enter a Reason for change, and then click
                        Save Changes to commit the changes.

Restart the role and service when Cloudera Manager prompts you to
                    restart.
