Create a Streams Cluster on CDP Private Cloud Base
Cloudera's streaming components empower enterprises to handle some of the most complex
  and sophisticated streaming use cases. You can evaluate the streaming components in CDP Private Cloud Base for up to 60 days. This document walks you through the
  process of installing the trial software and creating a streams cluster for your proof-of-concept
  (POC) or sandbox environment. After you evaluate CDP Private Cloud Base, you
  can contact Cloudera to request a license for your production environment.
The CDP Private Cloud Base streaming components provide advanced
   messaging, real-time processing, and analytics on real-time streaming data. The components are:
    
Cruise Control
Apache Kafka
Schema Registry
Streams Messaging Manager (SMM)
Streams Replication Manager

This document guides you through the steps to create a three-node cluster with all the
   streaming components with the exception of Streams Replication Manager which you do not need for
   a trial evaluation. You will need Streams Replication Manager for production-level performance
   and availability.
The following diagram shows the layout of the streaming components across the three-node
   cluster: 

note

Do not install the trial software on a NAS device. Use your local disk. 
You can use the trial version of CDP Private Cloud Base for up to 60
      days.
