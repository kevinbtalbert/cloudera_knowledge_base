Getting Started on your Streams Cluster
Now that you have a streams cluster, you can evaluate the streaming services on CDP
  Private Cloud Base. To get started, you can create a Kafka topic, write events into it, and then
  read those events. Then use the SMM UI to monitor your cluster and view topic details.
Create a Kafka Topic to Store your EventsYou must create a Kafka topic to store the events that you plan to stream. You can         create a topic from the command line or the from the SMM UI.Write a few Events into the TopicAfter you create a topic, populate the topic with one or more events that you want to         stream.Read the EventsConsumers are client applications that subscribe to read and process events. You can         simulate the subscription process by running the console consumer client to read the events         you just created.Monitor your Cluster from the SMM UIUse the SMM UI to monitor your cluster. You can quickly check the number of         producers, brokers, topics, and consumer groups on the Overview tab. From the Topics tab,         you can view topic details such as the producers and consumers that are connected to the         topic or the number of events that are written into the topic in a certain time         frame.
