Ranger API Overview
The Ranger REST API provides a framework to enable, monitor and manage comprehensive
  data security across the CDP platform.
Apache Ranger currently provides a centralized security administration,
   fine grain access control and detailed auditing for user access within Apache Hadoop, Apache
   Hive, Apache HBase and other Apache components. The Ranger REST API documentation is served on
   the same host and port as the Ranger Admin Web UI, and does not require an extra process or extra
   configuration. The API supports HTTP Basic Authentication, accepting the same users and
   credentials as the Ranger Admin Web UI. For more information about REST APIs available for
   collecting Ranger metrics, see:
