Snapshot policies in Replication Manager 
You can create snapshot policies in Replication Manager that define the directories or
    tables to be snapshotted, the intervals at which snapshots should be taken, and the number of
    snapshots that should be kept for each snapshot interval. 
For example, you can create a snapshot policy that takes daily and
      weekly snapshots, and specify that seven daily snapshots and five weekly snapshots should be
      maintained.
