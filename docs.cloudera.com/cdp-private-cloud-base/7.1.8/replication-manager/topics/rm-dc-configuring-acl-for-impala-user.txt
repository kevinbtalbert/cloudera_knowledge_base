Configure file access control lists for Impala user
Before you create Hive ACID table replication policies, you need to configure the
        file access control lists for an Impala user to access the cmroot
        directory based on whether the source cluster has one encryption zone, multiple encryption
        zones, or no encryption zone.
One encryption zone or no encryption zone
When the source cluster has only one encryption zone or no encryption zone,
                you can run the following commands to provide the Impala user access to
                    cmroot directory:
hdfs dfs -setfacl -m default:group:hive:rwx [***CMROOT PATH IN
                            hive.repl.cmrootdir***]
hdfs dfs -setfacl -m user:impala:rwx [***CMROOT PATH IN
                            hive.repl.cmrootdir***]


Multiple encryption zones
When there are multiple encryption zones in the source cluster, you must
                manually configure the file access control lists for Impala users for each
                encryption zone. In each encryption zone, a cmroot directory is
                available in the root of the encryption zone. 
Run the following commands to set the file access control list for the user
                and group:
hdfs dfs -setfacl -m default:group:hive:rwx [***ENCRYPTION ZONE
                            PATH or VALUE OF hive.repl.cm.encryptionzone.rootdir***]
hdfs dfs -setfacl -m user:impala:rwx [***ENCRYPTION ZONE PATH or
                            VALUE OF hive.repl.cm.encryptionzone.rootdir***]

noteThe default value of hive.repl.cm.encryptionzone.rootdir is
                    .cmroot.
For example, if the first encryption zone is
                    /user/hive/encr1 and the other encryption zone is
                    /user/hive/encr2, you must provide permissions for both the
                encryption zones. To provide the required permissions, perform the following
                    steps:
Run the following commands to provide access permissions to the
                            cmroot directory in the first encryption
                        zone:hdfs dfs -setfacl -m default:group:hive:rwx /user/hive/encr1/.cmroot
hdfs dfs -setfacl -m user:impala:rwx /user/hive/encr1/.cmroot
Run the following commands to provide access permissions to the
                            cmroot directory in the second encryption
                        zone:hdfs dfs -setfacl -m default:group:hive:rwx /user/hive/encr2/.cmroot
hdfs dfs -setfacl -m user:impala:rwx /user/hive/encr2/.cmroot
