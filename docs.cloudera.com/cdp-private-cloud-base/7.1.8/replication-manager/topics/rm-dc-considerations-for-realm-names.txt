Considerations for realm names to use for replication
You must consider the realm names if the source and destination clusters each use
    Kerberos for authentication before you create a replication policy.
Use one of the following configurations to prevent conflicts during replication job runs:


If the clusters do not use the same KDC (Kerberos Key Distribution Center), Cloudera
          recommends that you use different realm names for each cluster. Additionally, if you are
          replicating across clusters in two different realms, see the steps for Prepare Kerberos authentication-enabled clusters for replication to setup trust between those
          clusters.
You can use the same realm name if the clusters use the same KDC or different KDCs that
          are part of a unified realm, for example where one KDC is the master and the other is a
          secondary KDC.noteIf you have multiple clusters that are used to
            segregate production and non-production environments, this configuration could result in
            principals that have equal permissions in both environments. Make sure that permissions
            are set appropriately for each type of environment. 


importantIf the source and destination clusters are in the same realm but do not
      use the same KDC or the KDCs are not part of a unified realm, the replication job will fail.
