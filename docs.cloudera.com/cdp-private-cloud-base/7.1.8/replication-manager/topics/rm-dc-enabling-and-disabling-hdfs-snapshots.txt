Enabling and disabling HDFS snapshots
For snapshots to be created, HDFS directories must be enabled for snapshots. You cannot
    specify a directory as part of a snapshot policy unless it has been enabled for
    snapshots.Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
                    Administrator (also provided by Full
                    Administrator).
Go to the Cloudera Manager > HDFS service > File Browser tab.
Go to the directory you want to enable for snapshots.
Click the drop-down menu next to the full file path and select
                        Enable Snapshots.

noteOnce you enable snapshots for a directory, you
                        cannot enable snapshots on any of its subdirectories. Snapshots can be taken
                        only on directories that have snapshots enabled.


Click Disable Snapshots to disable snapshots for a
                    directory that has snapshots enabled. 

importantIf snapshots of the directory
                        exist, they must be deleted before snapshots can be disabled.
