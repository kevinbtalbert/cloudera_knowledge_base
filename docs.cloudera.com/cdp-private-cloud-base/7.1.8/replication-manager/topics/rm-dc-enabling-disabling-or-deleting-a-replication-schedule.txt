Managing replication policies
When you create a new replication policy, it is automatically enabled. If you disable a
    replication policy, it can be re-enabled at a later time.  You can enable, disable, or delete
    one or more replication policies at a time.

Go to the Cloudera Manager > Replication > Replication Policies page.

Select Actions > Disable to disable an active replication policy.

Select Actions > Enable to enable a disabled replication policy. 

Select Actions > Delete to delete a replication policy.
