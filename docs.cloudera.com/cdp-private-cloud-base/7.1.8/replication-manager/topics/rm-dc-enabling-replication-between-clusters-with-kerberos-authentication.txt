Enabling replication between clusters with Kerberos authentication
To enable replication between clusters, additional steps are required to ensure that
    the source and destination clusters can communicate.
Minimum Required Role: Cluster Administrator (also provided by Full
      Administrator) 
importantReplication Manager works with clusters in different Kerberos realms even
      without a Kerberos realm trust relationship. The Cloudera Manager configuration properties
        Trusted Kerberos Realms and Kerberos Trusted
        Realms are used for Cloudera Manager and CDH configuration, and are not related
      to Kerberos realm trust relationships.If you are using standalone DistCp between clusters
        in different Kerberos realms, you must configure a realm trust. 

Required ports in Kerberos authentication-enabled clusters for replicationWhen using Replication Manager with Kerberos authentication-enabled clusters, ensure     that the port used for Kerberos KDC Server and KRB5 services are open to all hosts on the     destination cluster. By default, this is port 88.Considerations for realm names to use for replicationYou must consider the realm names if the source and destination clusters each use     Kerberos for authentication before you create a replication policy.Prepare Kerberos authentication-enabled clusters for replicationBefore you create replication policies between clusters that use Kerberos     authentication, you must prepare the source and destination clusters.Kerberos connectivity testAs part of  the Test Connectivity, Cloudera Manager tests for properly configured     Kerberos authentication on the source and destination clusters that run the replication. Test     Connectivity runs automatically when you add a peer for replication, or you can manually     initiate Test Connectivity from the Actions menu.
