HDFS replication policies
HDFS replication policies enable you to copy (replicate) your HDFS data from one HDFS
    service to another and synchronize the data set on the destination service with the data set on
    the source service. The destination service must be managed by the Cloudera Manager Server where
    the replication is being set up, and the source service can be managed by that same server or by
    a peer Cloudera Manager Server. You can also replicate HDFS data within a cluster by specifying
    different source and destination directories.
Remote Replication Manager automatically copies HDFS metadata to the
      destination cluster as it copies files. HDFS metadata need only be backed up locally. 
note

Replication Manager requires a valid license. To understand more about Cloudera license
          requirements, see Managing Licenses.
Minimum required role - Replication Administrator or Full
          Administrator.
Before you create replication policies, ensure that the source cluster and target
          cluster are supported by Replication Manager. For information about supported clusters and
          supported replication scenarios by Replication Manager, see Support matrix for Replication Manager on CDP Private Cloud Base.



HDFS replication policy considerationsBefore you create an HDFS replication policy, you must understand how source data is         affected when you add or delete source data during replication, the network latency issues,         the performance and scalability limitations, the snapshot diff-based replication guidelines,         and how to bypass Sentry ACLs during replication.Creating HDFS replication policy to replicate HDFS dataYou must set up your clusters before you create an HDFS replication policy.View HDFS replication policy detailsThe Replications Policies page displays a row of information about each replication     policy which includes recent messages about the last replication job run. View historical details for an HDFS replication policyYou can view the historical details about the replication jobs on the Replication     History page.Monitoring the performance of HDFS replication policiesYou can monitor the progress of an HDFS replication policy using the performance data     that you can download as a CSV file from the Cloudera Manager Admin console.
