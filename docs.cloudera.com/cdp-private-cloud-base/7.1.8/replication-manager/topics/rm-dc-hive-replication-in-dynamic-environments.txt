Accommodate HMS changes for Hive replication policies
To use Replication Manager for Hive replication in environments where the Hive
    Metastore (HMS) changes often, such as when a database or table gets created or deleted, you
    must configure additional properties to accommodate the changes.

Go to the Cloudera Manager > Clusters > HDFS Service > Configuration tab.

Search for the HDFS Client Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
            hdfs-site.xml property on the source cluster.

Add the following key-value pairs:


replication.hive.ignoreDatabaseNotFound and
                true
replication.hive.ignoreTableNotFound and
                true



Click Save Changes.

Restart the HDFS service.
