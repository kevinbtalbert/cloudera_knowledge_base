Specifying hosts to improve Hive replication policy performance
When your cluster has Hive clients installed on hosts with limited resources and the
    Hive/Impala replication policies use these hosts to run commands for the replication, the
    replication job performance might degrade. To improve the replication job performance, you can
    specify the hosts to use during replication so that the lower-resource hosts are not
    used.

Go to the Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Hive service > Configuration tab.

Locate the Hive Replication Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet
            (Safety Valve) property. 

Add the HOST_WHITELIST property and enter a comma-separated list
          of hostnames to use for Hive/Impala replication policies.
For example,
          HOST_WHITELIST=host-1.mycompany.com,host-2.mycompany.com.

Click Save Changes.
