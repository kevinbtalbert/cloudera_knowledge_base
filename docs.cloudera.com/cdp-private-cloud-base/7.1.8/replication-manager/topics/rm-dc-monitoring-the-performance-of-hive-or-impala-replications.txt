Monitoring the performance of Hive/Impala replication policies
You can monitor the progress of a Hive/Impala replication policy using performance data
    that you download as a CSV file from Replication Manager. This file contains information about the tables and partitions being replicated, the average
        throughput, and other details that can help diagnose performance issues during Hive/Impala
        replications. You can view this performance data for running Hive/Impala replication jobs
        and for completed jobs. The performance data is collected every two minutes. Therefore, no
        data is available during the initial execution of a replication job because not enough
        samples are available to estimate throughput and other reported data.

To view the performance data for a running Hive/Impala replication policy,
          perform the following steps:


Go to the Cloudera Manager > Replication > Replication Policies page.


Locate and select the replication policy. Click Actions > Show History.


Click Download CSV for the HDFS Replication
                Report field, and choose one of the following options to download the
              following performance reports:


Performance file contains a summary report about the
                  performance of the replication job which includes the last performance sample for
                  each mapper working on the replication job. 
Full Performance file contains the complete performance
                  report about the job which includes all the samples taken for all mappers during
                  the full run of the replication job. 




Open the file in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.
The following columns appear in the CSV file:
Timestamp when the performance data was collected.
Host where the YARN or MapReduce job was running.
Number of Bytes Copied for the file currently being
                  copied.
Time Elapsed (ms) for the copy operation of the file
                  currently being copied.
Number of Files Copied.
Avg Throughput (KB/s) since the start of the file
                  currently being copied in kilobytes per second.
File size of the Last File (bytes).
 Time taken to copy Last File Time (ms).
Last file throughput (KB/s) that is being copied in
                  kilobytes per second.



Download the following CSV reports to view more information about the replication
              job:


Listing report contains the list of files and directories
                  copied during the replication job.
Status report contains the full status report of the
                  files where the replication status is shown as:
ERROR occurred during replication, therefore the file
                      was not copied.
DELETED for deleted files.
SKIPPED for up-to-date files that were not
                      replicated.

Error Status Only report contains the status report of
                  all copied files with errors. The file lists the status, path, and message for the
                  copied files with errors.
Deleted Status Only report contains the status report of
                  all deleted files. The file lists the status, path, and message for the databases
                  and tables that were deleted.
Skipped Status Only report contains the status report of
                  all skipped files. The file lists the status, path, and message for the databases
                  and tables that were skipped.





To view the performance data for a completed Hive/Impala replication policy,
          perform the following steps:


Go to the Cloudera Manager > Replication > Replication Policies page. 


Locate and select the replication policy. Click Actions > Show History.


Click Download CSV for the Hive External Table
                Replication Report field, and choose one of the following options to
              download the following performance reports in CSV format:


Results file contains a listing of replicated
                  tables.
Performance file contains a summary report about the
                  performance of the replication job.

noteThe option to download the HDFS replication reports might
                not appear if the HDFS phase of the replication skipped all the HDFS files because
                they have not changed, or if the Advanced > Replicate HDFS Files option is not selected during Hive/Impala replication  policy
                creation.



Open the file in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.
The following columns appear in the CSV file:
Timestamp when the performance data was collected.
Host where the YARN or MapReduce job was running.
DbName or database name.
TableName or table name.
TotalElapsedTimeSecs is the number of seconds elapsed
                  from the start of the copy operation.
TotalTableCount is the total number of tables to be
                  copied. The value of the column shows -1 for replications where
                  Cloudera Manager cannot determine the number of tables being changed. 
TotalPartitionCount is the total number of partitions to
                  be copied. If the source cluster is running Cloudera Manager 5.9 or lower, this
                  column shows -1  because older releases do not report this
                  information. 
DbCount is the current number of databases copied.
DbErrorCount is the number of failed database copy
                  operations.
TableCount is the total number of tables for all
                  databases copied so far.
CurrentTableCount is the total number of tables copied
                  for the current database.
TableErrorCount is the total number of failed table copy
                  operations.
PartitionCount is the total number of partitions copied
                  so far for all tables.
CurrPartitionCount is the total number of partitions
                  copied for the current table.
PartitionSkippedCount is the number of partitions skipped
                  because they were copied in the previous run of the replication job.
IndexCount is the total number of index files copied for
                  all databases.
CurrIndexCount is the total number of index files copied
                  for the current database.
IndexSkippedCount is the number of index files skipped
                  because they were not altered. Due to a bug in Hive, this value is always
                  zero.
HiveFunctionCount  is the number of Hive functions
                  copied.
ImpalaObjectCount is the number of Impala objects
                  copied.




Note the following limitations and
      known issues about the replication reports:
If you click the CSV download too soon after the replication job starts, Cloudera
          Manager returns an empty file or a CSV file that has columns headers only and a message to
          try later when performance data has actually been collected.
If you employ a proxy user with the form user@domain,
          performance data is not available through the links.
If the replication job only replicates small files that can be transferred in less than
          a few minutes, no performance statistics are collected.
If you specify the Dynamic Replication Strategy during replication policy
          creation, statistics regarding the last file transferred by a MapReduce job hide previous
          transfers performed by that MapReduce job.
Only the last trace per MapReduce job is reported in the CSV file.
