Improve network latency during replication job run
High latency among clusters can cause replication jobs to run more slowly, but does not
    cause them to fail.
For best performance, latency between the source cluster NameNode and the destination
      cluster NameNode should be less than 80 milliseconds. You can test latency using the Linux
        ping command. Cloudera has successfully tested replications with latency of
      up to 360 milliseconds. As latency increases, replication performance degrades.
