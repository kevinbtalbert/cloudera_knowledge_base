Orphaned snapshots
When a snapshot policy includes a limit on the number of snapshots to keep, Cloudera
    Manager checks the total number of stored snapshots each time a new snapshot is added, and
    automatically deletes the oldest existing snapshot if necessary. 
When a snapshot policy is edited or deleted, files, directories, or tables that were
      removed from the policy may leave "orphaned" snapshots behind that are not deleted
      automatically because they are no longer associated with a current snapshot policy. Cloudera
      Manager never selects these snapshots for automatic deletion because selection for deletion
      only occurs when the policy creates a new snapshot containing those files, directories,
      or tables.
You can delete snapshots manually through Cloudera Manager or by
        creating a command-line script that uses the HDFS or HBase snapshot
        commands. Orphaned snapshots can be hard to locate for manual deletion.
        Snapshot policies automatically receive the prefix
          cm-auto followed by a globally unique identifier
        (GUID). You can locate all snapshots for a specific policy by searching
        for t the prefix cm-auto-guid that is unique to
        that policy. 
To avoid orphaned snapshots, delete snapshots before editing or
        deleting the associated snapshot policy, or record the identifying name
        for the snapshots you want to delete. This prefix is displayed in the
        summary of the policy in the policy list and appears in the delete
        dialog box. Recording the snapshot names, including the associated
        policy prefix, is necessary because the prefix associated with a policy
        cannot be determined after the policy has been deleted, and snapshot
        names do not contain recognizable references to snapshot policies.
