Performance and scalability limitations to consider for replication policies
Before you create an HDFS replication policy, you must consider a few performance and
    scalability limitations.
The performance and scalability limitations include:
Maximum number of files for a single replication job is 100 million.
Maximum number of files for a replication policy that runs more frequently than once in
          8 hours is 10 million.
Throughput of the replication job depends on the absolute read and write throughput of
          the source and destination clusters. 
Regular rebalancing of your HDFS clusters is required for efficient operation of
          replications. 

noteCloudera Manager provides downloadable data that you can use to diagnose HDFS
      replication performance.
