Preparing clusters to replicate Ozone dataCloudera Docs
Preparing clusters to replicate Ozone data
You must prepare the clusters, create buckets in the target cluster, and configure
        additional configurations for OBS bucket replication before you create Ozone replication
        policies in CDP Private Cloud Base Replication Manager.
Before you create Ozone replication policies, ensure that
            the following prerequisites are complete:

Have you added the source cluster as a peer to the target cluster? 
For information about adding a source cluster as a peer, see Adding cluster as a
                        peer.

Have you created the bucket on the target cluster of the same type as the
                    bucket on the source cluster from which the replication policy replicates
                    data?

tipCreate a volume and then the bucket. For
                        more information, see Managing storage elements using
                            CLI..
The following sample commands create a volume and an FSO
                        bucket:ozone sh volume create o3://ozone1/vol1
ozone sh bucket create o3://ozone1/vol1/buck1 --layout FILE_SYSTEM_OPTIMIZED


Are the additional configurations required for OBS bucket replication
                    configured when the source bucket is an OBS bucket? 
For more information, see Configuring properties for OBS bucket replication using Ozone replication policies.

Are the source and target clusters SSL-enabled? If so, ensure that the SSL/TLS
                    certificate exchange between two Cloudera Manager instances that manage source
                    and target clusters respectively is configured. 
For more information, see Configuring SSL/TLS certificate exchange between two Cloudera Manager instances.

Is Kerberos enabled on both the clusters? If so, perform the following
                    steps:


Configure a user with permissions to access HDFS and Ozone.


Run the sudo usermod -a -G om bdr command to add the
                            group name of the user (For example, the group name
                                bdr) to the Ozone service configuration in
                            target Cloudera Manager:



importantIf Kerberos is enabled on both the
                        clusters, you must run the kinit -kt
                            /[***path***]/[***to***]/om.keytab om command (the absolute
                        path to the Ozone service's keytab) before you run any Ozone
                        commands.


Is Ranger enabled on the source cluster? If so, you must:


complete the following steps on the Ranger UI from source Cloudera
                            Manager:


Log into Ranger UI from source Cloudera Manager.
Click cm_ozone on the
                                        Service Manager page.
Add the user (that you configured in previous step) to
                                    the all - volume, bucket, key policy
                                    name, and then set the groups for this policy as public.




complete the following steps for the kms-site.xml
                            file for the Ranger_KMS service on the source and target clusters:


Locate and open the kms-site.xml
                                    file on the source Cloudera Manager.
Add the following key-value pairs:
hadoop.kms.proxyuser.om.hosts=*
hadoop.kms.proxyuser.om.groups=*
hadoop.kms.proxyuser.om.users=*


Save the file.


Restart the Ranger_KMS service for the changes to
                                        take effect.

Locate and open the kms-site.xml
                                    file on the target Cloudera Manager.
Add the following key-value pairs:
hadoop.kms.proxyuser.om.hosts=*
hadoop.kms.proxyuser.om.groups=*
hadoop.kms.proxyuser.om.users=*


Save the file.


Restart the Ranger_KMS service for the changes to
                                        take effect.







Configuring properties for OBS bucket replication using Ozone replication policiesBefore you replicate OBS buckets, you must configure additional properties that         assist Ozone replication policies in CDP Private Cloud Base Replication Manager to replicate         data in OBS buckets.Parent topic: Ozone replication policies
