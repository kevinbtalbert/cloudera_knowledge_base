Configuring heap size to replicate large directories using replication policies
Before you replicate the data in directories that has thousands of files and
    subdirectories, increase the heap size in the hadoop-env.sh
    file.

Go to the destination Cloudera Manager > HDFS service > Configuration tab.

Locate the HDFS Replication Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet
            (Safety Valve) for hadoop-env.sh property.

Enter the
            HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS=-Xmx[***required_heap_size***]
          key-value pair. 
For example, if you enter
            HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS=-Xmx1g, the heap size is set to 1
          GB. Adjust the heap size depending on the number of files and directories being
          replicated. 

Click Save Changes.

Restart the HDFS service.
