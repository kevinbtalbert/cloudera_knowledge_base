Replication of encrypted data
HDFS supports encryption of data at rest (including data accessed through Hive). This
    topic describes how replication works within and between encryption zones and how to configure
    replication to avoid failures due to encryption. 
Encrypting data in transit between clustersA source directory and destination directory may or may not be in an encryption zone.     If the destination directory is in an encryption zone, the data on the destination directory is     encrypted. If the destination directory is not in an encryption zone, the data on that directory     is not encrypted, even if the source directory is in an encryption zone. Encryption zones are     not supported in CDH versions 5.1 or lower.Security considerations for encrypted data during replicationThe user you specify in the Run As Username field during replication policy creation     requires full access to both the key and the data directories being replicated. This is not a     recommended best practice for KMS management. If you change permissions in the KMS to enable     this requirement, you could accidentally provide access for this user to data in other     encryption zones using the same key. If a user is not specified in the Run As Username field,     the replication runs as the default user, hdfs.Parent topic: Prepare to replicate using replication policies
