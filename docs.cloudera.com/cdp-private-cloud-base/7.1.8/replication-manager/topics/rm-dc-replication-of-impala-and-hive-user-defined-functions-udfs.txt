Replication of Impala and Hive User Defined Functions
        (UDFs)
By default, for clusters where the version of CDH is 5.7 or higher, Impala and Hive
    UDFs are persisted in the Hive Metastore and are replicated automatically as part of Hive/Impala
    replication.
After a replication job is complete, you can see the number of Impala and Hive UDFs that
      were replicated during the last run of the schedule on the Replication
        Policies page. You can also view the number of replicated UDFs on the
        Replication History page for previously-run replications.
