Disabling replication of parameters during Hive replication
Parameters of databases, tables, partitions, and indexes are replicated by default
    during Hive/Impala replications. You can disable the replication of parameters during Hive
    replication in Cloudera Manager.

Go to the Cloudera Manager >  Clusters > Hive Service > Configuration tab.

Enter the following parameter for the Hive Replication Environment Advanced
            Configuration Snippet property:

REPLICATE_PARAMETERS=false


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hive service.
