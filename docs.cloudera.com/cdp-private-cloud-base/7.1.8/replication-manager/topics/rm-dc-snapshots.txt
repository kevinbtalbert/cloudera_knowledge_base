Snapshots
You can create HBase and HDFS snapshots using Cloudera Manager or by using the
    command-line.


HBase snapshots allow you to create point-in-time backups of tables without making data
          copies, and with minimal impact on RegionServers. HBase snapshots are supported for
          clusters running CDH 4.2 or higher.
HDFS snapshots allow you to create point-in-time backups of directories or the entire
          filesystem without actually cloning the data. They can improve data replication
          performance and prevent errors caused by changes to a source directory. These snapshots
          appear on the filesystem as read-only directories that can be accessed just like other
          ordinary directories. 



Using snapshots with replicationSome replications, especially those that require a long time to finish can fail because     source files are modified during the replication process. You can prevent such failures by using     snapshot policies in Replication Manager. This use of snapshots is automatic with CDH versions     5.0 and higher. To take advantage of this, you must enable the relevant directories for     snapshots (also called making the directory snapshottable). Managing HDFS snapshots in Cloudera ManagerYou can manage HDFS snapshots using Cloudera Manager or the command line.
