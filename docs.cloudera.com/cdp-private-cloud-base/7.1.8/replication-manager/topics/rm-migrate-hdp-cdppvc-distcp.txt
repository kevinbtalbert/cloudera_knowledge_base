Using DistCp as alternate method to migrate HDFS data from HDP cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base cluster
You can migrate data stored in HDFS from a secure HDP cluster to a secure or unsecure
            CDP Private Cloud Base cluster using the Hadoop DistCp tool. 
Ensure that you have one of the following user accounts before you run Hadoop DistCp
                jobs:
HDFS superuser - For information about creating a HDFS superuser, see
                        Create the HDFS superuser.
User named hdfs - By default, the hdfs user is not allowed to run
                    YARN jobs. You must enable the hdfs user to run YARN jobs on both the
                    clusters.

For more information about using DistCp, see Ports Used by DistCp, Distcp between Secure Clusters in Different Kerberos
                Realms, and Using DistCp to Copy Files.

Migrating data from secure HDP cluster to unsecure CDP Private Cloud Base cluster using DistCpBefore you run DistCp to migrate data from a secure HDP cluster to an unsecure CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, you must allow the hdfs user to         run the YARN jobs on the HDP cluster in the absence of HDFS superuser account. You must also         ensure that the realm name is skipped during replication and only the specified user has         access to the HDP cluster.Migrating data from secure HDP cluster to secure CDP Private Cloud Base clusterYou can use the DistCp tool to migrate HDFS data from a secure HDP cluster to a         secure CDP Private Cloud Base cluster. To migrate data, you must         configure the HDP and CDP Private Cloud Base clusters on the same         Active Directory (AD) KDC, set up a one-way or two-way trust between them, and then run a         DistCp command to copy data.
