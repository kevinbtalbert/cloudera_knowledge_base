Configuration changes on the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster
During replication, the realm name must be skipped and only the specified user must
        have access to the HDP cluster. 

On the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, the administrator
                    must update the hadoop.security.auth_to_local
                    configuration property based on the HDFS Kerberos principal name. 
For example, if the HDFS Kerberos principal name is
                        hdfs@EXAMPLE.COM on the HDP cluster, then the
                    administrator must update the
                        hadoop.security.auth_to_local configuration property
                    to the following value:RULE:[1:$1@$0](.*@EXAMPLE.COM)s/@.*//

Restart the stale services.
