Running the DistCp job on the HDP cluster
After you enable the hdfs user to run YARN jobs on the HDP cluster and make
        the required configuration changes on the CDP Private Cloud Base
        cluster, you can run the DistCp job to migrate the HDFS data from the secure HDP cluster to
        the unsecure CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.

Make sure that you restart the cluster services before you run the DistCp job
                    in the HDP cluster.

Run the following hadoop distcp command:

hadoop distcp -D ipc.client.fallback-to-simple-auth-allowed=true [***Source cluster***]
          [***Destination cluster***]
For example,
 hadoop distcp -D ipc.client.fallback-to-simple-auth-allowed=true
        hdfs://172.27.28.200:8020/tmp/test/hosts1 
    hdfs://172.27.110.198:8020/tmp/hosts1
noteA Hadoop Distcp job requires simple authentication, therefore you must run
                        the hadoop distcp command with the
                            ipc.client.fallback-to-simple-auth-allowed option
                        set to true.
