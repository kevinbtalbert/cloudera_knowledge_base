Migrating data from secure HDP cluster to unsecure CDP Private Cloud Base cluster using DistCp
Before you run DistCp to migrate data from a secure HDP cluster to an unsecure CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, you must allow the hdfs user to
        run the YARN jobs on the HDP cluster in the absence of HDFS superuser account. You must also
        ensure that the realm name is skipped during replication and only the specified user has
        access to the HDP cluster.

Perform the following steps to migrate HDFS data from a secure HDP cluster to an
                unsecure CDP Private Cloud Base cluster:


Enabling the hdfs user to run the YARN jobs on the HDP clusterYou must make configuration changes to enable the hdfs user to run YARN jobs         on the HDP cluster.Configuration changes on the CDP Private Cloud Base clusterDuring replication, the realm name must be skipped and only the specified user must         have access to the HDP cluster. Running the DistCp job on the HDP clusterAfter you enable the hdfs user to run YARN jobs on the HDP cluster and make         the required configuration changes on the CDP Private Cloud Base         cluster, you can run the DistCp job to migrate the HDFS data from the secure HDP cluster to         the unsecure CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.Parent topic: Using DistCp as alternate method to migrate HDFS data from HDP cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base cluster
