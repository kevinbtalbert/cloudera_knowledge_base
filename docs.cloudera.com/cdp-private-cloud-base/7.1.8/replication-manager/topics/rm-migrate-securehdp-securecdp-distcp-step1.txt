Configuration changes on HDP cluster and CDP Private Cloud Base
        cluster
You must make some configuration changes on the HDP cluster and CDP Private Cloud Base cluster before you migrate the data from the
        HDP cluster to a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.

On the HDP cluster, open the core-site.xml file, enter the
                    following properties, and save the file:

<property>
    <name>hadoop.security.auth_to_local</name>
    <value><RM mapping rules for HDP></value>
    <value><RM mapping rules for CDH></value>
    <description>Maps kerberos principals to local user names</description>
</property>



On the HDP cluster, open the hdfs-site.xml file, enter the
                    following property, and save the file:

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal.pattern</name>
  <value>*</value>
</property>



Perform the above steps on the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.

Create a common Kerberos principal name on both the clusters.

Assign the created Kerberos principal name to all the applicable NameNodes in
                    the source and destination clusters.

To ensure that the same ResourceManager mapping rules are used in both the
                    clusters, update the ResourceManager mapping rules as shown below on both the
                    clusters:

<property>
    <name>hadoop.security.auth_to_local</name>
    <value>
      <HDP mapping rules>
      <CDH mapping rules>
      DEFAULT
    </value>
</property>



Configure a one-way or two-way trust between the clusters.
To set a two-way trust between the HDP cluster and CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, perform the following
                    steps:


Create clusters that belong to different Kerberos realms.
For example, assume that you have Realm: “DRT”
                            for the target cluster and Realm: “DRS” for the
                            source cluster.


Set up /etc/krb5.conf on all the hosts for both
                            the source and target hosts:


[realms] section - Add both the
                                    DRS and DRT realms, DRS from the source cluster's Kerberos KDC,
                                    admin_server, and default_domain settings.
[domain_realm] section - Add
                                    all the hosts of both source and target clusters.
Add krbtgt/DRS@DRT principal on
                                    both the source and target hosts that have HDFS NameNode role.
                                    To accomplish this task, perform the following
                                    steps:$ sudo kadmin.local
kadmin.local: addprinc -pw cloudera krbtgt/DRS@DRT
WARNING: no policy specified for krbtgt/DRS@DRT; defaulting to no policy
Principal "krbtgt/DRS@DRT" created

kadmin.local: listprincs





In Cloudera Manager and Ambari, perform the following steps:


Enable DRT as Trusted Kerberos Realm in source cluster
                                    HDFS service's configuration.
Enable DRS as Trusted Kerberos Realm (trusted_realm)
                                    in target cluster's configuration along with the source host
                                    name where HDFS NameNode role is present.
Enable DRS as Trusted Kerberos Realm in target cluster
                                    HDFS service's configuration.
Access the remote HDFS endpoint to verify whether the
                                    trust setup is successful. To access the remote HDFS endpoint,
                                    run the following
                                    commands:kinit krbtgt/DRS@DRT
hadoop fs -ls hdfs://[***REMOTE HDFS ENDPOINT***]:8020/





Configure the user to run YARN jobs on both the
            clusters.
