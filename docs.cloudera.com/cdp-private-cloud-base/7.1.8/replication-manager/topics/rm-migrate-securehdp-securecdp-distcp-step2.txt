Configuring a user to run YARN jobs on both the clusters
To run Hadoop DistCp jobs to migrate the data from HDP to CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, you must use HDFS superuser or
            hdfs user.

Ensure that you have one of the following user accounts before you run Hadoop DistCp
                    jobs:
HDFS superuser - For information about creating a HDFS superuser,
                        see Create the HDFS
                        superuser.
User named hdfs - By default, the hdfs user is not allowed to
                        run YARN jobs. You must enable the hdfs user to run YARN jobs on both
                        the clusters.



Perform the following steps on the HDP cluster:


Open the following file:
/var/lib/ambari-server/resources/common-services/YARN/2.1.0.2.0/package/templates/container-executor.cfg.j2


Remove the hdfs entry from banned-users
                            list and save the file.
Sample file
                            contents:yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs={{nm_local_dirs}}
yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs={{nm_log_dirs}}
yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.group={{yarn_executor_container_group}}
banned.users=yarn,hdfs,mapred,bin
min.user.id={{min_user_id}}



On the YARN configuration page, verify whether the
                                container-executor configuration template
                            contains hdfs in the banned.users list.
                        


If hdfs is listed in the banner.users
                            list, remove it from the template and save the template.


Restart the following services:


Stale services, if any.
Ambari server
Ambari agent on each host of the cluster.




In the yarn.admin.acl file, add hdfs.


In the etc/hadoop/capacity-scheduler.xml
                                fileSearch file, append hdfs to the
                                yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.acl_submit_applications
                            property.


Restart the YARN service.


Run the kinit command with the hdfs
                            userâ€™s keytab file to authenticate the hdfs user to the Key
                            Distribution Center (KDC).



On the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, perform the following steps:


Select the YARN service.


Click the Configuration tab.


Make sure that hdfs user is not listed in the
                                banned.users list.


Make sure that the min.user.id property is set
                            to 0.


Restart the YARN service.



Run the DistCp job on the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.
