Running DistCp job on the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster
After you make the required configuration changes in the HDP cluster and CDP Private
        Cloud Base cluster and configure a user to run the YARN jobs on both the clusters, you can
        run the Hadoop DistCp job.

Restart the cluster services on both the clusters.

Run the following Hadoop DistCp command:
sudo -u [***superuser or hdfs***] hadoop distcp [***Source
                        cluster***] [***Destination cluster***]For example,
                        sudo -u <superuser> hadoop distcp hdfs://nn1:8020/source
                        hdfs://nn2:8020/destination
