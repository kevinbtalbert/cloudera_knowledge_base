Migrating data from secure HDP cluster to secure CDP Private Cloud Base cluster
You can use the DistCp tool to migrate HDFS data from a secure HDP cluster to a
        secure CDP Private Cloud Base cluster. To migrate data, you must
        configure the HDP and CDP Private Cloud Base clusters on the same
        Active Directory (AD) KDC, set up a one-way or two-way trust between them, and then run a
        DistCp command to copy data.

Perform the following steps to migrate HDFS data from a secure HDP cluster to an
                secure CDP Private Cloud Base cluster:


Configuration changes on HDP cluster and CDP Private Cloud Base clusterYou must make some configuration changes on the HDP cluster and CDP Private Cloud Base cluster before you migrate the data from the         HDP cluster to a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.Configuring a user to run YARN jobs on both the clustersTo run Hadoop DistCp jobs to migrate the data from HDP to CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, you must use HDFS superuser or             hdfs user.Running DistCp job on the CDP Private Cloud Base clusterAfter you make the required configuration changes in the HDP cluster and CDP Private         Cloud Base cluster and configure a user to run the YARN jobs on both the clusters, you can         run the Hadoop DistCp job.Parent topic: Using DistCp as alternate method to migrate HDFS data from HDP cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base cluster
