Fetching Spark Maven dependencies

 The Maven coordinates are a combination of groupId, artifactId and
      version. The groupId and artifactId are the same as for the upstream
      Apache Spark project. For example, for spark-core,
      groupId is org.apache.spark, and artifactId is
        spark-core_2.11, both the same as the upstream project.
      The version is different for the Cloudera packaging: see the release notes
      for the exact name depending on which release you are using.
