Using the Cloudera Runtime Maven repository 7.1.8
Information about using Maven to build applications with Cloudera
    Runtime components. 
If you want to build applications or tools for use with Cloudera Runtime
      components and you are using Maven or Ivy for dependency management, you
      can pull the Cloudera Runtime artifacts from the Cloudera Maven
      repository. The repository is available at https://repository.cloudera.com/artifactory/cloudera-repos/.
importantWhen you build an application
      JAR, do not include CDH JARs, because they are already provided. If
      you do, upgrading CDH can break your application. To avoid this situation,
      set the Maven dependency scope to
        provided. If you have already built applications which
      include the CDH JARs, update the dependency to set scope
      to provided and recompile.
