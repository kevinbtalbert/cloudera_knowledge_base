FIPS Compliant Changes in Apache Impala
As an administrator, you must understand the FIPS compliant changes in Impala before
  configuring Impala Web UI to diagnose issues with each daemon on a particular host, or perform other
  administrative actions such as cancelling a running query from the built-in web server's
  UI.
Cloudera Manager supports two methods of authentication for secure access to the Impala
   Catalog Server, Impala Daemon, and StateStore web servers: password-based authentication and
   SPNEGO authentication. From this release, Impala embedded Web Server will not support HTTP
   password-based authentication in FIPS approved mode since it's based on MD5 and does not
   comply with FIPS 140-2.
For details on FIPS encryption, see Configure CDP with FIPS-compliant encryption.
