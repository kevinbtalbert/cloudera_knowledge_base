Behavioral Changes in Apache Kafka
Learn about the change in certain functionality of Kafka that has resulted in a change
    in behavior from the previously released version to this version of Cloudera
    Runtime.


Summary:
Previously, Kafka data directories were configured as
          world-readable on the filesystem of the broker host. From now on, they are only readable
          by Kafka.
Previous behavior:
Kafka data directories were created with 755 permissions.
New behavior:
Kafka data directories are created with 0750 permissions.


Summary:
JMX authentication is enabled by default for the Kafka service.
          Additionally random passwords are now generated for both JMX users by default.
Previous behavior:

JMX authentication (Enable Authenticated Communication with the JMX
              Agent) was disabled by default.

New behavior:
JMX authentication (Enable Authenticated Communication
            with the JMX Agent) is now enabled by default. By default random passwords
          are generated for both JMX users.


Summary:
The default TLS protocol when using Java 11 or later is updated to
          TLS 1.3. TLS 1.2 remains the default for earlier Java versions. For more information, see
            KIP-573.
Previous behavior:
The default TLS protocol used was TLS 1.2.
New behavior:
The default TLS protocol when using Java 11 or later is TLS
          1.3.


Summary:
The client.dns.lookup client property is now set
          to use_all_dns_ips by default. With this option set, clients attempt to
          connect to the broker using all possible IP addresses of a hostname. This option reduces
          connection failure rates and is better suited for cloud and containerized environments
          where a single hostname might resolve to multiple IP addresses. For more information, see
            KIP-602.
Previous behavior:

The default value of the client.dns.lookup client property was set to
            default.

New behavior:

The default value of the client.dns.lookup property is set to
              use_all_dns_ips.



Summary:
The default value for the following Kafka Connect properties is
          increased to 3:
Offset Storage Topic Replication Factor
                (offset.storage.replication.factor)
Configuration Storage Topic Replication Factor
                (config.storage.replication.factor)
Status Storage Topic Replication Factor
                (status.storage.replication.factor)

Previous behavior:
The default value of the properties was set to 1.
New behavior:
The default value of the properties is set to 3.


Summary:
The FileStream example connectors (FileStreamSourceConnector and
          FileStreamsSinkConnector) are no longer available for deployment by default using the
          Kafka Connect Rest API, SMM UI, or SMM REST API. The JAR file of the connector is still
          shipped with Cloudera Runtime, but the connectors must be installed before they can be
          deployed. For more information on how to install Kafka Connect connectors, see Installing Connectors
Previous behavior:
TheFileStream example connectors were available by default for
          deployment. In SMM, the connectors were selectable on the Connect
              Cluster > Connector Setup page by
          default.
New behavior:
TheFileStream example connectors  must be installed before they
          can be deployed. In SMM, the connectors are no longer selectable on the
              Connect Cluster > Connector
              Setuppage by default.
