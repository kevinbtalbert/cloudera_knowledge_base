Learn about the change in certain functionality of Streams Messaging Manager that has
    resulted in a change in behavior from the previously released version to this version of
    Cloudera Runtime.


Summary:
The FileStream example connectors (FileStreamSourceConnector and
          FileStreamsSinkConnector) are no longer available for deployment by default using the
          Kafka Connect Rest API, SMM UI, or SMM REST API. The JAR file of the connector is still
          shipped with Cloudera Runtime, but the connectors must be installed before they can be
          deployed. For more information on how to install Kafka Connect connectors, see Installing Connectors
Previous behavior:
TheFileStream example connectors were available by default for
          deployment. In SMM, the connectors were selectable on the Connect
              Cluster > Connector Setup page by
          default.
New behavior:

          can be deployed. In SMM, the connectors are no longer selectable on the
              Connect Cluster > Connector
              Setuppage by default.
