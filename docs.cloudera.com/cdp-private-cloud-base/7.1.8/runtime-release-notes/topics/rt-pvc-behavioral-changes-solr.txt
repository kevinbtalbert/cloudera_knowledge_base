Behavioral Changes in Apache Solr
Learn about the change in certain functionality of Apache Solr that has resulted in a
  change in behavior from the previously released version to this version of Cloudera
  Runtime.


Summary:
Validation of javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly
     parameter changed in Solr client
Previous behavior:

Unless explicitely set to 'true', Solr client used to set the value of
       javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly parameter to 'false'.

New behavior:
Solr client does not overwrite ‘null’ value of
       javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly parameter, it only throws a
      warning during connection
      setup:System Property: javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly set to: [true|null] not false.  
SPNego authentication may not be successful.This may cause issues when connecting Solr to custom applications. To prevent this, set -Djavax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly=false in the JVM configuration of those applications. 
noteFor the Spark-Solr connector, use
      spark-submit --driver-java-options "-Djavax.security.auth.useSubjecCredsOnly=false"
Cloudera has implemented this change in MapReduceIndexer, CrunchIndexer, Hive-Solr
      connector, and Atlas.
