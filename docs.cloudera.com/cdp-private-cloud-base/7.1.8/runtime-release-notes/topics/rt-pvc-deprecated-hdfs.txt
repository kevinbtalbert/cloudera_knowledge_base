Deprecation Notices in HDFS
Certain features and functionality in HDFS are deprecated or removed in Cloudera
        Runtime 7.1.8. You must review these changes along with the information about the features
        in HDFS that will be removed or deprecated in a future release. 
Use the following list to understand some of the deprecated items and incompatibilities
            if you are upgrading from CDH 5.x or higher or HDP 2.x or higher to CDP Private Cloud
            Base 7.1.8.
Known incompatibilities when upgrading from CDH and HDP
Cloudera Runtime uses Apache Hadoop 3.1.x whereas CDH 5.x and HDP 2.x use Apache
                Hadoop 2.6.x and 2.7.x respectively. 

Major change
HADOOP-11661 and HADOOP-12967: The copyMerge function used to
                consolidate the PART* files has been removed. Instead, use the hadoop fs
                    -getmerge shell command in Zeppelin or command line interface for
                Spark jobs.

Public APIs that are no longer available
importantSome APIs listed as deprecated might not
                block your upgrade. Do not use the deprecated APIs in your existing applications
                after upgrade, and in new development, to avoid issues.
The following public APIs are no longer supported in CDP Private Cloud Base
                7.1.8:


FileStatus.flags ( boolean acl,
                        boolean crypt, boolean ec, boolean sn )[static]
                            : Set<FileStatus.AttrFlags> 


FileStatus.setSnapShotEnabledFlag ( boolean
                            isSnapShotEnabled ) : void


SpanReceiverInfo.getClassName ( ) :
                        String


SpanReceiverInfo.getId ( ) : long


SpanReceiverInfoBuilder.addConfigurationPair
                        ( String key, String value ) : void


SpanReceiverInfoBuilder.build ( ) :
                        SpanReceiverInfo
