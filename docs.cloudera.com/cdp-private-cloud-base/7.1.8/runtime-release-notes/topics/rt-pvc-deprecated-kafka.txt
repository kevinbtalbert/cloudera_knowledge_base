Deprecation Notices for Apache Kafka
Certain features and functionality in Kafka are deprecated or removed in Cloudera
    Runtime 7.1.8. You must review these changes along with the information about the features in
    Kafka that will be removed or deprecated in a future release. 
importantThe following list of deprecated and removed items is not exhaustive and
      only contains items that have a direct and immediate effect on Kafka in CDP. For a full list
      of deprecation and/or removals in the version Apache Kafka shipped with Runtime, review the
        Notable Changes as well as the Release Notes on https://kafka.apache.org/.
Removed

kafka-preferred-replica-election
The kafka-preferred-replica-election.sh command line tool is removed.
            Its alternative in CDP, kafka-preferred-replica-election, is also
            removed. Use kafka-leader-election instead.
--zookeeper
The --zookeeper option is removed from the
              kafka-topics and kafka-reassign-partitions command
            line tools. Use the --bootstrap-server option instead.


Deprecated


MirrorMaker (MM1)
MirrorMaker is deprecated. Cloudera recommends that you use Streams Replication
              Manager (SRM) instead.


--zookeeper 
The --zookeeper option is only supported for the
                kafka-configs tool and should be only used when updating SCRAM
              Credential configurations. The --zookeeper option is either
              deprecated in or removed from other Kafka command line tools. Cloudera recommends that
              you use the --bootstrap-server option instead.
