Deprecation notices in Streams Messaging Manager
Certain features and functionalities in Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) are deprecated
  or removed in Cloudera Runtime 7.1.8. You must review these changes along with the information
  about the features in SMM that will be removed or deprecated in a future release. 
The lineage and aggregated metrics endpoints have their versions changed.
The experimental v1 lineage endpoints changes include:
/api/v1/admin/lineage/producers/{producerId} is changed to
        /api/v2/admin/lineage/producers/{producerId}. The response object is not
       backward compatible, however, all the information is still present in a better
       structure.
/api/v1/admin/lineage/consumersGroup/{consumersGroupId} is changed to
        /api/v2/admin/lineage/consumersGroup/{consumersGroupId}. The response
       object is not backward compatible, however, all the information is still present in a better
       structure.
/api/v1/admin/lineage/partitions/{topicName} is changed to
        /api/v2/admin/lineage/partitions/{topicName}. The response object is
       unchanged.
/api/v1/admin/lineage/partitions/{topicName}/{partitionId} is changed to
        /api/v2/admin/lineage/partitions/{topicName}/{partitionId}. The response
       object is unchanged.

The aggregated metrics endpoints changes include:
Every endpoint within /api/v1/admin/metrics/aggregated/* went through a
       version change to /api/v2/admin/metrics/aggregated/*.
The old endpoints are not accessible any more.
Most notably the partitionMetrics field is removed from all the endpoints
       and the information within is not accessible any more.
