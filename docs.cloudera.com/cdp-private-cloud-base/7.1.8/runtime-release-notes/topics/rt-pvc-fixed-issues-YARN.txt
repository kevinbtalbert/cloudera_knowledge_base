Fixed Issues in Apache Hadoop YARN and YARN Queue ManagerCloudera DocsFixed Issues in Apache Hadoop YARN and YARN Queue Manager
Review the list of Apache Hadoop YARN and YARN Queue Manager issues that are resolved in
    Cloudera Runtime 7.1.8.


OPSAPS-50291: "HADOOP_HOME,PATH,LANG,TZ" are now added by default
          to the yarn.nodemanager.env-whitelist Yarn configuration option.
This issue is fixed. 


COMPX-4871: All YARN Queue Manager Operations validation request fails after reaching
          260 levels
Once having 260 or more queue levels, the YARN Queue Manager validation request for any
          operations (Add, Delete, Stop, Edit) failed. In other words, queues up to 260 levels is
          the threshold up to which YARN Queue Manager worked fine and after that it started to fail
          in performing the operation.This fix removes this limitation.


COMPX-4920: Node Labels are not sorted by created time in the Node Labels grid/base page 
With this fix all Node Labels in the grid are sorted by the time they were created, so
          that the lastly created label is at the bottom. 


 COMPX-5252: YARN Queue Manager does not support direct migration between weight and
          absolute resource allocation mode
YARN Queue Manager UI did not support direct migration neither from weight resource
          allocation mode to absolute resource allocation mode, nor from absolute resource
          allocation mode to weight resource allocation mode. This issue is resolved.


COMPX-5255: Cannot enable "auto queue creation" for "root" in weight mode
Enabling the dynamic child queue creation feature for root queue is now possible.


COMPX-5755: YARN Queue Manager UI allows to create partition named “default” 
YARN Queue Manager UI supported the creation of a partition named "default". This could
          cause issues in the UI since the system has a default partition named "default". This fix
          prevents the user from creating such a partition, and also adds duplicate partition name
          validation when creating a new partition. 


 COMPX-6207: Disabling queue auto deletion does not work in YARN 
Before this fix when auto queue deletion was disabled for a specific parent queue, the
          auto-created queues under that parent queue were deleted once the job was done and after
          the expiration timeout. With this fix the auto-created queues are not deleted if auto
          queue deletion is disabled for that queue. 


COMPX-6628: Unable to delete single leaf queue assigned to a partition
It was not supported to delete a single leaf queue using the YARN Queue Manager UI if
          the queue was assigned to a partition.


COMPX-6665: Could not change allocation mode to relative (from absolute) when there is a
          partition with no hosts and no queues assigned 
With this fix users can change the resource allocation mode to relative if there are no
          hosts and queues assigned to the partition. 


 COMPX-6779: Not able to add new queue to leaf queue with partition capacity in absolute
          mode
This issue is fixed. 


 COMPX-6949, COMPX-7818: Wrong default version message when reordering placement rules 
After reordering placement rules and clicking Save, the common box displayed an
          incorrect message: Added a new placement rule. This message is fixed, and the box
            displays: Reordered placement rules. 


COMPX-7292: Add option to disable auto creation of a queue in weight mode
Previously if you enabled the dynamic child creation feature for a queue you could not
          disable it; you had to remove the parent queue and then recreate it. This fix enables you
          to disable the auto child creation feature for a queue.


COMPX-7522, COMPX-7828: Could not start dynamically created child queue 
Dynamically created child queues could not be started or stopped under legacy managed
          parent queues in percentage and absolute modes. This issue is fixed now. 


COMPX-7594: Minimum User Limit field fractional percentages inconsistency
The Minimum User Limit field previously accepted fractional percentages. This issue has
          been fixed and the field does not accept fractional percentages anymore. 


COMPX-7619: Placement Rules "View" button should be available in read-only mode
This fix adds the View options for placement rules for non-admin users when read-only
          mode is configured in YARN Queue Manager UI. 


COMPX-7822: User Limit Factor property should accept -1
The User Limit Factor property now accepts -1 as a value.


COMPX-8162: Maximum AM resource percentage value is not updated for dynamically created
          queues
This issue is resolved.


COMPX-8360: Yarn Queue Manager UI wipes out all Placement Rules when an invalid rule is
          added
 When an invalid placement rule is created, the previously created valid placement rules
          were removed by the YARN Queue Manager UI, while the configuration file did not remove
          them. With this fix, the YARN Queue Manager UI does not remove the previously created
          valid placement rules anymore.


COMPX-8598: Fix commissioning/recommissioning NodeManager failure in YARN 
When the yarn.scheduler.configuration.store.class property is set to zk and YARN Queue
          Manager is not installed and enabled in a cluster every YARN node decommission causes an
          exception. With this fix, no refreshQueues command is called when ZooKeeper configuration
          store is used, but YARN Queue Manager is not.


COMPX-10674: Not able to edit children capacities with decimal values after weight to
          relative mode conversion
 User was not be able to update Child queue capacity with decimal values after weight to
          relative mode conversion


COMPX-10771, COMPX-11178: Cannot add node label if active/standby ResourceManagers have
          flipped
Users was not be able to access YARN Queue Manager UI while ResourceManager failover
          happens and the standby RM is down


COMPX-10973: Fix -ve calculation in Fairness Based intra queue
          preemption.
This issue is fixed.


OPSAPS-61245: Banned users should be the same as custom users
CM 7.5.3 and CM 7.7.1 automatically fills the banned users values
          based on the customized process users.


OPSAPS-63181: The value of mapreduce.cluster.acls.enabled is not
          generated into YARN RM's mapred-site.xml
Enable Job ACL configuration is now generated for all the
          necessary roles.
