OPSAPS-60331: If Cloudera Manager is configured to use Active
          Directory as a Kerberos KDC, and is also configured to use
          /etc/cloudera-scm-server/cmf.keytab as the KDC admin credentials, you should no longer
          encounter errors when generating Kerberos credentials.
In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, when runnning Administration > Security > Kerberos Credentials > Import KDC Account Manager Credentials wizard, it is no longer necessary to remove
          /etc/cloudera-scm-server/cmf.keytab on the Cloudera Manager server
          host.
