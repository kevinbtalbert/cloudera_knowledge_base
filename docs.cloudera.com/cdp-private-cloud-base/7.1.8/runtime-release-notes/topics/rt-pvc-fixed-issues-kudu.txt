Fixed Issues in Apache KuduCloudera DocsFixed Issues in Apache Kudu
Review the list of Kudu issues that are resolved in Cloudera Runtime 7.1.8.


CDPD-40027: Ranger plugin unable to start up
Removed logredactor jar from plugins-common as ranger-kudu
                    subprocess fails to initialize. Added logredactor dependency in ranger-rms-hive
                    plugin so that it can package into ews/lib folder while building ranger-rms tar
                    file.


KUDU-1959: Fix the counter in
                    StartupProgressStepsRemainingMetric()
Before this fix the counter in
                    StartupProgressStepsRemainingMetric() was incremented twice if tablets are not
                    processed during the startup of a tablet server. 


KUDU-3346: Fix rebalancer tool fails to run with
                    ‘--ignored_tservers’ 
Prior to this patch the validity of 'ignored_tservers' was
                    checked when 'BuildClusterinfo', which leads to a failure when the 'raw_info'
                    only contains information of tservers on a specific location. This patch fixes
                    it by moving the parameter validity check into 'KsckResultsToClusterRawInfo',
                    because ksck results contain original cluster information.
