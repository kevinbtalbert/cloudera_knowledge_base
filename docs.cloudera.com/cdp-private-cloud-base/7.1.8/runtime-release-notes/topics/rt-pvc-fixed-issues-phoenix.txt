CDPD-39117: If there are mix of AND and OR filters in the query while converting the to phoenix filter from spark filters no parentheses got added to OR filters which was leading to wrong filter and finally a wrong data. PHOENIX-6683 fixes this issue by surrounding the OR filters with parentheses while converting spark filters to phoenix expressions.
This issue is resolved.


CDPD-35717: CALCITE-903 has introduced a transaprent reconnection feature, which will open a new server-side connection in case it is expired from the server side connection cache. While this is convinient for most read-only analytical workloads, this can cause a number a problems, including data loss for transactional connections.
This patch disables the transparent reconnect feature by default, and adds the transparent_reconnection property, which re-enables it when set to true.
