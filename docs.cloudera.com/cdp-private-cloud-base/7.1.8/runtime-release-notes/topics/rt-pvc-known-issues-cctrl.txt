CDPD-47616: Unable to initiate rebalance, number of valid windows
          (NumValidWindows) is zero
If a Cruise Control rebalance is initiated with the
            rebalance_disk parameter and Cruise Control is configured to fetch
          metrics from Cloudera Manager (Metric Reporter is set to
            CM metrics reporter), Cruise Control stops collecting metrics
          from the partitions that are moved. This is because Cloudera Manager does not collect
          metrics from moved partitions due to an issue in Kafka (KAFKA-10320).If the metrics are
            not available, the partition is considered invalid by Cruise Control. This results in
            Cruise Control blocking rebalance operations and proposal generation.
Configure Cruise Control to use to use the Cruise Control
          metrics reporter (default). This issue is not present if this metric reporter is used.
In Cloudera Manager, select the Cruise Control service.
Go to Configuration.
Find the Metric Reporter property.
Select the Cruise Control metrics reporter option.
Restart the Cruise Control service.



OPSAPS-68148: Cruise Control rack aware goal upgrade handler
The goal sets in Cruise Control, which include the default,
          supported, hard, self-healing and anomaly detection goals, might be overridden to their
          default value after a cluster upgrade if the goals have been customized.
Create a copy from the values of the goal lists before
          upgrading your cluster, and add the copied values to the goal lists after upgrading the
          cluster. Furthermore, you must rename any mentioning of
            com.linkedin.kafka.cruisecontrol.analyzer.goals.RackAwareGoal to
            com.linkedin.kafka.cruisecontrol.analyzer.goals.RackAwareDistributionGoal
          as Cruise Control will not be able to start otherwise.
