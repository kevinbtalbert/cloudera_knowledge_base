Known Issues in Apache HBase
This topic describes known issues and workarounds for using HBase in this release of
    Cloudera Runtime.


In the affected CDP releases (7.1.7.1056+, 7.1.7 SP2+, 7.1.8
          CHF1+, 7.2.16.0+, 7.2.15.2+, 7.2.14.3+), Hbase Regionserver performance is degraded by
          aggressive GC pause and memory contention from the ColumnFamilyCache.
Disable ColumnFamilyCache Cloudera Manager -> HBase
          -> HBase Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
          ranger-hbase-security.xml xasecure.hbase.columnfamilies.cache.maxsize=0

CDPD-44402: If you are running CDP 7.1.8 and >7.1.7.1056 SP1 releases, there is an
          increased heap usage and GC pressure in the HBase regionserver due to the Ranger
          ColumnFamily Cache feature. This problem is particularly evident when HBase tables that
          contain numerous columns, leading to high heap utilization and potentially causing the
          Regionserver to fail. 
Workaround: Disable the Ranger ColumnFamily Cache in Cloudera Manager by setting
            xasecure.hbase.columnfamilies.cache.maxsize to
            0 in ranger-hbase-security.xml. This cache
          can be safely turned off, as it reverts to the behavior seen in version 7.1.7 without any
          impact.
IntegrationTestReplication fails if replication does not finish before
          the verify phase begins

During IntegrationTestReplication, if the verify
            phase starts before the replication phase finishes, the test will fail
            because the target cluster does not contain all of the data. If the HBase services in
            the target cluster does not have enough memory, long garbage-collection pauses might
            occur.

Workaround: Use the -t flag to set the timeout value before
          starting verification.
 HDFS encryption with HBase

Cloudera has tested the performance impact of using HDFS encryption with HBase. The
            overall overhead of HDFS encryption on HBase performance is in the range of 3 to 4% for
            both read and update workloads. Scan performance has not been thoroughly tested. 

Workaround: N/A
AccessController postOperation problems in asynchronous operations

When security and Access Control are enabled, the following problems occur:
If a Delete Table fails for a reason other than missing
                permissions, the access rights are removed but the table may still exist and may be
                used again.
If hbaseAdmin.modifyTable() is used to delete column families,
                the rights are not removed from the Access Control List (ACL) table. The
                  portOperation is implemented only for
                  postDeleteColumn().
If Create Table fails, full rights for that table persist for the
                user who attempted to create it. If another user later succeeds in creating the
                table, the user who made the failed attempt still has the full rights.


Workaround: N/A
Apache Issue:
HBASE-6992


Snappy compression with /tmp directory mounted with noexec
          option

Using the HBase client applications such as hbase hfile on the cluster
            with Snappy compression could result in UnsatisfiedLinkError. 

Workaround: Add
            -Dorg.xerial.snappy.tempdir=/var/hbase/snappy-tempdir to
            Client Java Configuration Options in Cloudera Manager that points
          to a directory where exec option is allowed.


HBase shutdown can lead to inconsistencies in META

Cloudera Manager uses an incorrect shutdown command. This prevents graceful shutdown of
            the HBase service and forces Cloudera Manager to kill the processes instead. It can lead
            to inconsistencies in Meta.

Workaround: Run the following command instead of
          shutting down the HBase service using Cloudera
            Manager.hbase master stop --shutDownClusterThe
            command output must end with Closing master protocol: MasterService
            phrase. You can verify the command execution by checking the master logs. The log must
            contain Cluster shutdown requested of master=xxx and the closing of
            regions. Upon successful execution, the RegionServers start shutting down.noteThe command does not stop the REST Server and the
              Thrift Server role instances. You can safely shut down them from Cloudera
            Manager later.If you find any inconsistencies, please contact Cloudera
            Support.
