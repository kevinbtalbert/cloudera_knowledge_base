CDPD-54376: Clicking the home button on the File Browser page
          redirects to HDFS user directory
When you are previewing a file on any supported filesystem, such
          as S3 or ABFS, and you click on the Home button, you are redirected
          to the HDFS user home directory instead of the user home directory on the said
          filesystem.
None.


CDPD-41306: pip3.8 freeze command does not work and results into
          an error
You see the /usr/lib/hue/build/env/bin/python: No
            such file or directory error when you run the following
          command:build/env/bin/pip3.8 freeze

CDPD-46312: cx_Oracle 6.4.1 is missing from the CDP stack on 7.1.8
          release
cx_Oracle and Oracle Instant Client parcels are not bundled in the
          CDP 7.1.8 distribution.
You must download the Oracle Instant Client library 19.16
          (both basic and SDK clients) from the Oracle website. You can download the cx_Oracle
          Python extension module from https://pypi.org/project/cx-Oracle/. The
          documentation has also been updated to provide you these instructions. See Using Oracle database with Hue.


OPSAPS-64655: Performance issues in loading and using Hue
You may experience delay in loading the Hue application, running
          queries, or see a blank page when you try to open Hue. This could happen because of slower
          responses from the Hue server due to a limited number of Gunicorn worker processes.
To improve performance, increase the number of Gunicorn
          worker processes. Go to Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Hue > Configuration and add the following lines in the Hue Service Advanced
            Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini
            field:[desktop]
gunicorn_number_of_workers=32
cherrypy_server_threads=2Click
              Save Changes and restart the Hue service.


CDPD-43293: Unable to import Impala table using Importer
Creating Impala tables using the Hue Importer may fail.

If you have both Hive and Impala services installed on your cluster, then you can
            import the table using by selecting the Hive dialect from Tables > Sources.
If only Impala service is installed on your cluster, then go to  Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Hue > Configurations and add the following line in the Hue Service Advanced
              Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini
            field:[beeswax]
max_number_of_sessions=1



CDPD-41136: Importing files from the local workstation is disabled
          by default
Cloudera has disabled the functionality to import files from your
          local workstation into Hue because it may cause errors. You may not see the
            Local File option in the Type drop-down
          menu on the Importer page by default.
You can enable the functionality to import files from your
          local workstation by specifying the following parameter in the Hue Service
            Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini field
          in Hue configurations in Cloudera Manager:[indexer]
enable_direct_upload=true


DWX-8602: Unable to import a large CSV file from the local
          workstation
You may see an error message while importing a CSV file into Hue
          from your workstation, stating that you cannot import files of size more than 200 KB.
Upload the file to S3 or ABFS and then import them into Hue
          using the Importer.


CDPD-17465: LDAPTest fails with whoami_s
LDAPTest can potentially fail when the extended operation
          “whoami_s” is not available.
None.


CDPD-39330: Unable to use the pip command in CDP
You may not be able to use the pip command in CDP
          7.1.7 and may see the following error when using pip in a command:
            “ImportError: cannot import name chardet”.
Follow the steps listed on Unable to use pip command in CDP.


CDPD-24294: Hue uses the unsafe-inline directive in its Content
          Security Policy (CSP) header
Hue 4 web interface uses the unsafe-inline directive in its CSP
          header. As a result, the application server does not set the CSP header in its HTTP
          responses, and therefore does not benefit from the additional protection against potential
          cross-site scripting issues and other modern application vulnerabilities which a properly
          configured CSP may provide. This could lead to application vulnerability.
This issue will be fixed in Hue 5. Until then, Cloudera
          recommends deploying additional security measures such as a firewall within the Hue server
          to control allowed connections, and SSO-based authentications mechanisms such as LDAP or
          SAML.


OPSAPS-61244: Cloudera Manager displays stale Hue configuration
          after upgrading to CDP 7.1.x from CDH 6.
After upgrading from CDH 6 to CDP 7.1.x, you may see stale
          configurations in Cloudera manager for the Hue service.
Manually restart the Hue service from Cloudera Manager.


ENGESC-9091: Setting idle session timeout for Hue does not work
          when the cluster is secured using Knox SSO
If Hue is configured with
            desktop.auth.backend.KnoxSpnegoDjangoBackend as the
            Authentication Backend, then the automatic idle session logout
          that is set by configuring the idle_session_timeout property does not
          take effect. You may also see 404 error while accessing Hue from the Knox UI when the
            idle_session_timeout property is not set to -1.
None


DOCS-10377: Hue UI is blank upon login after upgrading to CDP
          7.1.7 from CDH 6
If your cluster was secured using Knox, and if you have upgraded
          from CDH 6 to CDP 7.1.7, then you may see a blank Hue screen. This could happen because
          the knox_proxyhosts parameter is newly introduced in CDP, and it is
          possible that this parameter is not configured in Cloudera Manager under Hue
          configuration. 
Specify the host on which you have installed Knox in the Hue
          Knox Proxy Hosts configuration as follows: 
Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.
Obtain the host name of the Knox Gateway by going to Clusters > Knox service > Instances.
Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration and search for the Knox Proxy Hosts
                field.noteCloudera Manager displays the following warning if the Knox
                  Proxy Hosts field is empty when Knox Gateway is enabled on the CDP
                cluster: The parameter knox_proxyhosts cannot be empty. This can
                  happen if there are no Knox Gateways. Please set the knox_proxyhosts to the list
                  of hosts that have Knox Gateways.
Specify the Knox Gateway hostname in the Knox Proxy Hosts
              field.
Click Save Changes and restart the Hue service.



OPSAPS-58927: Connection failed error when accessing the Search
          app (Solr) from Hue

If you are using Solr with Hue to generate interactive dashboards and for indexing
            data, and if you have deployed two Solr services on your cluster and selected the second
            one as a dependency for Hue, then Cloudera Manager assigns the hostname of the first
            Solr service and the port number of the second Solr service generating an incorrect Solr
            URL in the search section of the hue.ini file. As a result, you may see a “Connection
            failed” error when you try to access the Search app from the Hue web UI.



Log into Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.
Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration and add the following lines in the Hue Service Advanced
                Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini
                field:[search]
# URL of the Solr Server
solr_url=http://[***HOSTNAME***]:[***PORT***]/solr/For
                example: solr_url=http://solr2:4567/solr/
Click Save Changes.
Restart the Hue service.




CLR-72251: Invalid S3 URI error while accessing S3 bucket

The Hue Load Balancer merges the double slashes (//) in the S3 URI into a single slash
            (/) so that the URI prefix "/filebrowser/view=S3A://" is changed to
              "/filebrowser/view=S3A:/". This results in an error when you try to
            access the S3 buckets from the Hue File Browser through the port 8889.
The Hue web UI displays the following error: “Unknown error
            occurred”.
The Hue server logs record the “ValueError: Invalid S3 URI: S3A”
            error.


To resolve this issue, add the following property in the Hue Load Balancer Advanced
            Configuration Snippet:
Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an administrator.
Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configurations > Load Balancer and search for the Load Balancer Advanced Configuration
                  Snippet (Safety Valve) for httpd.conf field.
Specify MergeSlashes OFF in the Load Balancer Advanced
                  Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for httpd.conf field.
Click Save Changes.
Restart the Hue Load Balancer.You should be able to load the S3 browser from
                  both 8888 and 8889 ports.Alternatively, you can use the Hue server port
                  8888 instead of the load balancer port 8889 to resolve this issue.




CLR-72255: Error while rerunning Oozie workflow

You may see an error such as the following while rerunning an an already executed and
            finished Oozie workflow through the Hue web interface: E0504: App directory
              [hdfs:/cdh/user/hue/oozie/workspaces/hue-oozie-1571929263.84] does not
            exist.


To resolve this issue, add the following property in the Hue Load Balancer Advanced
            Configuration Snippet:
Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an administrator.
Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configurations > Load Balancer and search for the Load Balancer Advanced Configuration
                  Snippet (Safety Valve) for httpd.conf field.
Specify MergeSlashes OFF in the Load Balancer Advanced
                  Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for httpd.conf field.
Click Save Changes.
Restart the Hue Load Balancer.




CDPD-16407: Python-psycopg2 package version 2.8.4 not compatible
          with Hue

Ubuntu 18.04 provides python-psycopg2 package version 2.8.4 but it is not compatible
            with Hue because of a bug in the Django framework.

Downgrade the package at the OS level by running the
          following command: sudo apt install python-psycopg2==2.7.5 or
          install python-psycopg2 package using pip by running the following command:
          sudo pip install psycopg2==2.7.5


DOCS-6344: Hue limitation after upgrading from CDH to CDP Private Cloud Base
The hive.server2.parallel.ops.in.session
          configuration property changes from TRUE to FALSE after
          upgrading from CDH to CDP Private Cloud Base. Current versions of Hue are compatible with
          this property change; however, if you still would like to use an earlier version of Hue
          that was not compatible with this property being FALSE and shared a
          single JDBC connection to issue queries concurrently, the connection will no longer work
          after upgrading.


CDPD-43956: Manually replace UUID when importing Oozie workflows
          containing sub-workflows
When importing Oozie workflows that contain sub-workflows, you
          must replace all the UUID entries with unique new entries. If you change the UUID of a
          sub-workflow, you must update that reference in the parent workflow to avoid circular
          dependencies.


INSIGHT-3707: Query history displays "Result Expired" message
You see the "Result Expired" message under the Query History
          column on the Queries tab for queries which were run back to back.
          This is a known behaviour.
None.


Unsupported features


CDPD-59595: Spark SQL does not work with all Livy servers that
            are configured for High Availability
SparkSQL support in Hue with Livy servers in HA mode is not
            supported. Hue does not automatically connect to one of the Livy servers. You must
            specify the Livy server in the Hue Advanced Configuration Snippet as
            follows:[desktop]
[spark]
livy_server_url=http(s)://[***LIVY-FOR-SPARK3-SERVER-HOST***]:[***LIVY-FOR-SPARK3-SERVER-PORT***] Moreover,
            you may see the following error in Hue when you submit a SparkSQL query:
              Expecting value: line 2 column 1 (char 1). This happens
            when the Livy server does not respond to the request from Hue.
Specify all different Livy servers in the
              livy_server_url property one at a time and use the one which does not
            cause the issue.


CDPD-18491: PySpark and SparkSQL are not supported with Livy in
            Hue
Hue does not support configuring and using PySpark and SparkSQL
            with Livy in CDP Private Cloud Base.


Importing and exporting Oozie workflows across clusters and
            between different CDH versions is not supported

You can export Oozie workflows, schedules, and bundles from Hue and import them only
              within the same cluster if the cluster is unchanged. You can migrate bundle and
              coordinator jobs with their workflows only if their arguments have not changed between
              the old and the new cluster. For example, hostnames, NameNode, Resource Manager names,
              YARN queue names, and all the other parameters defined in the
                workflow.xml and job.properties files.
Using the import-export feature to migrate data between clusters is not recommended.
              To migrate data between different versions of CDH, for example, from CDH 5 to CDP 7,
              you must take the dump of the Hue database on the old cluster, restore it on the new
              cluster, and set up the database in the new environment. Also, the authentication
              method on the old and the new cluster should be the same because the Oozie workflows
              are tied to a user ID, and the exact user ID needs to be present in the new
              environment so that when a user logs into Hue, they can access their respective
              workflows.
noteMigrating Oozie workflows from HDP clusters is not
              supported.
