Known Issues in Navigator Encrypt
Learn about the known issues in Navigator Encrypt, the impact or changes to the
        functionality, and the workaround.


GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) is not enabled for the
                    repositories in the packages. You cannot use the packages without disabling GPG
                    checking.
To use the packages, disable GPG checking when you
                    are creating a local repository:
On RedHat: Add gpgcheck=0 to the repo file
On Ubuntu: Add [trusted=yes] to the entry added to
                                '/etc/apt/sources.listâ€™. For example, deb
                                [trusted=yes] file:///etc/navencrypt-repo. 



If you are using Ubuntu 20.04, hosts must be running Linux
                    kernel 5.8 and higher.
None


A host reboot might be required before NavEncrypt is started.
If while installing NavEncrypt, the cryptsetup package is also installed, a host
                reboot might be required before NavEncrypt is started.

Failed to start navencrypt-mount.service
If the comand "systemctl status navencrypt-mount" fails with the error: "Failed to
                start navencrypt-mount.service: Unit navencrypt-mount.service failed to load: No
                such file or directory", the kernel's kdbus component might be misconfigured. 
Workaround:To completely disable kdbus: The boot grub file must be modified to
                add "--set kdbus=0" to the kernel boot options.
Do this using the proper kernel tool. This seems to happen on SLES12SP5. Care must be
                taken when doing this as the grub configuration is integral to the host booting.
