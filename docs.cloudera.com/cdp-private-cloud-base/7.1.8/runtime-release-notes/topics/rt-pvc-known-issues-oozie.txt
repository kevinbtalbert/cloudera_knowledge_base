CDPD-46049: SSH action fails when oozie.action.ssh.http.command.post.options property contains double quotes.
You must disable capture-output in the SSH action.


CDPD-41274: HWC + Oozie issue: Could not open client transport with JDBC Uri

Currently only Spark cluster mode is supported in the Oozie Spark Action with Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC).

Use Spark action in cluster mode.
                    Use Spark action in cluster mode.
<spark xmlns="uri:oozie:spark-action:1.0">
                        ...
                        <mode>cluster</mode>

CDPD-26975: Using the ABFS / S3A connectors in an Oozie workflow where the operations are "secured" may trigger an IllegalArgumentException with the error message java.net.URISyntaxException: Relative path in absolute URI. 
Set the following XML configuration in the Datahub cluster's Cloudera Manager:
                    
In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to the
                            Oozie service.
Click the Configuration tab.
In the Oozie Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                            Valve) for oozie-site.xml field, set the

OOZIE-3549: Oozie fails to start when Cloudera Manager 7.x is used with Cloudera Runtime 6.x and Java 11 because Oozie does not set the trust-store password.
The issue is fixed in OOZIE-3549 and is already included in CDP 7.x but not in CDH 6.x. If you are on CDH 6.x and want to upgrade to Java 11 or your Cloudera Manager to 7.x then you must request for a patch.


Oozie jobs fail (gracefully) on secure YARN clusters when JobHistory server is
                    down

If the JobHistory server is down on a YARN (MRv2) cluster, Oozie attempts to
                        submit a job, by default, three times. If the job fails, Oozie automatically
                        puts the workflow in a SUSPEND state.

When the JobHistory server is running again, use the
                        resume command to inform Oozie to continue the workflow
                    from the point at which it left off.


Unsupported Feature

The following Oozie features are currently not supported in Cloudera Data
                            Platform:
Non-support for Pig action (CDPD-1070)
Conditional coordinator input logic

Cloudera does not support using Derby database with Oozie. You can use it for
                        testing or debugging purposes, but Cloudera does not recommend using it in
                        production environments. This could cause failures while upgrading from CDH
                        to CDP.
