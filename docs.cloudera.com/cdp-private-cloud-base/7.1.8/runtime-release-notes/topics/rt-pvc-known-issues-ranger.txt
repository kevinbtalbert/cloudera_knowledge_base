CDPD-41582: Atlas Resource Lookup : Classification for "entity-type"

{"resourceName":
              "classification", "userInput": "", "resources": {"classification":
            []}}]expectation is to return all the classifications . But the response
            has only "classification"Happens similarly for entity-label ,
            entity-business-metadata.
None.


CDPD-42598: Kafka policy creation allowed with incorrect
          permissions.  
When creating a Kafka policy from the UI, the permissions
          "Idempotent write"and "Cluster action" are not displayed as they are not applicable for
          the "topic" resource, but when creating a policy for the "topic" resource with the
          permissions "Idempotent write" and "Cluster Action", the policy is created successfully
          when the expected behaviour is that the policy creation must fail as the permission is
          not applicable for the Kafka topic resource
None.
