CDPD-40380: Authorization checking issue when Kerberos is
     disabled

Due to an issue in Ranger, when Kerberos is disabled then it is not possible to check
      authorization.



Open SR config in Cloudera Manager.
Find the "ranger.plugin.schema-registry.service.name" field.
Replace GENERATED_RANGER_SERVICE_NAME with the actual name of the service.
Restart Schema Registry.




CDPD-49304: AvroConverter does not support composite default
     values
AvroConverter cannot handle schemas containing a
      STRUCT type default value.
None.


OPSAPS-66356: Schema Registry's integration with Atlas does not work
     in secure clusters where Ranger authorization is enabled
Due to an error in the default Ranger policies for Atlas, the
     integration between Schema Registry and Atlas does not work. As a result, Schema Registry
     related entities (metadata) are not created in Atlas. Viewing or monitoring schema entity
     relationships is not possible. If this issue is present in your cluster, the following
     exceptions will be present in the Schema Registry and Atlas server's log:
Schema Registry server
       logERROR com.cloudera.dim.atlas.bootstrap.AtlasModelBootstrap: Error while setting up the Schema Registry model in Atlas.
Atlas Server
       logorg.apache.atlas.exception.AtlasBaseException: schemaregistry is not authorized to perform create entity-def schema_metadata_info



Access the Ranger Console (Ranger Admin web UI).
Click the cm_atlas resource-based service.
Add the schemaregistry user to the default policies.All policies that
        require an update will at minimum already contain the beacon,
         dpprofiler, atlas, admin, and
         nifi users. Adding the schemaregistry user to the
         Allow users to manage favorite searches default policy is not
        required.
Restart the Schema Registry service.Restarting the services triggers the creation of
        the missing entities in Atlas.




CDPD-54379: KafkaJsonSerializer and KafkaJsonDeserializer do not allow
     null values
KafkaJsonSerializer and
      KafkaJsonDeserializer do not allow the data to be null, resulting in a
      NullPointerException (NPE).
None.


CDPD-49217 and CDPD-50309: Schema Registry caches user group
     membership indefinitely

Schema Registry caches the Kerberos user and group information indefinitely and does not
      catch up on group membership changes.

Restart Schema Registry after group membership changes.


CDPD-56890: New schemas cannot be created following an upgrade
If you delete the latest version of a schema (the one with the highest
     ID) from the Schema Registry database before an upgrade, you might not be able to create new
     schemas after you upgrade the cluster to a newer version.importantIn CDP Private Cloud Base, this issue only manifests when upgrading from
      Cloudera Runtime 7.1.7 or lower to 7.1.8 or higher.


Access the Schema Registry database. Go to Cloudera Manager > Schema Registry > Configuration and search for "database" if you don't know the name, host, or port of the
       Schema Registry database.
Cross reference the ID's in the schemaVersionId column of the
        schmema_version_state table with the ID's found in the
        schema_version_info table.
Delete all records from the schema_version_state table that contains a
        schemaVersionId not present in the schema_version_info
       table.




CDPD-58265: Schema Registry Client incorrectly applies SSL
          configuration
The Cloudera distributed Schema Registry Java client might fail to
          apply the SSL configurations correctly with concurrent access in Jersey clients due to a
            Jersey issue related to JDK.
Before using HttpsURLConnection in any form
          concurrently, call
            javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultSSLSocketFactory() once in
          the custom client application.


OPSAPS-68139: Schema Registry does not apply cluster wide Kerberos
          principal mapping by default
Schema Registry does not apply the cluster-wide Kerberos
          auth-to-local (ATL) rules from the Core Setting service.
Manually set the Schema Registry Kerberos Name
            Rules property to match the configuration of the Core Setting service.


OPSAPS-68171: Schema Registry does not set Knox principal and
          service user as trusted proxies when using custom Kerberos principals
Schema Registry automatically sets the Knox principal name as a
          trusted proxy. If the Schema Registry Kerberos Name Rules property
          is set in deployments where custom Kerberos principals are used, Knox might not be allowed
          to work as a trusted proxy.
Manually configure the Knox user name by adding the
          following to Schema Registry Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
            Valve) for
          registry.yaml:knox_principal_name=[***KNOX USER NAME***]


CDPD-48822: AvroConverter ignores default values when converting
            from Avro to Connect schema
AvroConverter does not propagate field default values when
            converting Avro schemas to Connect schemas.
None


CDPD-55381: Schema Registry issues authentication cookie for the
          authorized user, not for the authenticated one
When the authenticated user is different from the authorized user,
          which can happen when Schema Registry is used behind Knox, authorization issues can occur
          for subsequent requests as the authentication cookie in Schema Registry stores the
          authorized user.
Access Schema Registry directly, without using Knox, if
          possible. If not, ensure that the name of the end user that tries to connect does not
          begin with knox.
