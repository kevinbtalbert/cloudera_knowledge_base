Learn about the known issues in Spark, the impact or changes to the functionality, and
    the workaround.


CDPD-23817: In the upgraded Cluster, the permission of /tmp/spark is restricted due to the HDP configuration hive.exec.scratchdir=/tmp/spark.
If you are using the /tmp/spark directory in the CDP cluster, you must provide the required additional Policies/ACL permissions.


CDPD-22670 and CDPD-23103: There are two configurations in Spark, "Atlas dependency" and "spark_lineage_enabled", which are conflicted. The issue is when Atlas dependency is turned off but spark_lineage_enabled is turned on.
Run Spark application, Spark will log some error message and cannot continue. That can be restored by correcting the configurations and restarting Spark component with distributing client configurations.


CDPD-23007: Mismatch in the Spark Default DB Location. In HDP 3.1.5, hive_db entities have one attribute - 'location' which is configured to the '/managed' path.
          In fresh install of CDP 7.1.7, hive_db entities now have 2 attributes 'location' configured to '/external' path and 'managedLocation' configured to '/managed' path.
          In. the AM2CM migration (HDP 3.1.5 -> CDP 7.1.7), the 'location' attribute from hive_db entities in HDP 3.1.5 comes unaltered to CDP 7.1.7 and hence maps to '/managed' path.
          
This issue arises only if you are upgrading from HDP 3.1.5 to CDP 7.1.7. If you are performing a fresh install of CDP 7.1.7, you can ignore this issue.

CDPD-217: The Apache Spark connector is not supported
The old Apache Spark - Apache HBase Connector
            (shc) is not supported in CDP releases.
Use the new HBase-Spark connector shipped in CDP
          release.


CDPD-3038: Launching pyspark displays several
          HiveConf warning messages
When pyspark starts, several Hive configuration
          warning messages are displayed, similar to the
          following:19/08/09 11:48:04 WARN conf.HiveConf: HiveConf of name hive.vectorized.use.checked.expressions does not exist
19/08/09 11:48:04 WARN conf.HiveConf: HiveConf of name hive.tez.cartesian-product.enabled does not exist
These errors can be safely ignored.
