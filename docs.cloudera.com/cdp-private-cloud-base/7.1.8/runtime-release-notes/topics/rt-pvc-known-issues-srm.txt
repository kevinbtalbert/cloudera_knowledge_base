Known Issues


CDPD-22089: SRM does not sync re-created source topics until the
            offsets have caught up with target topic
 Messages written to topics that were deleted and re-created are
            not replicated until the source topic reaches the same offset as the target topic. For
            example, if at the time of deletion and re-creation there are a 100 messages on the
            source and target clusters, new messages will only get replicated once the re-created
            source topic has 100 messages. This leads to messages being lost.

CDPD-11079: Blacklisted topics appear in the list of replicated
            topics
If a topic was originally replicated but was later excluded for
            replication, it will still appear as a replicated topic under the
              /remote-topics REST API endpoint. As a result, if a call is made to
            this endpoint, this topic will be included in the response. Additionally, the excluded
            topic will also be visible in the SMM UI. However, it's Partitions and Consumer Groups
            will be 0, its Throughput, Replication Latency and Checkpoint Latency will show
            N/A.

OPSAPS-67772: SRM Service metrics processing fails when the
            noexec option is enabled for /tmp
The SRM Service role uses /tmp to extract
            RocksDB .so files, which are required for metrics processing to
            function. If the noexec option is enabled for the
              /tmp directory, the SRM Service role is not able load the
            required RocksDB files. This results in metrics processing failing.


In Cloudera Manager, select the SRM service and go to
                  Configuration.
Add the following to SRM Service Environment Advanced Configuration
                  Snippet (Safety Valve). Do this for all SRM Service role
                  instances.ROCKSDB_SHAREDLIB_DIR=[***PATH***]Replace
                    [***PATH***] with a directory that is not
                    /tmp.




OPSAPS-67738: SRM Service role's Remote Querying feature does
            not work when the noexec option is enabled for /tmp

The SRM Service role puts the Netty native libraries into the
                /tmp directory. As a result, If the noexec
              option is enabled for the /tmp directory, the Remote Querying
              feature will fail to function.



In Cloudera Manager, select the SRM service and go to
                  Configuration.
Add the following to
                SRM_JVM_PERF_OPTS.-Dio.netty.native.workdir=[***PATH***]Replace
                  [***PATH***] with a directory that is not
                  /tmp.




OPSAPS-67742: The SRM Service role fails to start if properties
            are added to Additional Configs For Streams Application Running Inside SRM Service 
Configuring the SRM Service role's internal Kafka Streams
            application is not possible. If you add any properties to Using the
              Additional Configs For Streams Application Running Inside SRM Service, the
            SRM Service role fails to start. If you are affected by this issue, an exception similar
            to the following will be present in the SRM Service role's
              stderr.log:o.dropwizard.configuration.ConfigurationParsingException: /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/132-streams_replication_manager-STREAMS_REPLICATION_MANAGER_SERVICE/srm-service.yaml has an error: * Malformed YAML at line: 66, column: 49; mapping values are not allowed here in 'reader', line 65, column 48:

CDPD-60426: Configuration changes are lost following a rolling
            restart of the service
In certain cases, SRM might fail to apply configuration
            updates if the service is restarted with a rolling restart. In a case like this,
            configuration changes are ignored without any warning or indication. This issue also
            affects rolling upgrades.
When restarting the service, use Actions >  > Restart instead of Actions >  > Rolling Restart after making configuration changes. When upgrading a cluster, ensure that
            SRM is not restarted with a rolling restart.



Limitations



SRM cannot replicate Ranger authorization policies to or from
              Kafka clusters
Due to a limitation in the Kafka-Ranger plugin, SRM cannot
              replicate Ranger policies to or from clusters that are configured to use Ranger for
              authorization. If you are using SRM to replicate data to or from a cluster that uses
              Ranger, disable authorization policy synchronization in SRM. This can be achieved by
              clearing the Sync Topic Acls Enabled
                (sync.topic.acls.enabled) checkbox.


SRM cannot ensure the exactly-once semantics of transactional
              source topics
SRM data replication uses at-least-once guarantees, and as a
              result cannot ensure the exactly-once semantics (EOS) of transactional topics in the
              backup/target cluster.note Even though EOS is not guaranteed, you can still
                replicate the data of a transactional source, but you must set
                  isolation.level to read_committed for SRM's
                internal consumers. This can be done by adding [***CONFIG LEVEL
                    PREFIX***].isolation.level=read_committed to the
                  Streams Replication Manager's Replication Configs SRM
                service property in Cloudera Manger. The isolation.level property
                can be set on a global connector or replication level. For
                example:#Global connector level
connectors.consumer.isolation.level=read_committed
#Replication level
uswest->useast.consumer.isolation.level=read_committed


SRM checkpointing is not supported for transactional source
              topics
SRM does not correctly translate checkpoints (committed
              consumer group offsets) for transactional topics. Checkpointing assumes that the
              offset mapping function is always increasing, but with transactional source topics
              this is violated. Transactional topics have control messages in them, which take up an
              offset in the log, but they are never returned on the consumer API. This causes the
              mappings to decrease, causing issues in the checkpointing feature. As a result of this
              limitation, consumer failover operations for transactional topics is not
              possible.
