BUG-125263: Zeppelin service move fails on clusters upgraded from HDP3.1.5
Resolve the circular symlink issue on the Zeppelin node by
          linking the conf directory to a new directory under /etc/zeppelin:
            
# mkdir -p /etc/zeppelin/<version>/0

# rm /usr/hdp/<version>/zeppelin/conf

# ln -s /etc/zeppelin/<version>/0
                /usr/hdp/<version>/zeppelin/conf
 Where version is the HDP version. For example, 7.1.x-yyy. Restart the Zeppelin
          server in Ambari.


CDPD-3090: Due to a configuration typo, functionality involving
          notebook repositories does not work
Due to a missing closing brace, access to the notebook repositories
          API is blocked by default.
From the CDP Management Console, go to Cloudera
          Manager for the cluster running Zeppelin. On the Zeppelin
          configuration page (Zeppelin
              service > Configuration),
          enter shiro urls in the Search
          field, and then add the missing closing brace to the
            notebook-repositories URL, as
            follows:/api/notebook-repositories/** = authc, roles[{{zeppelin_admin_group}}]Click
              Save Changes, and restart the Zeppelin
            service.


CDPD-2406: Logout button does not work
Clicking the Logout button in the Zeppelin UI
          logs you out, but then immediately logs you back in using SSO.
Close the browser.

OPSAPS-59802: Zeppelin and Livy roles should be co-located on the same host.
When installing or upgrading to CDP Private Cloud Base, you must co-locate all Zeppelin and Livy roles on the same cluster host due to an issue with certificate generation.
