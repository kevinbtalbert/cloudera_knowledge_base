Known Issues in Apache ZooKeeper
Learn about the known issues in ZooKeeper, the impact or changes to the functionality,
    and the workaround.


OPSAPS-61188: Zookeeper start fails with custom user as contents
          inside /var/lib/zookeeper have "zookeeper" as owner instead of the custom user 
In Cloudera Manager the Process Username
          for ZooKeeper can be changed from the default zookeeper value to any
          custom value. This configuration change in Cloudera Manager automatically changes the
          owner of the var/lib/zookeeper folder but keeps
            zookeeper as the owner of any folders or files inside
            var/lib/zookeeper, such as myid and
            version-2. As a result ZooKeeper fails to start because it needs to
          read the snapshots and txnlogs from the var/lib/zookeeper/version-2
          folder when starting. 


Ensure that you changed the Process Username to a username
              that exists on the OS.
Manually change the owner.
Log in to the node.
Recursively change the owner of var/lib/zookeeper using the
                    chown -R command.





Zookeeper-client does not use ZooKeeper TLS/SSL automatically
The command-line tool ‘zookeeper-client’ is installed to all Cloudera Nodes and it can
            be used to start the default Java command line ZooKeeper client. However even when
            ZooKeeper TLS/SSL is enabled, the zookeeper-client command connects to localhost:2181,
            without using TLS/SSL.
Manually configure the 2182 port, when zookeeper-client connects to a ZooKeeper
            cluster.The following is an example of connecting to a specific three-node ZooKeeper
            cluster using TLS/SSL:
            CLIENT_JVMFLAGS="-Dzookeeper.clientCnxnSocket=org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxnSocketNetty -Dzookeeper.ssl.keyStore.location=<path to your configured keystore> -Dzookeeper.ssl.keyStore.password=<the password you configured for the keystore>  -Dzookeeper.ssl.trustStore.location=<path to your configured truststore> -Dzookeeper.ssl.trustStore.password=<the password you configured for the truststore> -Dzookeeper.client.secure=true" zookeeper-client -server <your.zookeeper.server-1>:2182,<your.zookeeper.server-2>:2182,<your.zookeeper.server-3>:2182
