Learn about the new features of Apache HDFS in Cloudera Runtime 7.1.8.
Support for Multiple NameNodes
This feature provides CDP Private Cloud Base the ability to use multiple standby namenodes. This feature is enabled only for the 7.1.8 clusters. This requires the High Availability feature enabled. After configuring an additional NameNode to the cluster, you cannot roll back either the Cloudera Manager upgrade or the CDP parcel upgrade. You must add an additional namenode after the upgrade to 718 is finalized.
For more information, see Multiple NameNodes documentation.
