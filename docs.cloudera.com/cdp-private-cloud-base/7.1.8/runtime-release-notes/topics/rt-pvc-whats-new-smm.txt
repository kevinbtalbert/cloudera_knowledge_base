What's new in Streams Messaging Manager
Learn about the new features for Streams Messaging Manager in Cloudera Runtime
  7.1.8.
Improvement in the Connect tab of the SMM UI
You can now deploy Kafka Connect connector configurations containing secret properties which
    will be stored in an encrypted storage (by default in Kafka). The deployed configuration will
    only contain references to these secrets. With this comes the need to mark properties as secret
    on the Streams Messaging Manager user interface so a new connector creation form is introduced,
    which supports it. You can import configurations and populate the form automatically.

Data Explorer Performance Optimization
The Data Explorer performance has been improved. The SMM UI has the following
    changes:

'null' values are shown explicitly as null (in italics to signify its not the
     string literal 'null').
Message keys can now be truncated as well and have a 'show more' button.
When the 'show more' button is clicked the non-truncated key/value if
     fetched.
Truncated content <1MB are opened in a modal, otherwise a new tab is opened and
     the content is written to it.
Numerical values >9007199254740991 are now shown correctly.


Kafka Connect improvement


In NiFi connectors you can now provide file path or URL for the
       flow.snapshot or alternatively you can browse the file in the SMM UI and
      then populate the flow.snapshot property with the content of that file.
You can now import Connector Configurations as a whole instead of adding individual
      configurations.
Connector configuration validation errors are now correlated with individual config
      key.
Sensitive properties are now hidden from the SMM UI and support is added to set properties
      as sensitive.
To monitor and manage Kafka Connect in SMM, a number of SMM service properties must be
      configured. From now on, these properties are automatically configured if Kafka
       Connect Host is left empty (default). This means that the SMM service
      automatically configures itself to connect to its co-located Kafka Connect instance. You can
      provide custom values for all properties if you want to override the defaults. The
      automatically configured properties are as follows:
Kafka Connect Host
Kafka Connect Port
Kafka Connect Protocol




Partition dimension removal in SMM
The partition dimensions of the producer ("/api/v2/admin/metrics/aggregated/producers") and
    consumer ("/api/v2/admin/metrics/aggregated/groups") metrics are removed from the SMM cache, and
    are not exposed anymore through the API. This made the SMM memory footprint smaller, relieved
    some of the load from the metric store, and the network traffic became smaller. With this
    change, you get a cleaner, and easily readable API, and the UI is snappier, and faster than
    before.
The version of the /api/v1/admin/metrics/aggregated/* and /api/v1/admin/lineage/* endpoints
    have been changed to /api/v2/admin/aggregated and /api/v2/admin/lineage. With this change, the
    response objects are changed as well.
For the /lineage endpoints a common lineage response object is introduced in v2 as opposed to
    the specific (and different) objects in the experimental v1 endpoint.
For the /aggregated/* endpoints, the partition level metrics (that were in the
    wrappedPartitionMetrics field) are removed. Partition level metrics have been removed from the
    /aggregate/producers and /aggregated/producers/{producerClientId} but they are still available
    in the corresponding /metrics/producers and /metrics/producers/{producerId} endpoints.

Ability to reset consumer group offsets in SMM
Users are now able to reset consumer group offsets so that the consumers will consume messages
    again. This is especially helpful when a bulk data import operation fails and needs to be
    retried.

Stateless Sink and Source should populate Key/Value Converters
SMM UI Connector Creation page now contains a default key/value converter to the
    StatelessNiFiSource or StatelessNiFiSink connectors.

SMM UI shows the replication status tooltip
Streams Messaging Manager now shows tooltip for the replication status.

On the Overview page the lineage information shown is adjusted
On the Overview page, when a Producer or a Consumer is selected, an arrow points to the
    topic(s) it produced to or consumed from, instead of the partitions.

SMM: HA Support for Oracle Database with RAC
Added HA support for Oracle database with RAC for SMM.

Added API to enrich a connector sample configuration
Streams Messaging Manager API /connector-templates/config/enhance is added, which accepts a
    sample connector configuration and enhances it with the properties that are probably needed for
    that connector.

Added emit.consumer.metrics config to SMM CSD, and removed unused SMON host/port
    configs
Removed "cm.metrics.service.monitor.host" and "cm.metrics.service.monitor.port"
    configurations from Streams Messaging Manager.
These no longer have to be configured as SMM automatically detects ServiceMonitor's location
    and emits the ConsumerGroup metrics into it.
Added "emit.consumer.metrics" configuration to Streams Messaging Manager.
In case this flag is disabled, Streams Messaging Manager does not emit historic ConsumerGroup
    metrics into ServiceMonitor, meaning historic metrics (for group Lag and CommittedOffset) would
    not be available for Groups in SMM. These metrics are used to populate the charts at the bottom
    of the ConsumerGroupDetail page, or accessed through the
    "api/v2/admin/metrics/consumers/group/{groupId}" REST API endpoint.

The SMM API now hides email notifier SMTP passwords in its response
Previously the /notifiers endpoint returned the full configuration of the
    notifier. In the case of email notifiers, the configuration included the password of the SMTP
    server. API responses from now on do not include the password. As result of this change, the
     PASSWORD field of existing email notifiers is left blank when you edit
    them. If you decide to edit the notifier you must reenter the password. 

Added common parameters for Stateless NiFi Connectors in SMM
The following new properties are added to SMM to support Stateless NiFi Connectors. Users can
    add these to the connector config json manually any time.
