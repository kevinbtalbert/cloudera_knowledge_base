What's New in Apache Solr
Learn about the new features of Solr in Cloudera Runtime 7.1.8.
 The MapReduceIndexerTool now supports ingesting parquet DECIMAL data into Solr
The ReadAvroParquetFile morphline command got a new attribute,
          decimalConversionEnabled. When set to true, decimal
        Parquet data is correctly read (instead of returning raw bytes as earlier). Its default
        value is false for backwards compatibility.
Decimal data can be stored as a string, float or double Solr field. Only storage as string
        is lossless, float and double can result in loss of precision.

Optimize phase of MRIT reducers can now be skipped
This release adds a new feature to MapReduceIndexerTool (MRIT) that allows skipping the
        optimize phase of reducers. To skip the optimize operation at the end of reducers, set the
        value of the maxSegments parameter to 0 or
          -1. You can set the value of this parameter using the
          --max-segments CLI option.
