Discontinued maintenance of direct mode
The Sqoop direct mode feature is no longer maintained. This feature was primarily designed to
        import data from an abandoned database, which is no longer updated. Using direct mode has
        several drawbacks:
Imports can cause an intermittent and overlapping input split.
Imports can generate duplicate data. 
Many problems, such as intermittent failures, can occur.
Additional configuration is required.

Do not use the --direct option in Sqoop import or export commands.
