Access HDFS from the NFS Gateway
To access HDFS, you must first mount the namespace and then set up the NFS client
      hosts to interact with HDFS through the Gateway.
Mount the HDFS namespace.
mount -t nfs -o vers=3,proto=tcp,nolock,sync,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576
                  $server:/ $mount_pointAccess HDFS as part of the local file system,
                  except that hard link or symbolic link and random write are not
                  supported.noteBecause NLM is not supported, the mount option
                     nolock is required.You can use the sync
                     option for improving the performance and reliability when writing large files.
                     If the sync option is specified, the NFS client flushes write operations to the
                     NFS Gateway before returning control to the client application. Additionally,
                     the client does not issue reordered writes. This reduces buffering requirements
                     on the NFS gateway.

Set up the NFS client users to interact with HDFS through the NFS Gateway.
