Add HDFS system mount
After installing hadoop-hdfs-fuse and configuring the test mount,
        you can add a persistent HDFS system mount.




Open /etc/fstab and append information about the hostname, the
                    NameNode port, and the mount point in the specified format.
The format is as follows:
                        hadoop-fuse-dfs#dfs://<name_node_hostname>:<namenode_port> <mount_point> fuse allow_other,usetrash,rw 2 0For
                        example:hadoop-fuse-dfs#dfs://localhost:8020 /mnt/hdfs fuse allow_other,usetrash,rw 2 0note
In an HA deployment, use the HDFS nameservice instead of the NameNode
                            URI; that is, use the value of dfs.nameservices in
                                hdfs-site.xml.


Test to make sure the mount point is working properly

mount <mount_point>


Your system is now configured to allow you to use the
                ls command and use that mount point as if it were a normal system
                disk.For more information, see the help for
                hadoop-fuse-dfs:hadoop-fuse-dfs --help
