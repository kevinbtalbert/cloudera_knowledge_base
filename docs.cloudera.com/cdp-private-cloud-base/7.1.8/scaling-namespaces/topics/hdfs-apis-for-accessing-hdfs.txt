APIs for accessing
      HDFS
Use the WebHDFS REST API to access an HDFS cluster from applications external to the
      cluster. WebHDFS supports all HDFS user operations including reading files, writing to files,
      making directories, changing permissions and renaming. In addition, WebHDFS uses Kerberos and
      delegation tokens for authenticating users.
Set up WebHDFS on a secure clusterSetting up WebHDFS on a secure cluster requires you to update certain properties on          hdfs-site.xml, create an HTTP service user principal, create a keytab for       the principal, and verify the association of the principal and keytab with the correct HTTP       service.
