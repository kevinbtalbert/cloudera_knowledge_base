Balancing data across an
            HDFS cluster
The HDFS Balancer is a tool for balancing the data across the storage devices of a
            HDFS cluster.
You can also specify the
         source DataNodes, to free up the spaces in particular DataNodes. You can use a block
         distribution application to pin its block replicas to particular DataNodes so that the
         pinned replicas are not moved for cluster balancing.

Why HDFS data becomes unbalancedFactors such as addition of DataNodes, block allocation in HDFS, and behavior of the       client application can lead to the data stored in HDFS clusters becoming       unbalanced.Configurations and CLI options for the HDFS BalancerYou can configure the HDFS Balancer by changing various configuration options or by       using the command line.Cluster balancing algorithmThe HDFS Balancer runs in iterations. Each iteration contains the following four       steps: storage group classification, storage group pairing, block move scheduling, and block       move execution.Exit statuses for the HDFS BalancerThe HDFS Balancer concludes a cluster balancing operation with a specific exit status       that indicates whether the operation succeeded or failed, with supporting reasons.Parent topic: Optimizing data storage
