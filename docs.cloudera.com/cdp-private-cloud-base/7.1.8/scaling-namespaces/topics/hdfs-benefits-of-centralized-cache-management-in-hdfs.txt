Benefits of centralized
      cache management in HDFS
Centralized cache management in HDFS offers many significant advantages such as
      explicit pinning, querying cached blocks for task placement, and improving cluster memory
      utilization.


Explicit pinning prevents frequently used data from being evicted from
                        memory. This is particularly important when the size of the working set
                        exceeds the size of main memory, which is common for many HDFS
                        workloads.


Because DataNode caches are managed by the NameNode, applications can
                        query the set of cached block locations when making task placement
                        decisions. Co-locating a task with a cached block replica improves read
                        performance.


When a block has been cached by a DataNode, clients can use a more efficient
               zero-copy read API. Since checksum verification of cached data is done once by the
               DataNode, clients can incur essentially zero overhead when using this new API.


Centralized caching can improve overall cluster memory utilization. When
                        relying on the operating system buffer cache on each DataNode, repeated
                        reads of a block will result in all n replicas of the
                        block being pulled into the buffer cache. With centralized cache management,
                        you can explicitly pin only m of the n
                        replicas, thereby saving n-m memory.
