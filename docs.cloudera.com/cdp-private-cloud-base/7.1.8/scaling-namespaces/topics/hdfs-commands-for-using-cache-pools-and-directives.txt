Commands for using cache pools and directives
You can use the Command-Line Interface (CLI) to create, modify, and list cache pools
      and cache directives using the hdfs cacheadmin subcommand.
Cache Directives are identified by a unique, non-repeating, 64-bit
        integer ID. IDs will not be reused even if a Cache Directive is
        removed.
Cache Pools are identified by a unique string name.
You must first create a Cache Pool, and then add Cache Directives to
        the Cache Pool.

Cache Pool Commands




addPool -- Adds a new Cache Pool.
Usage:
hdfs cacheadmin -addPool <name> [-owner <owner>] [-group <group>] 
[-mode <mode>] [-limit <limit>] [-maxTtl <maxTtl>]
Options:Table 1. Cache Pool Add Options

Option
Description




<name>

The name of the pool.



<owner>

The user name of the owner of the pool. Defaults to
                      the current user.



<group>

The group that the pool is assigned to. Defaults to
                      the primary group name of the current user.



<mode>

The UNIX-style permissions assigned to the pool.
                      Permissions are specified in octal (e.g. 0755). Pool
                      permissions are set to 0755 by default.



<limit>

The maximum number of bytes that can be cached by
                      directives in the pool, in aggregate. By default, no limit
                      is set.



<maxTtl>

The maximum allowed time-to-live for directives being
                      added to the pool. This can be specified in seconds,

                      units are [smhd]. By default, no maximum is set. A value
