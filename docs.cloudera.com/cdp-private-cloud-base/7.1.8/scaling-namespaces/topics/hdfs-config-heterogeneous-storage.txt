Configuring heterogeneous storage in HDFS
A variety of storage types are supported with HDFS. You can choose which storage type
        to assign to each DataNode Data Directory. Specifying a storage type allows you to optimize
        your data usage and lower your costs, based on your data usage frequency.
Each DataNode in a cluster is configured with a set of data directories. You can
            configure each data directory with a storage type. The storage policy dictates which
            storage types to use when storing the file or directory.
Some reasons to consider using different types of storage are as follows:
You have datasets with temporal locality (for example, time-series data). The
                    latest data can be loaded initially into SSD for improved performance, then
                    migrated out to disk as it ages.
You need to move cold data to denser archival storage because the data will
                    rarely be accessed and archival storage is much cheaper. This could be done with
                    simple age-out policies: for example, moving data older than six months to
                    archival storage.


HDFS storage typesThe storage type associated with HDFS identifies the underlying storage media. HDFS storage policiesA storage policy contains information that describes the type of storage to use. This       policy also defines the fallback storage type if the primary type is out of space or out of       quota. If a target storage type is not available, HDFS attempts to place replicas on the       default storage type.Commands for configuring storage policiesDepending on your requirements, use the hdfs storagepolicy         sub-commands to set storage policies or list the storage policies applied on a file or a         directory.Set up a storage policy for HDFSYou can use Cloudera Manager to set up storage policy on a DataNode data         directory.Set up SSD storage using Cloudera ManagerYou can use Cloudera Manager to set up SSD storage for your data         directories.Configure archival storageTo configure archival storage for a DataNode, you must assign the ARCHIVE storage type       to the DataNode, set storage policies, and move blocks that violate the storage policy to the       appropriate storage type.The HDFS mover commandYou can use the hdfs mover command to move replicas of data blocks         that violate the storage policy set on a file or a directory to a storage type that fulfills         the policy requirements.Parent topic: Optimizing data storage
