Configuring Proxy Users to Access HDFS
Hadoop allows you to configure proxy users to submit jobs or access HDFS on behalf of
    other users; this is called impersonation. When you enable impersonation, any jobs
    submitted using a proxy are executed with the impersonated user's existing privilege levels
    rather than those of a superuser (such as hdfs). 
Because all proxy users are configured in one location, core-site.xml,
      Hadoop administrators to implement centralized access control. 
To configure proxy users, set the
        hadoop.proxyuser.<proxy_user>.hosts,
        hadoop.proxyuser.<proxy_group>.groups and
        hadoop.proxyuser.<proxy_user>.users in
        core-site.xml properties.
For example, to allow user alice to impersonate a user
      belonging to group_a and group_b, set
        hadoop.proxyuser.<proxy_group>.groups as
      follows:

   <property>
     <name>hadoop.proxyuser.alice.groups</name>
     <value>group_a,group_b</value>
   </property>

To limit the hosts from which impersonated connections are allowed, use
        hadoop.proxyuser.<proxy_user>.hosts. For example, to
      allow user alice impersonated connections only from
        host_a and host_b:
<property>
   <name>hadoop.proxyuser.alice.hosts</name>
   <value>host_a,host_b</value>
</property>
If the configuration properties described are not present, impersonation
      is not allowed and connections will fail.
For looser restrictions, use a wildcard (*) to allow
      impersonation from any host and of any user. For example, to allow user
        bob to impersonate any user belonging to any group, and
      from any host, set the properties as follows:
  <property>
    <name>hadoop.proxyuser.bob.hosts</name>
    <value>*</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hadoop.proxyuser.bob.groups</name>
    <value>*</value>
  </property>

The hadoop.proxyuser.<proxy_user>.hosts property also accepts
      comma-separated lists of IP addresses, IP address ranges in CIDR format, or host names. For
      example, to allow user kate access from hosts in the range
        10.222.0.0-15 and 10.113.221.221, to impersonate
        user_a and user_b, set the proxy user properties as
      follows:
<property>
     <name>hadoop.proxyuser.super.hosts</name>
     <value>10.222.0.0/16,10.113.221.221</value>
</property>
<property>
     <name>hadoop.proxyuser.super.users</name>
     <value>user1,user2</value>
</property>
