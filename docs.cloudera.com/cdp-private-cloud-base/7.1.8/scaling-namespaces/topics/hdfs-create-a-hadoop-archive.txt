Create a Hadoop
      archive
Use the hadoop archive command to invoke the Hadoop archiving
      tool.

Run the hadoop archive command by specifying the archive name to create, the parent
               directory relative to the archive location, the source files to archive, and the
               destination archive location.
hadoop archive -archiveName name -p <parent> <src>* <dest>The
                  archive name must have a .har extensionnote

Archiving does not delete the source files. If you want to delete the input
                        files after creating an archive to reduce namespace, you must manually
                        delete the source files.
Although the hadoop archive command can be run from the
                        host file system, the archive file is created in the HDFS file system from
                        directories that exist in HDFS. If you reference a directory on the host
                        file system and not HDFS, the system displays the following
                        error:The resolved paths set is empty. Please check whether the srcPaths exist, where srcPaths
 = [</directory/path>] 



Consider the following example of archiving two
            files:hadoop archive -archiveName foo.har -p /user/hadoop dir1 dir2 /user/zooThis
            example creates an archive using /user/hadoop as the relative archive
            directory. The directories /user/hadoop/dir1 and
               /user/hadoop/dir2 will be archived in the
               /user/zoo/foo.har archive.
