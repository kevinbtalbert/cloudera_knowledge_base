Use curl to access a URL protected by Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO
To access a URL protected by Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO, ensure that your version of
            curl supports GSS and is capable of running curl
        -V.

Run curl -V.

$ curl -V
curl 7.19.7 (universal-apple-darwin10.0) libcurl/7.19.7 OpenSSL/0.9.8l
zlib/1.2.3
Protocols: tftp ftp telnet dict ldap http file https ftps
Features: GSS-Negotiate IPv6 Largefile NTLM SSL libz


Log on to the KDC using kinit.

$ kinit
Please enter the password for username@LOCALHOST:


Use curl to fetch the protected URL.

$ curl --cacert
              /path/to/truststore.pem --negotiate -u : -b ~/cookiejar.txt -c ~/cookiejar.txt https://localhost:14000/webhdfs/v1/?op=liststatus

where:
The --cacert option is required if you are using
                                TLS/SSL certificates that curl does not recognize by default.
The --negotiate option enables SPNEGO in curl.
The -u: option is required but the username is
                                ignored (the principal that has been specified for
                                    kinit is used).
The -b and -c options are used to
                                store and send HTTP cookies.
Cloudera does not recommend using the -k or
                                    --insecure option as it turns off
                                    curl's ability to verify the certificate.
