Detecting slow
      DataNodes
Slow DataNodes in a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster can negatively impact the cluster
      performance. Therefore, HDFS provides a mechanism to detect and report slow DataNodes that
      have a negative impact on the performance of the cluster.
HDFS is designed to detect
         and recover from complete failure of DataNodes:


There is no single point of failure.


Automatic NameNode failover takes only a few seconds.


Because data replication can be massively parallelized in large clusters,
                        recovery from DataNode loss occurs within minutes.


Most jobs are not affected by DataNode failures.


However, partial failures can negatively affect the performance of running DataNodes:


Slow network connection due to a failing or misconfigured adapter.


Bad OS or JVM settings that affect service performance.


Slow hard disk.


Bad disk controller.


Slow DataNodes can have a
         significant impact on cluster performance. A slow DataNode may continue sending heartbeats
         successfully, and the NameNode will keep redirecting clients to slow DataNodes. HDFS
         DataNode monitoring provides detection and reporting of slow DataNodes that negatively
         affect cluster performance.

Enable disk IO statisticsDisk IO statistics are disabled by default. To enable disk IO statistics on a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, you must set the file IO sampling         percentage to a non-zero value in the hdfs-site.xml file.Enable detection of slow DataNodesWhen slow DataNode detection is enabled, DataNodes collect latency statistics on         their peers during write pipelines, and use periodic outlier detection to determine slow         peers. The NameNode aggregates reports from all DataNodes and flags potentially slow nodes.         Slow DataNode detection is disabled by default.Parent topic: Optimizing performance
