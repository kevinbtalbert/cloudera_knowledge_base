Examples of DistCp commands using the S3 protocol and hidden credentials
You can various distcp command options to copy files between your CDP clusters and
    Amazon S3.

Copying files to Amazon S3

hadoop distcp /user/hdfs/mydata s3a://myBucket/mydata_backup


Copying files from Amazon S3

hadoop distcp s3a://myBucket/mydata_backup //user/hdfs/mydata


Copying files to Amazon S3 using the
                -filters option to exclude specified
              source files 
You specify a file name with the -filters
              option. The referenced file contains regular expressions, one per
              line, that define file name patterns to exclude from the
                distcp job. The pattern specified in the
              regular expression should match the fully-qualified path of the
              intended files, including the scheme (hdfs,
                webhdfs, s3a, etc.). For
              example, the following are valid expressions for excluding
                files:hdfs://x.y.z:8020/a/b/c
webhdfs://x.y.z:50070/a/b/c
s3a://bucket/a/b/cReference the file containing the filter expressions using
                  -filters option. For example:
                hadoop distcp -filters /user/joe/myFilters /user/hdfs/mydata s3a://myBucket/mydata_backup
Contents
                of the sample myFilters
                file:.*foo.*
.*/bar/.*
hdfs://x.y.z:8020/tmp/.*
hdfs://x.y.z:8020/tmp1/file1
The
                regular expressions in the myFilters exclude
                the following files:
.*foo.* – excludes paths that contain the
                    string "foo".
.*/bar/.* – excludes paths that include a
                    directory named bar.
hdfs://x.y.z:8020/tmp/.* – excludes all
                    files in the /tmp directory.
hdfs://x.y.z:8020/tmp1/file1 – excludes
                    the file /tmp1/file1.

Copying files to Amazon S3 with the -overwrite
              option. 
The -overwrite option overwrites destination
              files that already
              exist.hadoop distcp -overwrite /user/hdfs/mydata  s3a://user/mydata_backup


For more information about the -filters,
          -overwrite, and other options, see DistCp Guide: Command Line Options (Apache Software
        Foundation).
