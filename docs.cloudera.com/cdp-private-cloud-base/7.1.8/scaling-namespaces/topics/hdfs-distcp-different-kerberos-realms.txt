Distcp between secure clusters in different Kerberos realms
To use distcp between two secure clusters in different Kerberos
        realms, you must use a single Kerberos principal that can authenticate to both realms. In
        other words, a Kerberos realm trust relationship must exist between the source and
        destination realms. This can be a one-way trust (in either direction), a bi-directional
        trust, or even multiple one-way trusts where both the source and destination realms trust a
        third realm (such as an Active Directory domain).
Ensure that both the secure clusters run a supported version
            of JDK. For more information about the supported JDK versions, see Java Requirements.If there is no trust relationship between the source and destination realms, you cannot use
                distcp to copy data between the clusters, but you can use
            Replication Manager. For details, see Enabling Replication Between Clusters with Kerberos
                Authentication.
Configure source and destination realms in krb5.confYou must ensure that the krb5.conf file on the client from which the             distcp job is submitted includes realm definitions and mappings for         both source and destination realms.Configure HDFS RPC protectionSet the hadoop.rpc.protection property to             authentication in both the clusters between which you want to run             distcp. You can modify the property either in             hdfs-site.xml, or using Cloudera Manager.Configure acceptable Kerberos principal patternsIf the source and destination realms are not configured to trust each             other or do not have the same principal pattern, then you must set         the dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal.pattern property to *         and allow distcp irrespective of the principal patterns of the source and         destination clusters.Specify truststore propertiesIf TLS/SSL is enabled, then you must configure specific properties in the             ssl-client.xml file on the client submitting the distcp job to         establish trust between the target and destination clusters.Set HADOOP_CONF to the destination clusterSet the HADOOP_CONF path to be the destination environment. If you         are not using HFTP, set the HADOOP_CONF path to the source environment         instead.Launch distcpAuthenticate using kinit on the client and then launch the             distcp job.Parent topic: Using DistCp to copy files
