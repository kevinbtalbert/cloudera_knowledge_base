Configure source and destination realms in krb5.conf
You must ensure that the krb5.conf file on the client from which the
            distcp job is submitted includes realm definitions and mappings for
        both source and destination realms.

Include the realm definitions and mappings for both source and destination
                    realms in the krb5.conf file, as specified in the following
                    example.

[realms]
 QA.EXAMPLE.COM = {
  kdc = kdc01.qa.example.com:88
  admin_server = kdc01.qa.example.com:749
 }

 DEV.EXAMPLE.COM = {
  kdc = kdc01.dev.example.com:88
  admin_server = kdc01.dev.example.com:749
 }

[domain_realm]
.qa.example.com = QA.EXAMPLE.COM
qa.example.com = QA.EXAMPLE.COM
.dev.example.com = DEV.EXAMPLE.COM
dev.example.com = DEV.EXAMPLE.COM
