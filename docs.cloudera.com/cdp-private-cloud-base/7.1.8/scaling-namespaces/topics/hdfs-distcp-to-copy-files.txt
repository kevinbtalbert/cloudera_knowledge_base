Using DistCp to copy filesCloudera DocsUsing DistCp to copy files
Hadoop DistCp (distributed copy) can be used to copy data between CDP clusters
    (and also within a CDP cluster).
DistCp uses MapReduce to implement its distribution, error handling, and reporting. It expands
      a list of files and directories into map tasks, each of which copies a partition of the files
      specified in the source list.
Using DistCpThe distributed copy command, distcp, is a general utility for copying large data         sets between distributed filesystems within and across clusters. You can also use             distcp to copy data to and from an Amazon S3 bucket. The             distcp command submits a regular MapReduce job that performs a         file-by-file copy.Distcp syntax and examplesYou can use distcp for copying data between CDP clusters. In         addition, you can also use it to copy data between a CDP cluster and Amazon S3 or Azure Data         Lake Storage Gen 2.Using DistCp with Highly Available remote clustersYou can use distcp to copy files between highly available clusters         by configuring access to the remote cluster with the nameservice ID.Using DistCp with Amazon S3You can copy HDFS files to and from an Amazon S3 instance. You must provision an S3     bucket using Amazon Web Services and obtain the access key and secret key. Kerberos setup guidelines for Distcp between secure clustersThere are specific guidelines to consider while setting up Kerberos on secure CDP         clusters for successfully performing distcp between them.Distcp between secure clusters in different Kerberos realmsTo use distcp between two secure clusters in different Kerberos         realms, you must use a single Kerberos principal that can authenticate to both realms. In         other words, a Kerberos realm trust relationship must exist between the source and         destination realms. This can be a one-way trust (in either direction), a bi-directional         trust, or even multiple one-way trusts where both the source and destination realms trust a         third realm (such as an Active Directory domain).Copying data between a secure and an insecure cluster using DistCp and WebHDFSYou can use distcp and WebHDFS to copy data between a secure cluster         and an insecure cluster.Post-migration verificationAfter migrating data between the two clusters, you can use hadoop fs -ls             /basePath to verify the permissions, ownership and other aspects of your files,         and correct any problems before using the files in your new cluster.Using DistCp between HA clusters using Cloudera ManagerTo copy data between HA clusters using distcp, you must configure         specific name service properties to ensure that the HDFS clients in a cluster can access a         remote HA cluster. You can configure these values through advanced configuration snippets in         Cloudera Manager.
