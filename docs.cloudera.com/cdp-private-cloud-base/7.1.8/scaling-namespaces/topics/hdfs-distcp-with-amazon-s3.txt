Using DistCp with Amazon S3
You can copy HDFS files to and from an Amazon S3 instance. You must provision an S3
    bucket using Amazon Web Services and obtain the access key and secret key. 
You can pass these credentials on the distcp command line, or you can
      reference a credential store to "hide" sensitive credentials so that they do not appear in the
      console output, configuration files, or log files.
Amazon S3 block and native filesystems are supported with the
          s3a:// protocol.
Example of an Amazon S3 Block Filesystem URI:
s3a://bucket_name/path/to/file
S3 credentials can be provided in a configuration file (for example,
        core-site.xml):<property>
    <name>fs.s3a.access.key</name>
    <value>...</value>
</property>
<property>
    <name>fs.s3a.secret.key</name>
    <value>...</value>
</property>
 You can also enter the configurations in the Advanced Configuration
        Snippet for core-site.xml, which allows Cloudera Manager to
      manage this configuration.
You can also provide the credentials on the command
        line:hadoop distcp -Dfs.s3a.access.key=... -Dfs.s3a.secret.key=... s3a://
For
        example:hadoop distcp -Dfs.s3a.access.key=myAccessKey -Dfs.s3a.secret.key=mySecretKey /user/hdfs/mydata s3a://myBucket/mydata_backup
importantEntering secrets on the command line is inherently insecure. These secrets
        may be accessed in log files and other artifacts. Cloudera recommends that you use a
        credential provider to store secrets.noteUsing the -diff option
        with the distcp command requires a Distributed FileSystem on both the
        source and destination and is not supported when using distcp to copy data
        to or from Amazon S3.

Using a credential provider to secure S3 credentialsYou can run the distcp command without having to enter the access key     and secret key on the command line. This prevents these credentials from being exposed in     console output, log files, configuration files, and other artifacts. Examples of DistCp commands using the S3 protocol and hidden credentialsYou can various distcp command options to copy files between your CDP clusters and     Amazon S3.Parent topic: Using DistCp to copy files
