Prerequisites for enabling erasure coding
Before enabling erasure coding on your data, you must consider various factors such as
    the type of policy to use, the type of data, and the rack or node requirements.

Note the limitations for EC.
Determine which EC policy you want to use:  
Determine if you want to use EC for existing data or new data. If
          you want to use EC for existing data, you need to replicate that data
          with distcp or BDR.
Verify that your cluster setup meets the rack and node requirements.
