Format for using Hadoop
        archives with MapReduce
To use Hadoop Archives with MapReduce, you must reference files differently than you
        would with the default file system. If you have a Hadoop Archive stored in HDFS in
            /user/zoo/foo.har, you must specify the input directory as
            har:///user/zoo/foo.har to use it as a MapReduce input. 
Because Hadoop Archives are
            exposed as a file system, MapReduce can use all of the logical input files in Hadoop
            Archives as input.
