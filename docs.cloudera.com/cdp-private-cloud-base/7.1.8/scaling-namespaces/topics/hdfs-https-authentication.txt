        have configured Kerberos for the cluster.
importantIf the NameNode, Secondary NameNode, DataNode, JobTracker,
            TaskTrackers, ResourceManager, NodeManagers, HttpFS, or Oozie services are configured to
            use Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication, and two or more of these services are running
            on the same host, then all of the running services must use the same HTTP principal and
            keytab file used for their HTTP endpoints.
