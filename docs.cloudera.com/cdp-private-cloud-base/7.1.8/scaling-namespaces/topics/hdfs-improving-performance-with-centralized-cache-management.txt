Improving performance with
            centralized cache management
Centralized cache management enables you to specify paths to directories that are
            cached by HDFS, thereby improving performance for applications that repeatedly access
            the same data.
Centralized cache management
                  in HDFS is an explicit caching mechanism. The NameNode communicates with DataNodes
                  that have the required data blocks available on disk, and instructs the DataNodes
                  to cache the blocks in off-heap caches.

Benefits of centralized cache management in HDFSCentralized cache management in HDFS offers many significant advantages such as       explicit pinning, querying cached blocks for task placement, and improving cluster memory       utilization.Use cases for centralized cache managementCentralized cache management is useful for files that are accessed repeatedly and for       mixed workloads that have performance SLAs.Centralized cache management architectureIn a centralized cache management, the NameNode is responsible for coordinating all             of the DataNode off-heap caches in the cluster. The NameNode periodically receives a             cache report from each DataNode. The cache report describes all of the blocks cached on             the DataNode. The NameNode manages DataNode caches by piggy-backing cache and uncache             commands on the DataNode heartbeat.Caching terminologyA cache directive defines the path to cache while a cache pool manages groups of             cache directives.Properties for configuring centralized cachingYou must enable JNI to use centralized caching. In addition, you must configure       various properties and consider the locked memory limit for configuring centralized       caching.Commands for using cache pools and directivesYou can use the Command-Line Interface (CLI) to create, modify, and list cache pools       and cache directives using the hdfs cacheadmin subcommand.Parent topic: Optimizing performance
