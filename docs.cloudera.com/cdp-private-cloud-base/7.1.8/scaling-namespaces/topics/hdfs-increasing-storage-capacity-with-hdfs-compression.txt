Increasing storage capacity
        with HDFS compression
Linux supports GzipCodec, DefaultCodec,
            BZip2Codec, LzoCodec, and
        SnappyCodec. Typically, GzipCodec is used for HDFS
        compression. 
To configure data compression, you can either enable a data compression codec, for
            example,  GZipCodec, as the default or use the codec from the command
            line with a one-time job.

Enable GZipCodec as the default compression codecFor the MapReduce framework, update relevant properties in       core-site.xml and mapred-site.xml to enable       GZipCodec as the default compression codec.Use GZipCodec with a one-time jobYou can configure GZipcodec to compress the output of a MapReduce       job.Parent topic: Optimizing data storage
