List files in Hadoop
            archives
Use the hdfs dfs -ls command to list files in Hadoop
            archives.

Run the hdfs dfs -ls command by specifying the
                              archive directory location.
To specify the directories in an archive directory
                                    foo.har located in /usr/zoo,
                              run the following
                                    command:hdfs dfs -ls har:///user/zoo/foo.har/Assuming
                                    the archive directory foo.har contains two
                                    directories dir1 and dir2, the
                                    command returns the
                                    following
har:///user/zoo/foo.har/dir1
har:///user/zoo/foo.har/dir2note
Consider an archive created using the following
                                          command:hadoop archive -archiveName foo.har -p /user/ hadoop/dir1 hadoop/dir2 /user/zoo
If you list the files of the archive created in the preceding
                                          command, the command returns the following:
har:///user/zoo/foo.har/hadoop
har:///user/zoo/foo.har/hadoop/dir1
har:///user/zoo/foo.har/hadoop/dir2
Note that the modified parent argument causes the files to be
                                          archived relative to /user/.
