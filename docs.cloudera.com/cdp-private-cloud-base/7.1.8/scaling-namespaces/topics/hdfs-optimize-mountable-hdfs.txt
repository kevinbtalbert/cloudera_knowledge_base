Optimize mountable HDFS
You can consider certain recommendations to optimize the mountable HDFS.


Cloudera recommends that you use the -obig_writes option on
                    kernels later than 2.6.26. This option allows for better performance of
                    writes.
By default, the package installation creates the
                        /etc/default/hadoop-fuse file with a maximum heap size of
                    128 MB. You might need to change the JVM minimum and maximum heap size for
                    better performance. For example: export LIBHDFS_OPTS="-Xms64m -Xmx256m"
Be careful not to set the minimum to a higher value than the maximum.
