Optimizing data storage
You can consider various options to optimize data storage, such as increasing storage
    space through erasure coding, using codecs for compressing data, balancing data across an HDFS
    cluster, and so on.
To know more about HDFS heap
      calculations, see HDFS heap sizing.

Balancing data across disks of a DataNodeThe HDFS Disk Balancer is a command-line tool that evenly distributes data across all       the disks of a DataNode to ensure that the disks are effectively utilized. Unlike the HDFS       Balancer that balances data across DataNodes of a cluster, the Disk Balancer balances data at       the level of individual DataNodes.Erasure coding overviewData durability describes how resilient data is to loss. When data is stored in HDFS,     CDP provides two options for data durability. You can use replication, which HDFS was originally     built on, or Erasure Coding (EC). Increasing storage capacity with HDFS compressionLinux supports GzipCodec, DefaultCodec,             BZip2Codec, LzoCodec, and         SnappyCodec. Typically, GzipCodec is used for HDFS         compression. Set HDFS quotasAs an administrator, you can set HDFS quotas for the number of file and directory         names used and the amount of space used by directories after the Reports Manager service is         installed as part of Cloudera Management Service. Before you can set a quota, the Reports         Manager must index the file or directory.Configuring heterogeneous storage in HDFSA variety of storage types are supported with HDFS. You can choose which storage type         to assign to each DataNode Data Directory. Specifying a storage type allows you to optimize         your data usage and lower your costs, based on your data usage frequency.Balancing data across an HDFS clusterThe HDFS Balancer is a tool for balancing the data across the storage devices of a             HDFS cluster.HDFS heap sizingYou can provision an HDFS cluster for optimal performance based on the desired storage       capacity.
