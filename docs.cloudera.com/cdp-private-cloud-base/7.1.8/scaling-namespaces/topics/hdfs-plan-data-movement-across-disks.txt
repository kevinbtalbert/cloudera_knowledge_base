Plan the data movement
      across disks
A Disk Balancer plan identifies the amount of data that should move between the disks
      of a specified DataNode. The plan contains move steps, where each move step specifies the
      source and destination disks for data movement and the number of bytes to move.
You must set the
            dfs.disk.balancer.enabled property in
            hdfs-site.xml to true.

Run the hdfs diskbalancer -plan command by specifying the path to
               the DataNode. 
For example, hdfs diskbalancer -plan node1.mycluster.com.
The specified command generates the following two JSON documents as output
               in the HDFS namespace: <nodename>.before.json
               that indicates the state of the cluster before running Disk Balancer, and
                     <nodename>.plan.json that details the
               data movement plan for the DataNode. By default, the JSON documents are placed in
                  the following location:
                     /system/diskbalancer/<Creation_Timestamp>. Here,
                     <Creation_Timestamp> indicates the folder named according
                  to the date and time of creation of the JSON documents.

Run the generated plan.
