Recommended configurations
      for the Balancer
The HDFS Balancer can run in either Background or Fast modes. Depending on the mode in
      which you want the Balancer to run, you can set various properties to recommended
      values.
Background and fast modes



HDFS Balancer runs as a background process. The cluster serves other jobs and
                     applications at the same time.

Fast Mode

HDFS Balancer runs at maximum (fast) speed.

Troubleshooting tip
When the block report length exceeds the configured limit, you might receive the
            following exception in the NameNode
            logs:java.io.IOException: Requested data length 141557760 is longer than maximum configured RPC length 134217728


Causes
When there are too many blocks in one or more Datanodes, for example in the
                     range of several millions or 10M+, it leads to a large size of block report
                     from those particular Datanodes, and the block report length exceeds the
                     default value of 128M. In that case the NameNode only receives a part of block
                     report instead of the entire bock report as the block report gets truncated at
                     the default configured length of 128M. Since the HDFS Balancer receives block
                     information from NameNode, with wrong information of block number the balancer
                     might not move the blocks from the Datanode with the above issue.
Solutions
Increase the value of ipc.maximum.data.length to 256M or
                     above the reported data length from the above exception, so that the NameNode
                     can receive a large size of block report. The balancer would then be able to
                     progress further.

noteIf the above mentioned exception is sustained in
                        the NameNode logs for a prolonged period of time, then the property
                        modification would be required regardless of whether the balancer needs to
                        be run or not and even for normal and correct HDFS operations.
