Setting HDFS quotas in Cloudera Manager
You can set the file count or space quotas for a directory using Cloudera Manager.
        Ensure that you have administrator privileges before you set the quotas.

Go to the Cloudera Manager > Clusters > HDFS service > File Browser tab.

Browse the file system to find the directory for which you want to set
                    quotas.

Click the directory name so that it appears in the gray panel above the listing
                    of its contents and in the detail section to the right of the File
                        Browser table.

Click the Edit Quota option for the directory.

tipThe Edit Quota
                        option appears if the Reports Manager service is installed as part of
                        Cloudera Management Service.


Set the file count or disk space limits for the directory in the
                        Manage Quota dialog box.

tipBefore you can set a quota, the Reports
                        Manager must index the file or directory.


Click OK.
