Set up a storage policy for HDFS
You can use Cloudera Manager to set up storage policy on a DataNode data
        directory.

Check the HDFS Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                        for hdfs-site.xml to be sure that
                        dfs.storage.policy.enabled has not been changed from its default
                    value of true.

Specify the storage types for each DataNode Data Directory that is not a
                    standard disk, by adding the storage type in brackets at the beginning of the
                    directory path. 

For
                        example:[SSD]/dfs/dn1
[DISK]/dfs/dn2
[ARCHIVE]/dfs/dn3


Open a terminal session on any HDFS host and run the hdfs
                        storagepolicies -setStoragePolicy command for each path on which
                    you want to set a storage policy.

hdfs storagepolicies -setStoragePolicy -path <path> -policy <policy>
path_to_file_or_directory -policy policy_name


To move the data to the appropriate storage based on the current storage
                    policy, use the mover utility, from any HDFS host.
Use mover -h to get a list of available options. To migrate
                    all data at once (this may take a long time), you can set the path to
                        /.hdfs mover -p <path>

noteQuotas are enforced at the time you set the storage policy or when writing
                        the file, not when quotas are changed. The Mover tool does not recognize
                        quota violations. It only verifies that a file is stored on the storage
                        types specified in its policy.
