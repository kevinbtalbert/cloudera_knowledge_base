Storage group
        classification
The HDFS Balancer first invokes the getLiveDatanodeStorageReport
        rpc to the Namenode to the storage report for all the storages in all Datanodes. The storage
        report contains storage utilization information such as capacity, dfs used space, remaining
        space, and so forth, for each storage in each DataNode.
A Datanode can contain
            multiple storages and the storages can have different storage types. A storage group
                Gi,T is defined to be the group of all the storages with the same
            storage type T in Datanode i. For example,
                Gi,DISK is the storage group of all the DISK storages in Datanode
            i. For each storage type T in each DataNode i, HDFS Balancer computes Storage Group
            Utilization (%)
Ui,T = 100% (storage group used space)/(storage group
                capacity),
and Average Utilization (%)
Uavg,T = 100% * (sum of all used spaces)/(sum of all
                capacities).
Let △ be the threshold
            parameter (default is 10%) and GI,T be the storage group with storage type T
            in DataNode I.
 
                    Over-Utilized:       {Gi,T :  Uavg,T + Δ < Ui,T},
Average + Threshold ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Above-Average:	{Gi,T :  Uavg,T < Ui,T <= Uavg,T + Δ},
Average ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Below-Average:	{Gi,T :  Uavg,T - Δ <= Ui,T <= Uavg,T},
Average - Threshold ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Under-Utilized:      {Gi,T :  Ui,T < Uavg,T - Δ }.

A storage group is
            over-utilized  or under-utilized if its utilization is larger or smaller than the
            difference between the average and the threshold. A storage group is above-average or
            below-average if its utilization is larger or smaller than average but within the
            threshold.
If there are no
            over-utilized storages and no under-utilized storages, the cluster is said to be
            balanced. The HDFS Balancer terminates with a SUCCESS state. Otherwise, it continues
            with storage group pairing.
