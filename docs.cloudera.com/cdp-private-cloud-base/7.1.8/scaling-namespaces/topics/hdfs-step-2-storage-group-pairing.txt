Storage group
      pairing
The HDFS Balancer selects over-utilized or above-average storage as source storage,
      and under-utilized or below-average storage as target storage. It pairs a source storage group
      with a target storage group (source → target) in a priority order depending on whether or not
      the source and the target storage reside in the same rack.
The Balancer uses the
         following priority orders for pairing storage groups from the source and the target. 


Same-Rack (where the source and the target storage reside in the same
                        rack)
Over-Utilized → Under-Utilize
Over-Utilized → Below-Average
Above-Average → Under-Utilized


Any (where the source and target storage do not reside in the same
                        rack)
Over-Utilized → Under-Utilized
Over-Utilized → Below-Average
Above-Average → Under-Utilized
