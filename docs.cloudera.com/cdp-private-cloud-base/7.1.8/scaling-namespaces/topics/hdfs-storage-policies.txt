HDFS storage
      policies
A storage policy contains information that describes the type of storage to use. This
      policy also defines the fallback storage type if the primary type is out of space or out of
      quota. If a target storage type is not available, HDFS attempts to place replicas on the
      default storage type.
Each storage policy consists of a policy ID, a policy name, a list of storage types, a list
         of fallback storage types for file creation, and a list of fallback storage types for
         replication.
HDFS has six preconfigured storage policies.
Hot - All replicas are stored on DISK.
Cold - All replicas are stored ARCHIVE.
Warm - One replica is stored on DISK and the others are stored on ARCHIVE.
All_SSD - All replicas are stored on SSD.
One_SSD - One replica is stored on SSD and the others are stored on DISK.
Lazy_Persist - The replica is written to RAM_DISK and then lazily persisted to
               DISK.

noteYou cannot create your own storage policy. You must use one of the six pre-configured
         policies. HDFS clients such as HBase may support different storage policies.
