The HDFS mover command
You can use the hdfs mover command to move replicas of data blocks
        that violate the storage policy set on a file or a directory to a storage type that fulfills
        the policy requirements.
Command:
hdfs mover [-p <files/dirs> | -f <local file name>]

Argument
Description

-f <local file>
Specify a local file containing a list of HDFS files or directories to
                        migrate.

-p <files/dirs>
Specify a space-separated list of HDFS files or directories to
                        migrate.
noteWhen both -p and -f options are
                omitted, the default path is the root directory.
