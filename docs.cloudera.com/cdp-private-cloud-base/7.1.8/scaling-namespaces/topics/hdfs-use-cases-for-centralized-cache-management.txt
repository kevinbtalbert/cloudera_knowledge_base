Use cases for centralized
      cache management
Centralized cache management is useful for files that are accessed repeatedly and for
      mixed workloads that have performance SLAs.



Files that are accessed repeatedly: For example, a small
               fact table in Hive that is often used for joins is a good candidate for caching.
               Conversely, caching the input of a once-yearly reporting query is probably less
               useful, since the historical data might only be read once.



Mixed workloads with performance SLAs: Caching the working
               set of a high priority workload ensures that it does not compete with low priority
               workloads for disk I/O.
