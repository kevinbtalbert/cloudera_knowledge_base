Viewing racks assigned to cluster hosts
You can view details of the racks assigned to the cluster hosts from the
            All Hosts page of Cloudera Manager. 

In Cloudera Manager, go to Hosts > All Hosts.

Expand the Columns drop-down list, and select
                        Rack.
The table displaying the host details now includes a
                        Rack column next to Name, and
                    lists the racks assigned to every host.
