Why HDFS data becomes
      unbalanced
Factors such as addition of DataNodes, block allocation in HDFS, and behavior of the
      client application can lead to the data stored in HDFS clusters becoming
      unbalanced.
Addition of DataNodes
When new DataNodes are added to a cluster, newly created blocks are written to these
            DataNodes from time to time. The existing blocks are not moved to them without using the
            HDFS Balancer.

Behavior of the client application
In some cases, a client application might not write data uniformly across the DataNode
            machines. A client application might be skewed in writing data, and might always write
            to some particular machines but not others. HBase is an example of such a client
            application. In other cases, the client application is not skewed by design, for
            example, MapReduce or YARN jobs.
The data is skewed so that some of the jobs write significantly more data than others.
            When a Datanode receives the data directly from the client, it stores a copy to its
            local storage for preserving data locality. The DataNodes receiving more data generally
            have higher storage utilization.

Block allocation in HDFS
HDFS uses a constraint satisfaction algorithm to allocate file blocks. Once the
            constraints are satisfied, HDFS allocates a block by randomly selecting a storage device
            from the candidate set uniformly. For large clusters, the blocks are essentially
            allocated randomly in a uniform distribution, provided that the client applications
            write data to HDFS uniformly across the DataNode machines. Uniform random allocation
            might not result in a uniform data distribution because of randomness. This is generally
            not a problem when the cluster has sufficient space. The problem becomes serious when
            the cluster is nearly full.
