Learn about the three types of schema entity types: Schema Group, Schema Metadata,
      Schema Version.
You can use Schema Registry to work with three types of schema entities. The following
         image shows the types of Schema entities:


The following table provides a more detailed description of the schema entity types:

Schema Group

A logical grouping of similar schemas. A Schema Group can be based on any
                        criteria you have for managing schemas.
Schema Groups can have multiple Schema Metadata definitions.




Group Name – truck-sensors-log


Group Name – truck-sensors-kafka





Schema Metadata

Metadata associated with a named schema. A metadata definition is applied to
                        all the schema versions that are assigned to it.
Key metadata elements include:


Schema Name – A unique name for each schema. Used as a key to look up
                              schemas.


Schema Type – The format of the schema.

Note: Avro is currently the only supported
                              type.


Compatibility Policy – The compatibility rules that exist when the new
                              schemas are registered.
                              


Serializers/Deserializers – A set of serializers and deserializers
                              that you can upload to the registry and associate with schema metadata
                              definitions.






Schema Name – truck_events_avro:v


Schema Type – avro


Compatibility Policy – SchemaCompatibility.BACKWARD





Schema Version
The versioned schema associated a schema metadata
                     definition.

    { "name" : "truckId" , "type" : "int" },
    { "name" : "driverId" , "type" : "int"},
    { "name" : "driverName" , "type" : "string"},
    { "name" : "routeId" , "type" : "int"},
    { "name" : "route" , "type" : "string"},
