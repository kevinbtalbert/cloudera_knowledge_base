      architecture
Learn about the component architecture of Schema Registry.
Schema Registry has the following main components:

Registry web serverWeb application exposing the REST endpoints you can use to manage
               schema entities. You can use a web proxy and load balancer with multiple web servers
               to provide high availability and scalability.
Pluggable storageSchema Registry uses the following types of storages:
Schema metadata storageRelational store that holds the metadata for the schema
                     entities. MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle databases are supported.
SerDes storageFile storage for the serializer and deserializer jars. Local
                     file system and HDFS storage are supported. Local file system storage is the
                     default.

Schema Registry clientA java client that components can use to interact with the
               RESTful services.

The following diagram represents the component architecture of Schema Registry.
