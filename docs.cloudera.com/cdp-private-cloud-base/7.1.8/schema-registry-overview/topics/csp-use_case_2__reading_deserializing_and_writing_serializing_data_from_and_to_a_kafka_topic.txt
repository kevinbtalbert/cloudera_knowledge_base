Deserializing and
    serializing data from and to a Kafka topic
Learn how to use Schema Registry to store metadata on reading or deserializing and
    writing or serializing data from and to Kafka topics.
You can store metadata for the format of how data should be read and how it should be
      written. Schema Registry supports this use case by providing capabilities to store JAR files
      for serializers and deserializers, and then mapping the SerDes to the schema.
