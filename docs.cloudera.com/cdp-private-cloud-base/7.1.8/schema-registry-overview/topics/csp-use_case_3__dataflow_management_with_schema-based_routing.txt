Dataflow management with
    schema-based routing
Learn how to use Schema Registry to support NiFi dataflow management.
If you are using NiFi to move different types of syslog events to downstream systems, you
      have data movement requirements where you need to parse the syslog event to extract the event
      type and route the event to a certain downstream system (for example, different Kafka topics)
      based on the event type.
Without Schema Registry, NiFi uses regular expressions or other utilities to parse the
      event type value from the payload and stores it into a flowfile attribute. Then NiFi uses
      routing processors (for example, RouteOnAttribute) to use the parsed
      value for routing decisions. If the structure of the data changes considerably, this type of
      extract and routing pattern is brittle and requires frequent changes.
With the introduction of Schema Registry, NiFi queries the registry for schema and then
        retrieves the value for a certain element in the schema. In this case, even if the structure
        changes, as long as compatibility policies are adhered to, NiFi's extract and routing rules
        do not change. This is another common use case for Schema Registry.
