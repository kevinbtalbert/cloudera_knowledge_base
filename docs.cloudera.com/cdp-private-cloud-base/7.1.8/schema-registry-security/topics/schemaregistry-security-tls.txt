TLS encryption
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an industry standard set of cryptographic protocols
  for securing communications over a network. To encrypt sensitive information between the Cloudera
  Manager Server and cluster hosts, you must enable TLS.
You can choose to enable Auto-TLS or manually configure TLS.
Auto-TLS simplifies the process of enabling and managing TLS encryption on your cluster. When
   you enable Auto-TLS, an internal certificate authority (CA) is created and certificates are
   deployed automatically across all cluster hosts. For more information on Auto-TLS, see
    Configuring TLS Encryption for Cloudera Manager Using Auto-TLS.
If you choose to enable TLS manually, you must create the TLS certificates making sure the
   certificates meet the requirements. Then configure Cloudera Manager and Schema Registry.

The     certificates must meet the requirements listed here. Configuring TLS encryption manually for Schema RegistryIf you do not want to enable Auto-TLS, because, for example, you need to use your own         enterprise-generated certificates, you can manually enable TLS for Schema         Registry.Schema Registry TLS propertiesTo enable and configure TLS manually for Schema Registry, edit the security properties   according to the cluster configuration.Configuring mutual TLS for Schema RegistrySchema Registry supports two-way TLS authentication, also known as mutual TLS or         mTLS.
