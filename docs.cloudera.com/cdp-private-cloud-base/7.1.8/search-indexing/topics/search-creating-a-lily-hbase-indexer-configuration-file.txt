Creating a Lily HBase Indexer Configuration File


Configure individual Lily HBase Indexers using the hbase-indexer
            command-line utility. Typically, there is one Lily HBase Indexer configuration file for
            each HBase table, but there can be as many Lily HBase Indexer configuration files as
            there are tables, column families, and corresponding collections in Search. Each Lily
            HBase Indexer configuration is defined in an XML file, such as
               morphline-hbase-mapper.xml.
An indexer configuration XML file must refer to the
               MorphlineResultToSolrMapper implementation and point to the location
            of a Morphline configuration file, as shown in the following
               morphline-hbase-mapper.xml indexer configuration file. 


Set morphlineFile to the relative path
                  morphlines.conf. Make sure the file is readable by the HBase
               system user (hbase by default).

$ cat $HOME/morphline-hbase-mapper.xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<indexer table="sample_table"
mapper="com.ngdata.hbaseindexer.morphline.MorphlineResultToSolrMapper">

   <!-- The relative path on the local file system to the
   morphline configuration file. -->
   
   <param name="morphlineFile" value="morphlines.conf"/>

   <!-- The optional morphlineId identifies a morphline if there are multiple
   morphlines in morphlines.conf -->
   <!-- <param name="morphlineId" value="morphline1"/> -->

</indexer>


The Lily HBase Indexer configuration file also supports the standard attributes of
                  any HBase Lily Indexer on the top-level <indexer> element. It does not support the <field> element and
                     <extract> elements.
