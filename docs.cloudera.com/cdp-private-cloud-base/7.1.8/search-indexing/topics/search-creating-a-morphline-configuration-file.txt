Creating a Morphline Configuration File


After creating an indexer configuration XML file, you can configure morphline ETL
        transformation commands in a morphlines.conf configuration file. The
          morphlines.conf configuration file can contain any number of morphline
        commands. Typically, an extractHBaseCells command is the first command. The
          readAvroContainer or readAvro morphline commands are
        often used to extract Avro data from the HBase byte array. This configuration file can be
        shared among different applications that use morphlines.
noteTo function properly, the morphline must not contain a loadSolr
        command. The Lily HBase Indexer must load documents into Solr, instead of the morphline
        itself.


You can edit the morphlines.conf file within Cloudera Manager (Key-Value Store Indexer service > Configuration > Category > Morphlines > Morphlines File).
