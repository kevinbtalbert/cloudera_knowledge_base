MapReduceIndexerToolMapReduceIndexerTool (MRIT) is a MapReduce batch job driver that takes a morphline and     creates a set of Solr index shards from a set of input files and writes the indexes into HDFS in     a flexible, scalable, and fault-tolerant manner. MRIT also supports merging the output shards     into a set of live customer-facing Solr servers, typically a SolrCloud.Lily HBase batch indexing for Cloudera SearchYou can batch index HBase tables using the Lily HBase batch indexer MapReduce job       (HBaseMapReduceIndexerTool). This batch indexing does not require HBase replication or the       Lily HBase Indexer Service. Subsequently you do not need to register a Lily HBase Indexer       configuration with the Lily HBase Indexer Service.Parent topic: Batch indexing using Morphlines
