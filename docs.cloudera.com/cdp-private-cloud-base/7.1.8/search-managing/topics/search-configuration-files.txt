Cloudera Search configuration files
Cloudera Search configuration is primarily controlled by several configuration files,
    that are mostly stored in Apache ZooKeeper.
Configuration fileDescriptionsolr.xml This file is stored in ZooKeeper, and controls global properties for Apache Solr.
          To edit this file, you must download it from ZooKeeper, make your changes, and then upload
          the modified file back to ZooKeeper using the solrctl cluster command. solrconfig.xml Each collection in Solr uses a solrconfig.xml file, stored in
          ZooKeeper, to control collection behavior. managed-schema or schema.xml Cloudera recommends using a managed schema, and making schema changes using the
          Schema API.
          Collections use either a managed schema or the legacy schema.xml file.
          These files, also stored in ZooKeeper and assigned to a collection, define the schema for
          the documents you are indexing. For example, they specify which fields to index, the
          expected data type for each field, the default field to query when the field is
          unspecified, and so on.core.properties Unlike other configuration files, this file is stored in the local filesystem
          rather than ZooKeeper, and is used for core discovery.Additional files Any additional files referenced in the xml files, for example,
          custom JAR files.
