Viewing and modifying Search configuration using Cloudera Manager
Learn about viewing and editing configuration parameters for the
            Solr service in Cloudera Manager.




Go to Solr service > Configuration.

Use the SCOPE and CATEGORY
                    filters to restrict the displayed configuration parameters. You can also enter
                    text in the Search field to dynamically filter
                    configuration parameters.

After making changes, enter a Reason for change, and
                    click Save Changes.

Restart the Solr service (Solr service > Actions > Restart) and any dependent services. You can also restart dependent
                    services using the Restart Stale Services wizard.
