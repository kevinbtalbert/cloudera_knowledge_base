Creating a Solr collection
Learn how to create a collection so that you can start indexing data with
        Solr.


If you have enabled Ranger for authorization, you must have Solr
                        Admin permission to be able to create collections.
Before you can create a Solr collection you need to generate a collection
                    configuration using either a config or an instance directory.



noteAlthough it is not currenly strictly
                enforced, you are strongly recommended to observe the following limitations on
                collection names:
Use only ASCII alphanumeric characters (A-Za-z0-9), hyphen
                            (-), or underscore (_).
Avoid using the strings shard and
                        replica.

If you are using Kerberos, kinit as a user with permission to create the
                    collection:  

kinit solradmin@[***EXAMPLE.COM***]
Replace [***EXAMPLE.COM***] with your
                        Kerberos realm name.
On a host running a Solr server, make sure that the SOLR_ZK_ENSEMBLE environment variable is set in /etc/solr/conf/solr-env.sh. For example: cat /etc/solr/conf/solr-env.sh
export SOLR_ZK_ENSEMBLE=zk01.example.com:2181,zk02.example.com:2181,zk03.example.com:2181/solr
This is automatically set on hosts with a Solr Server
                        or Gateway role in Cloudera Manager.
Create a new collection using the following command: 

solrctl collection --create [***COLLECTION NAME***] -s [***NUMBER OF SHARDS***] -c [***COLLECTION CONFIGURATION***]
where


[***COLLECTION NAME***]
User-defined name of the collection.noteAlthough it is not currenly strictly
                enforced, you are strongly recommended to observe the following limitations on
                collection names:
Use only ASCII alphanumeric characters (A-Za-z0-9), hyphen
                            (-), or underscore (_).
Avoid using the strings shard and
                        replica.



[***NUMBER OF SHARDS***]
The number of shards you want to split your collection
                                        into.


[***COLLECTION
                                        CONFIGURATION***]
The name of an existing collection configuration.
