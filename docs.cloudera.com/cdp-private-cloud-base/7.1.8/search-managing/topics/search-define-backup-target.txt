Defining a backup target in solr.xml
If you want to to define or modify a backup target, you can do it by downloading,
        editing, and reuploading the solr.xml file from ZooKeeper.

The solr.xml file of your Solr installation, which is
                stored in ZooKeeper, can define a backup target repository, and depending on your
                installation it likely has a default target pointing to HDFS.
HDFS as a backup target is still fine even if your Solr collection uses a
                local file system (FS) / NRTCachingDirectoryFactory, so even with local FS
                collections you can store your backups on HDFS.
Similarly to this, other repositories like a LocalFileSystemRepository can
                also be defined in the solr.xml if you want to store the backups on
                a location other than HDFS. importantIf you use
                    a local FS to store backups, each Solr host  stores its backup directory
                    locally. That is, server X contains the backup directory
                        snapshots.shard1, server Y contains
                        snapshots.shard2 and you need to copy them to a shared
                    location in order to be able to restore them later. Because of this, Cloudera
                    recommends you to target backups to a shared file system.
If the solr.xml does not have a backup repository at all,
                it defaults to the local FS repository.
noteIf you use a HDFS backup repository, the backup also works
                if the Solr servers are located on nodes which do not have HDFS data node roles,
                they just need to have a HDFS client (gateway) role.


To define or modify a backup target, download the solr.xml
                    file from ZooKeeper using the following solrctl command:

solrctl cluster --get-solrxml solr.xml


Edit the contents of the solr.xml file.
This is an example of defining a HDFS backup target in the
                        solr.xml
                    file:<backup>
  <repository name="hdfs" class="org.apache.solr.core.backup.repository.HdfsBackupRepository" default="false">
    <str name="location">${solr.hdfs.default.backup.path}</str>
    <str name="solr.hdfs.home">${solr.hdfs.home:}</str>
    <str name="solr.hdfs.confdir">${solr.hdfs.confdir:}</str>
  </repository>
</backup>

Reupload the modified solr.xml file:

solrctl cluster --put-solrxml solr.xml
