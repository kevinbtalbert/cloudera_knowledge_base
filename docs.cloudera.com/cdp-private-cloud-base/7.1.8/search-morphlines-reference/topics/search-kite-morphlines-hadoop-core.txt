downloadHdfsFile
The downloadHdfsFile command (source code) downloads, on startup, zero or more
        files or directory trees from HDFS to the local file system. These files are typically
        static configuration files that are required by downstream morphline commands, e.g. Avro
        schema files, XML join tables, grok dictionaries, etc. Storing such configuration files in
        HDFS can help with consistent centralized configuration management across a set of cluster
        nodes.
The output directory on the local file system defaults to the current working directory of
        the current process. If the effective output file or directory already exists it will be
        deleted and overwritten.
The command provides the following configuration options:


Property Name
Default
Description



inputFiles

The HDFS files or directories to download, in the form of a list of HDFS
                URIs.


outputDir
"."
The relative or absolute path of the destination directory on the local file
                system. Parent directories of that directory will be created automatically. Defaults
                to the current working directory of the current process.


Example usage:
downloadHdfsFile {
  inputFiles : ["hdfs://c2202.mycompany.com/user/foo/configs/sample-schema.avsc"]
  outputDir : "myconfigs"
}

openHdfsFile
The openHdfsFile command (source code) opens an HDFS file for read and returns
        a corresponding Java InputStream.
The morphline record input field _attachment_body must contain the HDFS Path of the file to
        read. The command replaces the HDFS Path in this field with the corresponding Java
        InputStream. Said InputStream can then be parsed with other commands, such as readLine or similar.
The command automatically handles gzip files if the file path ends with the ".gz" file name
        extensions.
Example usage:
openHdfsFile {}
