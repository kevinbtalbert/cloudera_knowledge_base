readSequenceFile
The readSequenceFile command (source code) parses an Apache Hadoop SequenceFile and emits a morphline record for each
        contained key-value pair. The sequence file is read from the input stream of the first
        attachment of the record.
The command automatically handles Record-Compressed and Block-Compressed SequenceFiles.
The command provides the following configuration options:


Property Name
Default
Description



keyField
_attachment_name
The name of the output field to store the SequenceFile Record key.


valueField
_attachment_body
The name of the output field to store the SequenceFile Record value.


Example usage:
readSequenceFile {
  keyField : "key"
  valueField : "value"
}
