userAgent
The userAgent command (source code) parses a user agent string and returns
        structured higher level data like user agent family, operating system, version, and device
        type, using the underlying API and regexes.yaml BrowserScope database from ua-parser.
The command provides the following configuration options:


Property Name
Default
Description



inputField
n/a
The name of the input field that contains zero or more user agent
                strings.


outputFields
[]
A JSON object containing zero or more user agent mappings. Each mapping
                consists of a record output field name (on the left side of the colon ':') as well
                as an expression (on the right hand side). An expression consists of a concatenation
                of zero or more literal strings or components of the form @{componentName}.
                Example mapping: myOutputField : "@{ua_family}/@{ua_major}.@{ua_minor}.@{ua_patch}".
                The following components are available: ua_family, ua_major, ua_minor, ua_patch,
                os_family, os_major, os_minor, os_patch, os_patch_minor, device_family. If a
                component resolves to null or the empty string the preceding string separator, if
                any, is suppressed.


database
null
The (optional) relative or absolute path of a regexes.yaml database file on the
                local file system. The default is to use the standard regexes.yaml database file
                that ships embedded inside of the ua-parser-*.jar. Example:
                /path/to/regexes.yaml


Example usage:
userAgent {
  inputField : user_agents
  outputFields : {
    ua_family : "@{ua_family}"
    device_family : "@{device_family}"
    ua_family_and_version : "@{ua_family}/@{ua_major}.@{ua_minor}.@{ua_patch}"
    os_family_and_version : "@{os_family} @{os_major}.@{os_minor}.@{os_patch}"
  }          
}
Example input:
user_agents : Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 5_1_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/534.46 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.1 Mobile/9B206 Safari/7534.48.3
Expected output:
ua_family : Mobile Safari
device_family : iPhone
ua_family_and_version : Mobile Safari/5.1
os_family_and_version : iOS 5.1.1
