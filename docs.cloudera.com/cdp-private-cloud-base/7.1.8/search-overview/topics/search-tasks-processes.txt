Cloudera Search tasks and processes
For content to be searchable, it must exist in Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) and be
      indexed. Content can either already exist in CDP and be indexed on demand, or it can be
      updated and indexed continuously. To make content searchable, first ensure that it is ingested
      or stored in CDP.
