Cloudera Search authentication

Cloudera Search continues to use simple authentication with the anonymous user as the default
      configuration, but Search also supports changing the authentication scheme to Kerberos. All
      required packages are installed during the installation or upgrade process. Additional
      configuration is required before Kerberos is available in your environment.
When authentication is enabled, only specified hosts and users can connect to Solr.
      Authentication also verifies that clients connect to legitimate servers. This feature prevents
      spoofing such as impersonation and person-in-the-middle attacks. Search supports Kerberos and
      LDAP authentication.
Cloudera Search supports a variety of combinations of authentication
        protocols:Table 1. Authentication Protocol Combinations

Solr Authentication
Use Case



No authentication
Insecure cluster


Kerberos only
The Hadoop cluster has Kerberos turned on and every user (or client) connecting
                to Solr has a Kerberos principal.


Kerberos and LDAP
The Hadoop cluster has Kerberos turned on. External Solr users (or clients) do
                not have Kerberos principals but do have identities in the LDAP server. Client
                authentication using LDAP requires that Kerberos is enabled for the cluster. Using
                LDAP alone is not supported.


Once you are finished setting up authentication, configure Ranger authorization.
      Authorization involves specifying which resources can be accessed by particular users when
      they connect through Search. For more information, see Using Ranger to Provide
        Authorization in CDP.
