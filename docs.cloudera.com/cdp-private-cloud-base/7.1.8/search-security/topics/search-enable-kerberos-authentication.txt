Enable Kerberos authentication in Solr
Secure access to your Solr service by enabling Kerberos authentication.

Besides securing access to the Solr service, enabling Kerberos authentication is a
                prerequisite of both configuring LDAP authentication and Ranger authorization. 


Solr supports Kerberos authentication. All necessary packages are installed when you
                install Search.  
Kerberos authentication must be configured in Cloudera Manager for the cluster where
                Solr is deployed. For more inflrmation, see Configuring Authentication in
                    Cloudera Manager.


In Cloudera Manager select the Solr service.

Select Configuration and find the Solr Secure
                        Authentication property.

Select the Kerberos option.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Solr service.


Kerberos authentication for Solr is enabled.
