Overview of proxy usage and load balancing for Search
See the advantages of configuring a proxy server for the Solr service.

Applications connect to a single well-known host and port, rather than
        keeping track of the hosts where the Solr service is running. This is
        especially useful for non-Java Solr clients such as web browsers or
        command-line tools such as curl.noteThe Solr Java client (solrj) can
          inspect Zookeeper metadata to automatically locate the individual Solr
          servers, so load-balancing proxy support is not necessary.

If any host running the Solr service becomes unavailable, application
        connection requests still succeed because you always connect to the
        proxy server rather than a specific host running the Solr server.
Users can configure an SSL terminating proxy for Solr to secure the
        data exchanged with the external clients without requiring SSL
        configuration for the Solr cluster itself. This is relevant only if the
        Solr cluster is deployed on a trusted network and needs to communicate
        with clients that may not be on the same network. Many of the advantages
        of SSL offloading are described in SSL Offloading, Encryption, and Certificates with
          NGINX.
The "coordinator host" for each Search query
        potentially requires more memory and CPU cycles than the other hosts
        that process the query. The proxy server can issue queries using
        round-robin scheduling, so that each connection uses a different
        coordinator host. This load-balancing technique lets the hosts running
        the Solr service share this additional work, rather than concentrating
        it on a single machine.
