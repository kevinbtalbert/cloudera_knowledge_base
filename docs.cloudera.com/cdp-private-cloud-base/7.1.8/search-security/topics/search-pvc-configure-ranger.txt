Configuring Ranger authorization for Solr service
By default, the Solr service is not configured for authorization by Ranger. You can
        configure authorization manually, using Cloudera Manager. 

Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.


In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to the Ranger service.

On the Service Manager page, click the
                        Add icon next to Solr.

Enter the following information on the Create Service
                    page:

note
Do not click Test connection. In this use case, it
                            is not necessary and it does not work.



Click Save.

Click on the name of the newly added service.

Under Action click the Edit
                    icon.

In Allow Conditions > Select User dropdown select hue.
This is necessary because the Hue service breaks if it has no permission to
                    access Solr. To keep the cluster accessible to non-admin users, you can add
                        other users to the default policy or you can define additional
                    policies.

Grant full admin privileges to users that you want to be able to access the
                    Solr Admin UI.


Click Add under Allow
                                Conditions to add a new condition, then add the user or
                            users from the Select User drop-down.


Click Add Permissions then select the
                                Select/Deselect All option.


Accept the selection, then click Save.
