Configuring custom Kerberos principals and custom system users for Solr
In a Kerberos enabled cluster, the Solr service uses the solr
        principal by default. Changing the default principal and using custom principals is
        supported. Principals can be configured on a service-wide level in Cloudera Manager with the
            Kerberos Principal property. To configure a custom system user,
        you need to modifty the System User property.

Make sure you have the following privileges:

SSH access to the cluster where you want to enable the custom
                    principal
administrative privileges in Cloudera Manager 
HDFS super user access



importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.
importantCurrently the
                names of system users which are impersonating users with Solr should match with the
                names of their respective Kerberos principals. If changing both the user name and
                the principal is not possible, you must add the user name you want to associate with
                the custom Kerberos principal to Solr configuration via the Solr Service
                    Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                environment variable in Cloudera Manager.


Stop the Solr service.

Disable ZooKeeper ACL checking temporarily.


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to ZooKeeper > Configuration.


Find the Java Configuration Options for ZooKeeper Server
                            property.


Add the following value:

-Dzookeeper.skipACL=yes



Click Save Changes.


Restart the ZooKeeper service.



In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Clusters > Solr service > Configuration and find the Kerberos Principal
                    property.

Provide the custom Kerberos principal. 

Click Save Changes.

To be able to interact with the Solr service, you must either change the
                        System User name to match the custom Kerberos
                    principal, or add the existing System User name to
                        Solr Service Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                        Valve).
Select one of the following options: 
OptionDescription
Change the System User name to match the
                            custom Kerberos principal


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Clusters > Solr service > Configuration and find the System User
                                    property.
Change the user name to match the custom Kerberos principal you
                                    have set.
Click Save Changes. 



Keep the original System User

In Cloudera Manager navigate to Clusters > Solr service > Configuration and find the Solr Service Environment

                                    property.
Look for the SOLR_SECURITY_PROXY_JAVA_OPTS
                                    key.
Append its value with:
                                                -Dsolr.security.proxyuser.[***SYSTEM_USER***].groups=*
                                                -Dsolr.security.proxyuser.[***SYSTEM_USER***].hosts=*Replace
                                            [***SYSTEM_USER***] with the service
                                        user name you want to associate with the custom Kerberos
                                        principal.

Create a jaas.conf file containing the following:

Client {
           com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
           useKeyTab=false
           useTicketCache=true
           principal="[***CUSTOM_SOLR_KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL@KERBEROS_REALM_NAME***]";
           };

 Replace
                            [***CUSTOM_SOLR_KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL@KERBEROS_REALM_NAME***]
                        with your Kerberos principal and realm name.


Set the LOG4J_PROPS environment variable to a
                    log4j.properties file:

export LOG4J_PROPS=/etc/zookeeper/conf/log4j.properties


Set the ZKCLI_JVM_FLAGS environment variable:

export ZKCLI_JVM_FLAGS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/path/to/jaas.conf \ 
-DzkACLProvider=org.apache.solr.common.cloud.SaslZkACLProvider \ 
-Droot.logger=INFO,console \
-Dsolr.authorization.superuser=[***CUSTOM_SOLR_KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL***]"


Authenticate as the
                    [***CUSTOM_SOLR_KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL***]:

kinit [***CUSTOM_SOLR_KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL@KERBEROS_REALM_NAME***]
 Replace
                            [***CUSTOM_SOLR_KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL@KERBEROS_REALM_NAME***]
                        with your Kerberos principal and realm name.


Run the zkcli.sh script as follows:

/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/solr/bin/zkcli.sh -zkhost [***ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_HOSTNAME***]:[***ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_PORT***] -cmd updateacls /solr
Replace [***ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_HOSTNAME***] and
                            [***ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_PORT***] with the hostname and
                        port of a ZooKeeper server.

For
                    example:/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/solr/bin/zkcli.sh -zkhost zk01.example.com:2181 -cmd updateacls /solr

Check ACLs in Zookeeper:

zookeeper-client -server ${HOSTNAME}:2181 getAcl /solr


Change ownership of Solrâ€™s HDFS Data Directory. Check the value in Cloudera
                    Manager under Solr > Configuration > HDFS Data Directory.

Execute the following command as the HDFS superuser:

hdfs dfs -chown -R [***CUSTOM_SOLR_KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL***] [***HDFS_DATA_DIRECTORY***]


Re-enable ZooKeeper ACL check.


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to ZooKeeper > Configuration.


Find the Java Configuration Options for ZooKeeper Server
                            property.


Remove the following value:

-Dzookeeper.skipACL=yes



Click Save Changes.


Restart the ZooKeeper service.
