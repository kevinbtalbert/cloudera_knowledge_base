Tuning replication
If you have sufficient additional hardware, you may add more replicas for a linear boost
    of query throughput and to prevent data loss.
noteDo not adjust HDFS replication settings for Solr in most cases.
Note, that adding replicas may slow write performance on the first replica, but otherwise
      this should have minimal negative consequences.
Transaction log replication
Cloudera Search supports configurable transaction log replication levels for replication
        logs stored in HDFS. Cloudera recommends leaving the value unchanged at 3 or, barring that,
        setting it to at least 2.
Configure the transaction log replication factor for a collection by modifying the
          tlogDfsReplication setting in solrconfig.xml. The
          tlogDfsReplication is a setting in the updateLog
        settings area. An excerpt of the solrconfig.xml file where the transaction
        log replication factor is set is as follows:
         <updateHandler class="solr.DirectUpdateHandler2">

    <!-- Enables a transaction log, used for real-time get, durability, and
         solr cloud replica recovery.  The log can grow as big as
         uncommitted changes to the index, so use of a hard autoCommit
         is recommended (see below).
         "dir" - the target directory for transaction logs, defaults to the
                solr data directory.  -->
    <updateLog>
      <str name="dir">${solr.ulog.dir:}</str>
      <int name="tlogDfsReplication">${solr.ulog.tlogDfsReplication:3}</int>
      <int name="numVersionBuckets">${solr.ulog.numVersionBuckets:65536}</int>
    </updateLog>
The default replication level is 3. For clusters with fewer than three DataNodes (such as
        proof-of-concept clusters), reduce this number to the amount of DataNodes in the cluster.
        Changing the replication level only applies to new transaction logs.
Initial testing shows no significant performance regression for common use cases.
