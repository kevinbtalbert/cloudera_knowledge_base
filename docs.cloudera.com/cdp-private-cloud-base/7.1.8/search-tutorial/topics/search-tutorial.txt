Cloudera Search tutorial
This tutorial introduces you to Cloudera Search and demonstrates some of its basic
    capabilities to help you become familiar with the concepts and components involved in Search. It
    demonstrates creating a simple test collection to validate your Cloudera Search installation,
    and then continues on to more advanced use cases of batch
    indexing.
The topics in this tutorial assume you have deployed Cloudera Search. The
      examples in this tutorial use two shards, so make sure that your
      deployment includes at least two Solr servers.
This tutorial uses modified schema.xml and
        solrconfig.xml configuration files. In the versions of
      these files included with the tutorial, unused fields have been removed
      for simplicity. Original versions of these files include many additional
      options. For information on all available options, see the Apache Solr
        wiki:
