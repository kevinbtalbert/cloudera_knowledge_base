Token-based authentication for Cloudera Data Warehouse integrations
Using a token, you can sign on to use Hive and Impala in Cloudera Data Warehouse for a
  period of time instead of entering your single-sign on (SSO) credentials every time you need to
  run a query. This feature is in a technical preview state. Contact your account team for more
  information.
