Communication encryption

Encryption between HiveServer2 and its clients is independent from Kerberos authentication.
        HiveServer supports the following types of encryption between the service and its clients
        (Beeline, JDBC/ODBC): 
SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer)
TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer)
 TLS/SSL requires certificates. SASL QOP encryption does not. SASL QOP is aimed at protecting
      core Hadoop RPC communications. SASL QOP might cause performance problems when handling large
      amounts of data. You can configure HiveServer to support TLS/SSL connections from JDBC/ODBC
      clients using Cloudera Manager. 
Client connections to HiveServer2 over TLS/SSL
A client connecting to a HiveServer2 over TLS/SSL must access the trust store on HiveServer
        to establish a chain of trust and verify server certificate authenticity. The trust store is
        typically not password protected. The trust store might be password protected to prevent its
        contents from being modified. However, password protected trust stores can be read from
        without using the password. 
The client needs the path to the trust store when attempting to connect to HiveServer2
        using TLS/SSL. You can specify the trust store in one of the following ways: 
Pass the path to the trust store each time you connect to HiveServer in the JDBC
            connection string:
            jdbc:hive2://fqdn.example.com:10000/default;ssl=true;\
 sslTrustStore=$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts;trustStorePassword=extraneous 
Set the path to the trust store one time in the Java system javax.net.ssl.trustStore
            property:
            java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_141-cloudera/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts \
 -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=extraneous MyClass \
 jdbc:hive2://fqdn.example.com:10000/default;ssl=true 



Enabling TLS/SSL for HiveServerYou can secure client-server communications using symmetric-key encryption in the         TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocol. To encrypt data exchanged         between HiveServer and its clients, you can use Cloudera Manager to configure         TLS/SSL.Enabling SASL in HiveServerYou can provide a Quality of Protection (QOP)  that is higher than the         cluster-wide default using SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer).
