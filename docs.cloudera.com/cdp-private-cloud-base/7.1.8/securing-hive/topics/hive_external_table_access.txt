External table access
As administrator, you must set up Apache Ranger to allow users to access external
    tables.
External tables reside by default in /warehouse/tablespace/external on
      your object store. To specify some other location of the external table, you need to include
      the specification in the table creation statement as shown in the following example:

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE my_external_table (a string, b string)  
LOCATION '/users/andrena';

Hive assigns a default permission of 777 to the hive user, sets a umask to
      restrict subdirectories, and provides a default ACL to give Hive read and write access to all
      subdirectories. External tables must be secured using Ranger.
