Connecting to an Apache Hive endpoint through Apache Knox
If your cluster uses Apache Knox for perimeter security in CDP Private Cloud Base, you can
        connect to an Apache Hive endpoint through Knox. You set the HiveServer transport mode and
        reference your Java keystore.

            Automate the creation of an internal certificate authority (CA) using Auto-TLS (see link below). 
            Set up SSL, including trust, for Knox Gateway clients.
        

In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > Hive on Tez > Configuration, and change the Hive on Tez service transport mode in Cloudera
                    Manager to http.





KNOX discovers the service automatically and builds a proxy URL for Hive on
                    Tez only when the transport mode is http.

Download the
                    Knox Gateway TLS/SSL client trust store JKS file from Knox, and save it
                    locally.
You can find the location of the JKS file from value of the Knox property
                        gateway.tls.keystore.path.

In the Hive connection string, include parameters as follows:

jdbc:hive2://<host>:8443/;ssl=true;transportMode=http;  \
httpPath=gateway/cdp-proxy-api/hive;  \
sslTrustStore=/<path to JKS>/bin/certs/gateway-client-trust.jks;  \
trustStorePassword=<Java default password>

In this example, changeit is the Java default password for
                    the trust store.
