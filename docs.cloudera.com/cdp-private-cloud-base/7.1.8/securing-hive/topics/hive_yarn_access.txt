Managing YARN queue users
To manage users of secure YARN queues, you need to know how to configure impersonation
    for Ranger.
To allow access to YARN queues, as Administrator, you configure HiveServer user impersonation
      to false. You also need to configure
      hive.server2.tez.queue.access.check=true. To manage YARN queues, you need the
      following behavior: 
User submits the query through HiveServer (HS2) to the YARN queue
Tez app starts for the user
Access to the YARN queue is allowed for this user. As administrator, you can allocate
            resources to different users.

Managing YARN queues under Ranger
When you use Ranger, you configure HiveServer not to use impersonation
    (doas=false). HiveServer authorizes only the hive user, not
   the connected end user, to access Hive tables and YARN queues unless you also configure the
   following parameter:
hive.server2.tez.queue.access.check=true
