Configuring Hue for authentication against multiple LDAP/Active Directory servers
Some organizations have more than one LDAP or Active Directory (AD), and users in one
        LDAP/AD may not be present in the other. Hue supports the ability to authenticate users
        against multiple LDAP/AD servers.

Before attempting LDAP authentication against multiple servers, ensure you have
                configured LDAP synchronization for each server, as described in the previous
                sections. As long as users and groups are synchronised across LDAP and Hue,
                authentication should work.


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                            hue_safety_valve.ini, and add the following lines for each LDAP server:

[desktop]
[[ldap]]
[[[ldap_servers]]]

[[[[AD1.TEST.COM]]]]
ldap_url=ldap://w2k8-ad1
search_bind_authentication=true
create_users_on_login=true
base_dn="cn=users,dc=ad1,dc=test,dc=com"
bind_dn="cn=Administrator,cn=users,dc=ad1,dc=test,dc=com"
bind_password="[***PASSWORD***]"

[[[[AD2.TEST.COM]]]]
ldap_url=ldap://w2k8-ad2
search_bind_authentication=true
create_users_on_login=true
base_dn="cn=users,dc=ad2,dc=test,dc=com"
bind_dn="cn=Administrator,cn
bind_password="[***PASSWORD***]"

The above code snippet is for a demo LDAP server called "AD1.TEST.COM" and
                    "AD2.TEST.COM".

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.

When you log into Hue or while synchronizing LDAP users from
            the Hue web interface, you  need to select the LDAP/AD server from the dropdown
                list.
