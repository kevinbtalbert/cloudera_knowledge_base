Configuring group permissions
You can configure permissions for members of groups on the
      Groups tab of the Hue User Admin application.




noteA best practice is to remove all permissions from the default group
            and assign permissions as appropriate to your own groups. 


Log on to the Hue UI as a superuser.

Go to User
              Admin > Groups.

Click the name of the group you want to alter.

Deselect any users that you do not want to change (all users in
              the group are selected by default).

Select or deselect the permissions you want to apply or remove.

Click Update Group.
