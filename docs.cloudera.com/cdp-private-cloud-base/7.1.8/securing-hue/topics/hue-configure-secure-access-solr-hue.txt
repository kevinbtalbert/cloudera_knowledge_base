Configuring secure access between Solr and Hue
If you are using Solr (search) to build dynamic search dashboards and explore data
        from the Hue web UI, and have secured your CDP cluster using Kerberos, then you must enable
        secure access between the Solr service and Hue by turning on the security_enabled parameter
        in the hue_safety_valve.ini
        file.

The security_enabled parameter is set to false, by default. To
                enable secure access between Solr and Hue:


Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration and search for the Hue Service Advanced Configuration
                        Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini field.

Go to the [search] section and set the value of the
                        security_enabled parameter to true, as shown in the
                    following sample:

[search]
# Requires FQDN in solr_url if enabled
security_enabled=true
# URL of the Solr Server
solr_url=http://[***FQDN-SOLR-HOST***]:8983/solr


noteIf you set security_enabled=true, then you must provide
                        the fully-qualified domain name of the Solr host in the Solr URL.


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
