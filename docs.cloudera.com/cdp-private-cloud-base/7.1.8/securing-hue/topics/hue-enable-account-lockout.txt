Locking an account after invalid login attempts
As a security measure, you can configure Hue to lock an account after a set number of
        unsuccessful or invalid login attempts by specifying the number of attempts in the
        login_failure_limit parameter and setting the login_lock_out_at_failure parameter to true in
        the Hue Advanced Configuration Snippet in Cloudera Manager.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue > Configuration and add the following lines in the Hue Service
                        Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        hue_safety_valve.ini field:

[desktop]
[[auth]]
login_failure_limit=[***NUMBER-OF-ATTEMPTS-BEFORE-ACCOUNT-LOCKOUT***]
login_lock_out_at_failure=true

Replace [***NUMBER-OF-ATTEMPTS-BEFORE-ACCOUNT-LOCKOUT***]
                    with the number of unsuccesful login attempts after which you want to lock an
                    account. For example, if you set login_failure_limit to
                        3, then the user will be locked out on the third invalid
                    attempt.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service to apply stale configurations.
You can use the Rolling Restart option to minimize
                    downtime.

A user's account will be locked out after crossing the set
            number of invalid login attempts and the following message is displayed
                "Account locked: too many login attempts. Contact an admin to unlock
                your account."
