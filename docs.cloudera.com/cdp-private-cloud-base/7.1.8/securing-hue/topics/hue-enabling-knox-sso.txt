Authenticating Hue users with Knox SSOCloudera Docs
Authenticating Hue users with Knox SSO
You can use the Apache Knox Gateway to interact with Hue REST APIs and the Hue user
        interface, along with other CDP components and services. To set up Knox Single Sign-on (SSO)
        to authenticate users, you must configure the KnoxSpnegoDjangoBackend property using
        Cloudera Manager.

To authenticate users using Knox SSO, you must have Knox installed on your CDP
                cluster, also known as a secure cluster.


Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configurations and search for the Authentication Backend
                    field.

Select desktop.auth.backend.KnoxSpnegoDjangoBackend from
                    the dropdown.






Go to Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        hue_safety_valve.ini) and comment or remove any SAML-specific
                    configurations, if present.

cautionKnox-SSO and SAML are incompatible and mutually exclusive.
                        Hue authetication may fail with a redirection loop if you have the Knox-SSO
                        and SAML configurations present in the Hue Advanced Configuration Snippet at
                        the same time, as it confuses the authentication redirect to the IdP and
                        back to Hue.


Click Save Changes.

Go to Clusters > $Knox service > Instances and note down the hostnames of the Knox Gateways.
You must provide these details in the next step.
If you have set up Knox in High-Availablity (HA) mode, then you can see more
                    than one Knox Gateways listed on the Instances
                    tab.

Go back to Clusters > Hue service > Configurations and search for the Knox Proxy Hosts
                    field.

Enter the hostname of the Knox Gateway that you noted earlier.
If you have set up Knox HA, then click + to add another
                    hostname.


If you have deployed a Hue Load Balancer, then you must specify the Load
                    Balancer hostname in the Knox Proxy Hosts field by
                    clicking +.

Click Save Changes.
