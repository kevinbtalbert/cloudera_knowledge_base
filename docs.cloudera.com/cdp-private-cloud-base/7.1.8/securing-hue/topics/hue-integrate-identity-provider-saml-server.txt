Integrating your identity provider's SAML server with Hue
After Hue is configured for SAML authentication and restarted, copy the metadata that
    is generated by the Hue server and send it to your identity provider so they can configure the
    SAML server.

Ensure that you have configured Hue for SAML authentication and restarted it before
              you integrate your identity provider's SAML server with Hue.


Ensure Hue is configured, restarted, and running.

Go to
              http://<hue_fqdn>:8889/saml2/metadata.

Copy the metadata and send it to your identity provider.

Ensure that your identity provider configures the SAML server with
              the Hue metadata. It is the same process you used to configure the
              Hue server with SAML metadata.
