Options for importing and syncing LDAP users and groups in Hue
Configuring Hue for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) enables you to import
  users and groups from a directory service, synchronize group membership manually or automatically
  at login, and authenticate users with LDAP.
There are four options to import and sync LDAP users and groups in Hue:

LDAP sync option
Description



Add/Sync LDAP user
Import and synchronize one user at a time


Sync LDAP users/groups
Synchronize user memberships in all groups


Add/Sync LDAP group
Import and synchronize all users in one group


sync_groups_on_login
Automatically synchronize group membership at login


The following flowchart shows the process and the options to import and synchronize new users
   or groups in Hue:


Importing a group from LDAP creates a group in Hue. When you synchronize a group, Hue checks
   the user's group membership in LDAP and synchronizes it to the corresponding group in Hue. To
   synchronize an LDAP group with Hue, the group must be imported in the Hue database.
For example, if a user belongs to 10 LDAP groups, but only 5 groups are present in Hue, then
   only these 5 groups are synced when new users are added to these groups. This mechanism helps to
   avoid including irrelevant group data in the Hue database.
If you have multiple LDAP groups that are synchronized with Hue, then you can automate the
   synchronization process by turning on the sync_groups_on_login option in the Hue
   Advanced Configuration Snippet. However, this process can be burdensome if you have a large
   number of users logging in and authenticating simultaneously or new users getting added to the
   LDAP group, as multiple synchronization requests are triggered which could cause collisions on
   database writes. An alternative approach is to synchronize users using the command line option,
   which you can script and automate as a cron job. To manually synchronize LDAP groups having the
   newly added users that need to be added to Hue, run the following command separately for each
   LDAP
   group:$HUE_HOME/build/env/bin/hue import_ldap_group --import-members [***LDAP-GROUP-NAME***] --cm-managed

Importing and synchronizing users and groups with an LDAP server in HueYou can import and synchronize one user at a time, synchronize all user memberships in     all groups, import and synchronize all users in one group, or enable synchronization of group     memberships automatically when users in those groups log in to Hue.Parent topic: User management in Hue
