Resetting Hue user password
The first user logging into Hue after its initial installation becomes the first
        superuser. Even if a user does not log into the Hue UI, the first security scan may log in
        creating an initial user and therefore resulting in an unknown username and password. You
        can change the password for a user if you know the username or you can create a new
        superuser user and then use it to log in to Hue and change the password for a
        user.

Sign in to the Hue server as the root user and go to the Hue
                    home directory.

If you know the user ID of the currently logged in user, then reset the
                    password by running the following command:

build/env/bin/hue changepassword [***USER-ID***] --cm-managed

Replace the USER-ID with the actual ID of the user.

If you do not know the user ID of the user whose password you want to change,
                    then create a new Hue admin user by running the following command:

build/env/bin/hue createsuperuser --cm-managed

After creating a new admin user, log in to Hue and reset the password for a
                    given user ID.
