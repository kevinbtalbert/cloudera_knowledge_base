Restricting supported ciphers for Hue
You can configure the list of ciphers that Hue supports with HTTPS.
Use the ssl_cipher_list property under the
        [desktop] section in the Cloudera Manager Hue Service Advanced
        Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini property:
[desktop]
ssl_cipher_list=[***LIST-OF-ACCEPTED-CIPHERS***]
By default, the ssl_cipher_list property is set to
        !aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXPORT:!SSLv2. Specify ciphers using the cipher list
      format described at OpenSSL Cryptograpy and SSL/TLS Toolkit Manpages by selecting the
      SSL version, and then going to Commands > ciphers.
