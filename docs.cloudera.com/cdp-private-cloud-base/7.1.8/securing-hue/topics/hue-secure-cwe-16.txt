Securing Hue from CWE-16Cloudera Docs
Securing Hue from CWE-16
Hue may have allowed external domains such as doubleclick.net, .googletagmanager.com,
        or *.google-analytics.com to run JavaScript scripts, for certain URLs in the Content
        Security Policy (CSP) headers. This may lead to Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE-16). To
        secure Hue from CWE-16 class of weaknesses, you can add the X-Content-Type-Options response
        HTTP header and prevent attacks based on MIME-type confusions in Hueâ€™s Advanced
        Configuration Snippet using Cloudera Manager.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue > Configuration and add the following lines in the Hue Service
                        Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        hue_safety_valve.in field:

[desktop]
# X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff This is an HTTP response header
# feature that helps prevent attacks based on MIME-type confusion.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
