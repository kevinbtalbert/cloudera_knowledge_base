Enabling Hue as a TLS/SSL server using Cloudera Manager
You can use Cloudera Manager to enable TLS/SSL for the Hue server.
    

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration and filter by SCOPE > Hue Server and CATEGORY > Security.

Edit the following Hue TLS/SSL properties according to your cluster configuration:


Enable TLS/SSL for Hue: Select the check box to encrypt
              communication between clients and Hue with TLS/SSL.
Hue TLS/SSL Server Certificate File (PEM Format)
                ssl_certificate: Specifies the path to the TLS/SSL certificate on the
              host that is running the Hue web server.Ensure that you include the complete chain
                in the ssl_certificate PEM file.The order of the certificates should be as
                follows from the top to bottom: server, intermediate, root.If there are
                multiple intermediate CA certificates, then you must add them in the correct order.
                For
                example:Subject: CN=Hue Server Certificate
Issuer: CN=Intermediate 2

  Subject: CN=Intermediate 2
  Issuer: CN=Intermediate 1

    Subject: CN=Intermediate 1
    Issuer: CN=RootCA

      Subject: CN=RootCA
      Issuer: CN=RootCA
Hue TLS/SSL Server Private Key File (PEM Format)
                ssl_private_key: Specifies the path to the TLS/SSL private key on the
              host running the Hue web server.
Hue TLS/SSL Private Key Password ssl_password: Specifies the
              password for the private key in the Hue TLS/SSL Server Certificate and Private Key
              file.
Hue TLS/SSL Server CA Certificate (PEM Format) ssl_cacerts:
              Specifies the path to the TLS/SSL certificate authority root certificate on the host
              that is running the Hue web server.



Add the path to the certificate chain PEM file in [desktop] section of
          the Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
            hue_safety_valve.ini field:

[desktop]
ssl_certificate_chain=/[***PATH***]/[***TO***]/[***FULL-CHAIN***].pem


Click Save Changes.

Select Actions > Restart to restart the Hue service.

Change the permissions for Hue to read the certificates after
      you have enabled TLS/SSL as
      follows:chmod 644 [***PATH-WHERE-SSL-FILES-FOR-HUE-ARE-LOCATED***]
