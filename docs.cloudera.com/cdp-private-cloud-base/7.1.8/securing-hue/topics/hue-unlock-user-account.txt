Unlocking locked out user accounts in Hue
If Hue is configured to lock out a user account after a set number of invalid login
        attempts, then the users get an "Account locked: too many login attempts. Contact an admin
        to unlock your account." error message. As an Admin, you can unlock user accounts from the
        Hue web interface.

Log in to the Hue web interface as an Administrator or a Hue superuser.

Expand your user name on the left assist panel and click Administer
                        Users.
The User Admin page is displayed.

Click on the username that you want to unlock.

Go to the Step 3. Advanced tab and select the
                        Unlock Account option.

Click Update User.

The user should be able to log in to Hue.
