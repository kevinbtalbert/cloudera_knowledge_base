Configuring LDAP Group Mappings

Each host that comprises a node in a Cloudera cluster runs an operating
      system, such as CentOS or Oracle Linux. At the OS-level, there are
        user:group accounts created during installation that
      map to the services running on that specific node of the cluster. The
      default shell-based group mapping provider,
        org.apache.hadoop.security.ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping,
      handles the mapping from the local host system (the OS) to the specific
      cluster service, such as HDFS. The hosts authenticate using these local OS
      accounts before processes are allowed to run on the node.
For clusters integrated with Kerberos for authentication, the hosts must
      also provide Kerberos tickets before processes can run on the node. The
      cluster can use the organization's LDAP directory service to provide the
      login credentials, including Kerberos tickets, to authenticate
      transparently while the system runs. That means that the local
        user:group accounts on each host must be mapped to LDAP
      accounts. To map local user:group accounts to an LDAP
      service:
Use tools such as SSSD (Systems Security Services
        Daemon) or Centrify Server Suite (see Identity and Access management for
          Cloudera). 
The Hadoop LdapGroupsMapping group mapping mechanism.
        The LdapGroupsMapping library may not be as robust a
        solution needed for large organizations in terms of scalability and
        manageability, especially for organizations managing identity across
        multiple systems and not exclusively for Hadoop clusters. Support for
        the LdapGroupsMapping library is not consistent across
        all operating systems. 
Do not use Winbind to map Linux user:group accounts
        to Active Directory. It cannot scale, impedes cluster performance, and
        is not supported.
Use the same user:group mappings across all cluster
        nodes, for ease of management.
Use either Cloudera Manager or the command-line process detailed
        below. 
The local user:group accounts must be mapped to LDAP for
      group mappings in Hadoop. You must create the users and groups for your
      Hadoop services in LDAP. 
To integrate the cluster with an LDAP service, the
        user:group relationships must be contained in the LDAP
      directory. The admin must create the user accounts and define groups
        for user:group relationships on each host.
The user and group names listed in the table are the default
        user:group values for CDP services. 
noteIf the defaults have been changed for any service, use the
      custom values to create the users and configure the group for that service
      in the LDAP server, rather than the defaults listed in the table below.
      For example, you changed the defaults in the Cloudera Manager Admin
      Console to customize the System User or
        System Group setting for the service.

Using Cloudera Manager

Minimum Required Role:
Configurator (also provided by
          Cluster Administrator,
Limited Cluster Administrator , and
          Full Administrator)
Make the following changes to the HDFS service's security configuration:
Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console and go to the HDFS service.
Click the Configuration tab.
Select Scope > HDFS
                (Service Wide)
Select
                Category > Security.
Modify the following configuration properties using values from
            the table below:

Configuration Property
Value



Hadoop User Group Mapping Implementation
org.apache.hadoop.security.LdapGroupsMapping


Hadoop User Group Mapping LDAP URL
ldap://<server>


Hadoop User Group Mapping LDAP Bind User
Administrator@example.com


Hadoop User Group Mapping LDAP Bind User
                      Password
***


Hadoop User Group Mapping Search Base

Although the above changes are sufficient to configure group mappings for Active
        Directory, some changes to the remaining default configurations might be
        required for OpenLDAP.
