Adding Files to an Encryption Zone
You can add files to an encryption zone by copying them to the encryption zone using
      distcp. 
For
      example:hadoop distcp /user/dir /encryption_zone
importantYou can delete files or directories that are part of an HDFS encryption
      zone. 
Copying data from encrypted locations
By default, distcp compares checksums provided by the filesystem to verify
        that data was successfully copied to the destination. When copying from an encrypted
        location, the file system checksums will not match because the underlying block data is
        different. This is true whether or not the destination location is encrypted or
        unencrypted.
In this case, you can specify the -skipcrccheck and
          -update flags to avoid verifying checksums. When you use
          -skipcrccheck, distcp checks the file integrity by
        performing a file size comparison, right after the copy completes for each file.
