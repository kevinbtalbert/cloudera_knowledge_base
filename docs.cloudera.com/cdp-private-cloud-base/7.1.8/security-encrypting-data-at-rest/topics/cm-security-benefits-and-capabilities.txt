Benefits and Capabilities
In addition to minimizing security risks, re-encrypting the EDEK offers other
    capabilities and benefits.


Re-encrypting EDEKs does not require that the user explicitly re-encrypt HDFS
              files. 
In cases where there are several zones using the same key, the Key Administrator has
              the option of selecting which zoneâ€™s EDEKs are re-encrypted first.
The HDFS Superuser can also monitor and cancel re-encryption operations.
Re-encryption is restarted automatically in cases where you have a NameNode failure
              during the re-encryption operation.
