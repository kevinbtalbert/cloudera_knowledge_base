Configuring CDP Services for HDFS Encryption
There are recommendations that you must consider for setting up HDFS Transparent
    Encryption with various CDP services.

importantEncrypting /tmp using HDFS encryption is not
        supported. 

 noteRanger audit directories in HDFS are owned by specific service users. In case of HDFS, it will be the HDFS service user. Typically, HDFS service user is blacklisted for DECRYPT_EEK operation. Hence, enabling encryption of ranger audit directories in HDFS is not recommended.


Transparent Encryption Recommendations for HBaseMake /hbase an encryption zone. Do not create encryption zones as     subdirectories under /hbase, because HBase may need to rename files across     those subdirectories. When you create the encryption zone, name the key       hbase-key to take advantage of auto-generated KMS ACLs.Transparent Encryption Recommendations for HiveHDFS encryption has been designed so that files cannot be moved from one encryption     zone to another or from encryption zones to unencrypted directories. Therefore, the landing zone     for data when using the LOAD DATA INPATH command must always be inside the     destination encryption zone.Transparent Encryption Recommendations for HueMake /user/hue an encryption zone because Oozie workflows and other     Hue-specific data are stored there by default. When you create the encryption zone, name the key       hue-key to take advantage of auto-generated KMS ACLs.Transparent Encryption Recommendations for ImpalaThere are various recommendations to consider when configuring HDFS Transparent     Encryption for Impala.Transparent Encryption Recommendations for MapReduce and YARNMapReduce v1 stores both history and logs on local disks by default. Even if you do         configure history to be stored on HDFS, the files are not renamed. Hence, no special         configuration is required.Transparent Encryption Recommendations for SearchMake /solr an encryption zone. When you create the encryption zone,     name the key solr-key to take advantage of auto-generated KMS ACLs.Transparent Encryption Recommendations for SparkThere are various recommendations to consider when configuring HDFS Transparent     Encryption for Spark.Transparent Encryption Recommendations for SqoopThere are various recommendations to consider when configuring HDFS Transparent     Encryption for Sqoop.Parent topic: HDFS Transparent Encryption
