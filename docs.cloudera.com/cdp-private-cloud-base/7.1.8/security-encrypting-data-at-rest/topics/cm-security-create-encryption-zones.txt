Creating Encryption Zones
Once a KMS has been set up and the NameNode and HDFS clients have been correctly
    configured, use the hadoop key and hdfs crypto command-line
    tools to create encryption keys and set up new encryption zones.
important Cloudera does not currently support
        configuring the root directory as an encryption zone. Nested encryption zones are also not
        supported.
importantThe Java Keystore KMS
        default Truststore (for example,
          org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.JavaKeyStoreProvider)
        does not support uppercase key names.


Create an encryption key for your zone as keyadmin for the user/group
          (regardless of the application that will be using the encryption
          zone):hadoop key create <key_name>
Create a new empty directory and make it an encryption zone using the key created
          above.hadoop fs -mkdir /encryption_zone
hdfs crypto -createZone -keyName <key_name> -path /encryption_zoneYou
          can verify creation of the new encryption zone by running the -listZones
          command. You should see the encryption zone along with its key listed as
            follows:$ hdfs crypto -listZones
/encryption_zone    <key_name>warningDo not delete an encryption key as long as it is still in use for an encryption zone.
            This results in loss of access to data in that zone. Also, do not delete the KMS
            service, as your encrypted HDFS data will be inaccessible. To prevent data loss, first
            copy the encrypted HDFS data to a non-encrypted zone using the distcp
            command.
