Deleting Encryption Zones
To remove an encryption zone, delete the encrypted directory.

warningThis command deletes the entire directory and all of its contents. Ensure
        that the data is no longer needed before running this command.
hadoop fs -rm -r -skipTrash /encryption_zone

importantThe Key Trustee KMS does not directly run a key deletion (for
        example, it may perform a soft delete instead, or delay the actual deletion to prevent
        mistakes). In these cases, errors may occur when creating or deleting a key using the same
        name after it has already been deleted.
