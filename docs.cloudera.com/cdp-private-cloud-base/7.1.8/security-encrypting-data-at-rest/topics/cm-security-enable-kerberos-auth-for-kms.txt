Enabling Kerberos Authentication for the KMS
You can use Cloudera Manager to enable Kerberos authentication for the KMS.
Minimum Required Role:
Full Administrator

Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console and go to the KMS service.

Click Configuration.

Set the Authentication Type property to
            kerberos.

Click Save Changes.

Because Cloudera Manager does not automatically create the principal and keytab file
          for the KMS, you must run the Generate Credentials command manually. 
On the top navigation bar, go to Administration > Security > Kerberos Credentialsand click Generate Missing CredentialsnoteThis does
            not create a new Kerberos principal if an existing HTTP principal
            exists for the KMS host.

Return to the home page by clicking the Cloudera Manager logo.

Click the  icon that
          is next to any stale services to invoke the cluster restart wizard.

Click Restart Stale Services.

Click Restart Now.

Click Finish.
