Encrypting Data at Rest
Secure data at rest using encryption mechanisms and key management.
Cloudera clusters can use a combination of data at rest encryption mechanisms, including HDFS
      transparent encryption and Cloudera Navigator Encrypt. Both of these data at rest encryption
      mechanisms can be augmented with key management using Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server
      and Cloudera Navigator Key HSM. 
Before configuring encryption for data at rest, familiarize yourself with
      the requirements in "Data at Rest Encryption Requirements".
