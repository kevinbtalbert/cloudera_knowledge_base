Deploying Cloudera Navigator for encrypting data at rest
The following diagram illustrates product component functional relationships:

To isolate Key Trustee Server from other CDP services, you must deploy Key Trustee Server
        on dedicated hosts in a separate cluster in Cloudera Manager. Deploy Ranger KMS on dedicated
        hosts in the same cluster as the CDP services that require access to Key Trustee Server.
        This provides the following benefits:

You can restart your CDP cluster without restarting Key Trustee Server, avoiding
          interruption to other clusters or clients that use the same Key Trustee Server
          instance.
You can manage the Key Trustee Server upgrade cycle independently
        of other cluster components.
You can limit access to the Key Trustee Server hosts to authorized key
        administrators only, reducing the attack surface of the system.
Resource contention is reduced. Running Key Trustee Server and Key
        Trustee KMS services on dedicated hosts prevents other cluster services
        from reducing available resources (such as CPU and memory) and creating
        bottlenecks.
If you are using virtual machines for the Key Trustee Server or Key Trustee KMS hosts, see
        "Resource Planning for Data at Rest Encryption".
