Transparent Encryption Recommendations for HBase
Make /hbase an encryption zone. Do not create encryption zones as
    subdirectories under /hbase, because HBase may need to rename files across
    those subdirectories. When you create the encryption zone, name the key
      hbase-key to take advantage of auto-generated KMS ACLs.
Steps
On a cluster without HBase currently installed, create the
            /hbase directory and make that an encryption zone. 
On a cluster with HBase already installed, perform the following
            steps:
Stop the HBase service.
Move data from the /hbase directory to
                /hbase-tmp.
Create an empty /hbase directory and make it an
              encryption zone.
Distcp all data from /hbase-tmp to
                /hbase, preserving user-group permissions and
              extended attributes.
Start the HBase service and verify that it is working as
              expected.
Remove the /hbase-tmp directory.


KMS ACL Configuration for HBase
In the KMS ACL, grant the hbase user and group
          DECRYPT_EEK permission for the HBase key:
<property>
  <name>key.acl.hbase-key.DECRYPT_EEK</name>
  <value>hbase hbase</value>
  </description>
</property>
