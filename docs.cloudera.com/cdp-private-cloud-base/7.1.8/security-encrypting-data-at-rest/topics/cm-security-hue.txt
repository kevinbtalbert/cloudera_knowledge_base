Transparent Encryption Recommendations for Hue
Make /user/hue an encryption zone because Oozie workflows and other
    Hue-specific data are stored there by default. When you create the encryption zone, name the key
      hue-key to take advantage of auto-generated KMS ACLs.
Steps
On a cluster without Hue currently installed, create the
            /user/hue directory and make it an encryption
          zone.
On a cluster with Hue already installed:

Create an empty /user/hue-tmp directory.
Make /user/hue-tmp an encryption zone.
DistCp all data from /user/hue into
              /user/hue-tmp.
Remove /user/hue and rename
              /user/hue-tmp to /user/hue.


KMS ACL Configuration for Hue
In the KMS ACLs, grant the hue and oozie users and groups
          DECRYPT_EEK permission for the Hue key:
<property>
  <name>key.acl.hue-key.DECRYPT_EEK</name>
  <value>oozie,hue oozie,hue</value>
</property>
