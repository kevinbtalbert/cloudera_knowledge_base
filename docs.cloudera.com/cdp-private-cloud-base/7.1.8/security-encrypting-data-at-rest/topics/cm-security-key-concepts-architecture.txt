Key Concepts and Architecture
HDFS must be integrated with an external enterprise-level keystore. The Hadoop Key
    Management server serves as a proxy between HDFS clients and the keystore. The keystore can be
    either the Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server or a support Hardware Security
    Module.
HDFS transparent encryption involves the creation of an encryption zone, which is a directory
      in HDFS whose contents will be automatically encrypted on write and decrypted on read. Each
      encryption zone is associated with a key (EZ Key) specified by the key administrator when the
      zone is created. The EZ keys are stored on the external keystore.

Keystores and the Key Management ServerIntegrating HDFS with an external, enterprise-level keystore is the first step     to deploying transparent encryption. This is because separation of duties between a key     administrator and an HDFS administrator is a very important aspect of this feature.Data Encryption Components and SolutionsCloudera supports four encryption components which may be combined as unique solutions.     When selecting a Key Management System (KMS), you must decide which components meet the key     management and encryption requirements for your enterprise.Encryption Zones and KeysHDFS transparent encryption introduces the concept of an encryption zone     (EZ), which is a directory in HDFS whose contents will be automatically encrypted on write and     decrypted on read. Accessing Files Within an Encryption ZoneTo encrypt a new file, the HDFS client requests a new EDEK from the NameNode. The HDFS     client then asks the KMS to decrypt it with the encryption zone's EZ key. This decryption     results in a DEK, which is used to encrypt the file.Parent topic: HDFS Transparent Encryption
