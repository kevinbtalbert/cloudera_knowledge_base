Keystores and the Key Management Server
Integrating HDFS with an external, enterprise-level keystore is the first step
    to deploying transparent encryption. This is because separation of duties between a key
    administrator and an HDFS administrator is a very important aspect of this feature.However, most keystores are not designed for the encrypt/decrypt request rates seen by Hadoop
      workloads. This led to the development of a new service, called the Key Management Server
        (KMS), which serves as a proxy between HDFS clients and the backing keystore. Both the
      keystore and KMS must use Hadoop's KeyProvider API to interact with each other and with HDFS
      clients. While HDFS encryption can be used with a local Java KeyStore for key management, Cloudera does
          not recommend this for production environments where a more robust and secure key
          management solution should be used. Cloudera offers the following two options for
          enterprise-grade key management:

Key Trustee Server is a key store for managing encryption keys. To integrate with the
        Key Trustee Server, Cloudera provides Ranger KMS.
Hardware security modules (HSM) are third-party appliances that provide the highest
        level of security for keys. 
The diagram below illustrates how HDFS clients and the NameNode interact with an enterprise
      keystore through the Key Management Server. The keystore can be either the Key Trustee Server
      or a support HSM.
