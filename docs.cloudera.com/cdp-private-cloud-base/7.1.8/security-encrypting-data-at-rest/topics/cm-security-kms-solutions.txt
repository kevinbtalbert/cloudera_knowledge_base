Data Encryption Components and Solutions
Cloudera supports four encryption components which may be combined as unique solutions.
    When selecting a Key Management System (KMS), you must decide which components meet the key
    management and encryption requirements for your enterprise.
Cloudera Encryption components
Descriptions of Cloudera components for encrypting data at rest follow:
Ranger Key Management System (KMS)
Ranger extends the native Hadoop KMS functionality by allowing you to store keys in
              a secure database or you can use the secure key store like Key Trustee Server.
              Cryptographic key management service supporting HDFS TDE. Not a general purpose Key
              Management System, as opposed to Hadoop KMS which stores keys in file based Java
              Keystore, can be accessed only through KeyProvider API.
Key Trustee Server (KTS)
Key Manager that stores and manages cryptographic keys and other security
              artifacts
Key HSM
Allows Ranger Key Trustee Server to seamlessly integrate with the following hardware
              security modules (HSM)
Luna 6 & 7
CipherTrust
GCP Cloud HSM
Azure Key Vault

Navigator Encrypt
Transparently encrypts and secures data at rest without requiring changes to your
              applications


Cloudera Encryption solutions
You can deploy encryption components as any of the following solutions for encrypting data
        at rest:
Ranger KMS Only


Consists of ONLY Ranger KMS with a backend database that provides key
                  storage
Ranger KMS provides enterprise-grade key management 


Ranger KMS + HSM


Consists of Ranger KMS with database + integration with a backend hardware
                  security module (HSM)
Ranger KMS provides enterprise-grade key management
HSM provides encryption zone key protection
HSM stores only the encryption master key


Ranger KMS + Key Trustee Server (KTS)


Ranger KMS provides enterprise-grade key management 
KTS provides the key store that stores and manages cryptographic keys and other
                  security artifacts


Ranger KMS + KTS + Key HSM
Allows Cloudera Key Trustee Server to seamlessly integrate with a HSM in addition to
              above items
