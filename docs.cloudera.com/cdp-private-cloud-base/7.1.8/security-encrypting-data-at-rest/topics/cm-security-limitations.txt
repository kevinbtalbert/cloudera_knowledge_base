Limitations
There are few limitations associated with the re-encryption of EDEKs. 
cautionYou cannot perform any rename operations within the encryption zone during
      re-encryption. If you attempt to perform a rename operation during EDEK re-encryption, you
      will receive an IOException error.
EDEK re-encryption does not change EDEKs on snapshots, due to the immutable nature HDFS
      snapshots. Thus, you should be aware that after EZ key exposure, the Key Administrator must
      delete snapshots.
