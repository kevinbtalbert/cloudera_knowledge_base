Transparent Encryption Recommendations for MapReduce and YARN
MapReduce v1 stores both history and logs on local disks by default. Even if you do
        configure history to be stored on HDFS, the files are not renamed. Hence, no special
        configuration is required.
Recommendations for MapReduce v2 (YARN)
Make /user/history a single encryption zone, because history files
                are moved between the intermediate and done
                directories, and HDFS encryption does not allow moving encrypted files across
                encryption zones. When you create the encryption zone, name the key
                    mapred-key to take advantage of auto-generated KMS ACLs.

Steps
On a cluster with MRv2 (YARN) installed, create the /user/history
                directory and make that an encryption zone.
If /user/history already exists and is not empty:

Create an empty /user/history-tmp directory.
Make /user/history-tmp an encryption zone.
DistCp all data from /user/history into
                        /user/history-tmp.
 Remove /user/history and rename
                        /user/history-tmp to /user/history.
