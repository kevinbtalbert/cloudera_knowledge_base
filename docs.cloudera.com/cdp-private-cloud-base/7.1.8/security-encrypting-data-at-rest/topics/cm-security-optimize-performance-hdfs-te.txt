Optimizing Performance for HDFS Transparent EncryptionCloudera Docs
Optimizing Performance for HDFS Transparent Encryption
CDP implements the Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions (AES-NI),
    which provide substantial performance improvements. To get these improvements, you need a recent
    version of libcrypto.so on HDFS and MapReduce client hosts -- that is, any host
    from which you originate HDFS or MapReduce requests. 
Many OS versions have an older version of the library that does not support AES-NI. The
      instructions that follow tell you what you need to do for each OS version that CDP
      supports.

warning To ensure that HDFS encryption functions as
        expected, the steps described in this section are mandatory for
          production use.

RHEL/CentOS 6.5 or later
The installed version of libcrypto.so supports AES-NI,
      but you need to install the openssl-devel package on all
      clients:sudo yum install openssl-devel
RHEL/CentOS 6.4 or earlier 6.x versions, or SLES 11
Download and extract a newer version of libcrypto.so
      from a CentOS 6.5 repository and install it on all clients in
        /var/lib/hadoop/extra/native/:
Download the latest version of the openssl package.
          For
          example:wget http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/x86_64/Packages/openssl-1.0.1e-30.el6.x86_64.rpmThe
            libcrypto.so file in this package can be used on
          SLES 11 as well as RHEL/CentOS.
Decompress the files in the package, but do not install
          it:rpm2cpio openssl-1.0.1e-30.el6.x86_64.rpm | cpio -idmv
If you are using parcels, create the
            /var/lib/hadoop/extra/native/
          directory:sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/hadoop/extra/native
Copy the shared library into
            /var/lib/hadoop/extra/native/. Name the target
          file libcrypto.so, with no suffix at the end, exactly
          as in the command that
          follows.sudo cp ./usr/lib64/libcrypto.so.1.0.1e /var/lib/hadoop/extra/native/libcrypto.so

Debian Wheezy
The installed version of libcrypto.so supports AES-NI,
      but you need to install the libssl-devel package on all
      clients:sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
Ubuntu Precise and Ubuntu Trusty
Install the libssl-devel package on all
      clients:sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
Testing
        if encryption optimization works
To verify that a client host is ready to use the AES-NI instruction set
      optimization for HDFS encryption at rest, use the following
      command:hadoop checknativeYou
      should see a response such as the
      following:14/12/12 13:48:39 INFO bzip2.Bzip2Factory: Successfully loaded & initialized native-bzip2
library system-native14/12/12 13:48:39 INFO zlib.ZlibFactory: Successfully loaded & initialized native-zlib library
Native library checking:
hadoop:  true /usr/lib/hadoop/lib/native/libhadoop.so.1.0.0
zlib:    true /lib64/libz.so.1
snappy:  true /usr/lib64/libsnappy.so.1
lz4:     true revision:99
bzip2:   true /lib64/libbz2.so.1
openssl: true /usr/lib64/libcrypto.soIf
      you see true in the openssl row, Hadoop
      has detected the right version of libcrypto.so and
      optimization will work. If you see false in this row, you
      do not have the right version.
