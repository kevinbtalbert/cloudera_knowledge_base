Prerequisites and Assumptions
There are certain considerations that you must be aware of as you re-encrypt an
    EDEK.


It is recommended that you perform EDEK re-encryption at the same time that you
              perform regular cluster maintenance because the operation can adversely impact CPU
              resources on the NameNode. 
In Cloudera Manager, review the cluster’s NameNode status, which must be in
          “Good Health”. If the cluster NameNode does not have a status of “Good
          Health”, then do not proceed with the re-encryption of the EDEK. In the Cloudera
          Manager WebUI menu, you can verify the status for the cluster NameNode, which must
            not be in Safe mode (in other words, the WebUI should indicate “Safemode is
          off”).


Running the re-encryption command without successfully verifying the preceding items will
          result in failures with errors.
