Re-encrypting Encrypted Data Encryption Keys (EDEKs)
When you re-encrypt an EDEK, you are essentially decrypting the original EDEK created
    by the DEK, and then re-encrypting it using the new (rolled) version of the EZ key. The file's
    metadata, which is stored in the NameNode, is then updated with this new EDEK. Re-encryption
    does not impact the data in the HDFS files or the DEKâ€“the same DEK is still used to
    decrypt the file, so re-encryption is essentially transparent.

Re-encrypting an EDEKThis scenario operates on the assumption that an encryption zone has already been set     up for this cluster. Managing Re-encryption OperationsThere are various facets of the EDEK re-encryption process such as cancelling     re-encryption, rolling keys during a re-encryption operation, and throttling re-encryption     operations.Parent topic: Managing Encryption Keys and Zones
