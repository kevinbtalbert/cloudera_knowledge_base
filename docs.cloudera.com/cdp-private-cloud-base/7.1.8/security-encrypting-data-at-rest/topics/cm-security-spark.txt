Transparent Encryption Recommendations for Spark
There are various recommendations to consider when configuring HDFS Transparent
    Encryption for Spark.
Recommendations

By default, application event logs are stored at
              /user/spark/applicationHistory, which can be made
            into an encryption zone.
Spark also optionally caches its JAR file at
              /user/spark/share/lib (by default), but
            encrypting this directory is not required.


KMS ACL Configuration for Spark
In the KMS ACL, grant DECRYPT_EEK permission for the Spark key to the
          spark user and any groups that can submit Spark jobs:
<property>
  <name>key.acl.spark-key.DECRYPT_EEK</name>
  <value>spark spark-users</value>
</property>
