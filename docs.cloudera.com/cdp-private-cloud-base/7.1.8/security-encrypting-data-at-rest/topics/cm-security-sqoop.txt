Transparent Encryption Recommendations for Sqoop
There are various recommendations to consider when configuring HDFS Transparent
    Encryption for Sqoop.
Recommendations


For Hive support:  Ensure that you are using Sqoop with the
              --target-dir parameter set to a directory that is inside the Hive
            encryption zone.
For append/incremental support:  Make sure that the
              sqoop.test.import.rootDir property points to the same encryption zone
            as the --target-dir argument.
For HCatalog support: No special configuration is
              required.
