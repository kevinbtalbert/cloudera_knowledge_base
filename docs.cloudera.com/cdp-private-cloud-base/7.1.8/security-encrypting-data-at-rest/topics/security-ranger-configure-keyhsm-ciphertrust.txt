Connecting KeySecure HSM to CipherTrust Manager after migration from Key Secure
        HSM
 How to configure the KeySecure HSM to connect to CipherTrust.

After the Thales team successfully migrates the keys from Key Secure HSM to
                CipherTrust Manager, you must configure the Key HSM to connect to CipherTrust. You
                must perform the following steps on both the Active and Passive KTS nodes.


The Thales team must have successfully migrated the keys from Key Secure HSM to
                CipherTrust Manager.


Stop the Key HSM service.

$ service keyhsm stop


Backup the existing application.properties file.
Optional: 
If SSL is enabled on CipherTrust Manager, run the following command 

$ echo "thales_machine_ip nae.keysecure.local" >> /etc/hosts 


Set up the Key HSM service.

$ keyhsm setup keysecure

Validate the Key HSM.

$ service keyhsm validate

Start the Key HSM service.

$ service keyhsm start
Starting KeyHSM, please wait...


KeyHSM started successfully


Configure Key HSM to trust KTS by providing the full path to the file.

$ keyhsm trust /var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee/.ssl/ssl-cert-keytrustee.pem


Configure KTS to trust the Key HSM server.

$ ktadmin keyhsm --server http://127.0.0.1:9090 --trust


notePerform the next two steps once above steps are
                        successfully done on both Active and Passive KTS nodes. 


Restart KTS Server from Cloudera Manager. 

Restart Ranger KMS KTS service from Cloudera Manager.
