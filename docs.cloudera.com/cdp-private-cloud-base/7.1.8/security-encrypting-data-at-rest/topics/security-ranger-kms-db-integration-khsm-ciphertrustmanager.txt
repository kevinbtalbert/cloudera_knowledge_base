How to integrate Ranger KMS DB with CipherTrust Manager HSM.

This task describes how to integrate Ranger KMS DB with CipherTrust Manager Hardware
                Security Module (HSM). This process includes configuring the NAE port in Thales
                Cipher Trust Manager, configuring Ranger DB KMS to interact with Thales CipherTrust
                HSM, or, migrating Ranger KMS DB Master Key To CipherTrust Manager HSM, and
                migrating the master key from CipherTrust Manager HSM to Ranger KMS DB.



Ensure you have Thales CipherTrust Manger installed in your enivronment.
Ensure you have Java (jdk1.8.0.232) installed. 



Configure NAE port in Thales CipherTrust Manager

Log in to Thales CipherTrust Manager.

In CipherTrust Manager > Admin Settings, select Add Interface.

In Type, Select NAE (default).

In Network Interface,
                    selectAll.

In Port, type a value for the port number.
9000

In Mode, select one of the following options to match
                    your environment:


No TLS, user must supply password.
TLS, Ignore client cert. user must supply password.



Click Add.


If selected mode is TLS, ignore client cert, user must supply password
                    while adding interface, then click on Edit and Download Current
                        Certificate as shown in the images below. Else, skip this step. 



Once certificate downloaded (e.g -Certificate_nae.txt) copy it to Ranger KMS
                                        server
Create a directory on Ranger KMS serverhost under /etc/security.
                    mkdir etc/security/serverKeys and scp the downloaded
                    certificate to this directory. Ensure that the user has required access to the
                    file
                    chown kms:kms etc/security/serverKeys/Certificate_nae.txtchmod 755 etc/security/serverKeysCertificate_nae.txt

Create a user.


Go toAccess Management > Users, click Create New User .


In Create a New User, provide a username,
                            password, and any required information.


Click Create.

Fresh installation - Configuring Ranger KMS DB to interact with Thales CipherTrust
        HSM.
These are the steps required to configure Ranger KMS DB to interact with Thales
        CipherTrust HSM. These steps need to be performed only when the cluster is ready with all
        the required services and no encryption zone keys are present.

SSH into the Ranger KMS host.

Create a directory and copy the files IngrianNAE.properties, libIngPKCS11.so and
                            sunpkcs11.cfg from Thales CipherTrust Manager to the directory.
mkdir -p /opt/safenetConf/64/8.3.1 and then copy the
                    above mentioned files under this location. 

noteMake sure you have provided read-write access (chmod 775) to Ranger KMS
                        service users (chown kms:kms) to all the 3 files. 


Update the IngrianNAE.propertiesfile and initialize the below mentioned
                    properties.

NAE_IP = Hostname / CipherTrust Manager IP address
NAE_Port=9000 (should be the same port provided on CipherTrust instance under Device tab) 
Protocol=tcp (valid values ssl or tcp, should be the same protocol provided on CipherTrust instance)


Initialize the following property only when the protocol of the CipherTrust
                    Manager instance is SSL. This is the location of the certificate downloaded from
                    CipherTrust Manager and copied on Ranger KMS host.

CA_File=/etc/security/serverKeys/Certificate_nae.txt 


Go to CM > Ranger KMS > Configuration > Search for Ranger KMS Server Advanced Configuration Snippet and click on + icon to add the properties.

Add the following properties:
IngrianNAE_Properties_Conf_Slot_ID_Max=100
IngrianNAE_Properties_Conf_SessionID_Max=100
NAE_Properties_Conf_Filename=/opt/safenetConf/64/8.3.1/IngrianNAE.properties



Save changes.

Search for the following properties and set the values as follows:

ranger.kms.keysecure.enabled = true
                    
ranger.kms.keysecure.UserPassword.Authentication = true
                    
ranger.kms.keysecure.masterkey.name = MasterKey1
                    
ranger.kms.keysecure.login.username = keysecure-username
                    
ranger.kms.keysecure.login.password = keysecure-password
                    
ranger.kms.keysecure.masterkey.size = 256
                    
ranger.kms.keysecure.sunpkcs11.cfg.filepath = /opt/safenetConf/64/8.3.1/sunpkcs11.cfg
                    

Save changes.

Restart Ranger KMS.

The master key with alias MasterKey1 is created in CipherTrust Manager.
        



 Once Ranger KMS has started successfully, verify zone key creation, and zone
            encryption/decryption.
