How to integrate Ranger KMS DB with Google Cloud HSM

This task describes how to integrate Ranger KMS DB with Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
                Hardware Security Module (HSM). This process includes setting up the GCP HSM service
                on a client (host), configuring Ranger KMS with GCP, or migrating the Master Key
                storage from the KMS database to the Google Cloud HSM.



Ensure you can log in to the Google cloud console using your accout. (Requires
                    Google account access).
Ensure you have  Java (jdk1.8.0.232) installed. 



Set Up Google Cloud HSM

Log in to Google Cloud console using Cloudera account.

Create the service account by selecting or creating the Project.

Create the key.

Download and save the key in JSON format.

noteRecord the project ID, Location ID and save the JSON file.


In GCP Console > Key Management create the key ring.



Figure 1. Creating a key ring in Google Cloud Platform





This example shows a project gcp-eng-sdx-daily,
                 region Global, and key ring
                        RangerKMSRing.

The key ring is created.

Fresh Install - Steps to Configure Ranger KMS with GCP
These are the steps to configure Ranger KMS with the Google Cloud Platform ( GCP).
        These steps need to be performed only when the cluster is ready with all the required
        services and no encryption zone keys are present. 

Stop the KMS service if running.

Go to CM > Ranger KMS > Configuration > Search for Ranger KMS Server Advanced Configuration Snippet
                            (Safety Valve) for conf/dbks-site.xml and click on + icon to add the properties.

Add the following properties :


Name
Value



ranger.kms.gcp.enabled
true


ranger.kms.gcp.keyring.id
<Key Ring Name>


ranger.kms.gcp.cred.file

/path/to/downloadedCredFile.json 




ranger.kms.gcp.project.id

your-project-id


ranger.kms.gcp.location.id

project-location-id



ranger.kms.gcp.masterkey.name

YourMasterKeyName




Figure 3. Adding properties to safety valve




Save changes. Restart Ranger KMS

Figure 4. A master key will be created in your keyring on GCP



On restart,a master key will be created in your keyring on
                    GCP.

 Once Ranger KMS has started successfully, verify zone key creation, and zone
            encryption/decryption.


Migrating the Master Key From Ranger KMS Database To Google Cloud HSM
These are the steps required to migrate the Master Key Storage from the KMS database
        to Google Cloud HSM. These steps need to be performed when the cluster is ready with all the
        required services and encryption zone keys are present in the Ranger KMS DB.
noteThese steps are not required if Ranger KMS with GCP is being installed for the first time.
Export the following as environment variables 
                JAVA_HOME, RANGER_KMS_HOME, RANGER_KMS_CONF, SQL_CONNECTOR_JAR and HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD.You can find the values of the environment variables as follows: 
                


SSH into one of the KMS hosts.


Run the command to find the required environment variable value

ps -ef | grep proc_rangerkms



For HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD move to


cd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/xxx-ranger_kms-RANGER_KMS_SERVER



Open the proc.json file and search for HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD.


export JAVA_HOME = /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_232-cloudera/ 
export RANGER_KMS_HOME = /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-7.2.15-1.cdh7.2.15.p0.19846155/lib/ranger-kms 
export RANGER_KMS_CONF = /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/51-ranger_kms-RANGER_KMS_SERVER/conf/ 
export SQL_CONNECTOR_JAR = /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar 
export HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD= hadoop_credstore_pwd 

Stop the Ranger KMS service.

Once the environment variables have been exported and  Ranger KMS
                            service has been stopped, use the MigrateMKeyStorageDbToGCP.sh
                            utility script to migrate the master key.
${RANGER_KMS_HOME}/MigrateMKeyStorageDbToGCP.sh ApacheMasterKey1
my_gcpProjectName my_gcpKeyRingNameÂ  my_gcpKeyRingLocationName my_pathOfJsonCredFile.json
noteMigration of Master Key Storage from Google Cloud HSM To Ranger KMS DB is not supported as
                        after creation, a key cannot be moved to another location or
                        exported.

Master Key from Ranger KMS DB has been successfully migrated to GCP.
