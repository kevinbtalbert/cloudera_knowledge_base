Set up CipherTrust HSM for Ranger KMS, KTS, and KeyHSM
 How to integrate Ranger KMS, KTS and KeyHSM with the CipherTrust HSM appliance. 

 This task describes how to set up the CipherTrust hardware security moudule (HSM)
                appliance provided by Thales. The process describes configuring the NAE port using
                CipherTrust Manager, setting up and configuring KeyHSM in your cluster, and
                validating keys using CipherTrust Manager.

You must:
Have Thales CipherTrust Manger installed in your enivronment.
Have Ranger Key Management System, Key Trustee Server and Key HSM installed in
                    your environment.
Have Java (jdk1.8.0.232) installed. 
See related topics for more information about installing Ranger KMS, KTS and
                KeyHSM.

Configure NAE port in Thales CipherTrust Manager

Log in to Thales CipherTrust Manager.

In CipherTrust Manager > Admin Settings, select Add Interface.

In Type, Select NAE (default).

In Network Interface,
                    selectAll.

In Port, type a value for the port number.
9000

In Mode, select one of the following options to match
                    your environment:


No TLS, user must supply password.
TLS, Ignore client cert. user must supply password.



Click Add.

Create a user.


In Access Management > Users, click Create New User .


In Create a New User, provide a username,
                            password, and any any required information.


Click Create.


Setting up a cluster and configuring KeyHSMnotePerform the following steps on both active and passive KTS
                nodes.
In your Key HSM root directory, make sure that appropriate versions of KeyHSM
                    files are available with proper permissions.

cd /usr/share/keytrustee-server-keyhsm/ 


note
Cipher Trust HSM supports two keyhsm versions. 
If using Ingrian v6.x, then copy all jars into this folder and
                                    make sure you have provided proper permission.
If using Ingrian v8.12.x ,then copy all the jars except
                                    gson-2.1.jar into this folder and make sure you have provided
                                    proper permission. 




Only if SSL is enabled on CipherTrust Manager:

echo "thales_machine_ip  nae.keysecure.local" >> /etc/hosts              
note Perform this step only if SSL is enabled on Cipher
                        Trust Manager. 


Setup Key HSM service.

keyhsm setup keysecure


-- Configuring keyHsm General Setup --
Cloudera Recommends to use 127.0.0.1 as the listener port for Key HSM 
Please enter Key HSM SSL listener IP address: [127.0.0.1] Hit Enter
Will attempt to setup listener on 127.0.0.1
Please enter Key HSM SSL listener PORT number: 9090

validate Port:                                    :[ Successful ]

-- Ingrian HSM Credential Configuration --
Please enter HSM login USERNAME: username
Please enter HSM login PASSWORD: password

Please enter HSM IP Address or Hostname: 18.218.251.172
Please enter HSM Port number: 9000
Valid address:                                    :[ Successful ]

Use SSL? [Y/n] Y (If TSL is enabled on NAE port then press Y else type n and hit enter and act accordingly)

org.bouncycastle.cert.X509CertificateHolder@f20f09ff
org.bouncycastle.cert.X509CertificateHolder@ebb30faf
Trust this server? [y/N] y

Trusted server:                                   :[ Successful ]                      


Validate Key HSM Service.

$ service keyhsm validate 


Start the Key HSM service.

$ service keyhsm start


Configure Key HSM to trust KTS.

noteMust be the full path to the file.


$ keyhsm trust /var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee/.ssl/ssl-cert-keytrustee.pem


Configure KTS to trust the Key HSM server.

$ ktadmin keyhsm --server http://127.0.0.1:9090 --trust 


Restart Key HSM.

$ service keyhsm restart 


Restart the KTS from Cloudera Manager UI.

Test the HSM.

curl -k https://$(hostname -f):11371/test_hsm                


Login to the Ranger UI using keyadmin user role for creating an encryption zone
                    key and do further validation.
Validating Keys in Cipher Trust HSM
In Thales Cipher Trust Manager > Left Navigation Panel, click Keys.

Keys created in the second to last step should be present, as shown in:

Figure 1. Validating Keys in CipherTrust Manager




Further keys for zone operation can be created using Ranger UI with keyadmin role credentials and also using hadoop commands.
