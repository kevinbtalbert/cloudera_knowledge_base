Set up GCP Cloud HSM for Ranger KMS, KTS, and KeyHSM
 How to integrate Ranger KMS and KTS with with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) HSM
        service. 

 This task describes how to set up the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) hardware security
                moudule (HSM) service provided by Google. The process inlcudes setting up the GCP
                HSM service on a client (host), setting up KeyHSM and using the GCP HSM to validate
                keys.

You must:
Log in to the Google cloud console using your accout. (Requires Google account
                    access).
Have Ranger Key Management System, Key Trustee Server and Key HSM installed in
                    your environment.
Have Java (jdk1.8.0.232) installed. 
See related topics for more information about installing Ranger KMS, KTS and
                KeyHSM.

Set Up Google Cloud HSM

Login to Google Cloud console using Cloudera account.

Create a generic service account by selecting or creating the Project.

Create the key for that generic service account you created in the previous
                    step.

Download and save your generic service account key in JSON format.

noteYou will use the generic service account key later in this process. Record
                        the project ID, Location ID and JSON file.


In GCP Console > Key Management create the key ring.

This example shows a project gcp-eng-sdx-daily,
                    service account keyhsm, and key ring

Integrate GCP with KeyHSMnotePerform the following
                    steps on both active and passive KTS nodes.
In  your Key HSM root directory, copy the autthentication key (json file) you
                    created in the setup process, and provided the appropriate access.

# rpm -ivh keytrustee-keyhsm-*.rpm


cd /usr/share/keytrustee-server-keyhsm/
chown keyhsm:keytrustee <key.filename>.json                


Set up the GCP HSM.

keyhsm setup googlecloudhsm               


keyhsm.management.address=127.0.0.1
keyhsm.server.port=9090
google.cloud.hsm.key.ring=KeyHSMRing 

# Google App Credential File
google.cloud.hsm.app.cred.file=<authentication file>.json 

# Google HSM Project Id
google.cloud.hsm.project.id=<project ID> 

# Google HSM Location Id
google.cloud.hsm.location.id=<location ID>
note Use the key ring, authentication file, project ID,
                        and location ID strings you created during setup.              


Validate the Key HSM service.

$ service keyhsm validate


Check Key HSM is stopped             :[Successful]
Configuration Available              :[Successful]
Port 127.0.0.1:9090 available        :[Successful]
Unlimited-Strength JCE               :[Successful]
Validate cipher list                 :[Successful]
HSM availability                     :[Successful]
All services available:              :[Successful]                         


Start the Key HSM service.

$ service keyhsm start 


Configure KTS to trust the Key HSM server.

$ ktadmin keyhsm --server http://$(hostname -f):<port configured in setup> --trust


$ktadmin keyhsm --server http://127.0.0.1:9090 --trust


Restart Key HSM.

$ service keyhsm restart 


Restart the KTS from Cloudera Manager UI.

Test the HSM.

curl -k https://$(hostname -f):11371/test_hsm                


Login to the Ranger UI using keyadmin user role for creating an encryption zone
                    key.


Keys will be created in the Key ring on GCP. 

Further keys for zone operation can be created using Ranger UI with keyadmin role credentials and also using hadoop commands.
