Set up Luna 7 HSM for Ranger KMS w/database
 How to integrate Cloudera Ranger Key Management System (KMS) software with the Luna
        7 HSM appliance supplied by SafeNet. 

This task describes how to set up the Luna 7 hardware security moudule (HSM) supplied
                by SafeNet. The process inlcudes setting up Luna 7 HSM on a client (host) and using
                Cloudera Manager to add configuration properties that enable Ranger KMS and Luna 7
                HSM to interact.

You must:
Acquire the Luna 7 HSM from SafeNet. 
Have both Ranger KMS and a backend database to store keys installed in your
                    environment.
See related topics for more information about installing Ranger KMS and a
                database to store keys.

Set Up the Luna 7 Client

Download Luna 7 client on the host where Ranger KMS service resides.

610-013144-006_SW_Client_SDK_SafeNet_HSM_7.3.0_Linux_RevA.tar

 

Untar the Luna 7 client.

tar -xf 610-013144-006_SW_Client_SDK_SafeNet_HSM_7.3.0_Linux_RevA.tar


the LunaClient_7.3.0-165_Linux/ folder gets created.

Navigate to the Luna client folder.

cd LunaClient_7.3.0-165_Linux/64/


In the Luna clent folder, install Luna products and components.

bash install.sh



At the (y/n) prompt, choose y.

If you select no or
                                        n, this product will not be
                                    installed.



At the Products prompt, choose Luna products to be installed:


[1]: Luna Network HSM
[2]: Luna PCIe HSM
[3]: Luna USB HSM
[4]: Luna Backup HSM
[N|n]: Next
[Q|q]: Quit


 Enter selection: 1, then enter
                                selection n.


At the Components prompt, choose Luna Components to be
                                installed


[1]: Luna SDK
[2]: Luna JSP (Java)
[3]: Luna JCProv (Java)
[B|b]: Back to Products selection
[I|i]: Install
[Q|q]: Quit


 Enter selection: i, then enter
                                selection Q.
 Enter selection:
                                    1,2,and
                                    3 then type
                                i.



Navigate to the Luna SA command directory.

cd /usr/safenet/lunaclient/bin


You should see the following:
                            ls ckdemo cmu common
                            configurator lunacm multitoken openssl.cnf plink pscp
salogin uninstall.sh vtl


Add a user to the hsmusers group.

sudo gpasswd --add kms hsmusers


Copy the Luna appliance server certificate to the client.

scp admin@<LunaBoxHostname>:server.pem


 scp e02paruser115@elab2.safenet-inc.com:server.pem . 
(grant permission chmod 777 and chown kms:kms)
