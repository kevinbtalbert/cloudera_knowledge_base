Using the Ranger Key Management Service
Ranger KMS can be accessed by logging into the Ranger web UI as the KMS administrator. 
Role Separation
Ranger uses separate admin users for Ranger and Ranger KMS. 


The Ranger admin user manages Ranger access policies.
The Ranger KMS admin user (keyadmin by default) manages access
                  policies and keys for Ranger KMS, and has access to a different set of UI features
                  than the Ranger admin user.  


Using separate administrator accounts for Ranger and Ranger KMS separates encryption
            work (encryption keys and policies) from cluster management and access policy
               management.note
For more information about creating, deleting, listing, and rolling over existing
                  keys using Ranger REST APIs, see https://ranger.apache.org/apidocs/resource_XKeyREST.html.
