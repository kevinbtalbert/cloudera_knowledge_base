Configuring TLS encryption manually for Apache Atlas
Configuring Apache Atlas Transport Layer Security (TLS) involves both one-way (server
    authentication) and two-way (server and client authentication).

Create a keystore file:


cd /usr/jdk64/jdk1.8.0_112/bin/
keytool -genkey -alias serverkey -keypass <keypass> -keyalg RSA 
-sigalg SHA1withRSA -keystore atlas.keystore -storepass <keypass> 
-validity 3650 -dname "CN=Nicola Marangoni, OU=PS, O=Hortonworks, 
L=Munich, ST=BY, C=DE"



Select Atlas > Configs > Advanced, and select
            Advanced application-properties and set the following
          properties:



Property
Value
Description



atlas.enableTLS
true
Enable or disable TLS listener. Set this value to true to enable TLS
                    (default value is false).




Add the following properties by selecting Custom application-properties >
              Add Property.


Property
Value
Description



keystore.file
/home/atlas/atlas.keystore
The path to the keystore file leveraged by the server. This file contains
                    the server certificate.


truststore.file
/home/atlas/atlas.keystore
The path to the truststore file. This file contains the certificates of
                    other trusted entities (for example, the certificates for client processes if
                    two-way TLS is enabled). In most instances this can be set to the same value as
                    the keystore.file property (especially if one-way TLS is enabled).


atlas.ssl.exclude.cipher.suites
.*NULL.*, .*RC4.*, .*MD5.*, .*DES.*, .*DSS.*
The excluded Cipher Suites list - .*NULL.*,.*RC4.*,.*MD5.*,.*DES.*,.*DSS.*
                    are weak and unsafe Cipher Suites that are excluded by default. If additional
                    Ciphers need to be excluded, set this property with the default Cipher Suites
                    such as .*NULL.*, .*RC4.*, .*MD5.*, .*DES.*, .*DSS.*, and add the additional
                    Cipher Suites to the list with a comma separator. They can be added with their
                    full name or a regular expression. The Cipher Suites listed in the
                    atlas.ssl.exclude.cipher.suites property take precedence over the default Cipher
                    Suites. You should retain the default Cipher Suites, and add additional ones to
                    increase security.


noteIf the user wants to add any Cipher Suites, they must manually add it through the
              Atlas Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
              conf/atlas-application.properties.
The default HTTP port is 31000 and the default HTTPS port is 31443. These values can be
            overridden using the atlas.server.http.port and
              atlas.server.https.port properties, respectively.


Select Actions > Restart on the Cloudera
            Manager instance to restart all services.

If you disable Atlas TLS, you must clear your browser cookies to log in to the Atlas UI
            using HTTP request headers.
