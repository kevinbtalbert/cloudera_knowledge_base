NiFi TLS/SSL properties
To enable and configure TLS manually for NiFi, edit the security properties according to
  the cluster configuration.
The following table lists the TLS/SSL security properties for NiFi: 


Property
Description



NiFi Node TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore File
         Locationnifi.security.keystore
The path to the TLS/SSL keystore file containing the server certificate and private key
       used for TLS/SSL. Used when NiFi Node is acting as a TLS/SSL server. The keystore must be in
       JKS format.


NiFi Node TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore File
         Passwordnifi.security.keystorePasswd
The password for the NiFi Node JKS keystore file.


NiFi Node TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore Key
         Passwordnifi.security.keyPasswd
The password that protects the private key contained in the JKS keystore used when NiFi
       Node is acting as a TLS/SSL server.


NiFi Node TLS/SSL Client Trust Store
         Filenifi.security.truststore
The location on disk of the trust store, in .jks format, used to confirm the
       authenticity of TLS/SSL servers that NiFi Node might connect to. This is used when NiFi Node
       is the client in a TLS/SSL connection. This trust store must contain the certificate(s) used
       to sign the service(s) connected to. If this parameter is not provided, the default list of
       well-known certificate authorities is used instead.


NiFi Node TLS/SSL Client Trust Store
         Passwordnifi.security.truststorePasswd
The password for the NiFi Node TLS/SSL Certificate Trust Store File. This
       password is not required to access the trust store; this field can be left blank. This
       password provides optional integrity checking of the file. The contents of trust stores are
       certificates, and certificates are public information.
