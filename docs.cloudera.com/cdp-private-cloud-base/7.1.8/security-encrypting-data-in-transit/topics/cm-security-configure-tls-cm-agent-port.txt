Manually Configuring TLS Encryption on the Agent Listening
    Port
The agent listening port (TCP Port 9000) of a Cloudera Manager Agent can be secured
        with TLS. This port is used for retrieving diagnostic and log information. 

The requirements for a Cloudera Manager Agent to enable the agent listening port are
                as follows:
The following properties must be defined in the config.ini
                        file of the Cloudera Manager Agent: use_tls=1,
                            verify_cert_file, client_cert_file,
                        client_keypw_file. 
An encryption key must be configured.
A certificate must be configured.

The main requirement for the Cloudera Manager Server to connect with TLS to the agent
                listening port is as follows: 


The Cloudera Manager TLS/SSL Client Trust Store File property must be
                    configured to specify the CA certificate using which all the agent certificates
                    are signed. 


noteIf either the Cloudera Manager Agent or the Cloudera Manager Server is
                            not configured properly, the various diagnostic capture features in
                            Cloudera Manager could fail.

To verify whether the agent listening port is secured with TLS, run the
                        following command:
                        openssl s_client -connect <hostname>:9000If the
                        output of this command includes a server certificate in PEM format, then the
                        port is secured with TLS.
