Configuring TLS/SSL encryption manually for CDP Services
To configure TLS/SSL encryption manually for CDP Services.
Configuring TLS encryption manually for Apache AtlasConfiguring Apache Atlas Transport Layer Security (TLS) involves both one-way (server     authentication) and two-way (server and client authentication).Enable security for Cruise ControlWhen AutoTLS is disabled, you need to configure the security properties in Cloudera     Manager to use Cruise Control in a secure environment. You can also choose between SPENGO and     Trusted Proxy as an authentication method, and can assign admin, user and viewer roles to users     to achieve further authorization over Cruise Control tasks.Configuring TLS/SSL encryption manually for DAS using Cloudera ManagerTo secure the transfer of sensitive information between Data Analytics Studio (DAS)         and Cloudera Manager as well as with other services within your cluster, you must enable         TLS/SSL for both Event Processor and WebApp. You can configure TLS manually using Cloudera         Manager or have it set up automatically using the “Auto-TLS” feature.Enabling security for Apache FlinkSince Flink is essentially just a YARN application, you mainly need to configure service   level security settings for the Flink Dashboard and Gateway in Cloudera Manager. You can configure   security during the installation or later in the Configuration menu for Flink.Configuring TLS/SSL for HBase Once all the prerequisites are fulfilled, you can configure TLS/SSL for HBase Web UIs,   HBase REST Server and HBase Thrift Server.Enabling TLS/SSL for HiveServerYou can secure client-server communications using symmetric-key encryption in the         TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocol. To encrypt data exchanged         between HiveServer and its clients, you can use Cloudera Manager to configure         TLS/SSL.Configuring TLS/SSL for HueYou can independently enable TLS/SSL for Hue.Configuring Impala TLS/SSLTo protect sensitive information being transmitted, Impala supports     TLS/SSL network encryption, between Impala and client programs, and between     the Impala-related daemons running on different nodes in the     cluster.Channel encryptionKafka supports client to broker and inter-broker TLS/SSL encrypted communications.     Configuring TLS/SSL encryption for a Kafka deployment involves configuring both clients and     brokers. In addition to this, Kafka also supports TLS/SSL communication with     Zookeeper.Configuring TLS/SSL encryption manually for Key Trustee ServerIf you do not want to enable Auto-TLS because for example, you need to use your own         enterprise-generated certificates, you can manually enable TLS for Key Trustee Server. Configuring TLS/SSL encryption manually for Apache KnoxIf you do not want to enable Auto-TLS because, for example, you need to use your own         enterprise-generated certificates, you can manually enable TLS for Apache Knox.Configuring TLS/SSL encryption for Kudu using Cloudera ManagerTLS/SSL encryption is enabled between Kudu servers and clients by default. You can         enable TLS/SSL encryption for Kudu web UIs or configure the encryption using Cloudera         Manager.Configure Lily HBase Indexer to use TLS/SSLAlthough Cloudera recommends using AutoTLS, you also have the option to set up TLS         manually for the Lily HBase Indexer.Configuring TLS/SSL encryption manually for LivyYou can enable TLS manually for the Apache Livy Server.Configuring TLS/SSL manuallyIf you use your own enterprise-generated certificates, you would need to manually     configure TLS.Configure TLS/SSL for OozieYou can edit properties to enable TLS/SSL for Oozie, specify the keystore file location     on the local file system, and set the password for the keystore.Configure TLS encryption manually for Phoenix Query ServerYou can encrypt communication between clients and the Phoenix Query Server using         Transport Layer Security (TLS) formerly known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL). You must follow         these steps to manually configure TLS for Phoenix Query Server.Configure TLS/SSL encryption manually for Apache RangerHow to manually configure TLS/SSL encryption for Apache RangerConfigure TLS/SSL encryption manually for Ranger KMSHow to  manually configure TLS/SSL encryption for Ranger KMSConfigure TLS/SSL encryption manually for Ranger RMSHow to  manually configure TLS/SSL encryption for Ranger RMSConfiguring TLS encryption manually for Schema RegistryIf you do not want to enable Auto-TLS, because, for example, you need to use your own         enterprise-generated certificates, you can manually enable TLS for Schema         Registry.Configure TLS/SSL encryption for SolrAlthough Cloudera recommends using AutoTLS, you also have the option to set up TLS   manually for Cloudera Search.Configuring TLS/SSL encryption manually for SparkYou can enable TLS manually for the Spark History Server.Encryption in SSBWhen auto-TLS is disabled for the SQL Stream Builder (SSB) service, you must manually   set the TLS properties for SSB in Cloudera Manager.Enabling TLS/SSL for the SRM serviceTLS/SSL can be enabled and configured for the Streams Replication Manager (SRM)     service (Driver and Service roles) with various configuration properties available in Cloudera     Manager. Configuring these properties affects the security configuration of SRM in multiple     ways.Enabling TLS Encryption for SMM on CDP Private CloudLearn how to enable TLS/SSL encryption for Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) on CDP         Private Cloud to secure the communication of sensitive information. You can enable the         settings in Cloudera Manager according to the cluster configuration.Configuring TLS/SSL for Core Hadoop ServicesTLS/SSL for the core Hadoop services (HDFS and YARN) must be enabled as a   group.Configuring TLS/SSL encryption manually for ZeppelinYou can enable TLS manually for the Apache Zeppelin Server.Configure ZooKeeper TLS/SSL using Cloudera ManagerTLS/SSL encryption between the ZooKeeper client and the ZooKeeper server and within         the ZooKeeper Quorum is supported.
