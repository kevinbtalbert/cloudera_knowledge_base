Manually Configuring TLS Encryption for Cloudera Manager
How to manually enable TLS encryption and certificate authentication for Cloudera
    Manager.

When you configure authentication and authorization on a cluster, Cloudera Manager Server
        sends sensitive information over the network to cluster hosts, such as Kerberos keytabs and
        configuration files that contain passwords. To secure this transfer, you must configure TLS
        encryption between Cloudera Manager Server and all cluster hosts.
TLS encryption is also used to secure client connections to the Cloudera Manager Admin
        Interface, using HTTPS.
Cloudera Manager also supports TLS authentication. Without certificate authentication, a
        malicious user can add a host to Cloudera Manager by installing the Cloudera Manager Agent
        software and configuring it to communicate with Cloudera Manager Server. To prevent this,
        you must install certificates on each agent host and configure Cloudera Manager Server to
        trust those certificates.
This guide shows how to configure and enable TLS encryption and certificate authentication
        for Cloudera Manager. The provided examples use an internal certificate authority (CA) to
        sign all TLS certificates, so this guide also shows you how to establish trust with the CA.
        (For certificates signed by a trusted public CA, establishing trust is not necessary,
        because the Java Development Kit (JDK) already trusts them.)

noteCloudera recommends using auto-TLS to configure TLS encryption for Cloudera
          Manager and CDP components.Auto-TLS greatly simplifies the process of enabling and
            managing TLS encryption on your cluster. It automates the creation of an internal
            certificate authority (CA) and deployment of certificates across all cluster hosts. It
            can also automate the distribution of existing certificates, such as those signed by a
            public CA. Adding new cluster hosts or services to a cluster with auto-TLS enabled
            creates and deploys the required certificates automatically.For instructions on
            enabling auto-TLS, see Configuring TLS Encryption for Cloudera Manager Using Auto-TLS
            .

Generate TLS Certificates


The following procedure assumes that an internal certificate authority (CA) is used, and
          shows how to establish trust for that internal CA. If you are using a trusted public CA
          (such as Symantec, GeoTrust, Comodo, and others), you do not need to explicitly establish
          trust for the issued certificates, unless you are using an older JDK and a newer public
          CA. Older JDKs might not trust newer public CAs by default.



On Each Cluster Host:


Complete the following steps on each cluster host, including the Cloudera Manager
            Server host.


Configure your environment to set JAVA_HOME to the Oracle JDK. For
              example:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_141-clouderaIf
              you log out of the host before completing this procedure, make sure to set
                JAVA_HOME again when you log in to complete the steps.

Create the /opt/cloudera/security/pki directory:
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cloudera/security/pkiIf
              you choose to use a different directory, make sure you use the same directory on all
              cluster hosts to simplify management and maintenance.

Use the keytool utility to generate a Java keystore and
              certificate signing request (CSR). Replace the OU,
              O, L, ST, and C
              entries with the values for your environment. When prompted, use the same password for
              the keystore password and key password. Cloudera
              Manager does not support using different passwords for the key and keystore.

$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -genkeypair -alias $(hostname -f) -keyalg RSA -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f).jks -keysize 2048 -dname "CN=$(hostname -f),OU=Engineering,O=Cloudera,L=Palo Alto,ST=California,C=US" -ext san=dns:$(hostname -f)
$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -certreq -alias $(hostname -f) -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f).jks -file /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f).csr -ext san=dns:$(hostname -f) -ext EKU=serverAuth,clientAuth
noteYou must ensure that your Issuing Authority will issue the certificates with the
                extensions CDP requires.


Submit the CSR files (for example, cm01.example.com.csr) to your
              certificate authority to obtain a server certificate. 
For security purposes, many commercial CAs ignore requested extensions in a
                CSR. Make sure that you inform the CA that you require certificates with both server
                and client authentication options.If possible, obtain the certificate in PEM
              (Base64 ASCII) format. The certificate file is in PEM format if it looks similar to
              this (some lines
                omitted):-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDAzCCAesCAQAwgY0xCzAJBgNVBAYTAlVTMRMwEQYDVQQIEwpDYWxpZm9ybmlh

UnDPtrhW6A==
-----END CERTIFICATE-----If
                your issued certificate is in binary (DER) format, convert it to PEM
              format.

After you have received the signed certificate, copy the signed certificate to the
              following location:

/opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f).pem


Inspect the signed certificate to verify that both server and client authentication
              options are present, as well as the subject alternative name:

openssl x509 -in /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f).pem -noout -text
Look for output similar to the following to verify the server and client
                authentication options:
            X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
                TLS Web Server Authentication, TLS Web Client Authentication
Look for output similar to the following to validate the subject alternative
                name:
            X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
                DNS:hostname.example.com
important
If the certificate does not have the DNS field, re-submit the CSR to the CA, and
                  request that they generate a certificate that keeps the Subject Alternative Name
                  field intact.
If the certificate does not have both TLS Web Server
                    Authentication and TLS Web Client Authentication
                  listed in the X509v3 Extended Key Usage section, re-submit the
                  CSR to the CA, and request that they generate a certificate that can be used for
                  both server and client authentication.



Copy the root and intermediate CA certificates to
                /opt/cloudera/security/pki/rootca.pem and
                /opt/cloudera/security/pki/intca.pem on each host. If you have a
              concatenated file containing the root CA and an intermediate CA certificate, split the
              file along the END CERTIFICATE/BEGIN CERTIFICATE
              boundary into individual files. If there are multiple intermediate CA certificates,
              use unique file names such as intca-1.pem,
                intca-2.pem, and so on.

Copy the JDK cacerts file to jssecacerts as
              follows:

sudo cp $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts
noteThe default password for the cacerts file is
                  changeit. The same applies to the jssecacerts
                file if you copied it from the cacerts before changing the
                password. Cloudera recommends changing these passwords by running the following
                commands:
                $JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -storepasswd -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -storepasswd -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts
The Oracle JDK uses the jssecacerts file for its default
                truststore if it exists. Otherwise, it uses the cacerts file.
                Creating the jssecacerts file allows you to trust an internal CA
                without modifying the cacerts file that is included with the
                JDK.
noteIf you upgrade your JDK, make sure to copy your existing
                  jssecacerts file to the new JDK (under
                  $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security).


Import the root CA certificate into the JDK truststore. 

sudo $JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -importcert -alias rootca -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts -file /opt/cloudera/security/pki/rootca.pem
If you see a message like the following, enter yes to
                continue:
Trust this certificate? [no]: yes
You must see the following response verifying that the certificate has been
                properly
                imported:Certificate was added to keystore


Perform these steps to replace the self-signed cert with CA issued cert. 
cd /opt/cloudera/security/pki/; mv $(hostname -f).jks $(hostname -f)-orig.jks
keytool -importkeystore -srcstoretype JKS -deststoretype PKCS12 -srckeystore $(hostname -f)-orig.jks -srcalias $(hostname -f) -destkeystore $(hostname -f).p12 
openssl pkcs12 -in $(hostname -f).p12 -nodes -nocerts -out $(hostname -f)-pk.pem
openssl pkcs12 -export -in $(hostname -f).pem -inkey $(hostname -f)-pk.pem -name $(hostname -f) -out $(hostname -f).pk12
keytool -importkeystore -deststoretype JKS -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srckeystore  $(hostname -f).pk12 -destkeystore $(hostname -f).jks

Append the intermediate CA certificate to the signed host certificate, and then
              import it into the keystore. Make sure that you use the append operator
                (>>) and not the overwrite operator (>):

sudo cat /opt/cloudera/security/pki/intca.pem >> /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f).pem


Create symbolic links (symlink) for the certificate and keystore files:

sudo ln -s /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f).pem /opt/cloudera/security/pki/agent.pem
This allows you to use the same /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini
                file on all agent hosts rather than maintaining a file for each agent.





On the Cloudera Manager Server Host


On the Cloudera Manager Server host, create an additional symlink for the keystore
            file:sudo ln -s /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f).jks /opt/cloudera/security/pki/server.jks





Configure TLS for the Cloudera Manager Admin Console


Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
Use the following procedure to enable TLS encryption for the
          Cloudera Manager Server admin interface. Make sure you have generated the host certificate
          as described in Manually Configuring TLS Encryption for Cloudera Manager>On Each
            Cluster Host.



Step 1: Enable HTTPS for the Cloudera Manager Admin Console


Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.

Select Administration > Settings.

Select the Security category.

Configure the following TLS settings:



Property

Use TLS Encryption for Admin Console
Check this box to enable TLS encryption for Cloudera Manager.




Enter a Reason for Change, then click Save
                Changes to save the settings.




Step 2: Specify SSL Truststore Properties for Cloudera Management Services


When enabling TLS for the Cloudera Manager Server admin interface, you must set the
            Java truststore location and password in the Cloudera Management Services configuration.
            Otherwise, roles such as Host Monitor and Service Monitor cannot connect to Cloudera
            Manager Server and will not start.
Configure the path and password for the
              $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts truststore that you created
            earlier. Make sure that you have created this file on all hosts, including the Cloudera
            Management Service hosts, as instructed in Manually Configuring TLS Encryption for
              Cloudera Manager>On Each Cluster Host.


Open the Cloudera Manager Administration Console and go to the Cloudera
                Management Service service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select Scope > Cloudera Management Service (Service-Wide).

Select Category > Security.

Edit the following TLS/SSL properties according to your cluster
              configuration.



Property
Description

                        to:<JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/security/jssecacertsReplace
                            <JAVA_HOME> with the path to the
                        Oracle JDK.

                        Password
The password for the truststore file.




Enter a Reason for Change, then click Save
                Changes to save the settings.




Step 3: Restart Cloudera Manager and Services


You must restart both Cloudera Manager Server and the Cloudera Management Service for
            TLS encryption to work. Otherwise, the Cloudera Management Services (such as Host
            Monitor and Service Monitor) cannot communicate with Cloudera Manager Server.


Restart the Cloudera Manager Server by running the following command on the
              Cloudera Manager Server host:


RHEL 7
                  compatible:sudo systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server
RHEL 6 compatible, SLES, Ubuntu:

sudo service cloudera-scm-server restart




After the restart completes, connect to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console using
              the HTTPS URL (for example:
                https://cm01.example.com:7183). If you used an
              internal CA-signed certificate, you must configure your browser to trust the
              certificate. Otherwise, you will see a warning in your browser any time you access the
              Cloudera Manager Administration Console. By default, certificates issued by public
              commercial CAs are trusted by most browsers, and no additional configuration is
              necessary if your certificate is signed by one of them.

Restart the Cloudera Management Service (Cloudera Management Service > Actions > Restart).





Configure TLS for Cloudera Manager Agents


Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
Use the following procedure to encrypt the communication between
          Cloudera Manager Server and Cloudera Manager Agents:



Step 1: Enable TLS Encryption for Agents in Cloudera Manager


Configure the TLS properties for Cloudera Manager Agents.


Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.

Select Administration > Settings.

Select the Security category.

Select the Use TLS Encryption for Agents option.

Enter a Reason for Change, then click Save
                Changes to save the settings.




Step 2: Enable TLS on Cloudera Manager Agent Hosts


To enable TLS between the Cloudera Manager agents and Cloudera Manager, you must
            specify values for the TLS properties in the
              /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini configuration file on all agent
            hosts.


On each agent host (including the Cloudera Manager Server host, which also has an
              agent), open the /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini configuration
              file and set the use_tls parameter in the [Security]
              section as follows:

use_tls=1
Alternatively, you can edit the config.ini file on one host, and
                then copy it to the other hosts because this file by default does not contain
                host-specific information. If you have modified properties such as
                  listening_hostname or listening_ip address in
                  config.ini, you must edit the file individually on each host.





Step 3: Restart Cloudera Manager Server and Agents


Restart the Cloudera Manager Server by running the following command on the
              Cloudera Manager Server host:


RHEL 7
                  compatible:sudo systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server
RHEL 6 compatible, SLES, Ubuntu:

sudo service cloudera-scm-server restart




On each agent host (including the Cloudera Manager Server host), restart the
              Cloudera Manager agent service:


RHEL 7
                  compatible:sudo systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent
RHEL 6 compatible, SLES, Ubuntu:

sudo service cloudera-scm-agent restart







Step 4: Verify that the Cloudera Manager Server and Agents are Communicating


In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to Hosts > All Hosts. If you see successful heartbeats reported in the Last
              Heartbeat column after restarting the agents, TLS encryption is working
            properly.





Enable Server Certificate Verification on Cloudera Manager Agents


Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
If you have completed the previous sections, communication between Cloudera Manager
          server and the agents is encrypted, but the certificate authenticity is not verified. For
          full security, you must configure the agents to verify the Cloudera Manager server
          certificate. If you are using a server certificate signed by an internal certificate
          authority (CA), you must configure the agents to trust that CA:


On each agent host (including the Cloudera Manager Server host), open the
              /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini configuration file, and then
            uncomment and set the following property:

verify_cert_file=/opt/cloudera/security/pki/rootca.pem
Alternatively, you can edit the config.ini file on one host, and
              then copy it to the other hosts because this file by default does not contain
              host-specific information. If you have modified properties such as
                listening_hostname or listening_ip address in
                config.ini, you must edit the file individually on each host.


Restart the Cloudera Manager agents. On each agent host (including the Cloudera
            Manager Server host), run the following command:


RHEL 7
                compatible:sudo systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent
RHEL 6 compatible, SLES, Ubuntu:

sudo service cloudera-scm-agent restart




Verify that the Cloudera Manager server and agents are communicating. In the Cloudera
            Manager Admin Console, go to Hosts > All Hosts. If you see successful heartbeats reported in the Last
              Heartbeat column after restarting the agents and management service, TLS
            verification is working properly. If not, check the agent log
              (/var/log/cloudera-scm-agent/cloudera-scm-agent.log) for
            errors.




Configure Agent Certificate Authentication


importantPerform this procedure on each agent host, including the Cloudera
            Manager Server host, which also has an agent.Without certificate authentication,
          a malicious user can add a host to Cloudera Manager by installing the Cloudera Manager
          agent software and configuring it to communicate with Cloudera Manager Server. To prevent
          this, you must configure Cloudera Manager to trust the agent certificates.



Step 1: Export the Private Key to a File


On each Cloudera Manager Agent host, use the keytool utility to export
            the private key and certificate to a PKCS12 file, which can then be
            split up into individual key and certificate files using the openssl
            command:


Export the private key and certificate:

sudo $JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f).jks -destkeystore /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f)-key.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12 -srcalias $(hostname -f)


Use the openssl command to export the private key into its own
              file:

sudo openssl pkcs12 -in /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f)-key.p12 -nocerts -out /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f).key


Create a symbolic link for the .key file:

sudo ln -s /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f).key /opt/cloudera/security/pki/agent.key
This allows you to use the same /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini
                file on all agent hosts rather than maintaining a file for each agent.





Step 2: Create a Password File


The Cloudera Manager agent obtains the password from a text file, not from a command
            line parameter or environment variable. The password file allows you to use file
            permissions to protect the password. For example, run the following commands on each
            Cloudera Manager Agent host, or run them on one host and copy the file to the other
            hosts:
Create and secure the file containing the password used to protect the private key of
            the Agent:


Use a text editor to create a file called
                /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/agentkey.pw that contains the
              password.

Change ownership of the file to root:

sudo chown root:root /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/agentkey.pw


Change the permissions of the file:

sudo chmod 440 /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/agentkey.pw





Step 3: Configure the Agent to Use Private Keys and Certificates


On a Cloudera Manager Agent, open the
              /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini configuration file, uncomment and
            edit the following properties:

Property
Example Value
Description



client_key_file
/opt/cloudera/security/pki/agent.key
Path to the private key file.


client_keypw_file
/etc/cloudera-scm-agent/agentkey.pw
Path to the private key password file.


client_cert_file
/opt/cloudera/security/pki/agent.pem
Path to the client certificate file.


Copy the file to all other cluster hosts. If you have modified properties such as
              listening_hostname or listening_ip address in
              config.ini, you must edit the file individually on each host.




Step 4: Enable Agent Certificate Authentication


Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.

Select Administration > Settings.

Click the Security category.

Configure the following TLS settings:



Setting
Description



Use TLS Authentication of Agents to
                        Server
Select this option to enable TLS authentication of agents to the
                        server.

Specify the full filesystem path to the jssecacerts
                        file located on the Cloudera Manager Server host. For this example, set the
                        value
                        to:<JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/security/jssecacertsReplace
                            <JAVA_HOME> with the path to the

Step 5: Restart Cloudera Manager Server and Agents


On the Cloudera Manager server host, restart the Cloudera Manager server:


RHEL 7
                  compatible:sudo systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server
RHEL 6 compatible, SLES, Ubuntu:

sudo service cloudera-scm-server restart




On every agent host, restart the Cloudera Manager agent:


RHEL 7
                  compatible:sudo systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent
RHEL 6 compatible, SLES, Ubuntu:

sudo service cloudera-scm-agent restart







Step 6: Verify that Cloudera Manager Server and Agents are Communicating


In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to Hosts > All Hosts. If you see successful heartbeats reported in the Last
              Heartbeat column after restarting the agents and server, TLS certificate
            authentication is working properly. If not, check the agent log
              (/var/log/cloudera-scm-agent/cloudera-scm-agent.log) for errors.
For example, you might see the following error:
WrongHost: Peer certificate commonName does not match host, expected 192.0.2.155, got cdh-1.example.com
[02/May/2018 15:04:15 +0000] 4655 MainThread agent        ERROR    Heartbeating to 192.0.2.155:7182 failed
For this scenario, make sure that your DNS and /etc/hosts file are
            configured correctly, and that your server_host parameter in
              /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini uses the Cloudera Manager Server
            hostname, and not IP address.
