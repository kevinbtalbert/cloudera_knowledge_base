Configuring TLS/SSL encryption manually for Key Trustee Server
If you do not want to enable Auto-TLS because for example, you need to use your own
        enterprise-generated certificates, you can manually enable TLS for Key Trustee Server. 

When KTS HA is used, the properties that are available for the Active KTS are also
                available for the Passive KTS.



Review certificate requirements. See TLS/SSL certificate requirements and
                        recommendations for more information.
Review Understanding Keystores and Truststores.
Create certificates and configure Cloudera Manager properties. See
                        Manually Configuring TLS Encryption for Cloudera Manager for
                    more information.



From the Cloudera Manager site, go to
                        Clusters > Key Trustee Server.

Click the Configuration tab.

Enter tls in the search field. The security properties
                    appear.

Edit the security properties according to the cluster configuration. For a list
                    of security properties, see the Security section in Key Trustee Server
                        Properties in Cloudera Runtime.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Key Trustee Server service.
