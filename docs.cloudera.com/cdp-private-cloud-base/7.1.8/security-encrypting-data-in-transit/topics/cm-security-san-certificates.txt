SAN Certificates

A SubjectAlternativeName (SAN) certificate is a certificate that uses the
      SubjectAlternativeName extension to associate the resulting certificate with multiple specific
      host names. SAN certificates are supported while using Auto-TLS only if custom certificates
      are generated. SAN certificates are not supported with the internal Cloudera Manager
      Certificate Authority.
