Choosing manual TLS or Auto-TLS
An explanation of the difference between manual TLS and Auto-TLS in Cloudera
  Manager.
Wire encryption protects data in motion, and Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the most widely
   used security protocol for wire encryption. TLS provides authentication, privacy and data
   integrity between applications communicating over a network by encrypting the packets transmitted
   between endpoints. Users interact with Hadoop clusters via browser or command line tools, while
   applications use REST APIs or Thrift.
Overview of enabling TLS manually
The typical process to enable wire encryption on Cloudera Data Platform Private Cloud clusters
    is described below.
Get Certificates 
Generate a public/private keypair on each host
Generate the Certificate signing request (CSR) for all the hosts.
Get the CSR signed by the company’s internal Certificate Authority (CA).
Generate keystore & truststore and deploy them across all the cluster hosts.

Cluster configuration 
For each service, enable TLS by setting the keystore and truststore configuration. 
Restart the affected components before proceeding to enable TLS for the next service.
Make the required changes outside of the cluster manager’s UI (like setting up truststore,
      Enabling Knox SSL, etc.)

Ongoing Maintenance 
For new service installation, the keystore and truststore information need to be configured
      for the service. Restart the impacted services.
For each new host to be added to the cluster, admins would have to perform the steps from
      the “Get Certificates” section (only for the new hosts).
The certificates are rotated before they expire.


Auto-TLS feature in Cloudera Manager
The process described above can be a significant effort in large deployments, often leading to
    long deployment times and operational difficulties. The Auto-TLS feature automates all the steps
    required to enable TLS encryption at a cluster level. Using Auto-TLS, you can let Cloudera
    manage the Certificate Authority (CA) for all the certificates in the cluster or use the
    company’s existing CA. In most cases, all the necessary steps can be enabled easily via the
    Cloudera Manager UI. This feature automates the following processes –
When Cloudera Manager is used as a Certificate Authority:
Creates the root Certificate Authority or a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for creating
      an intermediate Certificate Authority to be signed by company’s existing Certificate Authority
      (CA)
Generates the CSRs for hosts and signs them automatically

The following steps are always performed
Creates a keystore and truststore for hosts.
Deploys the certificates, keystore and truststore to all the hosts in the cluster. 
All the cluster services are then automatically TLS enabled by configuring the keystore and
      truststore information from a role instance specific directory. 
Enables TLS for Cloudera Manager server and agents. 
After this initial setup, any new service, hosts (or) additional compute clusters setup are
      automatically TLS enabled by default.
Provides an automation framework for rotating certificates.

Let us review these options with examples below on a CDP DC 7.1 cluster:
Use case 1: Using Cloudera Manager to generate an internal CA and corresponding
      certificates
Use case 2: Enabling Auto-TLS with an existing Root CA
Use case 3: Enabling Auto-TLS with existing Certificates


New Cluster deployment 
With either of these options, you can reuse the existing TLS settings when creating a new
    cluster on a Cloudera Manager with Auto-TLS enabled. When you launch the wizard to create a new
    cluster you should see the following message. Now, when you deploy the cluster, all services
    will be automatically configured with wire encryption.



Summary
The Auto-TLS functionality not only speeds up the initial setup of the wire encryption but
    also automates future TLS configuration steps for the cluster. The following table summarizes
    the differences between the options described in this blog.

The Auto-TLS feature significantly reduces the overhead of TLS management of your
    cluster, thus providing increased security with reduced operational overhead and helps you stay
    focused on your customers and their workloads.
