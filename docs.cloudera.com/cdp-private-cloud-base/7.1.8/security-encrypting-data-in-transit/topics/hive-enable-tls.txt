Enabling TLS/SSL for HiveServer
You can secure client-server communications using symmetric-key encryption in the
        TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocol. To encrypt data exchanged
        between HiveServer and its clients, you can use Cloudera Manager to configure
        TLS/SSL.


 HiveServer has the necessary server key, certificate, keystore, and
                        trust store set up on the host system. 
The hostname variable ($(hostname -f)-server.jks) is used
                    with Java keytool commands to create keystore, as shown in this
                    example:$ sudo keytool -genkeypair -alias $(hostname -f)-server -keyalg RSA -keystore \
    /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f)-server.jks -keysize 2048 -dname \
    "CN=$(hostname -f),OU=dept-name-optional,O=company-name,L=city,ST=state,C=two-digit-nation" \
    -storepass password -keypass password


 On the beeline command line, the JDBC URL requirements include specifying
                ssl=true;sslTrustStore=<path_to_truststore>. Truststore password
            requirements depend on the version of Java running in the cluster: 
Java 11: the truststore format has changed to PKCS and the truststore password
                    is required; otherwise, the connection fails.
Java 8: The trust store password does not need to be specified.   


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Clusters > Hive > Configuration.

In Filters, select HIVE for the scope.

Select Security for the category. 

Accept the default Enable TLS/SSL for HiveServer2, which
                    is checked for Hive (Service-Wide).

Enter the path to the Java keystore on the host system.
/opt/cloudera/security/pki/keystore_name.jks

Enter the password for the keystore you used on the Java keytool command-line
                    when the key and keystore were created.
The password for the keystore must match the password for the key.

Enter the path to the Java trust store on the host system. 

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hive service. 

Construct a connection string for encrypting communications using TLS/SSL.
jdbc:hive2://#<host>:#<port>/#<dbName>;ssl=true;sslTrustStore=#<ssl_truststore_path>; \
trustStorePassword=#<truststore_password>;#<otherSessionConfs>?#<hiveConfs>#<hiveVars>
