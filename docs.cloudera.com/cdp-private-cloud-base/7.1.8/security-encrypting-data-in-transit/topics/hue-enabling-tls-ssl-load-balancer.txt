Enabling TLS/SSL for Hue Load Balancer
To configure the Hue Load Balancer to use HTTPS or operate as a TLS/SSL server, you
        need a self-signed SSL certificate and a private key file. If the private key file is
        password protected, then you must configure the Hue Load Balancer to use the corresponding
        key password.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Scope > Load Balancer.

Enter the location of the file that contains the server certificate key for
                    TLS/SSL on the host running Hue Load Balancer in the Hue Load
                        Balancer TLS/SSL Server Certificate File (PEM Format)
                    field.
The certificate file must be in the Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) format.

Enter the location of the TLS/SSL file that contains the private key used for
                    TLS/SSL on the host running Hue Load Balancer, in the Hue Load
                        Balancer TLS/SSL Server Private Key File (PEM Format)
                    field.
The certificate file must be in PEM format.

(Optional) If the private key file is password protected perform the following
                    steps:


Create a password file in your chosen security directory and insert the
                            private key password as shown in the following example:

echo "abc123" > /etc/security/password.txt

Where abc123 is the private key password and
                                password.txt is the password file.


Set the file ownership and permissions as shown in the following
                            example:

chown hue:hue password.txt
chmod 700 password.txt



Enter the path to the file containing the passphrase used to encrypt
                            the private key of the Hue Load Balancer server in the Hue
                                Load Balancer TLS/SSL Server SSLPassPhraseDialog
                            field.



Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
