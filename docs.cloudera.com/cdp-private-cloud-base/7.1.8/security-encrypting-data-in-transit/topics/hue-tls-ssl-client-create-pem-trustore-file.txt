Creating a truststore file in PEM format
Server certificates are stored in Java KeyStore (JKS) format and must be converted to
    Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format. You must create a PEM file before configuring Hue as a
    TLS/SSL client or a TLS/SSL server.

To create the Hue truststore, extract each certificate from its keystore with the Java
          keytool, convert the certificate to PEM format with the OpenSSL.org
          openssl tool, and then add it to the Hue truststore:


Extract the certificate from the keystore of each TLS/SSL-enabled server with
                  which Hue communicates. For example, if you have
                  hadoop-server.keystore that contains a server certificate,
                  foo-1.example.com with a password of
                  example123, you would use the following keytool
                  command:

keytool -exportcert -keystore hadoop-server.keystore -alias foo-1.example.com -storepass example123 -file foo-1.cert


Convert each certificate into a PEM file. Here is what the openssl
              tool command looks like for the foo-1.cert file that was extracted in
              Step 1:

openssl x509 -inform der -in foo-1.cert > foo-1.pem


Concatenate all the PEM certificates you extracted and converted from the server
          truststore into one PEM file:

cat foo-1.pem foo-2.pem foo-n.pem ... > hue_truststore.pem

Concatenate the certificate files in the following order: SSL certificate followed by
          intermediate certificate, followed by the root CA certificate.

importantEnsure the final PEM truststore is deployed in a location that is
            accessible by the Hue service.
