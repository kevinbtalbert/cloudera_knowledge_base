Configuring Hue as a TLS/SSL server
Hue and other Python-based services expect certificates and keys to be stored in PEM
    (Privacy Enhanced Mail) format.
Before you enable TLS/SSL for the Hue server, you must generate a private key and certificate
    by using the openssl command-line tool and reuse a host's existing Java
    keystore by converting it to the PEM format.
