Configuring multiple listeners
Kafka brokers can simultaneously listen to connection requests on multiple ports with
    various protocols. By default Cloudera Manager automatically configures the ports and the
    protocols used by the brokers to listen to requests. However, manual configuration is possible
    and may be required in an advanced deployment. 

Kafka Brokers support listening for connections on multiple ports with different protocols.
        For example, a broker is capable of listening on port 9092 for PLAINTEXT requests and 9093
        using TLS/SSL simultaneously. Which ports a broker listens to is controlled by the
          listeners Kafka broker property. 
In Cloudera Manager, the listeners property is not available directly for
        configuration. Instead, it is set by Cloudera Manager automatically based on how other
        security properties are configured. 
For example, if TLS/SSL is enabled, Enable TLS/SSL for Kafka Broker 
        is set to true, Cloudera Manager automatically configures the Kafka broker to listen to
        TLS/SSL requests on port 9093. That is, the listeners property is set to
            SSL://[***KAFKA BROKER FQDN***]:9093.
It is usually sufficient to rely on Cloudera Manager to automatically configure listeners
        for you. However, in a deployment where the clients use various protocols and ports to
        establish a connection with the broker, you need to configure the broker so that it listens
        on all ports and with all protocols used by the clients. This configuration has to be done
        manually with the help of an advanced configuration snippet.
Complete the following steps to manually configure listeners for Kafka brokers. 

During configuration, ensure that listeners are set individually
      for each broker, using each brokerâ€™s FQDN. 
In Cloudera Manager, select the Kafka service.Go to Instances.Configure listeners using an advanced configuration snippet:Repeat the
          following steps for each Kafka broker role.
Click on a Kafka broker role.
Go to Configuration.
Find the Kafka Broker Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                Valve) for kafka.properties property and configure
              listeners.For
                example:listeners=SASL_SSL://[***KAFKA BROKER FQDN***]:9093,SSL://[***KAFKA BROKER FQDN***]:9094
This
                example shows a configuration where the broker is accepting both SASL_SSL and SSL
                requests. importantEnsure that you configure a listener for all
                  protocols and ports that you want the broker to listen to.
            
Click Save Changes.
Restart the Kafka service.
The Kafka broker now listens for connection requests on the configured ports with
      the configured protocols.
