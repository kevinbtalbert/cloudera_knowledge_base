Configure TLS/SSL encryption for Kafka clients
Kafka supports TLS/SSL encrypted communication with both brokers and clients. Client
    configuration is done by setting the relevant security-related properties for the client. 

The following steps demonstrate configuration for the console consumer or producer. If you
        are configuring a custom developed client, see Java client security examples  or
          .Net client security examples for code examples.




Generate or acquire a truststore containing the certificate of the Certificate
            Authority that issued the broker certificates.
Note down the location and password for the truststore. You will need to provide these
            during configuration.



Create a .properties file.In this example the file is
          named client.properties.Add the mandatory properties to the file.The following configuration
          example contains all mandatory
          properties:security.protocol=SSL
ssl.truststore.location= [***PATH TO CLIENT TRUSTSTORE***]
ssl.truststore.password=[***PASSWORD***](Optional) Add additional security  properties to the file.
Depending on your requirements and broker configuration, additional configuration
            properties might also be needed. The following are some of the most commonly used
            optional properties:
ssl.provider
ssl.cipher.suites
ssl.enabled.protocols
ssl.truststore.type
ssl.keystore.type

Run the client.

Console Consumer

kafka-console-producer --bootstrap-server [***HOST1:PORT1***] --topic [***TOPIC***] --producer.config client.properties

Console Producer

kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server [***HOST1:PORT1***] --topic [***TOPIC***] --consumer.config client.properties



Kafka clients are configured for TLS/SSL encryption.
