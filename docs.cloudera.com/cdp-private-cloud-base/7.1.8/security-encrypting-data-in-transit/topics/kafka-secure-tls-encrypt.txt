Kafka supports client to broker and inter-broker TLS/SSL encrypted communications.
    Configuring TLS/SSL encryption for a Kafka deployment involves configuring both clients and
    brokers. In addition to this, Kafka also supports TLS/SSL communication with
    Zookeeper.


Configure TLS/SSL encryption for Kafka brokersKafka supports TLS/SSL encrypted communication with both brokers and clients. To     enable and configure TLS/SSL, you need to enable TLS/SSL for the brokers and enter key and     truststore related information. Configuring TLS/SSL encryption for Kafka MirrorMakerThe Kafka MirrorMaker role supports TLS/SSL encrypted communication with Kafka     brokers. To enable and configure TLS/SSL, you need to enable TLS/SSL for the MirrorMaker role,     enter key and truststore related information, and specify the client authentication used by the     source and destination Kafka clusters.Configuring TLS/SSL encryption for the Kafka Connect roleKafka Connect roles inherit the TLS/SSL configuration of the parent Kafka service. If     you are deploying Kafka Connect roles under a Kafka service that already has TLS/SSL enabled,     Cloudera Manager will automatically enable TLS/SSL for Connect as well. If required however, you     can manually enable or disable TLS/SSL. Configure TLS/SSL encryption for Kafka clientsKafka supports TLS/SSL encrypted communication with both brokers and clients. Client     configuration is done by setting the relevant security-related properties for the client. Configure Zookeeper TLS/SSL support for KafkaLearn how to configure TLS/SSL communication between Kafka and Zookeeper. AuthenticationInter-broker securityKafka can expose multiple communication endpoints, each supporting a different protocol.     Supporting multiple communication endpoints enables you to use different communication protocols     for client-to-broker communications and inter-broker communications. Configuring multiple listenersKafka brokers can simultaneously listen to connection requests on multiple ports with     various protocols. By default Cloudera Manager automatically configures the ports and the     protocols used by the brokers to listen to requests. However, manual configuration is possible     and may be required in an advanced deployment. Parent topic: Configuring TLS/SSL encryption manually for CDP Services
