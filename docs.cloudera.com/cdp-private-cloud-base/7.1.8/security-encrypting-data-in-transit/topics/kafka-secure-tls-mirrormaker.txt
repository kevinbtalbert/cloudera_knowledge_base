Configuring TLS/SSL encryption for Kafka MirrorMaker
The Kafka MirrorMaker role supports TLS/SSL encrypted communication with Kafka
    brokers. To enable and configure TLS/SSL, you need to enable TLS/SSL for the MirrorMaker role,
    enter key and truststore related information, and specify the client authentication used by the
    source and destination Kafka clusters.



Generate or acquire a key and truststore for the MirrorMaker role which contain all
            necessary keys and certificates.
Note down the locations and passwords for the key and truststores. You will need to
            provide these during configuration.



In Cloudera Manager, select the Kafka service.Go to Configuration.Find and configure the following properties based on your cluster and
          requirements.

Description




Enable TLS/SSL for Kafka MirrorMaker
ssl_enabled

Encrypt communication between clients and Kafka MirrorMaker using Transport
                    Layer Security (TLS) (formerly known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL)).



Kafka MirrorMaker TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore File
                        Location
ssl_server_keystore_location

The path to the TLS/SSL keystore file containing the server certificate and
                    private key used for TLS/SSL. Used when Kafka MirrorMaker is acting as a TLS/SSL
                    server.



Kafka MirrorMaker TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore File
                        Password
ssl_server_keystore_password

The password for the Kafka MirroMaker keystore file.



Kafka MirrorMaker TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore Key
                        Password
ssl_server_keystore_keypassword

The password that protects the private key contained in the JKS keystore
                    used when Kafka MirrorMaker is acting as a TLS/SSL server.



Kafka MirrorMaker TLS/SSL Trust Store File
ssl_client_truststore_location

The location on disk of the trust store, used to confirm the authenticity
                    of TLS/SSL servers that Kafka MirrorMaker might connect to. This trust store
                    must contain the certificate(s) used to sign the service(s) connected to. If
                    this parameter is not provided, the default list of well-known certificate
                    authorities is used instead.



Kafka MirrorMaker TLS/SSL Trust Store Password
ssl_client_truststore_password

The password for the Kafka MirrorMaker TLS/SSL Trust Store File. This
                    password is not required to access the trust store; this field can be left
                    blank. This password provides optional integrity checking of the file. The
                    contents of trust stores are certificates, and certificates are public
                    information.



Source Kafka Cluster's Client Auth
source.ssl.client.auth

Only required if the source Kafka cluster requires client
                    authentication.



Destination Kafka Cluster's Client Auth
destination.ssl.client.auth

Only required if destination Kafka cluster requires client
                    authentication.
