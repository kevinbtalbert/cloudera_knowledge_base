Additional configuration steps when using a load balancer TLS/SSL for Solr HA


To configure a load balancer:


Go to the Solr service.

Cloick the Configuration tab.

Select Scope > Solr.

Enter the hostname and port number of the load balancer in the Solr Load
                        Balancer property in the format hostname:port
                    number.

note
When you set this property, Cloudera Manager regenerates the keytabs for
                            Solr roles. The principal in these keytabs contains the load balancer
                            hostname.
If there are services that depend on this Solr service, such as Hue,
                            those services use the load balancer to communicate with Solr.



Enter a Reason for change, and then click
                        Save Changes to commit the changes.

Restart Solr and any dependent services or restart the entire cluster for this
                    configuration to take effect.
