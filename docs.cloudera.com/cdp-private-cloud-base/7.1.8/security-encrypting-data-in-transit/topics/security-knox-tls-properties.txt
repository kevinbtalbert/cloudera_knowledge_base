Description



Knox Gateway TLS/SSL Client Trust Store File
gateway.httpclient.truststore.path
The location on disk of the trust store, in .jks format, used to confirm the
                authenticity of TLS/SSL servers that Knox Gateway might connect to. This is used
                when Knox Gateway is the client in a TLS/SSL connection. This trust store must
                contain the certificate(s) used to sign the service(s) connected to. If this
                parameter is not provided, the default list of well-known certificate authorities is
                used instead.


Knox Gateway TLS/SSL Client Trust Store Password
NA
The password for the Knox Gateway TLS/SSL Certificate Trust Store File. This
                password is not required to access the trust store; this field can be left blank.
                This password provides optional integrity checking of the file. The contents of
                trust stores are certificates, and certificates are public information.


Enable TLS/SSL for Knox Gateway
knox.enableTLS
Encrypt communication between clients and Knox Gateway using Transport Layer
                Security (TLS) (formerly known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL)).


Knox Gateway TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore File Location
gateway.tls.keystore.path
The path to the TLS/SSL keystore file containing the server certificate and
                private key used for TLS/SSL. Used when Knox Gateway is acting as a TLS/SSL server.
                The keystore must be in JKS format.


Knox Gateway TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore File Password
ssl_server_keystore_password
The password for the Knox Gateway JKS keystore file.
