Enable TLS/SSL for Ranger RMS Server
ranger-rms.service.https.attrib.ssl.enabled


Encrypt communication between clients and Ranger RMS
                                            Server using Transport Layer Security (TLS) (formerly
                                            known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL)).




Ranger RMS Server TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore File
                                            Location
ranger-rms.service.https.attrib.keystore.file


The path to the TLS/SSL keystore file containing the
                                            server certificate and private key used for TLS/SSL.
                                            Used when Ranger RMS Server is acting as a TLS/SSL
                                            server. The keystore must be in JKS format.

Ranger RMS Server TLS/SSL Trust Store File
ranger-rms.truststore.file


The location on disk of the trust store, in .jks format,
                                            used to confirm the authenticity of TLS/SSL servers that
                                            Ranger RMS Server might connect to. This trust store
                                            must contain the certificate(s) used to sign the
                                            service(s) connected to.
If this parameter is not provided, the default list of
                                            well-known certificate authorities is used instead.




Ranger RMS Server TLS/SSL Trust Store Password
ranger-rms.truststore.password


The password for the Ranger RMS Server TLS/SSL Trust
                                            Store File. This password is not required to access the
                                            trust store; this field can be left blank. This password
                                            provides optional integrity checking of the file. The
                                            contents of trust stores are certificates, and
                                            certificates are public information.

Table 2. Ranger RMS Server TLS/SSL Keystore File Alias Settings

Configuration Property
Description




Ranger RMS Server TLS/SSL Keystore File Alias
ranger-rms.service.https.attrib.keystore.keyalias


The alias for the Ranger RMS Server TLS/SSL keystore
                                            file.
If host FQDN is used as an alias while creating a
                                            keystore file, the {{HOST}} default placeholder value
                                            will be replaced with the host FQDN where Ranger RMS
                                            Server will be installed in the current cluster.
The placeholder can be replaced to have a custom alias
                                            used while creating the keystore file.
If using a custom alias which is the same as
                                            host short name then use {{HOST_UQDN}} placeholder as a
                                            value.
