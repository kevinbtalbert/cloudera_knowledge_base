Enabling TLS Encryption for SMM on CDP Private Cloud
Learn how to enable TLS/SSL encryption for Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) on CDP
        Private Cloud to secure the communication of sensitive information. You can enable the
        settings in Cloudera Manager according to the cluster configuration.

If Kerberos is enabled, then you must enable SSL for Streams Messaging
                Manager (SMM). SMM UI fails to load if Kerberos is enabled and SSL is not
                enabled.
Also, if Kafka has Kerberos/SSL enabled, the same should be enabled for
                SMM.


Log in to Cloudera Manager.

Select the Streams Messaging Manager cluster.

Click Configuration from the menu bar.

In the Search field, type TLS/SSL to
                    show the SMM TLS/SSL properties.

The security related properties appear.


Edit the security properties according to the cluster configuration.

Click Save Changes.
