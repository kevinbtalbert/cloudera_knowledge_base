Configuring TLS/SSL encryption manually for Spark
You can enable TLS manually for the Spark History Server.

In Cloudera Manager, select the
                        Spark service from the
                        Clusters drop-down menu.

In the Configuration tab, enter tls
                    into the search box.

Edit the following property fields as needed for your cluster and
                    environment:



Property
Description



TLS/SSL Protocol
The version of the TLS/SSL protocol to use when TLS/SSL
                                        is enabled.


Enabled SSL/TLS Algorithms
A comma-separated list of algorithm names to enable when
                                        TLS/SSL is enabled. By default, all algorithms supported by
                                        the JRE are enabled.


TLS/SSL Port Number
Port where to listen for TLS/SSL connections. HTTP
                                        connections will be redirected to this port when TLS/SSL is
                                        enabled.


Enable TLS/SSL for History Server
Encrypt communication between clients and History Server
                                        using Transport Layer Security (TLS) (formerly known as
                                        Secure Socket Layer (SSL)).


History Server TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore File
                                        Location
The path to the TLS/SSL keystore file containing the
                                        server certificate and private key used for TLS/SSL. Used
                                        when History Server is acting as a TLS/SSL server. The
                                        keystore must be in JKS format.


History Server TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore File
                                        Password
The password for the History Server JKS keystore
                                        file.
