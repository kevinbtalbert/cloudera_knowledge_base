How To Set Up Access to Cloudera EDH (Microsoft Azure Marketplace)

The Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub (EDH) and Cloudera Altus Director bundles
      that are available on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace only support SSH
      access (port 22). To access Cloudera Manager (port 7180), Altus Director
      (port 7189), or other services, you can: 
Set up a SOCKS (Sockets Secure protocol) proxy on your client machine. Cloudera
          recommends that you use this option.
Add inbound rules to the Network Security Group in the Azure
          instance after you deploy EDH or Director to Azure.

Configure the SOCKS Proxy

The SOCKS5 protocol is implemented as a client and server process that enables traversal of IP
    network firewalls. After you configure the SOCKS proxy, your browser resolves DNS lookups using
    the Microsoft Azure network (through the proxy server), and lets you connect to services using
    internal FQDNs or private IP address.
With this approach, you complete the following tasks:
Set up a single SSH tunnel to one of the hosts on the network and create a SOCKS proxy on
      the host.
Change the browser configuration to perform all lookups through the SOCKS proxy host.



Network Prerequisites

Verify the following prerequisites before you connect to your cluster with a SOCKS proxy:
You must be able to reach the host that you want to proxy to from the public internet or
       from the network that you're connecting from.
The host that you proxy to must be on the same network as the Cloudera services that
              you're connecting to. For example, if youâ€™re using the Cloudera EDH offering, tunnel
              to the Cloudera Manager host. 




Find the Public IP of the Host 

For the Cloudera EDH offering, use the public IP of the 0th master node VM:
     [dnsName]-mn0.



Start the SOCKS Proxy

On Linux

To start a SOCKS proxy over SSH, run the following
      command:ssh -i your-key-file.pem -CND 1080
the_username_you_specified@publicIP_of_VM
The command uses the following parameters:
-i your-key-file.pem Specifies the path to the private key needed
                to SSH to the Cloudera EDH server. Omit if using SSH passwords.
C Sets up compression.
N Suppresses any command execution once established.
D Sets up the SOCKS proxy on a port.
1080 The port to set the SOCKS proxy locally.




On Windows

Follow the instructions on Microsoft's website (see SSH tunnel to endpoints in Azure VNet
              from Windows). 




Configure Google Chrome to Use the Proxy

By default, Google Chrome uses system-wide proxy settings on a per-profile basis.
     To start Chrome without these settings, open Chrome through the command line and specify the
      following:
The SOCKS proxy port. This must be the same port that you used when you started the
       proxy.
The profile. This examples below create a new profile.

Use one of the following commands to create a profile and launch a new instance of
     Chrome that does not conflict with any currently running Chrome instances.
Linux/usr/bin/google-chrome \
--user-data-dir="$HOME/chrome-with-proxy" \
--proxy-server="socks5://localhost:1080"
Mac OS
     X"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
--user-data-dir="$HOME/chrome-with-proxy" \
--proxy-server="socks5://localhost:1080"
Microsoft
     Windows"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" ^
--user-data-dir="%USERPROFILE%\chrome-with-proxy" ^
--proxy-server="socks5://localhost:1080"
In this Chrome session, you can use the private IP address or internal FQDN to connect to any
          host that is accessible by Cloudera EDH. 




Network Security Group

Warning: This method is not recommended for any purpose other than a Proof of Concept.
    If the data is not carefully locked down, it will be accessible to hackers and malicious
    entities. 
On the Microsoft Azure Portal, find the Network Security Group(s) and add inbound rules
        for the various services. You might have to create these rules for the
        services.
