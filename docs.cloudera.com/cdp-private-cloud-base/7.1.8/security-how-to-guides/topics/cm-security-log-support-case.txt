How to Log a Security Support Case

noteCloudera customers can get help at the support site and use the  Cloudera Knowledge Base. 
Before logging a support case, collect as much information
      about your issue as possible, as detailed below: 
If possible, gather a diagnostic bundle.
Note specific details about the issue, including these: 
Is this a new install, or did you upgrade a working cluster? For
              upgrades, identify release numbers ("trying to upgrade from
              Cloudera Manager 5.7.0 to Cloudera Manager 6.0.0," for
              example).
Is this a production deployment, development environment, or
              sandbox environment?
Note the severity of the impact and whether it is causing a
              production outage.
Capture error messages (screenshots, command-line capture, and
              so on) and attach to the case.
Note the commands executed and the results, captured to a file
              if possible.
Itemize all changes made to your cluster configuration after the
              issue arose (possibly, as attempts to resolve the issue).


The following are some additional details to
      gather when contacting support:
    Kerberos Issues
LDAP Issues
TLS/SSL Issues

Kerberos Issues


For Kerberos issues, your krb5.conf and
          kdc.conf files are valuable for support to be able to
          understand your configuration.
If you are having trouble with client access to the cluster, provide the output
          for klist -ef after kiniting as the user account on
          the client host in question. Additionally, confirm that your ticket is
          renewable by running kinit -R after successfully
          kiniting.
Specify if you are authenticating (kiniting) with a user outside of the Hadoop
          cluster's realm (such as Active Directory, or another MIT Kerberos
          realm).
If using AES-256 encryption, ensure you have the Unlimited Strength JCE Policy Files
          deployed on all cluster and client nodes.




LDAP Issues


Specify the LDAP service in use (Active Directory, OpenLDAP, one of
          Oracle Directory Server offerings, OpenDJ, etc)
Provide a screenshot of the LDAP configuration screen you are
          working with if you are troubleshooting setup issues.
Be prepared to troubleshoot using the ldapsearch
          command (requires the openldap-clients package) on
          the host where LDAP authentication or authorization issues are being
          seen.




TLS/SSL Issues


Specify whether you are using a private/commercial CA for your
          certificates, or if they are self-signed. Note that Cloudera strongly
          recommends against using self-signed certificates in production
          clusters.
Clarify what services you are attempting to setup TLS/SSL for in your
          description.
When troubleshooting TLS/SSL trust issues, provide the output of the following
          openssl command:openssl s_client -connect host.fqdn.name:port
