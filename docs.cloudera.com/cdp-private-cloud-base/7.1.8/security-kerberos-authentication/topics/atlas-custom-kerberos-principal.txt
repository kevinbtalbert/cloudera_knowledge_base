Configuring custom Kerberos principal for Atlas
Customising the Atlas Kerberos Principal is a two-step process.

Updating the Kerberos Principal.

In your Cloudera Manager instance, go to the
                            Configuration tab and search for the
                            Principal by entering "principal" in the search
                        field.



For Kerberos Principal, enter the value as “atlas” and
                        click Save Changes.


Regenerating the missing keytab.

In the Instances tab, click Actions to
                            Selected and select Regenerate missing
                            keytab. Click Save.



noteUpdating the Atlas Kerberos Principal results in stale configurations for
                        services. You must restart the stale services.
Warning: Cloudera Manager will not create service users /
                        groups which are customised. 
Cloudera Manager handles the mapping of the service user to the
                        Kerberos Principal and no additional task is required. You must configure
                        the required policies in the Ranger UI.
importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.
If the Kerberos principal name is customized for a Knox service having a
                        default service user name, add the following proxy configurations to
                            Atlas Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                            for conf/atlas-application.properties and restart the Atlas
                            service:
atlas.proxyuser.<knox_principal_name>.hosts= <list of
                                    allowed hosts>. The <list of allowed hosts>
                                can be provided as * to allow
                                all.
atlas.proxyuser.<knox_principal_name>.groups= <list of
                                    allowed groups>
atlas.proxyuser.<knox_principal_name>.users= <list of
                                    allowed users>

Where <knox_principal_name> is the value of the
                            Kerberos Principal in the Knox service. Select
                            Clusters > Knox > Configuration and search for
                            Kerberos Principal to display this value.

noteCustom principals are used as service users to create
                            the required policies. You must ensure that the UNIX account associated
                            with Custom Principals is available on all hosts and must be mapped with
                            the appropriate groups. Else, you have appropriate auth-to-local rules
                            present to map the Custom Principals to the service users and
                            appropriate required policy is present in Ranger. Specially for
                                Atlas, if you have custom service principal, you must add the same
                                to Kafka policies if you have not mapped auth-to-local rules in
                                Kafka configurations. Else, you must have the Atlas service user in
                                the Kafka policies. Note that Kafka supports
                                    auth-to-local rules with a custom
                                property named
                                    sasl.kerberos.principal.to.local.rulesFor
                                more information, see Enable Kerberos
