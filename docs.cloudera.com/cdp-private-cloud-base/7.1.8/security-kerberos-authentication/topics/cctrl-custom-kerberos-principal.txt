Configuring custom Kerberos principal for Cruise Control
The Kerberos principal for Cruise Control is configured by default to use the same
        service principal as the default process user. However, you can change the default setting
        by providing a custom principal in Cloudera Manager.

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.


Go to your Cluster in Cloudera Manager.

Select Cruise Control from the list of services.

Go to the Configuration tab.

Search for the Kerberos principal by entering "kerberos" in the search
                    field.

Provide a custom name to the Kerberos Principal
                    property.

Click Save Changes.

Click on Actions > Restart next to the Cruise Control
                    service name to restart the service.

If you use Ranger for authorization, update all
            resource-based services and policies that use the old principal and add the new
            principal. For more information on updating resource-based services and policies, see
                Using Ranger to Provide Authorization in CDP.
