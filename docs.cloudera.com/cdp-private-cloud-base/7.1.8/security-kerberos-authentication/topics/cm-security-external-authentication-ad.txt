How to configure authentication using Active Directory in Cloudera Manager.  

Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.

Select Administration > Settings

Select External Authentication in the
            Category filter. 

For Authentication Backend Order, select the order in which
          Cloudera Manager should look up authentication credentials for login attempts. 
The Authentication Backend Order options are :
        
Database Only
External then Database
Database then External
External Only (with emergency Administrator access)
External Only (without emergency Administrator access)


For External Authentication Type, select Active
            Directory.

In the LDAP URL property, enter the URL of the Active Directory server.

In the Active Directory Domain property, provide the domain to authenticate
          against.

LDAP URL and Active Directory are the only settings required to allow
            anyone in Active Directory to log in to Cloudera Manager. 
For example, if you set LDAP URL to  ldap://adserver.example.com and
            the Active Directory Domain to ADREALM.EXAMPLE.COM, users can log into
            Cloudera Manager using just their username, such as sampleuser. They no
            longer require the complete string: sampleuser@ADREALM.EXAMPLE.COM.


Restart the Cloudera Manager Server.
