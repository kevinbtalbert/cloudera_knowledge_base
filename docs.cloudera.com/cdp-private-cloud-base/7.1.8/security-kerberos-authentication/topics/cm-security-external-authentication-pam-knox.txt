Configuring PAM authentication using Apache Knox
You can configure Cloudera Manager to authenticate through Apache Knox, with
    authorization provided by LDAP through PAM.

In Cloudera Manager, click
              Administration > Settings > External
              Authentication.Search for the property Enable SPNEGO/Kerberos Authentication for the
            Admin Console and API, and select the checkbox to enable it.Search for "Knox Proxy" to view the Knox properties that you need to
          configure.Set the Allowed Groups for Knox Proxy property to the
          appropriate LDAP group values.Set the Allowed Users for Knox Proxy property to the
          appropriate users.Set the Allowed Hosts for Knox Proxy property to the
          appropriate host values (IP address or FQDN).Cloudera Manager checks whether PUT/POST requests come from the same referers. To
          relax that restriction, set the  Cloudera Manager Frontend URL
          property
              (Administration > Settings)
          to the Knox host and port (for example,
          "https://bsmith-knox2-1.bsmith-knox2.root.hwx.site:8443").Verify that the Authorization Backend Order property is
            not set to "Database Only." If set to Database Only, the external group mapping
          will not work.Restart the Cloudera Manager Server:sudo systemctl restart
            cloudera-scm-serverIn Cloudera Manager, map roles to the groups that your user belongs to. Click
              Administration > Users &
              Roles > LDAP/PAM Groups, then
            Add LDAP/PAM Group Mapping.
