Configuring PAM authentication with Linux users
You can configure PAM authentication to allow built-in Linux users to log in to
    Cloudera Manager.
Configure the Cloudera Manager Server host:
The Linux user who is running Cloudera Manager (for example, cloudera-scm)
              must have read access to the system shadow file. Run the following command on the
              Cloudera Manager Server host to check the shadow file group
                permission::ls -l /etc/shadow
----r-----+ 1 root root 1738 Jul 16 17:09 /etc/shadowThe
                above example shows that the root group of the shadow file is the owner group and
                not the shadow group. The '-r' indicates that the user in the root group can have
                read access to the shadow file.If you see something like ---------- 1
                  root root 1611 Jul 16 17:09 /etc/shadow, no group read permission is
                assigned. Add that permission to the file by running the following
                command:chmod g+r /etc/shadow
Add the user to the owner group:usermod -a -G root
            cloudera-scmIf the owner group is the shadow group:usermod -a -G
            shadow cloudera-scm
In Cloudera Manager, click
              Administration > Settings > External
              Authentication.Verify that the Authentication Backend Order property is
            not set to "Database Only."Verify that the Authorization Backend Order property is
            not set to "Database Only." If set to Database Only, the external group mapping
          will not work.Select PAM as the external authentication type.If you have a specific PAM configuration you wish to use for Cloudera Manager,
          modify the PAM Service Name property with that configuration's name
          (it should correspond to a file residing in /etc/pam.d/). Otherwise, use the default
          value, login.Save the changes.When finished, restart the Cloudera Manager Server:sudo
            systemctl restart cloudera-scm-serverTo test the configuration, log into Cloudera Manager with a Linux user and run the
          following commands in the host server console to create a user and assign groups to the
          user:
Create the user:
useradd testUser
passwd testUser

Assign groups to the user:
groupadd testGroup
usermod -a -G testGroup testUser

In Cloudera Manager, map roles to the groups that your user belongs to. Click
              Administration > Users &
              Roles > LDAP/PAM Groups, then
            Add LDAP/PAM Group Mapping.
You can now login to Cloudera Manager using the Linux user you just
      created.
