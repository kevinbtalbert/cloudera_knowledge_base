Configure authentication using Kerberos (SPNEGO)
Cloudera Manager 6.3 and higher support Kerberos authentication using SPNEGO for the
    Admin Console as well as the API.

important
With SPNEGO enabled, the Swagger-based Java and Python SDKs, as well as the older
          deprecated Java SDK, can still authenticate using HTTP Basic Authentication. The older
          deprecated Python SDK cannot. Do not enable SPNEGO if you are relying on the deprecated
          Python client for any operations.



If you have not already done so, enable Kerberos for cluster services.

Navigate to Administration > Settings.

Enter SPNEGO in the Search field.

Select the Enable SPNEGO/Kerberos Authentication for the Admin Console and API
          checkbox. Leave the other SPNEGO settings blank to allow Cloudera Manager to automatically
          generate the principal and keytab.

Click Save Changes.

Restart Cloudera Manager Server.
