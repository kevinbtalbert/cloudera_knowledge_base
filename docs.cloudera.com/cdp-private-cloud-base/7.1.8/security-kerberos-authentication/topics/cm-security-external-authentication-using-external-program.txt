How to configure authentication using an external program in Cloudera
    Manager.
Cloudera Manager can use a custom external authentication
      program. Typically, this may be a custom script that interacts with a custom authentication
      service. Cloudera Manager will call the external program with the username as the first
      command line argument. The password is passed over stdin. Each positive value
      exit code can be mapped to Cloudera Manager user roles. A negative value is returned for
      failure to authenticate. Valid values for the exit code are between 0 and 127.

Log in to Cloudera Manager Admin Console.

Select Administration > Settings

Select External Authentication for the
            Category filter to display the settings. 

For External Authentication Type, select External Program.

Provide a path to the external program in the External Authentication Program
            Path property.


After you configure authentication for Cloudera Manager, configure authorization for the
        authenticated users. This is done by mapping the authenticated users to Cloudera Manager
        user
        roles.
