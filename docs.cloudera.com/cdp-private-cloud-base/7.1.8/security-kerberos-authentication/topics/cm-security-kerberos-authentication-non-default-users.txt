Kerberos authentication for non-default users
The steps described here are only applicable if you are running one or more CDP
    services with non-default users.

If you have modified the default value for the System User property for any
          service in Cloudera Manager, you must only perform the command (as described below)
          corresponding to that service, in order to successfully run jobs with the non-default
          user.



HBase
Give the hbase user ownership of the HBase root directory:
sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -chown -R hbase ${hbase.rootdir}
By default, hbase.rootdir is
                    /hbase.


Hive
Give the hive user ownership of the
                      /user/hive
                    directory.sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -chown hive /user/hive


YARN
For every NodeManager host, for each path in
                      yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs,
                    run:rm -rf ${yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs}/usercache/*This
                    removes the /usercache directory that contains intermediate
                    data stored for previous jobs.
