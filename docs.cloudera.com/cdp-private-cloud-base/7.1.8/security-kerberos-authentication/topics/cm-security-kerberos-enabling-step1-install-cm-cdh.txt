Step 1: Install Cloudera Manager and CDP
Cloudera strongly recommends that you install and configure the Cloudera Manager Server
    and Cloudera Manager Agents and CDP to set up a fully-functional CDP cluster before
    trying to configure Kerberos authentication for the cluster. 
Parent topic: Enabling Kerberos Authentication for CDP
Required user:group Settings for Security


When you install the CDP packages and the Cloudera Manager Agents on your cluster hosts,
          Cloudera Manager takes some steps to provide system security such as creating the OS
            user:group accounts and setting directory permissions as shown in the
          table below. These user accounts and directory permissions work with the Hadoop Kerberos
          security requirements.

The hdfs user has HDFS superuser privileges.
When you install the Cloudera Manager Server on the server host, a new Unix user account
          called cloudera-scm is created automatically to support security. The
          Cloudera Manager Server uses this account to create host principals and deploy the keytabs
          on your cluster.
Depending on whether you installed CDP and Cloudera Manager at
          the same time or not, use one of the following sections for information on configuring
          directory ownerships on cluster hosts.
New Installation, Cloudera Manager and CDP Together
Installing a new Cloudera Manager cluster with CDP components at the same time can save
          you some of the user:group configuration required if you install them separately. The
          installation process creates the necessary user accounts on the Linux host system for the
          service daemons. At the end of the installation process when each cluster node starts up,
          the Cloudera Manager Agent process on the host automatically configures the directory
          ownership as shown in the table below, and the Hadoop daemons can then automatically set
          permissions for their respective directories. Do not change the directory owners on the
          cluster. They must be configured exactly as shown below.
