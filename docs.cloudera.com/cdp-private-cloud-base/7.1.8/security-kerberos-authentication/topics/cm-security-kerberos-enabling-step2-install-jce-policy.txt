Step 2: Install JCE policy files for AES-256 encryption
How to install JCE policy files, if required. 
noteThis step is not required when using JDK 1.8.0_161 or greater. JDK
        1.8.0_161 enables unlimited strength encryption by default.
By default, CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 (and higher) use AES-256 encryption for
        Kerberos tickets, so the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction
        Policy Files must be installed on all cluster hosts as detailed below. Alternatively, the
        Kerberos instance can be modified to not use AES-256.To manually install the JCE policy files on the host system: 
Download the
            jce_policy-<version>.zip file
          from the Oracle website.
Unzip the file.
Follow the steps in README.txt to install it.
To use Cloudera Manager to install the JCE policy file: 
Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
Navigate to
              Administration > Security.
Click Install Java Unlimited Strength Encryption Policy
            Files.
Specify the repository location for your version of Cloudera
          Manager, and click Continue.
Check the box labeled Install Oracle Java SE Development
            Kit (JDK 8), and then check the box labeled
            Install Java Unlimited Strength Encryption Policy
            Files. Click Continue.
Provide cluster host login credentials, and then click
            Continue.
After the installation completes, click
            Finish. If the Upgrade Cloudera
            Manager page displays, you can exit by clicking the
            Cloudera Manager logo to return to the home
          page.
Alternative: Disable AES-256 encryption from the Kerberos instance: 
Remove any aes256 entries from the
            supported_enctypes field of the
            kdc.conf or krb5.conf files.
Restart the Kerberos KDC and the kadmin server so the changes take
          effect. 
The keys of relevant principals, such as Ticket Granting Ticket principal
      (krbtgt/REALM@REALM), might need to change. noteIf AES-256 remains in use despite disabling it, it may be
      because the aes256-cts:normal setting existed when the Kerberos
      database was created. To resolve this issue, create a new Kerberos database and then
      restart both the KDC and the kadmin server.To verify the type of encryption used in your cluster:For MIT KDC: On the local KDC host, type this command in the kadmin.local or kadmin
          shell to create a test principal:
kadmin:  addprinc test
For Active Directory: Create a new AD account with the name,
              test.
On a cluster host, type this command to start a Kerberos session as test:

kinit test 
On a cluster host, type this command to view the encryption type in use:

klist -e 
If AES is being used, output like the following is displayed after you type the
              klist command (note that AES-256 is included in the
            output):
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_0
Default principal: test@Cloudera Manager
