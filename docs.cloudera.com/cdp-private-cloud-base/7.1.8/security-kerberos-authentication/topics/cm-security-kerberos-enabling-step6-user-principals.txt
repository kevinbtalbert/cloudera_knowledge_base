How to create a Kerberos principal for a user account.
Parent topic: Enabling Kerberos Authentication for CDP



Now that Kerberos is configured and enabled on your cluster, you and every other Hadoop
          user must have a Kerberos principal or keytab to obtain Kerberos credentials to be allowed
          to access the cluster and use the Hadoop services. In the next step of this procedure, you
          will need to create your own Kerberos principals to verify that Kerberos security is
          working on your cluster. If you and the other Hadoop users already have a Kerberos
          principal or keytab, or if your Kerberos administrator can provide them, you can skip
          ahead to the next step.




If you are using Active Directory


Add a new AD user account for each new user that should have access to the cluster.
            You do not need to make any changes to existing user accounts.




If you are using MIT KDC


In the kadmin.local or kadmin shell, use the
            following command to create user principals by replacing
              YOUR-LOCAL-REALM.COM with the name of your realm, and replacing
              USERNAME with a username:

kadmin:  addprinc USERNAME@YOUR-LOCAL-REALM.COM 


Enter and re-enter a password when prompted.
