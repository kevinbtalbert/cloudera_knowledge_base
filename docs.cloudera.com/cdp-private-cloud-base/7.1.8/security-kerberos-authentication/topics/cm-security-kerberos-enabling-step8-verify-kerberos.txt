Step 8: Verify that Kerberos security is working
Verify that Kerberos security is working by running test MapReduce jobs. 

After you have Kerberos credentials, you can verify that Kerberos security is working on
        your cluster by trying to run MapReduce jobs. To confirm, try launching a sleep or a pi job
        from the provided Hadoop examples
        (/usr/lib/hadoop/hadoop-examples.jar).
note
This section assumes you have a fully-functional CDP cluster and you have been able to
          access HDFS and run MapReduce jobs before you followed these instructions to configure and
          enable Kerberos on your cluster. If you have not already done so, you should at a minimum
          use the Cloudera Manager Admin Console to generate a client configuration file to enable
          you to access the cluster.
          



Acquire Kerberos credentials for your user account.

kinit USERNAME@YOUR-LOCAL-REALM.COM 


Enter a password when prompted.

Submit a sample pi calculation as a test MapReduce job. Use the following command if
          you use a package-based setup for Cloudera Manager:
$ hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop-0.20-mapreduce/hadoop-examples.jar pi 10 10000
Number of Maps = 10
Samples per Map = 10000
...
Job Finished in 38.572 seconds
Estimated value of Pi is 3.14120000000000000000If
          you have a parcel-based setup, use the following command
          instead:$ hadoop jar /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-0.20-mapreduce/hadoop-examples.jar pi 10 10000
Number of Maps = 10
Samples per Map = 10000
...
Job Finished in 30.958 seconds
Estimated value of Pi is 3.14120000000000000000


You have now verified that Kerberos security is working on your cluster.
important
Running a MapReduce job will fail if you do not have a valid Kerberos ticket in your
          credentials cache. You can examine the Kerberos tickets currently in your credentials
          cache by running the klist command. You can obtain a ticket by running
          the kinit command and either specifying a keytab file containing
          credentials, or entering the password for your principal. If you do not have a valid
          ticket, you will receive an error such
          as:11/01/04 12:08:12 WARN ipc.Client:
