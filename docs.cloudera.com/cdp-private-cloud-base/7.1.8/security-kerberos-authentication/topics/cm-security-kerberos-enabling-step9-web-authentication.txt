In Cloudera Manager, set the authentication backend to
              SpnegoDjangoBackend.


Go to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console. From the Clusters tab, select
                the Hue service.


Click the Configuration tab.


Select Scope > Service-Wide.


Select Category > Security.


Locate the Authentication Backend property and select
                  desktop.auth.backend.SpnegoDjangoBackend.


Click Save Changes.



Restart the Hue service.

If you are using an external load balancer, perform the following steps, otherwise
            skip the remaining steps. Cloudera Manager creates these configuration
            automatically:


On the host running the Hue Kerberos Ticket Renewer, switch to the
                  KT_RENEWER process directory. For example:

cd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/`ls -lrt /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/    \
| awk '{print $9}' |grep KT_RENEWER| tail -1`/



Verify that the Hue keytab includes the HTTP principal.

klist -kte ./hue.keytab

Keytab name: FILE:./hue.keytab
KVNO Timestamp Principal
---- ----------------- --------------------------------------------------------
1 03/09/15 20:20:35 hue/host-10-16-8-168.openstacklocal@EXAMPLE.CLOUDERA.COM (aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96)
1 03/09/15 20:20:36 HTTP/host-10-16-8-168.openstacklocal@EXAMPLE.CLOUDERA.COM (aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96)



Copy the hue.keytab file to /var/lib/hue and
                change ownership to the hue user and group.

cp ./hue.keytab /var/lib/hue/
chown hue:hue /var/lib/hue/hue.keytab



Go to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console. From the Clusters tab, select
                the Hue service.


Click the Configuration tab.


Select Scope > Service-Wide.


Select Category > Advanced.


Locate the Hue Service Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet
                  (Safety Valve) property and add the following line:

KRB5_KTNAME=/var/lib/hue/hue.keytab



Enter a Reason for change, then click Save Changes to commit the
                changes.
