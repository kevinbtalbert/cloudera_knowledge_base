Configuring PAM authentication with LDAP and SSSD
You can configure PAM authentication with one or more Active Directory/LDAP servers
    using System Security Services Daemon (SSSD). SSSD is a system service that allows the Cloudera
    Manager Server host to access a remote LDAP directory or Active Directory domain.
For more information on SSSD, see Red Hat documentation.

Configure SSSD on the Cloudera Manager server host. Run the following command to check
          if the remote user has been synchronized to the server host:id
            <remote_username>
In Cloudera Manager, click
              Administration > Settings > External
              Authentication.Verify that the Authentication Backend Order property is
            not set to "Database Only."Verify that the Authorization Backend Order property is
            not set to "Database Only." If set to Database Only, the external group mapping
          will not work.Select PAM as the external authentication type.If you have a specific PAM configuration you wish to use for Cloudera Manager,
          modify the PAM Service Name property with that configuration's name
          (it should correspond to a file residing in /etc/pam.d/). Otherwise, use the default
          value, login.Save the changes.Add your group mapping roles. Click
              Administration > Users &
              Roles > LDAP/PAM Groups, then
            Add LDAP/PAM Group Mapping.When finished, restart the Cloudera Manager Server:sudo
            systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server
