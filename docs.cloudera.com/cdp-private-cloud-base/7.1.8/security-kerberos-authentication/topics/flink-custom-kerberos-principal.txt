Configuring custom Kerberos principal for Apache Flink
The Kerberos principal for Flink is configured by default to use the same service
        principal as the default process user. However, you can change the default setting by
        providing a custom principal in Cloudera Manager.

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.


Go to your Cluster in Cloudera Manager.

Select Flink from the list of services.

Go to the Configuration tab.

Search for the Kerberos principal by entering kerberos
                    in the search field.

Provide a custom name to the Kerberos Principal
                    property.

Click Save Changes.

Click Actions > Restart next to the Flink service name
                    to restart the service.
