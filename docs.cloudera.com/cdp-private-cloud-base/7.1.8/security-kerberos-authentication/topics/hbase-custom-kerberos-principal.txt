Configuring custom Kerberos principal for HBase
The Kerberos principal for HBase is configured by default to use the same service
        principal as the default process user. However, you can change the default setting by
        providing a custom Kerberos principal in Cloudera Manager.

After changing the Kerberos Principal to the required value in Cloudera Manager, you
                have to change the owner of the HBase folders in HDFS to the new custom Kerberos
                principal name. Then, the ACLs for the ZNodes that are managed by HBase have to be
                changed in ZooKeeper.importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.
Perform the steps given below to configure a custom Kerberos principal for HBase.


Stop the HBase service and set the custom Kerberos principal in Cloudera
                    Manager:


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an
                                Administrator.


In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters >
                                HBase. 


Click Actions > Stop to stop the Hbase
                            service.


Go to the Configuration tab.


Search for the Kerberos Principal by entering "kerberos" in the search
                            field.


For Kerberos Principal, enter the required
                            custom principal value.


Click Save Changes.



importantDo not restart the HBase service until the remaining
                        steps given below are performed.


Change the owner of the HBase HDFS directories:
To change the owner of the HBase folders in HDFS to the new custom Kerberos
                    principal name, use the chown command as an HDFS
                    superuser.hdfs dfs -chown -R newhbaseprincipal:newhbaseprincipal /hbase
If Ranger is used, use the chown command as an HDFS
                    superuser to change the owner of the Ranger HBase log directory in
                    HDFS.hdfs dfs -chown -R newhbaseprincipal:newhbaseprincipal /ranger/audit/hbase

Change the HBase principals configured in Ranger.
If Ranger is used, log in to the Ranger web UI and perform the following
                    steps:


In the Service Manager page, click the
                                Edit icon of the HBase service to open the
                                Edit Service page, and replace the original
                            principal with the custom principal in all the fields in which the
                            original principal is used.


In the Service Manager page, under
                                HBASE, click the
                                cm_hbase link to navigate to the
                            configuration page for cm_hbase policies, and
                            replace the original HBase principal in each policy with the custom
                            principal.



Change the ACLs in ZooKeeper for the /hbase node.
To change the ACLs in ZooKeeper, use either one of the following two
                    options:
Option 1 - Changing the ACLs:


Log in to the ZooKeeper CLI as the old HBase Kerberos principal that is
                            currently owning the HBase ZNodes. See Configure ZooKeeper client
                                shell for Kerberos authentication for information on
                            configuring authentication for zkClient.sh.


The ZNodes that are managed by HBase are under the
                                /hbase ZNode. For each ZNode (including the
                            root ZNode, for example, "/hbase"), list the ACLs by using the
                                    getAcl command and then change the
                            ACLs by using the setAcl command to use the
                            new principal.
Configuration example of ZNodes that can be accessed only by
                            HBase:
getAcl /hbase/tokenauth/keys
'sasl,'hbase
: cdrwa
 
setAcl  /hbase/tokenauth/keys sasl:newhbaseprincipal:cdrwa

Configuration example of ZNodes that can be read by any user but can
                            be changed only by HBase:
getAcl /hbase
'sasl,'hbase
: cdrwa
'world,'anyone
: r
 
setAcl /hbase sasl:newhbaseprincipal:cdrwa,world:anyone:r
noteEnsure that you start changing the ACLs from the leaf
                                nodes, and then work towards the root, because you cannot access the
                                nodes with the original principal after the setAcl command is
                                used.


Option 2 - Deleting and recreating all HBase ZNodes:importantUse
                        this option only for freshly installed HBase clusters. Using this option for
                        HBase clusters that are not freshly installed could lead to loss of some
                        HBase configuration files that are stored in ZooKeeper, such as
                        replication-related configuration files.


Stop the HBase service.


Log in to the ZooKeeper CLI as a super user or as the old HBase
                            Kerberos principal that is currently owning the HBase ZNodes.


Delete all HBase ZNodes, including the root ZNode for HBase (/hbase, by
                            default) by using the deleteall /hbase
                            command.



Restart the HBase service, and any stale services.
After performing the steps given above, click Actions >
                        Start to restart the HBase service from
                        Cloudera Manager, restart any stale services, and
                    redeploy any stale configurations.
