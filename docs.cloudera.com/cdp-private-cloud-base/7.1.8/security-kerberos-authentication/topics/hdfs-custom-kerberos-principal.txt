Configuring custom Kerberos principal for HDFS
The Kerberos principal for HDFS is configured by default to use the same service
        principal as the default process user. However, you can change the default setting by
        providing a custom principal in Cloudera Manager. 

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > HDFS service > Configuration and search
                    for the Kerberos Principal by entering "kerberos" in the search field.

Enter the custom Kerberos principal in the Kerberos
                        Principal field.

This Kerberos principal short name is used by all the roles of HDFS.


Click Save Changes and restart the HDFS service.
