Configuring custom Kerberos principal for HttpFS
To use custom Kerberos principal for HttpFS:

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > HDFS service > Configuration and search
                    for Kerberos Principal.

Enter the custom Kerberos principal in the Role-Specific Kerberos
                        Principal field (for the HttpFs Default Group).

Click Save Changes and restart the HttpFS service.
