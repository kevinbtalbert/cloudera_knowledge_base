Configuring custom Kerberos principal for Hue
The Kerberos principal for Hue is configured by default to use the same service
        principal as the default process user. However, you can change the default setting by
        providing a custom principal in Cloudera Manager.

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.
importantCurrently the
                names of system users which are impersonating users with Solr should match with the
                names of their respective Kerberos principals. If changing both the user name and
                the principal is not possible, you must add the user name you want to associate with
                the custom Kerberos principal to Solr configuration via the Solr Service
                    Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                environment variable in Cloudera Manager.


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration and search for "Kerberos".

Enter the custom Kerberos principal in the Kerberos
                        Principal field.
This Kerberos principal short name is used by all roles associated with this
                    service.
If you have secured your cluster using Knox, and if Knox uses custom Kerberos
                    principal, then you must set the following configuration in the Hue
                        Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        hue_safety_valve.ini
                    field:[desktop]
[[knox]]
knox_principal=[***KERBEROS-PRINCIPAL-SHORT-NAME***]
# example: knox_principal=knoxfoo0

Click Save Changes and restart the Hue service.
