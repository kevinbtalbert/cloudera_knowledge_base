Configuring custom Kerberos principal for Kudu
You can configure a custom Kerberos principal for Kudu using Cloudera
        Manager.

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Kudu >  Configuration.

Search for kerberos.

Find the Kerberos principal property and set it to the
                    required name.

Click Save changes.
Custom Kerberos principal for Kudu is applied for not just the Kudu
                    server but also for the Hive and Impala clients.
Optional: 
For components that are not controlled by Cloudera Manager, configure the SASL
                    protocol name. 
You must add the SASL protocol name configuration wherever the Kudu client
                    properties, such as master addresses, are configured.For example, if the
                        principal name is kudu/_HOST set the protocol to
                            kudu.
