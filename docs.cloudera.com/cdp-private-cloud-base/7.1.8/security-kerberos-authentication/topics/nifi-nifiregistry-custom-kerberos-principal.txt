Configuring custom Kerberos principal for NiFi and NiFi Registry
The Kerberos principal for NiFi and NiFi Registry is configured by default to use the
        same service principal as the default process user. However, you can change the default
        setting by providing a custom principal in Cloudera Manager. 

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.


Go to your Cluster in Cloudera Manager.

Select NiFi or NiFi Registry from
                    the list of services.

Select Configuration tab.

Search for the Kerberos principal by entering
                        kerberos in the search field.

Provide a custom name to the Kerberos Principal
                    property.

Click Save Changes.

Click on Actions > Restart next to the NiFi or NiFi
                    Registry service name to restart the service
