Configuring custom Kerberos principal for Omid
Use the steps given here to configure a custom Kerberos principal for Omid. 

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.


Start the HBase shell as the HBase superuser. See Use the HBase
                        shell for information on starting the HBase shell.

Grant rwx (read, write, execute) permissions to the new custom principal linked
                    to the Omid tables:


grant 'NEW_OMID_PRINCIPAL','RWX','OMID_COMMIT_TABLE';
grant 'NEW_OMID_PRINCIPAL','RWX','OMID_TIMESTAMP_TABLE';



Log in to Cloudera Manager as an
                        Administrator.

In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters >
                        Omid.

Go to the Configuration tab.

Search for the Kerberos Principal by entering "kerberos" in the search
                    field.

For Kerberos Principal, enter the required custom
                    principal value.

Click Save Changes.

Click Actions and select Restart
                    to restart the service.
