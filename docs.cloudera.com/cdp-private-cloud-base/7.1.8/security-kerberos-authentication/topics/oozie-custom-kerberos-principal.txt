Configuring custom Kerberos principal for Oozie
The Kerberos principal for Ozone is configured by default to use the same service
        principal as the default process user. However, you can change the default setting by
        providing a custom principal in Cloudera Manager. 

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.


In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > Oozie.

Go to the Configuration tab

Search for the Kerberos Principal by entering "kerberos" in the search
                    field.

For Kerberos Principal, enter your custom principal
                    value.

Click Save Changes.

Click Actions and select Restart
                    to restart the service.
