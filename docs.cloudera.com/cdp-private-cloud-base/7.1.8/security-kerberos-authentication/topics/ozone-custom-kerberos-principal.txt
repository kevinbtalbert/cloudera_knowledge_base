Configuring custom Kerberos principal for Ozone
The Kerberos principal for Ozone is configured by default to use the same service
        principal as the default process user. However, you can change the default setting by
        providing a custom principal in Cloudera Manager. 

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.
noteHowever, when you change the principal name of Ozone Manager
                and the Ranger plugin is enabled, you must ensure that you update the required
                safety valve in Ranger as well to notify the Ranger plugin about the Ozone Manager
                principal change. Otherwise, Ozone Manager cannot communicate with the Ranger plugin
                and all authorization requests fail.


Go to the Cloudera Manager > Ozone service > Configuration tab.

Search for Kerberos principal.

Enter the custom Kerberos principals for the various Ozone roles.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Ozone service.

Login to the Cloudera Manager > Ranger service > Ranger Web UI page using administrator credentials.

Edit cm_ozone to add or update the following key-value
                    configuration parameters:


tag.download.auth.users =
                                [***custom_ozone_manager_role_principal***]
policy.download.auth.users =
                                [***custom_ozone_manager_role_principal***]

tipIt is recommended that you configure the
                            conf/ranger-admin-site.xml_role_safety_valve
                        property with
                                ranger.plugins.ozone.serviceuser=[***custom_ozone_manager_role_principal***]
                        when you set up a cluster using a template. For example, if the
                            kerberos principal name of Ozone Manager is updated to
                                ozone-om, then configure the
                                conf/ranger-admin-site.xml_role_safety_valve
                            property in Ranger to
                                ranger.plugins.ozone.serviceuser=ozone-om.
