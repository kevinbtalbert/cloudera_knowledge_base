Configuring custom Kerberos principal for Phoenix
Use the steps given here to configure a custom Kerberos principal for
        Phoenix.

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.
To configure a custom Kerberos principal for Phoenix:


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an
                        Administrator.

In Cloudera Manager, go to Clusters >
                        Phoenix.

Go to the Configuration tab.

Search for the Kerberos Principal by entering "kerberos" in the search
                    field.

For Kerberos Principal, enter the required custom
                    principal value.

Click Save Changes.

In Cloudera Manager, go to Clusters >
                        HDFS.

Go to the Configuration tab.

Locate the Cluster-wide Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                        Valve) for core-site.xml property or search for it by typing its
                    name in the Search box.

Click View as XML, and add the following
                    properties:


<property>
    <name>hadoop.proxyuser.NEW_PHOENIX_PRINCIPAL.hosts</name>
    <value>*</value>
</property>
<property>
    <name>hadoop.proxyuser.NEW_PHOENIX_PRINCIPAL.groups</name>
    <value>*</value>
</property>


where the NEW_PHOENIX_PRINICIPAL is the custom principal name.

Enter a Reason for change, and then click
                        Save Changes to commit the changes.

Restart all stale services.
