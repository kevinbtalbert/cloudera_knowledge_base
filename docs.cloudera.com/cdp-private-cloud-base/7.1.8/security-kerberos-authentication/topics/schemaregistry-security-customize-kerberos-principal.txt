Configuring custom Kerberos principal for Schema Registry
The Kerberos principal for Schema Registry is configured by default to use the same
        service principal as the default process user. However, you can change the default setting
        by providing a custom principal in Cloudera Manager. 

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.


Go to your cluster in Cloudera Manager.

Select Schema Registry from the list of services.

Select the Configuration tab.

Search for the Kerberos Principal by entering kerberos in the
                    search field.

Enter a custom name in the Kerberos Principal field.

Click Save changes.

Click Action > Restart next to the Schema Registry service name to restart the
                    service.
