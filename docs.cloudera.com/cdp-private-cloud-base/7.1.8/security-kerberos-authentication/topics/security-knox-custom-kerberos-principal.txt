Configuring custom Kerberos principal for Knox
Use the steps given here to configure a custom Kerberos principal for
        Knox.

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.
To configure custom Kerberos principal for Knox:


In Cloudera Manager, go to Knox > Configuration.

Search for the Kerberos Principal by entering "kerberos" in the search
                    field

Find the Kerberos Principal property and enter the
                    custom Kerberos principal name.

Click Save Changes.

Click Actions > Restart.
