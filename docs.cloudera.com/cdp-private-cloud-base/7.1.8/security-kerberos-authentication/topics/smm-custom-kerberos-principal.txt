Configuring custom Kerberos principal for Streams Messaging Manager
In a Kerberos-enabled cluster, Streams Messaging Manager uses the
            streamsmsgmgr Kerberos principal to connect to Kafka and Schema Registry.
        The principal can be customized in Cloudera Manager with the Kerberos
            Principal property.

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.


In Cloudera Manager, go to Streams Messaging Manager > Configuration.

Find the Kerberos Principal property and enter your
                    principal.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the service.

If you use Ranger for authorization, update all
            resource-based services and policies that use the old principal and add the new
            principal. For more information on updating resource-based services and policies, see
                Using Ranger to Provide Authorization in CDP.
