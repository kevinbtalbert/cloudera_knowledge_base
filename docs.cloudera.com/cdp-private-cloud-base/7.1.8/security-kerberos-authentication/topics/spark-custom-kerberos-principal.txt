Configuring custom Kerberos principal for Spark
The Kerberos principal for Apache Spark is configured by default to use the same
        service principal as the default process user. However, you can change the default setting
        by providing a custom principal in Cloudera Manager.

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.


Go to your Cluster in Cloudera Manager.

Select Spark from the list of services.

Go to the Configuration tab.

Search for the Kerberos principal by entering "kerberos" in the search
                    field.

Provide a custom name to the Kerberos Principal
                    property.

Click Save Changes.

Click Actions > Restart next to the Spark service name
                    to restart the service.
