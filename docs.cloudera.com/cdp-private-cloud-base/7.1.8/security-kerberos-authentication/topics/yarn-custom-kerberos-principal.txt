Enabling custom Kerberos principal support in YARN
By default Cloudera Manager sets the Kerberos principal in YARN to yarn. This value
        can be easily changed using Cloudera Manager.


importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.



Disable the ZooKeeper ACL check temporarily.


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to ZooKeeper >  Configuration.


Find the Java Configuration Options for ZooKeeper
                                Server property.


Add the following value: 

-Dzookeeper.skipACL=yes



Click Save Changes.


Restart the ZooKeeper service.



In Cloudera Manager, navigate to YARN >  Configuration.

Find the Kerberos principal property and set it to the
                    required name.

Click Save Changes.

Find the Admin ACL property and ensure that it contains
                    either the ${yarn_user} placeholder or the updated principal
                    name value.

Ensure that YARN HDFS folders have the correct access rights and owners.
For example, if you use the Capacity Scheduler Node labels feature, the
                        yarn.node-labels.fs-store.root-dir folder could be
                    inaccessible by YARN with the new Kerberos principal name. To resolve this
                    issue, make it accessible or use the hdfs chown command. The
                    following is the minimum list of folder paths for which ownership needs to be
                    changed if Capacity Scheduler Node labels are enabled:
/yarn/node-labels
/user/yarn/mapreduce/mr-framework
/user/yarn/services/service-framework/*
/tmp/logs


Restart all services with stale configuration.


Click Stale configuration: Restart needed.


Ensure that Deploy client configuration is
                            selected.


Click Restart.



Select the YARN service.

Click Actions >  Reset ACLs on ZooKeeper nodes.
This step can take a long time if a lot of application data is stored in
                        ZooKeeper.



Enable the ZooKeeper ACL check.


Navigate to ZooKeeper >  Configuration.


Find Jave Configuration Options for ZooKeeper
                                Server.


Remove the -Dzookeeper.skipACL=yes value.


Click Save Changes.


Restart the ZooKeeper service.
