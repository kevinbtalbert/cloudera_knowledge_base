Enabling custom Kerberos principal support in a Queue Manager cluster
In a secure Queue Manager cluster you can enable custom Kerberos principal using
        Cloudera Manager. 

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.


Ensure your Queue Manager cluster is secure. For that check if it runs on port
                7183.


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to YARN >  Configuration.

Search for admin acl.

Find the Admin ACL (yarn_admin_acls)
                    property.

Add the user you want to use for the Kerberos principal to the list of
                        Admin ACL property.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the YARN service to avoid staleness.

Navigate to Queue Manager >  Configuration.

Search for kerberos principal.

Find the Kerberos Principal
                        (kerberos_princ_name) property.

Add the same user you added to the Admin ACL
                    property.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the YARN Queue Manager service to avoid staleness.

If you get the
                Exception: Only admins can carry out this operation
            error message while doing Queue Manager operations, ensure that the principal name is
            added to the YARN Admin ACL list.
