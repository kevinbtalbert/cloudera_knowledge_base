Back up Key Trustee Server clients
Cryptographic keys stored in Key Trustee Server are encrypted by clients before they
        are sent to Key Trustee Server. The primary client for Key Trustee Server is Navigator
        Encrypt. Cloudera strongly recommends backing up regularly the configuration files and GPG
        keys for Key Trustee Server clients. 


warningFailure to back up these files can result in irretrievable data
                    loss. For example, encryption zone keys used for HDFS Transparent Encryption are
                    encrypted by the KMS before being stored in Key Trustee Server. A catastrophic
                    failure of the KMS with no backup causes all HDFS data stored in encryption
                    zones to become permanently irretrievable.



To prevent permanent data loss, regularly back up the following directories on
                    each client that stores objects in Key Trustee Server:
