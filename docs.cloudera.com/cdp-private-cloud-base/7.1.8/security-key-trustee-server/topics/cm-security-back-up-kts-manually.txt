Back up Key Trustee Server manually
If you do not wish to back up KTS using Cloudera Manager or the backup script, you
        can use this procedure for both parcel-based and package-based installations.
The following procedure references the default database
            port and location; if you modified these settings during installation, replace the
            database and port with your values.

Back up the Key Trustee Server database:

For Key Trustee Server 3.8:
                        su - postgres
pg_dump -c -p 5432 keytrustee | zip --encrypt keytrustee-db.zip -
For Key Trustee Server 5.4 and higher:
                        su - keytrustee
pg_dump -c -p 11381 keytrustee | zip --encrypt keytrustee-db.zip -


The --encrypt option prompts you to create a password used
                        to encrypt the zip file. This password is required to decrypt the file.
For parcel-based installations, you must set environment variables after
                        switching to the keytrustee
                        user:su - keytrustee
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE_SERVER/PG_DB/opt/postgres/9.3/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE_SERVER/PG_DB/opt/postgres/9.3/lib
pg_dump -c -p 11381 keytrustee | zip --encrypt keytrustee-db.zip -


Back up the Key Trustee Server configuration directory
                        (/var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee): zip -r --encrypt
                            keytrustee-conf.zip
                        /var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee

The --encrypt option prompts you to create a password used
                        to encrypt the zip file. This password is required to decrypt the file.


Move the backup files (keytrustee-db.zip and
                        keytrustee-conf.zip) to a secure location.
