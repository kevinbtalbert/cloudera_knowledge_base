Back up Key Trustee Server using Cloudera Manager
Cloudera Manager versions 5.8 and higher, when used with Key Trustee Server versions
        5.7 and higher, allow for backups of the KT Server. 

The actions executed in this procedure are equivalent to running the
                    ktbackup.sh script on the node in question (see Back up Key
                    Trustee Server using the ktbackup.sh script for additional details).
In addition, when using the HDFS Encryption Wizard in Cloudera Manager 5.8 or higher
                to install and configure Key Trustee Server versions 5.7 and higher, a
                    cron job is automatically set up to back up the Key Trustee
                Server on an ongoing basis. See Initializing Standalone Key Trustee Server 
                for more detail.
To back up the KT Server service configuration using Cloudera Manager:


Select the KT Server service configuration that you want to back up.

For a KT Server backup, select Create Backup on Active Server (or Create Backup
                    on Passive Server) from the Actions menu. 

A successfully completed backup of the KT Server is
            indicated by the message “Command Create Backup on Active Server finished successfully
            on service keytrustee_server”.
