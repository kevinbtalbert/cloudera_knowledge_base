Back up Key Trustee Server using the ktbackup.sh script
Key Trustee Server releases 5.7 and higher include a script, ktbackup.sh, to simplify
        and automate backing up Key Trustee Server. 
When run on a Key Trustee Server host, the script creates a tarball containing the
                Key Trustee Server private GPG keys and the PostgreSQL database. 
To preserve the security of the backup, you must specify a GPG recipient. Because
                this recipient is the only entity that can decrypt the backup, the recipient must be
                someone authorized to access the Key Trustee Server database, such as a key
                administrator.

Creating and Importing a GPG Key for Encrypting and Decrypting Backups
If the key administrator responsible for backing up and restoring Key Trustee Server
                does not already have a GPG key pair, they can create one using the gpg
                    --gen-key command. The following example demonstrates this
                procedure:
noteBy default, gpg --gen-key fails at the password prompt if you
                have logged in to your user account with the su command. You must
                log in to the SSH session with the user account for which you want to generate the
                GPG key pair.
[john.doe@backup-host ~]$ gpg --gen-key

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

After the GPG key pair is generated, you can export the public key:
[john.doe@backup-host ~]$ gpg --armor --output /path/to/johndoe.pub --export 'John Doe'
Copy the public key (johndoe.pub in this example) to the Key Trustee
                Server host, and import it into the service account keyring
                    (keytrustee for Key Trustee Server):

On the Key Trustee Server
                    host:sudo -u keytrustee gpg --import /path/to/johndoe.pub


Running the ktbackup.sh Script
You must run ktbackup.sh as the service account. The location of the
                script depends on the service and installation method. See the following table for
                the script location and default service account for package- and parcel-based
                installations for Key Trustee Server.

The following table lists the command options for ktbackup.sh.
Table 2. Command Options for ktbackup.sh

Command Option
Description



-c, --confdir=CONFDIR
Specifies the Key Trustee configuration directory. Defaults to
                                    /var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee for
                                parcel-based Key Trustee Server. For package-based Key Trustee
                                Server, you must specify this option.


--database-port=PORT
Specifies the Key Trustee Server database port. Defaults to
                                    11381 for parcel-based installations. For
                                package-based Key Trustee Server installations, you must specify
                                this option.


--gpg-recipient=GPG_RECIPIENT
Specifies the GPG recipient. The backup is encrypted with the
                                public key of the specified recipient. The GPG recipient public key
                                must be imported into the service account keyring before running the
                                script. 


--cleartext
Outputs an unencrypted tarball. To preserve the security of the
                                cryptographic keys, do not use this option in production
                                environments.


--output=DIR
Specifies the output directory for the tarball. Defaults to
                                    /var/lib/keytrustee for parcel-based Key
                                Trustee Server. For package-based Key Trustee Server, you must
                                specify this option.


--roll=n
Deletes backups older than the last n backups
                                from the directory specified by the --output
                                parameter. For example, if you have 10 backups, specifying
                                    --roll=10 creates a new backup (11 backups
                                total) and then delete the oldest backup. Specifying
                                    --roll=1 creates a new backup and then deletes
                                all other backups.


-q, --quiet
Suppresses console log messages and, if successful, returns only
                                the backup tarball file path. This is useful for automating
                                backups.


--verbose
Outputs additional log messages to the console for
                                debugging.


The following examples demonstrate the command usage for different scenarios:

To back up a parcel-based Key Trustee Server, specifying the GPG recipient by
                    name:$ sudo -u keytrustee /opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE_SERVER/bin/ktbackup.sh --gpg-recipient='John Doe'
To back up a package-based Key Trustee Server with the database running on a
                    non-default port (12345 in this
                    example):$ sudo -u keytrustee ktbackup.sh --database-port=12345 --gpg-recipient=john.doe@example.com


Automating Backups Using cron
You can schedule automatic backups of Key Trustee Server using the
                    cron scheduling utility.
Create a crontab entry using the following commands:

Edit the crontab by running the following
                    command:sudo -u keytrustee crontab -e
Add the following entry to run the backup script every 30 minutes. This example
                    is for a parcel-based installation of Key Trustee Server. See the Backup
                        Script Locations table for the package-based script
                        location.*/30 * * * * /opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE_SERVER/bin/ktbackup.sh --gpg-recipient='John Doe' --quiet --output=/tmp/backups --roll=10Run
                            man 5 crontab to see the crontab man
                        page for details on using cron to schedule backups at
                        different intervals.
