Generating a New Certificate
Generating a new certificate for Key Trustee Server. 

Generate a new certificate signing request (CSR):

openssl req -new -key keytrustee_private_key.pem -out new.csr
Replace keytrustee_private_key.pem with the filename of
                        the private key. You can reuse the existing private key or generate a new
                        private key in accordance with your company policies. For existing
                        auto-generated self-signed certificates, the private key file is located at
                            /var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee/.ssl/ssl-cert-keytrustee-pk.pem.


Generate a new certificate from the CSR:


 For a CA-signed certificate, submit the CSR to the CA, and they will
                            provide a signed certificate.
To generate a new self-signed certificate, run the following
                            command:$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in new.csr -signkey keytrustee_private_key.pem \
-out new_keytrustee_certificate.pem
