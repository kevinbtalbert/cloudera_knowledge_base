Initializing Standalone Key Trustee Server Using Cloudera Manager
How to initialize your standalone Key Trustee Server using Cloudera Manager. 

importantIf you are using SSH software other than OpenSSH, the initialization
        fails. To prevent this, pre-create the SSH key before
        continuing:sudo -u keytrustee ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /var/lib/keytrustee/.ssh/id_rsa


For new installations, use the Set up HDFS Data At Rest Encryption
      wizard and follow the instructions in Enabling HDFS Encryption Using the Wizard. When
      prompted, deselect the Enable High Availability option to proceed in
      standalone mode.
importantYou must assign the Key Trustee Server and Database roles to the
      same host. Key Trustee Server does not support running the database on a different
      host.
For parcel-based Key Trustee Server releases 5.8 and higher, Cloudera
      Manager automatically backs up Key Trustee Server (using the ktbackup.sh
      script) after adding the Key Trustee Server service. It also schedules automatic backups using
        cron. For package-based installations, you must manually back up Key
      Trustee Server and configure a cron job.
Cloudera Manager configures cron to run the backup script
      hourly. The latest 10 backups are retained in /var/lib/keytrustee in
      cleartext. For information about using the backup script and configuring the
        cron job (including how to encrypt backups), see Backing up Key Trustee
        Server and clients.
