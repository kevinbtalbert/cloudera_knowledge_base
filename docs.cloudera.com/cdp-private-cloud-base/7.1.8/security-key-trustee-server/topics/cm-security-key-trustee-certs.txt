Managing Key Trustee Server Certificates
Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates are used to secure communication with Key
    Trustee Server. By default, Key Trustee Server generates self-signed certificates when it is
    first initialized. Cloudera strongly recommends using certificates signed by a trusted
    Certificate Authority (CA).

Replacing Key Trustee Server CertificatesUse the following procedure if you need to replace an existing certificate for the         Key Trustee Server. For example, you can use this procedure to replace the auto-generated         self-signed certificate with a CA-signed certificate, or to replace an expired         certificate.
