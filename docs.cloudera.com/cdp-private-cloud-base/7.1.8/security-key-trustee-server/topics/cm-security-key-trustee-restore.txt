Restoring Navigator Key Trustee Server
If a Key Trustee Server fails catastrophically, you must restore it from backup to a
        new host with the same hostname and IP address as the failed host. 
When restoring the Key Trustee Server database from backup, keep in mind that any keys or
            deposits created after the backup are not restored.
            
The procedure to restore Key Trustee Server is different for parcel-based than for
            package-based installations. For more information about parcels, see Overview of
                Parcels.
