Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server
Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server is an enterprise-grade cryptographic key storage
    and management system that can be used by cluster components. 


importantEach cluster must use its own KTS instance. Sharing a single KTS across
      clusters is neither approved nor supported for security reasonsâ€”specifically, the increased
      security risks associated with single point of failure for encryption keys used by multiple
      clusters.
