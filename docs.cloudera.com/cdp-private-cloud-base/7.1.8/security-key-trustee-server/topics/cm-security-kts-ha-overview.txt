Setting Up Key Trustee Server High Availability
Key Trustee Server high availability applies to read operations only. If either Key
  Trustee Server fails, the KeyProvider automatically retries fetching keys from the functioning
  server. New write operations (for example, creating new encryption keys) are not allowed unless
  both Key Trustee Servers are operational.
If a Key Trustee Server fails, the following operations are impacted:

HDFS Encryption
You cannot create new encryption keys for encryption zones.
You can write to and read from existing encryption zones, but you cannot create new
      zones.

Cloudera Navigator Encrypt
You cannot register new Cloudera Navigator Encrypt clients.
You can continue reading and writing encrypted data, including creating new mount points,
      using existing clients.


Cloudera recommends monitoring both Key Trustee Servers. If a Key Trustee Server fails
   catastrophically, restore it from backup to a new host with the same hostname and IP address as
   the failed host. Cloudera does not support PostgreSQL promotion to convert a passive Key Trustee
   Server to an active Key Trustee Server.
Depending on your cluster configuration and the security practices in your organization, you
   might need to restrict the allowed versions of TLS/SSL used by Key Trustee Server.

Configuring Key Trustee Server High Availability Using Cloudera ManagerRecovering a Key Trustee ServerIf a Key Trustee Server fails, restore it from backup as soon as possible. If the Key   Trustee Server hosts fails completely, make sure that you restore the Key Trustee Server to a new   host with the same hostname and IP address as the failed host.
