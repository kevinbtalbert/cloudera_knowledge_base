Recovering a Key Trustee Server
If a Key Trustee Server fails, restore it from backup as soon as possible. If the Key
  Trustee Server hosts fails completely, make sure that you restore the Key Trustee Server to a new
  host with the same hostname and IP address as the failed host.
For more information, see Backing up Key Trustee Server and clients and Restoring
    Navigator Key Trustee Server.
