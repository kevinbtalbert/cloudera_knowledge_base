Restore Key Trustee Server in parcel-based installations
How to restore a parcel-deployed Key Trustee Server database from a
        backup.

These instructions apply to Key Trustee Servers deployed using parcels. For
                package-based deployments, see Restore Key Trustee Server in package-based
                    installations for more information.
The following procedures assume the default database port and location; if you
                modified these settings during installation, replace the database and port with your
                custom values.
If the Key Trustee Server host has failed completely, remove the host from the
                cluster and add a new host using Cloudera Manager:


 Remove the failed host from the cluster. See Deleting Hosts for
                    instructions.

Add a new host with the same hostname and IP address as the failed host to the
                    cluster. See Adding a Host to a Cluster for instructions.

importantMake sure that the replacement host uses the same
                        operating system version as the failed host.


Install Key Trustee Server on the new host. Be sure to install the same Key
                    Trustee Server version as the failed host.

After you have provisioned a new host and installed Key Trustee Server (or if
                    you are restoring the database or configuration on the original host), restore
                    the database and configuration directory.
                    
Backups created using...
ktbackup.sh script
See Restore Key Trustee Server from ktbackup.sh
                            backups

pg_dump command
Continue below


If your backups were created manually using the pg_dump
                    command, do the following:


Copy or move the backup files (keytrustee-db.zip and
                                keytrustee-conf.zip) to the Key Trustee Server
                            host.


Start the PostgreSQL server: 

sudo ktadmin db --start --pg-rootdir /var/lib/keytrustee/db --background



Restore the Key Trustee Server database:

su - keytrustee
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE_SERVER/PG_DB/opt/postgres/12.1/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE_SERVER/PG_DB/opt/postgres/12.1/lib
unzip -p /path/to/keytrustee-db.zip | psql -p 11381 -d keytrustee
If the zip file is encrypted, you are prompted for the password to
                                decrypt the file.



Restore the Key Trustee Server configuration directory:

su - keytrustee
cd /var/lib/keytrustee
unzip /path/to/keytrustee-conf.zip
If the zip file is encrypted, you are prompted for the password to
                                decrypt the file.



Stop the PostgreSQL server:

sudo ktadmin db --stop --pg-rootdir /var/lib/keytrustee/db



Start the Key Trustee Server service in Cloudera Manager (Key Trustee Server service > Actions > Start).


Remove the backup files (keytrustee-db.zip and
                                keytrustee-conf.zip) from the Key Trustee Server
                            host.
