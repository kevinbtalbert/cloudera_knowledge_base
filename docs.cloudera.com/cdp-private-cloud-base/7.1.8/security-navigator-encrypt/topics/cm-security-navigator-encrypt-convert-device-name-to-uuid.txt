Converting from Device Names to UUIDs for Encrypted DevicesCloudera Docs
Converting from Device Names to UUIDs for Encrypted Devices

When configuring a Navigator Encrypt mount point, you can use either the device
      name (sample device name: /dev/sdb1) or the UUID (sample
      UUID: 3a602a15-11f7-46ac-ae98-0a51e1b25cf9) to
      configure the mount point. For more information, see Navigator Encrypt and Device UUIDs.
The UUID mount point configuration choice is preferable for Navigator
      Encrypt, because the device name can change when the system is rebooted or
      new  disks are added, but the UUID never changes. You can only use the
      UUID (--use-uuid) configuration option during the
      initial mount point configuration. You cannot use the UUID mount point
      configuration option on existing mount points that were created in Navigator
      Encrypt 3.12.0 or earlier, or that were configured to use the
      device name instead of the UUID. 
For configurations where a device name was used, and you wish to convert to
      a UUID, you have the option to use the UUID conversion utility
      (navencrypt-prepare --convert-uuid), which converts existing
      mount points from using the device name to using the UUID. The UUID conversion
      utility updates the Navigator Encrypt configuration files to use UUIDs, and
      then reloads the updated mount points. You can perform this conversion on
      mount points with encrypted data without any impact on that data.
      importantCloudera strongly recommends that Navigator Encrypt
        mount points that are currently using the device name be converted to use
        the device UUID. This will prevent error situations when the Navigator
        Encrypt mount points cannot be mounted, and the encrypted data cannot be
        accessed because the device name changed.



Preparing for UUID Conversion

The UUID conversion utility runs as part of the
          navencrypt-prepare command:
        # navencrypt-prepare -h
...
--convert-uuid --all|--device=DEVICE
    Converts devices that are stored using the device name to instead use its uuid.
    '--all' will attempt to convert all device names in the navencrypt ztab file.
    '--device=DEVICE' will convert a single device.
...
As shown, you have two options when running the UUID conversion utility:
--device=DEVICEUse this option to run the conversion
              against a single specified device.
--allUse this option to run the conversion against all
              mount points that are currently using the device name instead of
              the UUID as defined in the /etc/navencrypt/ztab
              file.

The conversion utility first backs up all files in
          /etc/navencrypt to a timestamped directory under
          /tmp. Ensure that the user running the
          navencrypt-prepare operation has permission to write
        to /tmp. If this backup directory is not created, then
        the conversion script will exit without making any changes to the
        Navigator Encrypt configuration files.noteBecause the conversion
          utility backs up the Navigator Encrypt configuration files, it is not
          necessary to back up the files separately. However, if you want the
          files backed up elsewhere (somewhere other than the
            /tmp folder), then manually perform this backup by
          copying the /etc/navencrypt directory to the desired
          location before running the conversion utility. Note that the
          conversion utility will still attempt to create its own backup under
            /tmp, and will not run if this backup cannot be
          created.



Converting a Single Device

Use the UUID conversion utility --device=DEVICE
        option  to convert from a device name to UUID for a mount point on a
        single  device. It is recommended that you test the conversion against
        at least one device before running it  against all devices:
# navencrypt-prepare --convert-uuid --device=/dev/xvdd 
Backing up /etc/navencrypt to /tmp/navencrypt_bkup_20180917_135716 ... 
Stopping navencrypt-mount... 
Stopping navencrypt directories

Umounting /dev/xvdd ... [ OK ]
Umounting /dev/xvde ... [ OK ]
Umounting /dev/xvdf ... [ OK ]
* Unloading module ... [ OK ] 
Running conversion on /dev/xvdd
... ..
You must approve and finalize the conversion before it is complete.



Converting All Available Devices

Use the UUID conversion utility --all option to
        convert from the device name to the device UUID on all available
        devices. The conversion utility skips loop devices because they do not 
        have a dedicated UUID:
# navencrypt-prepare --convert-uuid --all 
Backing up /etc/navencrypt to /tmp/navencrypt_bkup_20180917_135731 ...

* Umounting /dev/xvdf ...                                 [  OK  ]
* Unloading module ...                                    [  OK  ]

You must approve and  finalize the conversion before it is
        complete.



Finalizing the Conversion

Before the device name-to-UUID conversion is applied to the 
        configuration files, you must review and approve the differences between
        the  /etc/navencrypt/ztab and 
        /etc/navencrypt/control by either  accepting the
        changes ("y"), or rejecting them ("n").

Rolling Back the UUID Conversion

If you experience any problems with the device name-to-UUID conversion,
        you can restore the previous mount point state by replacing the contents
        of the /etc/navencrypt/directory with the backup
        created by the conversion
        utility:# service navencrypt-mount stop
# rm /etc/navencrypt/keytrustee/deposits/dev.disk.by-uuid.*
# cp -rp /tmp/navencrypt_bkup_date_time/* /etc/navencrypt/
# service navencrypt-mount start
