Manually Backing Up Navigator Encrypt

It is recommended that you back up Navigator Encrypt configuration
        directory after installation, and again after any configuration
        updates.


To manually back up the Navigator Encrypt configuration directory
              (/etc/navencrypt):
              zip -r --encrypt nav-encrypt-conf.zip /etc/navencryptThe
                --encrypt option prompts you to create a
              password used to encrypt the zip file. This password is also
              required to decrypt the file. Ensure that you protect the password
              by storing it in a secure location.
Move the backup file (nav-encrypt-conf.zip) to
            a secure location.


warningFailure to back up the configuration directory makes
        your backed-up encrypted data unrecoverable in the event of data
        loss.



Validating Navigator Encrypt Configuration

To validate the Navigator Encrypt deployment, run the following
        command:
sudo navencrypt status --integrity
This command verifies that:

The mount encryption key (MEK) exists for each mount point.
Each mount point in /etc/navencrypt/ztab has a
          corresponding entry in the control file
            (/etc/navencrypt/control).
Each mount point directory exists.
For loop devices, the file used for encrypted storage
          exists.

The output is similar to the following:
$ sudo navencrypt status --integrity
Checking MEKs integrity

        Mountpoint: /dev/loop0
                MEK file exist: ......................   [YES]
        Mountpoint: /dev/loop1
                MEK file exist: ......................   [YES]

Checking Ztab Mountpoints integrity

         Mountpoint: /dev/loop0
                 ztab vs control correspondence: .....   [YES]
                 Mountpoint directory exists: ........   [YES]
         Mountpoint: /dev/loop1
                 ztab vs control correspondence: .....   [YES]
                 Mountpoint directory exists: ........   [YES]

Checking Datastore backend files

         Datastore: '/root/my_storage_test'
                 Backend file exist: .................   [YES]



Restoring Mount Encryption Keys (MEKs) and Control File

Navigator Encrypt deposits its mount encryption keys (MEKs) and control
        file (/etc/navencrypt/control) in Cloudera Navigator
        Key Trustee Server. If these files are accidentally deleted, they can be
        restored from Key Trustee Server using the following commands:

To restore
          MEKs:sudo navencrypt key --restore-keys
To restore the control
          file:sudo navencrypt control --restore-control-file




Access Modes

Navigator Encrypt provides three different access modes:
Enforcing is the default mode in which Navigator Encrypt
            validates access from all processes against the ACL. To protect your
            data, enforcing mode must be enabled.
Permissive mode causes action="denied"
            messages to be logged in dmesg. It does not 
            prevent access to the encrypted data. This mode is a dry-run feature
            to run and build ACL rules.
Admin mode, as well as permissive mode, does not
            prevent access to the encrypted data. It allows any process to
            access the information because the ACL rules are not validated
            against the process. Admin mode does not cause
              action="denied" messages to be logged in
              dmesg.

To view the current access mode, run the following
        command:sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt status -d
noteThe navencrypt status command reports that the
          navencrypt module is not running if no volumes are
        encrypted or the kernel module is not loaded.
To change the access mode, use the following
        command:sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt set --mode={enforcing|permissive|admin}
You cannot change the Navigator Encrypt access mode unless the
        Navigator Encrypt module is running. To view the status of the Navigator
        Encrypt module, run navencrypt status --module.
To start the Navigator Encrypt module there must be at least one active
        mount-point. To verify the mount-points status, run the following
        command:sudo /etc/init.d/navencrypt-mount status
For RHEL 7, use systemctl
        instead:sudo systemctl status navencrypt-mount



Changing and Verifying the Master Key

You can perform two operations with the navencrypt key
        command: change and verify.
You can verify a key against the Navigator Encrypt module, the
        Navigator Key Trustee server, or both. For
        example:sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt key --verify
sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt key --verify --only-module
sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt key --verify --only-keytrustee
noteThe navencrypt key command fails if no volumes are
        encrypted or the kernel module is not loaded.
The master key can be changed in the event that another key-type
        authentication mechanism or a new master key is required. Valid master
        key types are single-passphrase, dual-passphrase, and RSA key files. To
        change the master key type, issue the following command and follow the
        interactive
        console:sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt key –-change
You can use the --trustees, --votes,
        and --recoverable options for the new key as described
        in Table 1.



Listing Categories

To list the existing categories for each mount point, run the command
          navencrypt-move --list-categories. For
        example:$ sudo navencrypt-move --list-categories
Navigator Encrypt Categories found per Mountpoint:

  /dmcrypt-storage
     @mysql
     @keytabs

  /home/jdoe/secrets
     @moms_recipes
     @world_domination_plan




Updating ACL Fingerprints

All rules reference a process fingerprint (a SHA256 digest) that is used to authenticate
        the process into the file system. If the file system detects a fingerprint that is different
        from the one stored in the ACL, the Linux process is denied access and treated as an
        untrusted process.
Occasionally this process fingerprint must be updated, such as when
        software is upgraded. When the fingerprint must be updated, the
        Navigator Encrypt administrator re-authenticates the process on the ACL
        by executing the command navencrypt acl --update.
The following example demonstrates how to determine when a process
        fingerprint has been changed and must be
        updated:$ sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --list
Type MASTER passphrase:
# -  Type Category    Path         Profile  Process
1 !! ALLOW @mysql *            /usr/sbin/mysqld
2 ALLOW @log * /usr/sbin/mysqld
3 !! ALLOW @apache * /usr/lib/apache2/mpm-prefork/
In the example above, the double exclamation (!!)
        characters indicate that a process fingerprint has changed and must be
        updated. Similarly, double E (EE) characters indicate a
        process read error. This error can be caused by a process that does not
        exist or that has permission issues.
note
For RHEL-compatible OSes, the prelink application
          may also be responsible for ACL fingerprint issues. Prelinking is
          intended to speed up a system by reducing the time a program needs to
          begin. Cloudera highly recommends disabling any automated
            prelink jobs, which are enabled by default in some
          systems. As an alternative, Cloudera recommends that you integrate a
          manual prelink run into your existing change control
          policies to ensure minimal downtime for applications accessing
          encrypted data.
To disable prelinking, modify the
            /etc/sysconfig/prelink file and change
            PRELINKING=yes to PRELINKING=no.
          Then, run the /etc/cron.daily/prelink script as root.
          Once finished, automatic prelinking is disabled.
For more information about how prelinking affects your system, see
            prelink.




Managing Mount Points

The /etc/init.d/navencrypt-mount command mounts all
        mount points that were registered with the
          navencrypt-prepare command and are listed in the
          /etc/navencrypt/ztab file. The possible operations
          are:
start
stop
status
restart

For RHEL 7, use systemctl [start|stop|status|restart]
          navencrypt-mount.noteOn RHEL 7, the
            systemctl command can obscure the exit status of
          the start and/or stop commands
          because navencrypt-mount is loaded as a kernel module
          instead of running as a background process. Cloudera strongly
          recommends that you run systemctl status
            navencrypt-mount whenever you run the
            start and/or stop command to
          verify that the status of the navencrypt kernel
          module is still healthy and functioning.
noteDo not manually unmount the encryption mount
        point (for example, using umount). If you do so, you
        must manually close the dm-crypt device using the
        following procedure:
Run dmsetup table to list the
              dm-crypt devices.
Run cryptsetup luksClose
                <device_name> to close the device
            for the unmounted mount point.

When executing the stop operation, the encrypted mount
        point is unmounted, and your data becomes inaccessible.
The following example shows how to run navencrypt-mount
          status with some inactive mount
        points:sudo /etc/init.d/navencrypt-mount status
The following example shows how to run the navencrypt-mount
          stop
        command:sudo /etc/init.d/navencrypt-mount stop
The following example shows how to run the navencrypt-mount
          start
        command:sudo /etc/init.d/navencrypt-mount start
Here is an example command used to manually mount a
        directory:sudo /usr/sbin/mount.navencrypt /path/to_encrypted_data/ /path/to/mountpoint
This command can be executed only if the
          navencrypt-prepare command was previously
        executed.



Navigator Encrypt Kernel Module Setup

If the kernel headers were not installed on your host, or if the wrong
        version of the kernel headers were installed, the Navigator Encrypt
        module was not built at installation time. To avoid reinstalling the
        system, install the correct headers and run the
          navencrypt-module-setup command. This attempts to
        build the module and install it.
This method is also an efficient way to install any new Navigator
        Encrypt module feature or fix without otherwise modifying your current
        Navigator Encrypt environment.



Navigator Encrypt Configuration Directory Structure

The file and directory structure of /etc/navencrypt is
        as
        follows:$ tree /etc/navencrypt/
/etc/navencrypt/
├── control -> /etc/navencrypt/jSpi9SM65xUIIhrau1Nn8ZXmQhrrQ9e363EUz8HKiRs

The following files and folders are part of the created file
          structure:
controlFile that saves information about the
              mount points and corresponding Navigator Key Trustee keys. If this
              file is accidentally deleted, you can restore it using the navencrypt
                  control --restore-control-file
            command.
rulesFile that contains the ACL rules. It is
              encrypted with the user-provided master key.
ztabFile that contains information about all
              the mount points and their encryption type.importantUse caution when editing the
            /etc/navencrypt/ztab file. Entries are
          tab-separated (not space-separated). The ztab file
          must not contain empty lines.
keytrusteeDirectory where Navigator Key
              Trustee GPG keys are stored. These are generated during
                navencrypt register operations.
keytrustee/depositsDirectory where the Navigator Encrypt mount
              encryption keys (MEKs) are saved. These are encrypted with the user-provided master
              key. If these are accidentally deleted, you can restore them from Key Trustee Server
              using the navencrypt key
                  --restore-keys command.

Every mount point has an internal randomly-generated encryption
        passphrase.



Collecting Navigator Encrypt Environment Information

When troubleshooting problems with Navigator Encrypt, it is helpful to
        gather information about the installation and environment. Navigator
        Encrypt provides a command to facilitate this:
sudo navencrypt-collect
This command collects and outputs to the console the following
        information:

Information about the system on which Navigator Encrypt is
          installed
Entries from /etc/navencrypt/ztab
The contents of the keytrustee.conf file
Recent entries from the Navigator Encrypt log file
Configured software repositories
Checksums of all /usr/src/navencrypt* and
            /usr/sbin/navencrypt* files

You can use this information to compare Navigator Encrypt installations, and you can also
        provide this information to Cloudera Support for troubleshooting. The
          navencrypt-collect command only outputs this information on the console,
        and does not generate any files or upload to Cloudera.
To save the information to a file, use the redirect operator
          (>). For example:
sudo navencrypt-collect > navencrypt.info



Upgrading Navigator Encrypt Hosts

See "Best Practices for Upgrading Navigator Encrypt Hosts" in the Upgrading Cloudera
          Navigator Encrypt guide for information about upgrading operating systems (OS) and
        kernels on hosts that have Navigator Encrypt installed.
