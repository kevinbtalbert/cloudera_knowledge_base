Registering Cloudera Navigator Encrypt with Key Trustee Server

Prerequisites

Functioning Key Trustee Server
After installing Navigator Encrypt on a host, you must register the host with Key Trustee
          Server. If you have not yet installed Key Trustee Server, see Installing Ranger KMS backed with a Key Trustee Server and HA.

Key Trustee Server Organization
To register with Key Trustee Server, you must have an existing organization. See Managing Key Trustee Server Organizations for
          information about creating and viewing organizations in Key Trustee Server.

Master Password
The Master Key is the primary Navigator Encrypt administrator access code and is
          configured by the Navigator Encrypt administrator during installation. The Master Key can
          take any one of three different forms:
If you choose a passphrase (single), it must be between 15 and 32 characters
              long.
If you choose passphrase (dual), both must be between 15 and 32 characters
              long.
If you choose the RSA option, enter a path to the RSA key file, and if it has RSA
              passphrase, enter it for this private key.

warningIt is extremely important that you
          keep your master password secret and safe. In the event that you lose
          your master password, you will never be able to recover it,
          leaving your encrypted data irretrievably locked away.




Registering with Key Trustee Server

After installing Navigator Encrypt on a host, you must register the host with Key Trustee
        Server in order to encrypt and decrypt data. The following section lists the command options
        for registering your Navigator Encrypt client.
noteDo not run Navigator Encrypt commands with the
          screen utility.
If the TLS certificate is signed by an internal CA that is not publicly recognized, then
        you must add the root certificate to the host certificate truststore of each Navigator
        Encrypt client. 
Example
        command:sudo navencrypt register --server=https://keytrustee01.example.com:11371 --passive-server=https://keytrustee02.example.com:11371 --org=your_keytrustee_org --auth=org_auth_token
Table 1. Registration Options

Command Option
Explanation



--clientname=my_client_name
User-defined unique name for this client to be used for
                administration and reports. You can verify your client name in
                the /etc/navencrypt/keytrustee/clientname
                file.


--server=https://keytrustee01.example.com:11371
Target Active Key Trustee Server for key storage. Replace
                  keytrustee01.example.com:11371 with the
                hostname and port of the Active Key Trustee Server. The default
                port is 11371.


--passive-server=https://keytrustee02.example.com:11371
Target Passive Key Trustee Server for key storage. Replace
                  keytrustee02.example.com:11371 with the
                hostname and port of the Passive Key Trustee Server. The default
                port is 11371.


--org=your_keytrustee_org
Key Trustee organization name configured by the Key Trustee
                Server administrator


--auth=org_auth_token
Organization authorization token, a pre-shared secret by the Key Trustee Server
                administrator


--skip-ssl-check
Skip SSL certificate verification. Use with self-signed certificates on the Key
                Trustee Server


--trustee
Add trustees for retrieval of the master key


--votes
Configure voting policy for trustees


--recoverable
Master Key will be uploaded without encrypting it with your local GPG Key
                Trustee Server


--scheme
                "<scheme>"
Key Trustee Server scheme that Navigator Encrypt uses for
                public key operations. Specify "http" or
                  "https".


--port
Key Trustee Server port that Navigator Encrypt uses for
                public key operations.


Registering with Previous Versions of Key Trustee Server
By default, new installations of  Key Trustee Server use a single HTTPS port for key
          storage and public key operations. Previous versions and upgrades use separate ports for
          key storage and public key operations. For backward compatibility, Navigator Encrypt 3.7.0
          introduces the --scheme and --port parameters for the
            navencrypt register command.
For example, to register a version 3.7.0 Navigator Encrypt client with Key Trustee Server
          using HTTPS over port 443 for key storage and HTTP over port 80 for public key operations,
          run the following
          command:sudo navencrypt register --server=https://keytrustee.example.com:443 --org=key_trustee_org --auth=auth_token --scheme "http" --port 80
Navigator Encrypt versions lower than 3.7.0 do not support the
            --scheme and --port parameters.
          For these versions of Navigator Encrypt, you must ensure that the Key
          Trustee Server is configured to use port 443 (HTTPS) for key storage
          and port 80 (HTTP) for public key operations.
Navigator Encrypt versions lower than 3.8.0 do not support the
            --passive-server parameter.

Updating Key Trustee Server Ports
The navencrypt register command does not provide the
          ability to change the ports for existing registrations. If the Key
          Trustee Server ports are changed, you must update
            /etc/navencrypt/keytrustee/ztrustee.conf with the
          new port and scheme parameters (HKP_PORT and
            HKP_SCHEME, respectively).
For example, see the following ztrustee.conf excerpt
          from a registered client that has been upgraded to Navigator Encrypt
          3.7.0:{
        "LOCAL_FINGERPRINT":    "2048R/182AAA838DC300AC334258D8E7F299BFB68A6F6F",
        "REMOTES":      {
                "kts01.example.com": {
                        "REMOTE_FINGERPRINT":   "4096R/AF6400E12DC149799CA8CE6BF1604C34D830DE20",
                        "REMOTE_SERVER":        "https://kts01.example.com",
                        "DEFAULT":      true,
                        "SSL_INSECURE": false,
                        "PROTOCOL":     "json-encrypt"
                }
        }
}
In this example, the Key Trustee Server
            (keytrustee.example.com) is using the default
          configuration of port 443 (HTTPS) for key storage and port 80 (HTTP)
          for public key operations.
If the Key Trustee Server is then updated to use port 11371 (HTTPS)
          for both key storage and public key operations, you must update
            ztrustee.conf as follows (changes in
          bold):{
        "LOCAL_FINGERPRINT":    "2048R/182AAA838DC300AC334258D8E7F299BFB68A6F6F",
        "REMOTES":      {
                "kts01.example.com": {
                        "REMOTE_FINGERPRINT":   "4096R/AF6400E12DC149799CA8CE6BF1604C34D830DE20",
                        "REMOTE_SERVER":        "https://kts01.example.com:11371",
                        "HKP_PORT":     11371,
                        "HKP_SCHEME":   "https",
                        "DEFAULT":      true,
                        "SSL_INSECURE": false,
                        "PROTOCOL":     "json-encrypt"
                }
        }
}

Updating Navigator Encrypt for Highly Available Key Trustee Server
If you registered a Navigator Encrypt client with a highly available (HA) Key Trustee
          Server, you can edit /etc/navencrypt/keytrustee/ztrustee.conf to enable
          the client to take advantage of the high availability features. The following example
          shows the contents of ztrustee.conf after adding the required
            REMOTE_SERVERS entry (changes in bold):
{
        "LOCAL_FINGERPRINT":    "2048R/182AAA838DC300AC334258D8E7F299BFB68A6F6F",
        "REMOTES":      {
                "kts01.example.com": {
                        "REMOTE_FINGERPRINT":   "4096R/AF6400E12DC149799CA8CE6BF1604C34D830DE20",
                        "REMOTE_SERVER":        "https://kts01.example.com:11371",
                        "HKP_PORT":     11371,
                        "HKP_SCHEME":   "https",
                        "DEFAULT":      true,
                        "REMOTE_SERVERS":       ["https://kts01.example.com:11371", "https://kts02.example.com:11371"],
                        "SSL_INSECURE": true,
                        "PROTOCOL":     "json-encrypt"
                }
        }
}

Configuration Files
The installer creates the /etc/navencrypt directory. All configuration settings are saved in this directory. Do not delete any file from /etc/navencrypt. These files provide the necessary information for the Navigator Encrypt application to function properly.
warningPerform backups of encrypted data, mount-points,
          and Navigator Encrypt configuration directories on a regular basis. To
          do this, ensure you have a backup of /etc/navencrypt.
            Failure to backup this directory will make your backed up
            encrypted data unrecoverable in the event of data loss.

Change Master Key by UUID
It is possible to re-use a previously used Master Key by its UUID. For example, if you
          currently have a Master key with a single passphrase, you can see the corresponding Key
          Trustee Server UUID in the /etc/navencrypt/control
          file:$ cat /etc/navencrypt/control
{
	"app":	{
		"name":	"navencrypt",
		"version":	"3.5"
	},
	"keys":	{
		"master":	{
			"type":	"single-passphrase",
			"uuid":	"qMAKRMdk4HVbhfzR79cp9w92YBmNHJ5nSLhfd8ZVo6L"
		},
		"targets":	[]
	}
}
noteIf the control file is accidentally deleted, you can restore it
          using the navencrypt control --restore-control-file
          command.
You can copy the UUID (qMAKRMdk4HVbhfzR79cp9w92YBmNHJ5nSLhfd8ZVo6L in
          this example) and run navencrypt key --change with option
            --new-master-key-uuid to change a Master Key by using its UUID
          only:$ sudo navencrypt key --change --new-master-key-uuid=qMAKRMdk4HVbhfzR79cp9w92YBmNHJ5nSLhfd8ZVo6L
>> Type your OLD Master key
Type MASTER passphrase 1:
Type MASTER passphrase 2:
