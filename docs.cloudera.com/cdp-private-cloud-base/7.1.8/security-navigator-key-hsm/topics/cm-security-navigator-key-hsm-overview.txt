Cloudera Navigator Key HSM Overview

Cloudera Navigator Key HSM allows Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server
      to seamlessly integrate with a hardware security module (HSM). Key HSM
      enables Key Trustee Server to use an HSM as a root of trust for
      cryptographic keys, taking advantage of Key Trustee Serverâ€™s policy-based
      key and security asset management capabilities while at the same time
      satisfying existing, internal security requirements regarding treatment of
      cryptographic materials.
For instructions on installing Key HSM, see Installing Cloudera Navigator Key HSM.
