HSM-Specific Setup for Cloudera Navigator Key HSM
Additional HSM-specific setup information for Key HSM. 
SafeNet KeySecure
noteKeySecure was previously named DataSecure, but the Key HSM configuration process is the
        same for both.
Prerequisites
Before setting up SafeNet KeySecure, be sure to:

Set the protocol to NAE-XML
Set Allow Key and Policy Configuration Operations to
            enabled
Set Password Authentication to required
Disable Client Certificate Authentication
Set KeySecure Crypto Operations to activated
 For additional details about SafeNet KeySecure settings, see the SafeNet KeySecure
        product documentation.
After entering the Key HSM listener IP address and port, the HSM setup for SafeNet
        KeySecure prompts for login credentials, the IP address of the KeySecure HSM, and the port
        number:-- Ingrian HSM Credential Configuration --
Please enter HSM login USERNAME: keyhsm
Please enter HSM login PASSWORD: ******

Please enter HSM IP Address or Hostname: 172.19.1.135
Please enter HSM Port number: 9020
If the connection is successful, the following message is
        displayed:Valid address:                                    :[ Successful ]
The KeySecure setup utility then prompts you whether to use
        SSL:Use SSL? [Y/n] Y
If you choose to use SSL, Key HSM attempts to resolve the server certificate, and prompts
        you to trust the

CloudHSM
Before completing the CloudHSM setup, verify that the CloudHSM
        connection is properly configured by running either the
          cloudhsm_mgmt_util or key_mgmt_util
        tool and verifying that the tool connects to the HSM successfully. After
        validating this connection, you can exit the
        tool:$ /opt/cloudhsm/bin/cloudhsm_mgmt_util /opt/cloudhsm/etc/cloudhsm_mgmt_util.cfg

Connecting to the server(s), it may take time
depending on the server(s) load, please wait...

After entering the Key HSM listener IP address and port identifier, the
        HSM setup for CloudHSM prompts you for: the crypto user name and crypto
        user password. noteYou can configure different user types in the
          CloudHSM client (for example, the crypto user type
          manages key operations). Be sure to enter the user type
            crypto (CU) here.

Thales HSM
By default, the Thales HSM client process listens on ports 9000 and
        9001. The Cloudera Manager agent also listens on port 9000. To prevent a
        port conflict, you must change the Thales client ports. Cloudera
        recommends using ports 11500 and 11501.
To change the Thales client ports, run the following
        commands:sudo /opt/nfast/bin/config-serverstartup --enable-tcp --enable-privileged-tcp --port=11500 --privport=11501
sudo /opt/nfast/sbin/init.d-ncipher restart
To configure Key HSM to use the modified port, edit the
          /usr/share/keytrustee-server-keyhsm/start.sh file and
        add the -DNFAST_SERVER_PORT=11500 Java system property.
        For
        example:java -classpath "*:/usr/safenet/lunaclient/jsp/lib/*:/opt/nfast/java/classes/*" -Djava.library.path=/usr/safenet/lunaclient/jsp/lib/ -DNFAST_SERVER_PORT=11500 com.cloudera.app.run.Program $@
Before completing the Thales HSM setup, run the nfkminfo command to verify that the Thales HSM is properly configured:$ sudo /opt/nfast/bin/nfkminfo

Luna HSM
importantIf you have implemented Key Trustee Server high
        availability, ensure that the Luna client on each Key Trustee Server is
        configured with access to the same partition. See the Luna product
        documentation for instructions on configuring the Luna client.
Before completing the Luna HSM setup, run the vtl
          verify command (usually located at
          /usr/safenet/lunaclient/bin/vtl) to verify that the
        Luna HSM is properly configured.
After entering the Key HSM listener IP address and port, the HSM setup for Luna prompts for the slot number and password:-- Configuring SafeNet Luna HSM --
