Validating Key HSM Settings
After you finish setting up Navigator Key HSM, you can check the configuration settings
    and verify that Key HSM is properly connected to your HSM.

After the setup completes, the Key HSM configuration is stored in
          /usr/share/keytrustee-server-keyhsm/application.properties.
You can view these settings using the service keyhsm settings
        command:$ sudo service keyhsm settings

  # keyHsm Server Configuration information:
  keyhsm.management.address : 172.19.1.2
  keyhsm.server.port : 9090
  keyhsm.management.port : 9899
  keyhsm.service.port : 19791
  keyhsm.hardware : ncipher

These settings can be manually configured by modifying the
          application.properties file, with the exception of any passwords. These
        are encrypted by design, and can only be changed by re-running the setup utility.



Verifying Key HSM Connectivity to HSM


To verify Hardware Security Module (HSM) operations using Key HSM, run the following
            command on the Key Trustee Server host (which should also be the Key HSM host as
            described in Installing Cloudera Navigator Key HSM):

curl -k https://keytrustee01.example.com:11371/test_hsm
If Key HSM operations to the HSM are successful, the command returns output similar
              to the following:
"Sample Key TEST_HELLO_DEPOSIT2016-06-03-072718 has been created"
You must run this command from the Key Trustee Server host. If you run it from a
              different host, the command returns an HTTP 403 error code.


If the command returns an HTTP 405 error code, restart Key Trustee
            Server and try again.

noteIf you are using the test_hsm script to verify that the Key
              Hardware Security Module (Key HSM) has successfully integrated with the Key Trustee
              Server, or to verify that the Key HSM is connected to HSM, and the Key Trustee
              Server private key file is password-protected, then the verification may fail. This
              can occur even if the integration is successful or connected.If this occurs, create
                a key through Hadoop for the test.
