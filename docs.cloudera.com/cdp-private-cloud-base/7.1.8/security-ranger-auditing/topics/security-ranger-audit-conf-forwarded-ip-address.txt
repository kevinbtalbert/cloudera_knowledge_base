Configuring Ranger audits to show actual client IP address
How to forward the actual client IP address to audit logs generated from a Ranger
        plugin.

Ranger audit logs record the IP address through which Ranger policies grant/authorize
                access. When Ranger is set up behind a Knox proxy server, the proxy server IP
                address appears in the audit logs generated for each Ranger plugin. You can
                configure each plugin to forward the actual client IP address on which that service
                runs, so that the audit logs for that service more specifically reflect
                access/authorization activity. You must configure each plugin individually. This
                topic uses the Hive (Hadoop SQL) service as an example.  


From Cloudera Manager choose <service_name> > Configuration.

In <service_name> > Configuration > Search, type ranger-plugin, then press
                        Return.

In Ranger Plugin Use X-Forwarded for IP Address, check
                    the box.

In Ranger Plugin Trusted Proxy IP Address, type the IP
                    address of the Knox proxy server host.






Hive audit logs will now show the IP address of the host on which Hive service
            runs.
