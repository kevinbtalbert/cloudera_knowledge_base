Create a read-only Admin user (Auditor)
Creating a read-only Admin user (Auditor) enables compliance activities because this
        user can monitor policies and audit events, but cannot make changes.
When a user with the Auditor role logs in, they see
            a read-only view of Ranger policies and audit events. An Auditor can search and filter
            on access audit events, and access and view all tabs under Audit to understand access
            events. They cannot edit users or groups, export/import policies, or make changes of any
            kind.

Select Settings > Users/Groups/Roles.

Click Add New User.

Complete the User Detail section, selecting
                        Auditor as the role:
