Filter service access logs from Ranger UICloudera Docs
Filter service access logs from Ranger UI
You can limit display of system access/audit log records generated by service
        users in each service.

This topic describes how to limit the display of access log records on the Access tab in the Ranger Admin Web UI.


Go to Ranger Admin Web UI > Audit > Access. 

Check the Exclude Service Users box, as shown in:



Figure 1. Setting the Exclude Service Users flag to true






Define specific component services and users for access logs to filter out, in
                        ranger-admin-site.xml.


Go to Cloudera Manager > Ranger > Configuration


In Search, type
                                ranger-admin-site.


Define the following properties:


Name
ranger.plugins.<service_name>.serviceuser
Value
<service_name>
Name
ranger.accesslogs.exclude.users.list
Value
user1, user2







Figure 2. Filtering out service and user logs for Hive service






Click Save Changes (CTRL+S).

Restart the Ranger service.


Setting Exclude Service Users to true and defining specific
                filtering properties prevents audit logs from service users from appearing on Ranger Admin Web UI > Audit > Access, but does NOT prevent access logs for service users from being
                generated in Solr.
