Configuring a Ranger audit filter policy
You can configure an audit filter as you add or edit a resource- or tag-based service.
To configure an audit filter policy:

In Ranger Admin web UI > Service Manager clcik Add or Edit for either
          a resource-, or tag-based service. 
Scroll down to Audit Filter.
Click Audit Filter flag. You configure a Ranger audit filter
            policy by adding (+), deleting (X), or
            modifying each audit filter row for the service. 
Use the controls in the filter row to edit filter properties. For example, you can
            configure:
Is Audited: choose Yes or No

to include or not include a filter in the audit logs for a service 
Access Result: choose DENIED, ALLOWED, or NOT_DETERMINED 
to include that access result in the audit log filter
Resources: Add or Delete a resource item 
to include or remove the resource from the audit log filter
Operations: Add or Remove an action name 
to include the action/operation in the audit log filter
(click x to remove an existing operation)
Permissions: Add or Remove permissions


Click + in Permissions to open the Add dialog.
Select/Unselect required permissions.


For example, in HDFS service select read, write, execute, or All permissions.
Users: click Select User to see a list of defined users
to include one or multiple users in the audit log filter
Groups: click Select Group to see a list of defined groups
to include one or multiple groups in the audit log filter
Roles: click Select Role to see a list of defined roles
to include one or multiple roles in the audit log filter



Audit filter details


When you save the UI selections described in the preceding list, audit filters are
            defined as a JSON list. Each service references a unique list.

For example, ranger.plugin.audit.filters for the HDFS service
          includes: 
[
              
              {
              "accessResult":"DENIED",
              "isAudited":true
              },
              {
              "users":[
              "unaudited-user1"
              ],
              "groups":[
              "unaudited-group1"
              ],
              "roles":[
              "unaudited-role1"
              ],
              "isAudited":false
              },
              {
              "actions":[
              "listStatus",
              "getfileinfo"
              ],
              "accessTypes":[
              "execute"
              ],
              "isAudited":false
              },
              {
              "resources":{
              "path":{
              "values":[
              "/audited"
              ],
              "isRecursive":true
              }
              },
              "isAudited":true
              },
              {
              "resources":{
              "path":{
              "values":[
              "/unaudited"
              ],
              "isRecursive":true
              }
              },
              "isAudited":false
              }
              ]
Each value in the list is an audit filter, which takes the format of a simplified
          Ranger policy, along with access results fields. 
Audit filters are defined with rules on Ranger policy attributes and access result
          attributes.
Policy attributes: resources, users, groups, roles, accessTypes
Access result attributes: isAudited, actions, accessResult
