Audit Overview
Apache Ranger provides a centralized framework for collecting access audit history and
        reporting data, including filtering on various parameters. Ranger enhances audit information
        obtained from Hadoop components and provides insights through this centralized reporting
        capability.
Ranger plugins support storing audit data to multiple audit destinations.

Solr
The Solr audit destination is a short term audit destination (with a default TTL
                    of 90 days)  managed by Solr which can be configured by a Ranger Admin user. The
                    Ranger Admin Web UI displays the access audit data from the audit data stored in
                    Solr.
HDFS
The HDFS audit destination is a long term audit destination for
                    archival/compliance purposes. The HDFS audit destination has no default
                    retention/purge period. A customer must manage the
                    storage/retention/purge/archival of audit data stored in HDFS manually.
