Configure Ranger authentication for LDAP
How to configure Ranger to use LDAP for user authentication.

noteIn CDP Public Cloud, identity management is provided by FreeIPA, and configured
                using the Management Console. Therefore for CDP Public Cloud you should leave the
                Admin Authentication Method set to the UNIX authentication settings. For more information on
                FreeIPA, see Managing FreeIPA in the Identify Management documentation. 


In Cloudera Manager, select Ranger, then click the Configuration
                    tab.

To display the authentication settings, type "authentication" in the Search
                    box. You may need to scroll down to see all of the LDAP settings.






Configure the following settings for LDAP authentication, then click Save
                        Changes.

* There are three possible values for
                            ranger.ldap.ad.referral: follow,
                            throw, and ignore. The recommended
                        setting is follow.
When searching a directory, the server might return several search results,
                        along with a few continuation references that show where to obtain further
                        results. These results and references might be interleaved at the protocol
                        level.


When this property is set to follow, the AD service
                                provider processes all of the normal entries first, and then follows
                                the continuation references.


When this property is set to throw, all of the
                                normal entries are returned in the enumeration first, before the
                                    ReferralException is thrown. By contrast, a
                                "referral" error response is processed immediately when this
                                property is set to follow or
                                throw.


When this property is set to ignore, it indicates
                                that the server should return referral entries as ordinary entries
                                (or plain text). This might return partial results for the search.
                                In the case of AD, a PartialResultException is
                                returned when referrals are encountered while search results are
                                processed.
