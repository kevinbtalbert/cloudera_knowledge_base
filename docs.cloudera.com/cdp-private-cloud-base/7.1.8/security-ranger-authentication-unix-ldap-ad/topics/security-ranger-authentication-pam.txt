How to configure Ranger to use PAM for user authentication.

noteIn CDP Public Cloud, identity management is provided by FreeIPA, and configured using
            the Management Console. Therefore for CDP Public Cloud you should leave the Admin
            Authentication Method set to the UNIX authentication settings. For more information on
            FreeIPA, see Managing FreeIPA in the Identify Management documentation. 


In Cloudera Manager, select Ranger, then click the Configuration tab.

Under Admin Authentication Method, select PAM, then click
                  Save Changes.






Allow the Ranger user to read the /etc/shadow file:

usermod -a -G shadow ranger
chgrp shadow /etc/shadow
chmod g+r /etc/shadow


Select Actions > Restart to restart Ranger.
