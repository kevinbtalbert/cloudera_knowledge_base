Configuring Ranger Authentication with UNIX, LDAP, AD, or PAM
This section describes how to configure the authentication method that determines who
        is allowed to log in to the Ranger web UI. The options are local UNIX, LDAP, AD, or
        PAM.
noteIn CDP Public Cloud, identity management is provided by FreeIPA, and configured using
            the Management Console. Therefore for CDP Public Cloud you should leave the Admin
            Authentication Method set to the UNIX authentication settings. For more information on
            FreeIPA, see Managing FreeIPA in the Identify Management documentation.
