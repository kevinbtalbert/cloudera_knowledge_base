Configure optimized rename and recursive delete operations in Ranger Ozone plugin
You can enable performance optimized authorization approach for rename and recursive
        delete operations in the Ranger Ozone plugin.

Ozone introduced support for FSO (FILE_SYSTEM_OPTIMIZED) Bucket
                layout. FSO Bucket layout is a Hierarchical FileSystem namespace view with
                directories and files. Similar to HDFS, with FSO bucket layout, Ozone has an
                efficient directory rename and delete operations. Ranger supports not only
                authorization for rename and recursive delete operations, but also provides an
                option to enable performance optimized solution when these operations are performed
                on directory containing large set of subpaths (directories/files) within it.
Property name - ranger.plugin.ozone.optimized.subaccesspath.enabled
Default is set to false.
To enable authorization for rename and recursive delete operations in the Ranger
                Ozone plugin:


In Cloudera Manager > Ozone > Ozone Manager > Configuration > Search. type ranger-ozone-security.xml.

In Ozone Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        ranger-ozone-security.xml, click +.


Under Ozone, in Name,
                            type:
                                ranger.plugin.ozone.optimized.subaccesspath.enabled.


In Value, type:
                            true.


Click Save Changes.



In Ozone > Actions, click Restart.

Ranger not only authorizes rename and recursive delete operations, but also provides
            an option to enable performance optimized solution when these operations are performed
            on a directory containing a large set of subpaths (directories/files) within
            it.
