Create a Hive authorizer URL policy
You can create a Hive Authorizer URL policy in Ranger that maintains Read and Write
        permissions for a location or folder.

Hive supports several commands that include URLs which refer to a current or future
                data location. Such locations must authorize end user access to that location.
                Currently, you can create a Ranger HDFS policy that grants "All" permissions for a
                location, recursively. If no such policy exists, HDFS authorization "falls back" to
                the current ACL that defines access to a location or folder.  By default the value
                of the parameter is “hdfs:,file:”. If you remove “hdfs:”, access requests will be
                authorized against the HIVE URL policy and won't check for hdfs plugin or Hadoop
                ACL. This solution requires maintaining many policies or ACLs at the storage level.
                You can create a Hive Authorizer URL policy in Ranger that maintains Read and Write
                permissions for a location or folder.  
To create a Hive Authorizer policy:


In Cloudera Manager > HIVE-1 > Configuration > Search. type ranger-hive.

In Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        ranger-hive-security.xml, click +.


Under HIVE-1, in Name,
                            type:
                                ranger.plugin.hive.urlauth.filesystem.schemes.


In Value, type:
                            file:


Click Save Changes.



In Cloudera Manager > Hive_On_Tez-1 > Configuration > Search. type ranger-hive.

In Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        ranger-hive-security.xml, click +.


Under HIVE_ON_TEZ-1, in
                                Name, type:
                                ranger.plugin.hive.urlauth.filesystem.schemes.


In Value, type:
                            file:


Click Save Changes.



In HIVE-1 > Actions, click Restart.

In HIVE_ON_TEZ-1 > Actions, click Restart.
By default the value of the parameter is “hdfs:,file:”. If you remove “hdfs:”,
                    access requests will be authorized against the HIVE URL policy and won't check
                    for hdfs plugin or Hadoop ACL.

In Ranger > Resource Policies > Hadoop SQL, click Add New Policy.

In Policy Details, select URL,
                    then type the URL represents the location or folder to which you want Ranger to
                    authorize access:
                        hdfs://<hostname>.root.hwx.site:8020/demo/data.

In Allow Conditions, select user(s), then choose Read
                    and Write permissions, as shown in the following example:

Figure 1. Creating a Hive Authorizer URL Policy



This policy allows the user to READ / WRITE into the location defined by
                        the URL.CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS STUDENT (student_ID INT,
                    FirstName STRING, LastName STRING, year STRING, Major STRING) COMMENT 'Student
                    Names' ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION
                        '/demo/data';This will create a table reading data from the
                        location /demo/data provided user will have the necessary READ permission to
                        the location along with CREATE permission for table STUDENTIf the
                        storage system is S3A or ADFS, then URL policy would be maintained for the
                        scheme. For example, s3a://<folder>, abfs://<folder>.Hive
                        supports URL policies for the following commmands that have URLs defined for
                        the respective location:
CREATE TABLE
exernal table location
ALTER TABLE LOCATION
new location
ALTER PARTITION LOCATION
new partition location
ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION
for partition location
LOAD
input location
