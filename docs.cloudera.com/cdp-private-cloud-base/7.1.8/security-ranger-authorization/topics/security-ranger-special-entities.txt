Ranger special entities

Ranger in CDP has specific, internal groups and entities that affect user authorization and
   access to all services in CDP. 
In addition to any users, group, roles and permissions that you define using Ranger, you must
   understand the following Ranger special entities:

"public" group

A special, internal group within Ranger that consists of all users, including future users.
      Membership is implicit and automatic.noteAll users belong to "public"
       group. Any policies granted to this group provide access to everyone.
The following, default policies give permissions to members of group "public": 


all - database > public > create permission
default database tables columns > public > create permission
Information_schema database tables columns > public > select permission


You can remove “public” from these default policies to further restrict user access, based
      on your security requirements.

{OWNER} special entity

A special Ranger entity attached to a user based on their actions. For example, when a user
      "bob" creates a table, "bob" becomes the {OWNER} of that table and would get any permissions
      provided to {OWNER} on that table across all the policies. The following default policies have
      permissions for {OWNER}:



all - database, table, column > {OWNER} > all permissions
all - database, table > {OWNER} > all permissions
all - database, udf > {OWNER} > all permissions
all - database > {OWNER} > all permissions

Although not recommended, you can modify access to special entity {OWNER}, based on your
      security requirements. Removing the default {OWNER} permissions may require adding additional,
      specific policies for each object owner, which may increase your policy management operational
      burden.
