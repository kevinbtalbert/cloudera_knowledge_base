How to add a tag-based service to Ranger.
You can use the Service Manager for Tag-Based Policies page
         to create tag-based services and add tag-based access policies that can be applied to
         Hadoop resources. Using tag-based policies enables you to control access to resources
         across multiple Hadoop components without creating separate services and policies in each
         component. You can also use Ranger TagSync to synchronize the Ranger tag store with an
         external metadata service such as Apache Atlas.

Select  Access Manager > Tag Based Policies, then click the Add icon () in the TAG box on the Service Manager page.






On the Create Service page, type in a service name and an optional description. The
               service is enabled by default, but you can disable it by selecting Disabled.
               To add the service, click Add.






The new tag service appears on the Service Manager page.
