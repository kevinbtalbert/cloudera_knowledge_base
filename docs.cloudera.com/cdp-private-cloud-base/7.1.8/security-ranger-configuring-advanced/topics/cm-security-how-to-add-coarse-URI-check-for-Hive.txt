How to add a coarse URI check for Hive agent

Hive command performance deteriorates when the Hive URL location specified has a large number
   of folders and files. Performance suffers while the recursive check for permission occurs on all
   folders and files. One way to improve performance is to enable a Hive URL policy. Another way is
   to configure a coarse URI check that checks the parent folder permission only for authorization.
  
You can set the Hive agent authorization check at the parent folder level using a safety
  valve configuration in Cloudera Manager.
To avoid a URL recursive permission check, create the following configuration:
Go to CM > Hive > Configuration > Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
       ranger-hive-security.xml.,  
Click + to add a new configuration.
In Name, type xasecure.hive.uri.permission.coarse.check.
In Value, type true.

Click Save Changes.
Restart the Hive service.
