How to configure Ranger HDFS plugin configs per (NameNode) Role Group
You can override the service-level configurations, by setting configurations at the
        Role/Group level.

The Ranger HDFS plugin supports service-wide configuration using safety valves for
                auditing, policy management and security. Additionally, you can override
                service-wide security setting by configuring the NameNode Advanced Configuration
                Snippet (Safety Valve) which allows role/group specific configuration. This feature
                supports configuring security policies across a federated namespace environment.


In Cloudera Manager Home, select
                        HDFS, then choose
                        Configuration.

On Configuration, in Search, type
                        Ranger-hdfs.

In NameNode Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                        Valve), click + (Add).

Add key-value pairs that configure
                        ranger-hdfs-security.xml per NameNode group.

key-value pairs that you define in NameNode Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
            Valve) for ranger-hdfs-security.xml override any defined in HDFS Service Advanced
            Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for ranger-hdfs-security.xml.
