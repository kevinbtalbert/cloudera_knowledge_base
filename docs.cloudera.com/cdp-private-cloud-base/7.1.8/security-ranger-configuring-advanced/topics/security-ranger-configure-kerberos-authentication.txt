How to configure Kerberos Authentication for Apache Ranger
Kerberos authentication for Apache Ranger is
        automatically configured when HDFS Kerberos authentication is configured in Cloudera Manager
        (typically using the Cloudera Manager Kerberos Wizard). In this way, the actions that Ranger
        authorizes are sure to be requested by authenticated users.Specifically, Ranger depends
      on the HDFS hadoop.security.authentication property to enable or disable
      Kerberos authentication. When the hadoop.security.authentication property is
      updated, the Ranger service gets a restart indicator for the core-site.xml
      file that resides inside the Ranger service conf directory generated by Cloudera Manager.
        important Authorization through Apache Ranger is just one element of a secure
        production cluster: Cloudera supports Ranger only when it runs on a cluster where Kerberos
        is enabled to authenticate users.Ranger Kerberos authentication is automatically
        enabled when HDFS Kerberos authentication is enabled.  To enable Kerberos Authentication
      for CDP, read the related information.
