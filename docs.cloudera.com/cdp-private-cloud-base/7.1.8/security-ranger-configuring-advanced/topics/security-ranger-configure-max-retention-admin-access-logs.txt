How to clear Ranger Admin access logs
Starting with version 7.1.7sp1, you can set the max number of days to retain access
        logs in the Ranger Admin Web UI.

Ranger admin access log files accrue in the following path:
                    /var/log/ranger/admin/access_log.yyyy-mm-dd.log. By
                default, these files aren't removed which consumes free space in the
                    /var/ directory. You can set a maximum number of days for
                which these files are retained, after which they are deleted. To do so, you must add
                a configuration property to the ranger-admin-site.xml file. note This feature is available in version 7.1.7sp1.


In Cloudera Manager Home, select
                    Ranger, then choose
                    Configuration.

On Configuration, in Search, type
                        ranger-admin.

In conf/ranger-admin-site.xml_role_safety_valve, click
                        + (Add).

Add a key-value pair that configures the maximum number of days to retain
                    Ranger Admin access log files.


Name 

ranger.accesslog.rotate.max.days

Value

any suitable number of days 





To retain Ranger Admin access log files for 90 days, in the Value field, type
                        90


Click Save Changes.

After saving changes, the Stale Configuration icon
                        appears on the Cloudera Manager UI. Optionally, click Stale
                            Configuration to view details.


Select Actions > Restart.
