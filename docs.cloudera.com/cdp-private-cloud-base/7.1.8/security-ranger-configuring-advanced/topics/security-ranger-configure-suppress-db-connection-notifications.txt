How to suppress database connection notifications
You can limit the number of notifications to those about connection requests made
        from Ranger to an Oracle db.

Ranger Admin performs many interactions with its backend database (often Oracle), for
                example; policy updates, user/group info updates, etc. A customer can see audit logs
                that represent all activities at the Oracle side, not just connection attempts.
To limit the number of notifications to those that describe persistent db
                connections:


In Cloudera Manager Home, select
                        Ranger, then choose
                        Configuration.

On Configuration, in Search, type
                        log4j.

In Ranger Admin Logging Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                        Valve)

In Ranger Admin Default Group, type the following
                    text:
log4j.category.com.mchange=FATAL, sql_appender
log4j.additivity.com.mchange=false
