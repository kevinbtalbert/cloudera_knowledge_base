Configure Ranger Admin High Availability
How to configure Ranger Admin High Availability (HA) by adding additional Ranger Admin
      role instances.

In Cloudera Manager, select Ranger, then select Actions > Add Role
               Instances. 






On the Add Role Instances page, click Select hosts. 






On the selected hosts page, the primary Ranger Admin host is selected by default.
               Select a backup Ranger host. A Ranger Admin (RA) icon appears in the Added Roles
               column for the selected backup host. Click OK to continue. 






The Add Role Instances page is redisplayed with the new backup host. Click
                  Continue. 






Review the settings on the Review Changes page, then click Continue. 






Restart the stale Ranger configuration, then click Finish. 






After restart you will see two URLs for the Ranger Admin Web UI.


Requests are distributed to the multiple Ranger Admin instances in a
                     round-robin fashion. 
If a connection is refused (indicating a failure), requests are automatically
                     rerouted to the alternate Ranger Admin instance. However, you must manually
                     switch to the alternate Ranger Admin Web UI. 
For all services that have the Ranger plugin enabled, the value of the
                        ranger.plugin.<service>.policy.rest.url property changes
                     to
                        http://<RANGER-ADMIN-1>:6080,http://<RANGER-ADMIN-2>:6080.
