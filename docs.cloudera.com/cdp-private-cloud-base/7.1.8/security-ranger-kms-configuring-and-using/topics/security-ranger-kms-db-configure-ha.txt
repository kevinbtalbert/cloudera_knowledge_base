Configure High Availability for Ranger KMS with DB
Use the following steps to configure high availability for Ranger KMS with an
        associated keystore database. 

In Cloudera Manager, select Ranger KMS, then select Actions > Add Role
                        Instances. 






On the Assign Roles page, click Select hosts. 






On the selected hosts page, select a backup Ranger KMS host. A Ranger KMS (RK)
                    icon appears in the Added Roles column for the selected host. Click OK to
                    continue. 


noteThese steps show how to add one additional backup Ranger KMS host, but
                            you can use the same procedure to add multiple Ranger KMS hosts.
                        






The Assign Roles page is redisplayed with the new backup host. Click
                        Continue. 






Review the settings on the Review Changes page, then click Continue. 






The new role instance appears on the Ranger KMS page. If the new Ranger KMS
                    instance was not started by the wizard, you can start the service by clicking
                        Actions > Start in the Ranger KMS service. 






In Cloudera Manager, select the Ranger service, click Ranger Admin Web
                        UI, then log in as the Ranger KMS user (the default credentials are
                    keyadmin/admin123). Click the Edit icon for the cm_kms service, then update the
                    KMS URL property. 



Add the new KMS host using the following format:
                                        kms://http@<kms_host1>;http@<kms_host2>:<kms_port>/kms
                                    
The default port is 9292. For example:
                                        kms://http@kms_host1;http@kms_host2:9292/kms
If SSL is enabled, use https and port 9494. For
                                example:
                                        kms://http@kms_host1;http@kms_host2:9494/kms


Click Test Connection to confirm the settings, then click Save
                        to save your changes. 





In Cloudera Manager click the Ranger KMS service, then select Actions >
                        Create Ranger Plugin Audit Directory. 







In Cloudera Manager, select Ranger KMS, then click Configuration. 


Use the Add (+) icons for the Ranger KMS Server Advanced Configuration
                            Snippet (Safety Valve) for conf/kms-site.xml property to add the
                            following properties, then click Save Changes.

                                        = <Zookeeper hostname>:2181note
                                            In a cluster with multiple ZK hosts, include them as a
                                            comma-separated list. For example:
                                            hadoop.kms.authentication.zk-dt-secret-manager.zkConnectionString
                                            =
                                            <ZK_hostname1>:2181,<ZK_hostname2>:2181,....,<ZK_hostnameN>:2181
                                            .

                                        avoid collision>For
                                            example:hadoop.kms.authentication.zk-dt-secret-manager.znodeWorkingPath
                                            = testzkkmsnoteDo not put a leading slash at the
                                            beginning of the znode working path. 
hadoop.kms.authentication.zk-dt-secret-manager.zkAuthType =
                                        sasl
