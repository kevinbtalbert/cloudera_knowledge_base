Configure High Availability for Ranger KMS with KTS
Use the following steps to configure high availability for Ranger KMS with Key
        Trustee Server as the backing key store.  

In Cloudera Manager, select Ranger KMS KTS, then select Actions > Add Role
                        Instances. 






On the Assign Roles page, click Select hosts. 






On the selected hosts page, select a backup Ranger KMS KTS host. A Ranger KMS
                    KTS (RK) icon appears in the Added Roles column for the selected host. Click
                        OK to continue. 


noteThese steps show how to add one additional backup Ranger KMS KTS host,
                            but you can use the same procedure to add multiple Ranger KMS KTS hosts.
                        






The Assign Roles page is redisplayed with the new backup host. Click
                        Continue. 






Review the settings on the Review Changes page, then click Continue. 






The new role instance appears on the Ranger KMS KTS page. If the new Ranger KMS
                    with KTS instance was not started by the wizard, you can start the service by
                    clicking Actions > Start in the Ranger KMS with Key Trustee Server
                    service. 






If necessary, synchronize the KMS KTS private key.

Check the catalina.out file in the Ranger KMS KTS log
                        directory for the following error: 

java.io.IOException: Unable to verify private key match between KMS hosts. Verify private key files have been synced
between all KMS hosts. Aborting to prevent data inconsistency.

To determine whether the KMS KTS private keys are different, compare the MD5
                        hash of the private keys. On each Ranger KMS KTS host, run the following
                        command:

md5sum /var/lib/kms-keytrustee/keytrustee/.keytrustee/secring.gpg

If the output is different on both instances, Cloudera recommends
                            following security best practices and transferring the private key using
                            offline media, such as a removable USB drive. For convenience (for
                        example, in a development or testing environment where maximum security is
                        not required), you can copy the private key over the network by running the
                        following rsync command on the original Ranger KMS KTS
                        host:

rsync -zav /var/lib/kms-keytrustee/keytrustee/.keytrustee root@ktkms02.example.com:/var/lib/kms-keytrustee/keytrustee/.



Restart the Ranger KMS KTS service.

In Cloudera Manager, select the Ranger service, click Ranger Admin Web
                        UI, then log in as the Ranger KMS user (the default credentials are
                    keyadmin/admin123). Click the Edit icon for the cm_kms service, then update the
                    KMS URL property. 



Add the new KMS host using the following format:
                                        kms://http@<kms_kts_host1>;http@<kms_kts_host2>:<kms_port>/kms
                                    
The default port is 9292. For example:
                                        kms://http@kms_kts_host1;http@kms_kts_host2:9292/kms
If SSL is enabled, use https and port 9494. For
                                example:
                                        kms://https@kms_kts_host1;https@kms_kts_host2:9494/kms


Click Test Connection to confirm the settings, then click Save
                        to save your changes. 





In Cloudera Manager, select Ranger KMS with Key Trustee Server, then click
                        Configuration. 


Use the Add (+) icons for the Ranger KMS Server with KTS Advanced
                            Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for conf/kms-site.xml property to
                            add the following properties, then click Save Changes. 




hadoop.kms.authentication.zk-dt-secret-manager.zkConnectionString
                                            = <Zookeeper hostname>:2181

noteSet this property only to
                                                override the default value.



hadoop.kms.authentication.zk-dt-secret-manager.znodeWorkingPath
                                            = <provide a znode working path other than /zkdtsm to
                                            avoid collision>
For example:
hadoop.kms.authentication.zk-dt-secret-manager.znodeWorkingPath
                                            = testzkkms
noteDo not put a leading slash at the beginning of the
                                            znode working path. Set this property only to override
                                            the default value.


hadoop.kms.authentication.zk-dt-secret-manager.zkAuthType
                                            = sasl
note
                                            Default value is none and it will
                                                give all the permission to the default node created
                                                in ZK. So, the recommended setting is sasl. If set
                                                to sasl, for example, the ACL at custom /zk path is:
                                                'sasl,'HTTP:cdrwa 
                                        

hadoop.kms.authentication.zk-dt-secret-manager.kerberos.keytab
                                        = {{CMF_CONF_DIR}}/ranger_kms_kts.keytab
important If you set
                                                sasl (as recommended) for
                                                hadoop.kms.authentication.zk-dt-secret-manager.zkAuthType,
                                                then you must set
                                                hadoop.kms.authentication.zk-dt-secret-manager.kerberos.keytab
                                                = {{CMF_CONF_DIR}}/ranger_kms_kts.keytab.












Update the following Ranger KMS configuration properties, then click Save
                        Changes. 




hadoop.kms.authentication.signer.secret.provider.zookeeper.auth.type
                                    = sasl
For example, select sasl in the
                                        Ranger KMS Server with KTS Default
                                        Group.










Click the Stale Configuration Restart icon.








On the Stale Configurations page, click Restart Stale Services. 

On the Restart Stale Services page, select the Re-deploy client
                        configuration checkbox, then click Restart Now. 

A progress indicator page appears while the services are being restarted. When
                    the services have restarted, click Finish.
