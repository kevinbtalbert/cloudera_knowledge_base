How to full sync the Ranger RMS database
You must perform a full-sync of the Ranger RMS database after upgrading RMS to 7.1.8.

Performing a full-sync in Ranger RMS truncates all the existing data from RMS tables
                in the Ranger database. The sync process initiates a fresh synchronization from the
                Hive Metastore (HMS). All available tables and database metadata download from HMS
                and persist into the Ranger database.
Prior to CDP-7.1.7, Ranger RMS synchronizes only table metadata. Database metadata
                mappings were not downloaded from HMS. After migrating from CDP versions before
                CDP-7.1.7 to CDP 7.1.8+, only pre-existing table mappings will be available. Any
                newly created tables or database mappings will be synchronized in RMS. Any
                pre-existing database mappings will not be present. 
importantTo ensure the pre-existing databases are
                mapped correctly, you must perform a full-sync after upgrading RMS to 7.1.8.


Have a (7.1.8) cluster with Ranger and Ranger RMS service up and running.


In Cloudera Manager > Ranger_RMS > Actions, click Stop.

In Ranger_RMS > Actions, click Ranger RMS Database Full
                    Sync.

Confirm that the command completed successfully, as shown in the following
                    example:

note You can also confirm the text - ‘[I]
                                Truncate operation executed successfully on Ranger RMS tables’ from
                                the stderr log of the command from Cloudera Manager UI.




In Cloudera Manager > Ranger_RMS, click Start.
