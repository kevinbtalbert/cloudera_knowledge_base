Adding default service users and roles for RangerCloudera Docs
Adding default service users and roles for Ranger
Cloudera Manager adds a property and default values that define roles for the minimum
    set of service users by default.
Runtime releases 7.1.8 and 7.2.16 introduce a new configuration property: 

Name
ranger.usersync.whitelist.users.role.assignment.rules
Default Value
&ROLE_SYS_ADMIN:u:admin,rangerusersync,rangertagsync,ranger,rangeradmin,rangerraz,rangerrms&ROLE_KEY_ADMIN:u:keyadmin

Go to Cloudera Manager > Ranger > Configuration, then type whitelist in Search to
      see the property and assigned values. Ranger Usersync creates roles for each service user
      during syncronization.
ranger.usersync.whitelist.users.role.assignment.rules uses same format as
        ranger.usersync.group.based.role.assignment.rules. 
If you add any custom principals, you must update the list of values for
    ranger.usersync.whitelist.users.role.assignment.rules accordingly so that
   Ranger usersync applies role assignments rules appropriately. Any change to these configuration
   values requires a restart of Ranger usersync. Ranger usersync applies these rules during restart
   and every sync cycle, if changed. 
If the same service user exists in:
ranger.usersync.whitelist.users.role.assignment.rules, and
ranger.usersync.group.based.role.assignment.rules

with different role assignments, then the role assignment from
    ranger.usersync.whitelist.users.role.assignment.rules takes priority.
   This is true even if ranger.usersync.group.based.role.assignment.rules has
   role assignment rules for a group that has service users as members. Any changes to the role
   assignments made to these service users from Ranger UI or rest API are temporary. The next Ranger
   usersync sync cycle resets them.
