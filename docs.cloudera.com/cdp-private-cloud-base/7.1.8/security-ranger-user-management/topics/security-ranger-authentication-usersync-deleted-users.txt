Configuring Ranger Usersync for Deleted Users and Groups
How to configure Ranger Usersync for users and groups that have been deleted from the
      sync source.

You can configure Ranger Usersync to update Ranger when users and groups have been
            deleted from the sync source (UNIX, LDAP, AD or PAM). This ensures that users and groups
            – and their associated access permissions – do not remain in Ranger when they are
            deleted from sync source. 


In Cloudera Manager, select Ranger > Configuration, then use the Search box
               to search for Ranger Usersync Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                  conf/ranger-ugsync-site.xml. Use the Add (+) icons to add the following
               properties, then click Save Changes. 




Name
Value
Description




ranger.usersync.deletes.enabled 

true
Enables deleted users and groups synchronization. The default
                                 setting is false (disabled). 



ranger.usersync.deletes.frequency  

10
Sets the frequency of delete synchronization. The default
                                 setting is 10, or once every 10 Usersync cycles. Delete
                                 synchronization consumes cluster resources, so a lower (more
                                 frequent) setting may affect performance. 










Click the Ranger Restart icon.






On the Stale Configurations page, click Restart Stale Services. 






On the Restart Stale Services page, select the Re-deploy client
                  configuration check box, then click Restart Now. 






A progress indicator page appears while the services are being restarted. When the
               services have restarted, click Continue. 

Users that have been deleted in sync source are not automatically deleted in Ranger
               – they are marked as Hidden and must be manually deleted by the Ranger Admin user,
               and then Ranger Usersync must be restarted. 
In the Ranger Admin Web UI, select Settings > Users/Groups/Roles. Click in
               the User List text box, then select Visibility > Hidden.  





To delete a hidden user or group manually, select the applicable check boxes, then
               click the red Delete icon, as shown in the following example. 






You can delete multiple users or groups by running a "delete" script on the
                  command line interface.
For
                  example:Sample command to delete users:
python deleteUserGroupUtil.py -users <user file path> -admin <ranger admin user> -url <rangerhosturl> [-force] [-sslCertPath <cert path>] [-debug]

Sample command to delete groups:
python deleteUserGroupUtil.py -groups <group file path> -admin <ranger admin user> -url <rangerhosturl> [-force] [-sslCertPath <cert path>] [-debug]
note  The deleteUserGroupUtil.py script installs as part of the
                  Ranger installation on the node where Ranger Admin runs, in the following
                  location: /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/ranger-admin/
                  .


In Cloudera Manager, select Ranger > Ranger Usersync, then select Actions
                  > Restart this Ranger Usersync. 






note


Sync source is tracked when processing Ranger users and groups for
                           deletion. If the same user name for a separate sync source already exists
                           in Ranger DB, that user will not be updated or marked as hidden. 
For AD/LDAP sync: 

After marking a user or group as deleted/hidden in Ranger, the
                                    user or group status does not change automatically. The user or
                                    group must be manually deleted (or deleted using the cli
                                    "delete" script).  Usersync must be restarted to reflect any
                                    changes to the same user name in the source. 


For example, a user (Bob) from one OU (say Engineering) is
                                    deleted from the source and is marked as deleted in Ranger
                                    admin. If the same user name (Bob) is subsequently added back to
                                    the same OU, the user status will not be automatically enabled.
                                    The user must be manually deleted and Usersync must be restarted
                                    to implement the changes. 


If an identical user name (say Bob) is deleted from one OU (say
                                    Engineering) and added to a different OU (say Finance) between
                                    the sync cycles, user Bob is marked as hidden/deleted only when
                                    the delete cycle is triggered. Until then there is a security
                                    risk that user Bob from Finance will be granted the permissions
                                    for Bob from Engineering.
