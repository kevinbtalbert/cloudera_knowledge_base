Adding or editing module permissions
How to add or edit users and groups permission to access Ranger modules.
 Permissions defines the users and groups that can
                  access Ranger modules using Ranger Admin Web UI. Access to a module determines
                  whether the user can see and use options within that module using Ranger Admin Web
                  UI. For example, a user with access to Resource Based Polices module can see
                        Resource Based Policies option under
                        Access Manager in Ranger Admin Web UI. An admin user
                  can add, import, and export services policies, as well as view, edit and delete
                  permissions for policies, as shown in the following example:  Figure 1. Ranger Admin User View of Resource-based Policies

 A Ranger user (without admin permissions) can only view the resource-based
                  policies, as shown in the following example:Figure 2. Ranger User View of Resource-based Policies
