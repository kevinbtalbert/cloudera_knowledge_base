Unknown Error
Several possible causes for this error, including:
User accounts on the cluster with an ID less than the value
                  specified for the min.user.id property in the
                    taskcontroller.cfg file. Default value of
                  1000 is good for Ubuntu but may not be valid for other OSs. To
                  set the min.user.id in the
                  taskcontroller.cfg file, see "Step 7: Prepare the cluster for each user".
Jobs do not run and the TaskTracker is unable to create a
                  Hadoop logs directory (see "Troubleshooting
                    Error Messages>Jobs cannot run and TaskTracker cannot create Hadoop logs directory").
May result from previous errors. Check older entries in the
                  log file for possibilities.
