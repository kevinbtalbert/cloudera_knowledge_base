Troubleshooting TLS/SSL Issues in Cloudera Manager
To diagnose and resolve issues related to TLS/SSL configuration, verify configuration tasks
      appropriate for the cluster by verifying the steps in "Manually Configuring TLS Encryption for
      Cloudera Manager".After checking your settings and finding no obvious misconfiguration, try
      some of the troubleshooting steps below.Test Connectivity with OpenSSL
From the host that has connectivity issues, run openssl as shown below.
        You can also check that the certificate used by the host is recognized by a trusted CA
        during the TLS/SSL negotiation.
To check the connection:
openssl s_client -connect [host.fqdn.name]:[port]
For example:
openssl s_client -connect test1.sec.cloudera.com:7183
A return code 0 means openssl was able to follow trust
        server chain of trust through its library of trusted public CAs. 
For certificates signed by your organization's internal CA or self-signed certificates, you
        may need to add the certificate to the truststore using the openssl
        command. Use the -CAfile option to specify the path to the root CA so
          openssl can verify the self-signed or internal-CA-signed certificate as
        follows:
$ openssl s_client -connect test1.sec.cloudera.com:7183 -CAfile \
/opt/cloudera/security/CAcerts/RootCA.pem
Only the Root CA certificate is needed to establish trust for this test. The result from
        the command is successful when you see the return code 0 as
        follows:...
 Verify return code: 0 (ok)

By default, Cloudera Manager Server writes logs to the
          /etc/cloudera-scm-server/cloudera-scm-server.log file on startup.
        Successful server start-up using the certificate looks similar to the following log
        example:
2014-10-06 21:33:47,515 INFO WebServerImpl:org.mortbay.log: jetty-6.1.26.cloudera.2
2014-10-06 21:33:47,572 INFO WebServerImpl:org.mortbay.log: Started SslSelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:7183
2014-10-06 21:33:47,573 INFO WebServerImpl:org.mortbay.log: Started SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:7180
2014-10-06 21:33:47,573 INFO WebServerImpl:com.cloudera.server.cmf.WebServerImpl: Started Jetty server.
Upload Diagnostic Bundles to Cloudera Support
By default, Cloudera Manager uploads diagnostic bundles over HTTPS to the Cloudera Support
        server at cops.cloudera.com. However, the upload can fail if the Cloudera
        Manager truststore cannot verify the authenticity of the Cloudera Support server
        certificate, and that verification process can fail due to Cloudera Manager truststore
        configuration issues.
To ensure the Cloudera Manager Server truststore contains the public CAs needed to verify
        Cloudera Support's certificate, you can explicitly establish trust by importing Cloudera Support's
        certificate into Cloudera Manager's truststore (see "Importing Cloudera Support's Certificate into the Cloudera Manager Server Truststore". 
noteCloudera Support servers use certificates signed by a commercial CA, so this
        step is typically not needed, unless the default truststore has been altered. Before
        downloading or adding any certificates, test the connection (see "Test Connectivity with OpenSSL") and verify that the certificate is the source of the connection
        issue.

Importing Cloudera Support's Certificate into the Cloudera Manager Server
        Truststore
To obtain Cloudera's public key certificate from the Cloudera Support server:
openssl s_client -connect cops.cloudera.com:443 | openssl x509 -text -out /path/to/cloudera-cert.pem
To import this certificate into the Cloudera Manager truststore (use paths for your own
        system):
keytool -import -keystore /path/to/cm/truststore.jks -file /path/to/cloudera-cert.pem
After importing the certificate, confirm that Cloudera Manager is configured for this
        truststore file, as detailed in "Configuring Cloudera Manager Truststore Properties".
noteAlternatively, you can use the default Java truststore for your Cloudera
        Manager cluster deployment, as described in "Manually Configuring TLS Encryption for
        Cloudera Manager". 

Configuring Cloudera Manager Truststore Properties
After installing the Cloudera Support server certificate into the Cloudera Manager
        truststore, you must configure Cloudera Manager to use the truststore, as follows:

Log into the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
Select Administration > Settings.
Click the Security category.
Enter the path to the truststore and the password (if necessary):

Setting
Description



Cloudera Manager TLS/SSL Certificate Trust Store File
Enter the complete Cloudera Manager Server host filesystem path to the
                    truststore (the trust .jks). Cloudera Manager Server invokes
                    JVM with -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore to access the specified
                    truststore.


Cloudera Manager TLS/SSL Certificate Trust Store Password
Specify the password (if there is one) for the truststore file. Password is
                    not required to access the truststore, so you can typically leave this field
                    blank. Cloudera Manager Server invokes JVM with
                      -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore.password if this field has an
                    entry.
