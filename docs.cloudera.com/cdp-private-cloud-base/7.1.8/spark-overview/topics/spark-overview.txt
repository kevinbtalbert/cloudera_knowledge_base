Apache Spark Overview
Apache Spark is a distributed, in-memory data processing engine
    designed for large-scale data processing and analytics.
 Apache Spark is a general framework for distributed computing that
      offers high performance for both batch and interactive processing. It
      exposes APIs for Java, Python, and Scala and consists of Spark core and
      several related projects.
 You can run Spark applications locally or distributed across a cluster,
      either by using an interactive shell or by submitting an application.
      Running Spark applications interactively is commonly performed during the
      data-exploration phase and for ad hoc analysis. 
 To run applications distributed across a cluster, Spark requires a
      cluster manager.  Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) supports only the YARN
      cluster manager. When run on YARN, Spark application processes are managed
      by the YARN ResourceManager and NodeManager roles. Spark Standalone is not
      supported. 
 For detailed API information, see the Apache Spark project site. 

note Although this document makes some references
        to the external Spark site, not all the features, components,
        recommendations, and so on are applicable to Spark when used on CDH.
        Always cross-check the Cloudera documentation before building a reliance
        on some aspect of Spark that might not be supported or recommended by
        Cloudera. 

CDP supports Apache Spark, Apache Livy for local and remote access to
      Spark through the Livy REST API, and Apache Zeppelin for browser-based
      notebook access to Spark. The Spark LLAP connector is not supported.
