New topic and consumer group discovery
Kafka topics or consumer groups may not get replicated instantly when they are added to
    white and blacklists. This is due to the default behaviour of how topics and consumer groups are
    discovered by Streams Replication Manager. 
The discovery and replication of newly created topics or consumer groups is not
      instantaneous. Streams Replication Manager checks source clusters for new topics and consumer
      groups periodically, as controlled by the Refresh Topics Interval
        Seconds and Refresh Groups Interval Seconds properties.
      By default both properties are set to 10 minutes. As a result, the discovery and replication
      of new topics or groups can take up to 10 minutes. 
Cloudera does not recommend using a refresh interval lower than the default value for
      production environments as it can lead to severe performance degradation.
