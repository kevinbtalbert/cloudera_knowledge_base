Configuring Remote Querying
Remote Querying in Streams Replication Manager (SRM) refers to the SRM Service's
    capability of querying other, remote SRM Services to fetch the remote cluster replication
    metrics. This allows users to monitor all replications of a deployment that has multiple
    instances of SRM through a single SRM Service.
Related informationRemote QueryingEnabling Remote QueryingRemote Querying can be enabled for a cluster of SRM Service roles (SRM Service     cluster). When this feature is enabled, the configured SRM Service cluster acts as a monitoring     gateway and fetches metrics from other, remote SRM Service clusters. This enables you to monitor     the replications of your whole deployment using a single SRM Service cluster.Configuring the advertised information of the SRM Service roleIf your SRM deployment is located behind a proxy, you must configure the information     advertised by a cluster of SRM Service roles (SRM Service cluster). Otherwise, the SRM Service     cluster cannot be discovered by other SRM Service clusters and Remote Querying will not be     possible.
