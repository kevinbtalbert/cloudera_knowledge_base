Configuring replications
In order to replicate data between clusters, you must configure replications for
    Streams Replication Manager (SRM). Each replication specifies a source->target cluster pair and
    the direction in which data is replicated. Replications can be configured in Cloudera
    Manager.

Configuring replications does not start the replication of data. When you configure your
        replications, SRM sets up communication with the clusters specified within each replication,
        but does not automatically replicate any data. To start replicating data, you must specify
        which topics and groups you want to replicate. This is done using the
          srm-control command line tool. Unless the tool is used to add topics and
        consumer groups to the replication allowlists, the replications you configure remain empty
        (inactive).


In Cloudera Manager, select Streams Replication Manager. Go to Configuration.Add and enable
          replications:
Find the Streams Replication
                Manager's Replication Configs property.
Click the add button and add new lines
              for each unique replication you want to add and enable.
Add and enable your replications. For example:
primary->secondary.enabled=true
secondary->primary.enabled=true


Enter a Reason for change, and then click Save
            Changes to commit the changes.
Restart Streams Replication Manager.

Replications are set up and configured for the specified cluster
      pairs.
Use the srm-control tool to start  replication by adding topics or
      groups to the allowlist.
