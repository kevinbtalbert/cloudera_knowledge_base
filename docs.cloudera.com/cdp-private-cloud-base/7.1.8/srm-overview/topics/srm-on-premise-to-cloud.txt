On-premise to Cloud and Kafka Version Upgrade
On-premise to cloud and Kafka version upgrade example architectures for SRM.
If you have an on-premises Apache Kafka cluster that you want to migrate to the cloud, not only
      do you have to migrate consumers and producers, you also have to migrate topics and their
      messages to the new cloud based cluster. 
After you have set up replication through SRM, you only need to point your consumers to the
      new brokers before you can start processing messages from the cloud cluster. This approach
      ensures that the historical data kept in the on-premises Kafka cluster is migrated to the
      cloud cluster allowing you to replay messages directly from the cloud without having to go
      back to your on-premises cluster.
Figure 1. Cluster Migration On-premise. Producers and
        Consumers are using the on-premises cluster while SRM is replicating messages.
Once you have migrated your cluster, producers, and consumers to the cloud, you can use SRM
      to turn-around the replication direction and use the on-premises cluster as your DR cluster. 
Figure 2. Cluster Migration Cloud. Producers and Consumers
        have been migrated to the cloud cluster and the on-premises cluster is used for disaster
        recovery.
Kafka Version Upgrade
If you have to upgrade your Kafka cluster to a newer version and an in-place upgrade is not
        possible, you can use the same migration approach to provision a new cluster, use SRM to
        replicate all existing topics and messages before migrating your producers and consumers to
        interact with the new cluster.
