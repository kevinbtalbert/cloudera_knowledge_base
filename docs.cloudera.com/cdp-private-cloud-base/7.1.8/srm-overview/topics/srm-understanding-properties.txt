Understanding SRM properties, their configuration and hierarchy
There are a number of configuration properties that Streams Replication Manager (SRM)
    accepts, but are not exposed directly in Cloudera Manager. You can configure these properties
    with the Streams Replication Manager's Replication Configs property. Additionally, these
    properties can be configured on different levels allowing for granular control over how and when
    they are applied.
SRM supports various configuration properties. With the exception of adding and enabling
      replications, all fundamental properties required to set up and start data replication between
      clusters are available for configuration directly through Cloudera Manager, or are configured
      automatically by Cloudera Manager. 
In addition to these properties, SRM accepts and supports a number of additional properties
      including Streams Replication Manager specific properties, Kafka Connect worker properties as
      well as Kafka properties available in the version of Kafka that you are using. These however
      are not directly available for configuration in Cloudera Manager, and do not have dedicated
      configuration entries on the UI. Properties like these are configured through the
        Streams Replication Manager's Replication Configs property.
The configuration properties that you add to Streams Replication Manager's
        Replication Configs can be set on multiple levels with the help of property
      prefixes. These prefixes allow you to exercise control over when and where (at what level) a
      configuration is used by SRM. This gives you fine grained control over how data is
      replicated.
The prefixes that you can use and the configuration levels they correspond to are as
      follows:

Global level - no prefixFor example:
        offset.flush.timeout.ms
Global worker level - prefixed with the workers. prefixFor example:
          workers.scheduled.rebalance.max.delay.ms 
Global connector level - prefixed with the connectors. prefixFor
          example: connectors.producer.override.buffer.memory
Cluster level - prefixed with cluster alias For
        example:[***ALIAS***].offset.flush.timeout.ms
Replication level - prefixed with a replication nameFor
          example:[***ALIAS***]->[***ALIAS***].consumer.max.poll.records

noteAll properties in SRM support prefixes, even the ones that you set directly through the
      Cloudera Manager UI. However, the prefixes for these properties are set automatically in the
      background based on your overall configuration. Therefore, from a user perspective, prefixes
      only become significant when you use Streams Replication Manager's Replication
        Configs.
Properties follow a hierarchy, which is based on what prefix they have. In general, prefixed
      properties take precedence over non-prefixed properties, and more specific prefixes take
      priority over less specific ones. That is, replication level properties take precedence over
      both cluster and global level configurations. Cluster level properties take precedence over
      global level configurations. Lastly, global level configurations are overridden by both
      replication and cluster level properties.
Not all prefixes and configuration levels are valid for all properties. For example, most
      properties related to Kafka client connections (bootstrap servers, aliases, security
      configurations and so on) are not relevant on a replication level. While they can be set, they
      will not have an effect.
The following sections give more information on the available configuration levels/prefixes,
      give examples of what types of properties can be set at each level, as well as recommendations
      on when and how to use each.
Global level
Global configuration is achieved by adding the property on its own, without a prefix. This
        is the most generic configuration, with the lowest priority level.  Global level
        configurations can also be regarded as fallback configurations. This is a result of the
        property hierarchy. SRM will fall back and use a global level configuration if there are no
        cluster or replication level configurations set for a specific property. 
The following types of properties are accepted at this level by SRM:
SRM service level properties
These are SRM-specific configurations that are applied to SRM as a whole. For
              example, mm.rest.protocol is a property typically set at this level,
              as it allows configuring the protocol used by all replication specific Connect REST
              Servers run internally by the SRM Driver to use the same protocol.
Kafka client connection properties
Client connection properties are used by SRM when it connects to a Kafka cluster.
              Client connection properties can be set on a global level, however, not all connection
              related properties are compatible with this level. For example, you can set
                bootstrap.servers on a global level, but because in the majority of
              cases you will have a unique bootstrap server set for each individual connection,
              setting this property on a global level is redundant. As a result, Cloudera
                recommends that you only configure security related connection properties at this
                level and only if you have multiple clusters in your deployment that use the same
                security configuration. For example, you might have a deployment where SRM connects
                to many Kafka clusters, and all of them use the same cipher suite. In a case like
                this you can set ssl.cipher.suites at the global level a single
                time instead of configuring it on a per cluster basis. 
Kafka Connect worker properties 
These configurations are applied to all Kafka Connect workers run internally by the
              SRM Driver. Any Connect worker property is supported at this level as long as it uses
              one of the following prefixes: 
offset.storage
config.storage
status.storage
key.converter

value.converter
header.converter

task
worker
listeners.https
For example, you can configure
                  offset.storage.replication.factor at this level to specify the
                replication factor of the internal topic used to track the source offsets of SRM in
                all target clusters.Other worker properties that do not use the listed
                prefixes can still be configured globally. However, they must be configured on a
                global worker level using the workers. prefix.
Kafka Connect connector properties 
These configurations are applied to all connectors in all replications run
              internally by the SRM Driver. The Connect connector properties supported at this level
              are as follows: 
errors.retry.timeout
errors.retry.delay.max.ms
errors.tolerance
errors.log.enable
errors.log.include.messages
config.properties.exclude
config.properties.blacklist
config.property.filter.class
consumer.poll.timeout.ms
admin.timeout.ms
refresh.topics.enabled
refresh.groups.enabled
sync.topic.configs.enabled
sync.topic.acls.enabled
emit.heartbeats.interval.seconds
emit.checkpoints.interval.seconds
sync.group.offsets.enabled
sync.group.offsets.interval.seconds
replication.policy.class
replication.policy.separator
heartbeats.topic.replication.factor
checkpoints.topic.replication.factor
offset-syncs.topic.replication.factor
offset.lag.max
offset-syncs.topic.location
connect.start.task.timeout.ms
disable.source.topic.auto.creation
copy.source.offset.in.header.enabled


For example, you can configure sync.group.offsets at this level to sync
        the translated consumer group offsets. 
Other connector properties that are not listed can still be configured globally. However,
        they must be configured on a global connector level using the connectors.
        prefix.

Global worker level
Global worker level configuration is achieved by using the workers.
        prefix. This level supports Kafka Connect worker properties only. Properties specified with
        the workers. prefix are applied to all Connect workers run internally by
        the SRM Driver. 
The difference between the global worker level and the global level (no prefix) is that on
        a global level only a handful of Connect worker properties are supported. The global worker
        level on the other hand supports all Connect worker properties. 
For example, scheduled.rebalance.max.delay.ms is not supported on a global
        level, it is not applied to all Connect workers if it is set without a prefix. However,
        specifying the property on a global worker level is supported. That is, when the property is
        set with the workers. prefix, it is applied to all workers.

Global connector level
Global connector level configuration can be achieved by prefixing the configuration
        property with the connectors. prefix. This level supports Kafka Connect
        connector properties only. Properties that use this prefix are applied to all Connect
        connectors run internally by the SRM Driver. 
The difference between the global connector level and the global level (no prefix) is that
        on a global level only a handful of Connect connector properties are supported. The global
        connector level on the other hand supports all Connect connector properties. 
The global connector level prefix can also be used to tweak all consumers and producers
        that are used by the SRM Driver. For example, by using the
          connectors.consumer. prefix, any consumer property can be specified to
        tweak the consumers used in the replications. Similarly, the
          connectors.producer.override. prefix can be used to override producer
        configurations in the replications.

Cluster level
Cluster level configuration is achieved by prefixing the configuration property with a
        cluster alias specified in Streams Replication Manager Cluster alias.
        Cluster level configurations have a higher priority than global configurations. As a result,
        cluster level configurations take precedence over global configurations.
The following types of configurations are accepted at this level by SRM:
Kafka client connection properties 

These configurations are used by SRM to connect to the Kafka cluster identified by
                the alias. SRM is capable of generating connection configurations securely for most
                use-cases and Kafka clusters either through automation, or with Kafka Credentials
                    (Administration > External
                    Accounts > Kafka Credentials).
                Cloudera recommends that you only use automation or Kafka credentials to configure
                these properties. 
For advanced use-cases, or when a specific connection configuration property is not
                available through Kafka credentials, the cluster prefix can be used to specify the
                configuration property. For example, the
                  sasl.login.callback.handler.class property cannot be set using
                Kafka credentials. If in your deployment you are using a third-party callback
                handler and need to specify it for SRM, you can do so by adding
                  sasl.login.callback.handler.class with the appropriate cluster
                prefixes to Streams Replication Manager Replication
                Configs.

Kafka Connect worker properties 
These configurations are applied to Kafka Connect workers which correspond to a
              replication targeting the Kafka cluster identified by the alias prefix. On this level,
              all Connect worker configurations are supported. For example, you can use
                offset.flush.timeout.ms to increase the flush timeout to support
              high-traffic replication flows.


Replication level
Replication level configuration can be achieved by prefixing the configuration property
        with the name of the replication. Replication level configurations have a higher priority
        than cluster or global level configurations. As a result, replication level configurations
        take precedence over both cluster and global configurations.
The following types of configurations are accepted at this level by SRM:
Kafka Connect worker properties using the
              cluster->cluster.worker.prefix 
These properties are applied to the Kafka Connect workers which correspond to the
              replication identified by the prefix. On this level, all Connect worker configurations
              are supported. For example, offset.flush.timeout.ms can be specified
              to increase the flush timeout to support high-traffic replication flows.

Kafka Connect connector properties 

These configurations are applied to all connectors in the replication identified by
                the prefix. 
In addition to the replication specific connector configurations, you can also
                tweak the consumers and producers that are used within a specific replication. For
                example, by using the cluster->cluster.consumer. prefix, any
                consumer property can be specified to tweak the consumers used in the replication.
                Similarly, the cluster->cluster.producer.override. prefix can be
                used to override producer configurations in the replication flow.
