Kafka credentials property reference
A Kafka credential allows services and Cloudera tools to securely connect to Kafka
    clusters that are external to a particular Cloudera Manager instance. Review the Kafka
    credentials property reference to better understand what options you have when configuring and
    setting up a Kafka credential.
Name

Description
Specifies the name of the Kafka credential. For SRM, the name you specify here is
            equivalent to the cluster alias. As a result, this name is used to refer to the cluster
            that the credential defines when configuring SRM properties and when using the
              srm-control tool. Cloudera recommends that you specify unique and
            easily identifiable names. 


Boostrap servers

Description
Specifies the addresses of the Kafka brokers. Add a comma-separated list of host and
            port pairs. The host can be specified as an IP address or an FQDN.
Example
my-kafka-cluster-host-1.com:9093,
            my-kafka-cluster-host-2.com:9093


JAAS secret [1-3]

Description

There are three JAAS Secret properties, numbered 1-3. All three properties can be
              used to specify sensitive JAAS configuration values. Values set in these properties
              can be referenced with placeholders in the JAAS configuration you add to the
                JAAS template property. 



JAAS template

Description
Specifies the JAAS configuration that SRM uses when connecting to this cluster. The
            configuration you add to this property can contain placeholders. These placeholders can
            be used to hide sensitive information. The property accepts and resolves the following
            placeholders: 
##JAAS_SECRET_1##Used to refer to the value set in the JAAS Secret
                    1 property.
##JAAS_SECRET_2##Used to refer to the value set in the JAAS Secret
                    2 property.
##JAAS_SECRET_3##Used to refer to the value set in the JAAS Secret
                    3 property.

Example
org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required
              username="##JAAS_SECRET_1##" password="##JAAS_SECRET_2##";In this example
              ##JAAS_SECRET_1## and ##JAAS_SECRET_2## are used to hide sensitive information. The
              values of the username and password are defined in the JAAS Secret
                1 and JAAS Secret 2 properties.If for
              example the JAAS Secret 1 and JAAS Secret 2 properties were set to
              “username” and “password”, the resolved JAAS configuration would be the
              following:org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="username" password="password";
