SRM Service data traffic reference
The SRM Service generates data traffic when it collects replication related metrics.
    Data traffic is generated between the SRM Service and its target Kafka cluster. Additionally, if
    Remote Querying is set up, data traffic is also generated between different SRM Services that
    are remote to each other. Review these examples to gain a better understanding of how much data
    traffic you should expect in your deployment.


Data transferred between the SRM Service and Kafka
The SRM service generates data traffic between itself and its target Kafka cluster.
            This data traffic is generated as a result of the SRM Service collecting the raw metrics
            from the target Kafka cluster. In the case of:
A single replication.
A single replicated topic with 1000 partitions and 100 messages published per
                second.
A single consumer group.

The amount of data traffic generated is approximately 280 kB per second.
Data transferred between SRM Services by Remote Querying
When Remote Querying is enabled, the SRM Service acting as the designated monitoring
            gateway generates additional data traffic. This data traffic is generated as a result of
            the gateway communicating with other, remote SRM Services and receiving data on remote
            replications. In the case of: 
A single replication flow.
A single replicated topic with 1000 partitions.
A single consumer group.
One hour retention time set for the Streams application.
The maximum amount of data traffic generated by Remote Querying (the data
              returned by other SRM Services) is around 70 kB.
