SRM security example 
Streams Replication Manager (SRM) is capable of replicating data between CDP and
    non-CDP clusters that are secured. A setup like this involves configuring security for the SRM
    service (Driver and Service roles) and the srm-control command line tool.

Consider the following replication environment.

There are two clusters, US-West and US-East. US-West is a CDP cluster that has both Kafka
        and SRM deployed on it. The Kafka service on this cluster is both Kerberos and TLS/SSL
        enabled. That is, clients connecting to this cluster (including SRM) use the
          SASL_SSL protocol. 
US-East has Kafka deployed on it but not SRM. Kafka on this cluster has TLS/SSL encryption
        enabled. More importantly, the platform that this cluster is running on is not defined. This
        is because this example is meant to demonstrate that SRM can connect to and replicate data
        to or from non-CDP clusters. As long as that cluster is running Kafka, SRM will be able to
        connect to it. 
Data replication is unidirectional. The SRM service deployed in US-West is replicating
        Kafka data from US-East to US-West. From the perspective of the SRM service, US-West is its
        co-located Kafka cluster, while US-East is an external Kafka cluster.
The following example walks you through the steps required to set up both the SRM service
        and the srm-control tool for this replication environment. 


The following steps assume that the SRM service is already installed and available on
        US-West. Additionally, it is also assumed that key and truststore files as well as other
        credentials required to establish a connection with each cluster are known and are
        available. The instructions do not go into detail on how you can generate or acquire these
        credentials.

Define the external Kafka cluster (US-East): 
Log into the Cloudera Manager instance managing US-West.
Go to Administration > External
                  Accounts.
Go to the Kafka Credentials tab.
Click Add Kafka credentials.
Create a Kafka credential for US-East:The security configuration
              of the external cluster determines which of the available properties you must set.
              Because in this example US-East has TLS/SSL encryption enabled, the following
              properties must be set:
Name
Bootstrap servers
Security protocol
Truststore Password
Truststore Path
Truststore Type
noteClick the i icon next to
          each property in Cloudera Manager to reveal additional information about each
          property.
Click Add.If credential creation is
              successful, a new entry corresponding to the Kafka credential you specified appears on
              the page.
Define the co-located Kafka cluster (US-West):Co-located Kafka clusters
          can be defined in two separate ways. Either with a service dependency or with Kafka
          credentials. Because in this example US-West is Kerberos and TLS/SSL enabled, the service
          dependency method is used. This is in-line with Cloudera best practices.
In Cloudera Manager, go to Clusters and select the
              Streams Replication Manager service.
Go to Configuration.
Find and enable the Kafka Service
            property.
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Co-located
                Kafka Cluster Alias property.The alias you configure
              represents the co-located cluster. Enter an alias that is unique and easily
              identifiable. For example:uswest
Enable relevant security feature togglesBecause US-West is both
              TLS/SSL and Kerberos enabled, you must enable all feature toggles for both the Driver
              and Service roles. The feature toggles are the following:
Enable TLS/SSL for SRM Driver
Enable TLS/SSL for SRM Service
Enable Kerberos Authentication

Add both clusters to SRM’s configuration:
Find and configure the External Kafka Accounts
              property.Add the name of the Kafka credential you created for
              US-East to this property. This can be done by clicking the add button to add a new
              line to the property and then entering the name of the Kafka credential. For
              example:useast
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Cluster
                alias property.Add all cluster aliases to this property.
              This includes the aliases present in both the External Kafka Accounts and
                Streams Replication Manager Co-located Kafka Cluster Alias properties.
              Delimit the aliases with commas. For
              example:useast, uswest
Configure replications:In this example, data is replicated
          unidirectionally from US-West to US-East. As a result, only a single replication must be
          configured.
Find the Streams Replication Manager's Replication Configs
              property.
Click the add button and add new lines for each unique replication you want
              to add and enable.
Add and enable your replications.For
              example:useast->uswest.enabled=true
Configure Driver and Service role targets:
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Service Target
                Cluster property.Add the co-located cluster’s alias to the
              property.  In the case of this example:useast
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Driver Target
                Cluster property.This property should contain all cluster
              aliases. In the case of this example, you can either add the aliases of both US-West
              and US-East or leave the property empty. Leaving the property empty is the same as
              adding all aliases. 
Click Save Changes.Restart the SRM service.Configure and run the srm-control tool:
Click Gateway in the Filters
              pane.
Find and configure the following properties:

SRM Client's Secure Storage Password
The password used to access the secure storage. Take note of the password you
                    configure. You need to provide it in your CLI session before running the
                    tool.
Environment Variable Holding SRM Client's Secure Storage Password
The name of the environment variable that stores the secure storage password.
                    Take note of the name that you configure. You need to set it in your CLI session
                    before running the tool.
Gateway TLS/SSL Trust Store File
The path to the TLS/SSL truststore file containing the server (co-located
                    cluster’s) certificate and public key. Ensure that this file is available on all
                    SRM hosts.
Gateway TLS/SSL Truststore Password 
The password used to access the truststore file specified in the
                      Gateway TLS/SSL Trust Store File property. 
SRM Client's Kerberos Principal Name
The kerberos principal that the tool uses for authentication when connecting
                    to the co-located Kafka cluster.
SRM Client's Kerberos Keytab Location 
The path to the Kerberos keytab file that the tool uses for authentication
                    when connecting to the co-located Kafka cluster. 


Click Save Changes.
Re-deploy client configuration.
SSH into one of the SRM hosts in your cluster.
Set the secure storage password as an environment variable.
export [***SECURE STORAGE ENV VAR***]=”[***SECURE STORAGE PASSWORD***]”
Replace [***SECURE STORAGE ENV VAR***] with the name of the
                environment variable you specified in Environment Variable Holding SRM
                  Client's Secure Storage Password. Replace [***SRM SECURE
                  STORAGE PASSWORD***] with the password you specified in SRM
                  Client's Secure Storage Password. For example:
                export SECURESTOREPASS=”mypassword
