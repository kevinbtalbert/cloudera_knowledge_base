Configure SRM for Failover and Failback
Learn how to configure Streams Replication Manager (SRM) for failover and
    failback.

To prepare for a failover or failback scenario you must set up SRM with bidirectional
        replication. Additionally, you must ensure that all mission critical topics and consumer
        groups are added to the allowlist on both the primary and backup clusters. Optionally, you
        can also choose to enable automatic group offset synchronization, which can simplify the
        steps you need to take when migrating consumer groups.



Ensure that the SRM service is configured and all clusters are taking part in the
          replication process are defined and added to SRM's configuration. For more information,
          see Defining and adding clusters for replication. 
Ensure that the srm-control tool is configured. For more information,
          see Configuring srm-control.
If you plan on enabling automatic group offset synchronization, ensure that you review
            Configuring automatic group offset
          synchronization. Although the basic steps are provided here, the feature has some
          limitations that you must be aware of. 
The following steps and examples are for a replication scenario with two clusters. These
          are referred to as primary and secondary.


Set up bidirectional replication between clusters:
In Cloudera Manager, go to Clusters and select the
              Streams Replication Manager service.
Go to Configuration
Find the Streams Replication Manager's Replication
                Configs property.
Click the add button and add new lines for each unique replication you want
              to add and enable.
Add and enable your replications. 
For example, assume that you have two clusters, primary and
                  secondary. To enable bidirectional replication between these
                clusters, you must add two unique replications. One that replicates from
                  primary to secondary and another that replicates
                from secondary to primary. 
primary->secondary.enabled=true
secondary->primary.enabled=true


Optional: Enable and configure automatic group offset
          synchronization.
This can be done by enabling sync.group.offsets.enabled. Optionally,
            if you want to customize the frequency of offset synchronization, you can also set
              sync.group.offsets.interval.seconds. Both properties are configured
            by adding them to Streams Replication Manager's Replication
              Configs. For example:
sync.group.offsets.enabled = true
sync.group.offsets.interval.seconds = [***TIME IN SECONDS***]
Enter a Reason for change, and then click Save
            Changes to commit the changes.
Restart Streams Replication Manager.
Add the required consumer groups and topics to the allowlist on the
            primary cluster.

Add
              groups:srm-control groups --source [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --target [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --add [GROUP1],[GROUP2]
Add
              topics:srm-control topics --source [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --target [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --add [TOPIC1],[TOPIC2]

Add the required consumer groups and topics to the allowlist on the
            secondary cluster.
important
If remote topics and consumer groups are not added to the allowlist on the
                secondary cluster, a failback operation will be impossible to carry
              out. 


Add
              groups:srm-control groups --source [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --target [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --add [GROUP1],[GROUP2]

Add
              topics:srm-control topics --source [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --target [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --add [PRIMARY_CLUSTER.TOPIC1],[PRIMARY_CLUSTER.TOPIC2]

Verify that all required topics and consumer groups are added to the
          allowlist.

Verify consumer
              groups:srm-control groups --source [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --target [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --listsrm-control groups --source [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --target [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --list

Verify
              topics:srm-control topics --source [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --target [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --listsrm-control topics --source [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --target [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --list




SRM is set up with bidirectional replication and all mission critical topics and consumer
        groups are added to the allowlist on both the primary and
          secondary clusters.
