Running a Hive command in Data Hub
You can run most Hive commands that push configuration variables to Hive SQL scripts
        from the command line of a node in your cluster. You use a keyword and options to launch
        these commands in Beeline.

Hive supports running Hive commands from the command line. The command you enter
                launches Beeline in the background. The -e flag followed by a Hive
                    set command lists system variables. 


On the command line of a node in your CDP cluster, enter the
                        hive command to send configuration properties to standard
                    output.

> hive -e set

Supported commands appear. All obsolete Hive CLI commands are supported by
                    Beeline except set key=value commands that configure Hive
                    Metastore.
The output includes the system variable
