Running the HBCK2 tool
You can run the HBCK2 tool from the command-line interface in your target
        cluster.

The HBCK2 tool is a part of the hbase-operator-tools binary. Once you get the
                hbase-operator-tools binary from Cloudera, upload the binary tarball to the target
                cluster and extract the tarball. The HBCK2 JAR file is contained in the operator
                tools tarball provided by Cloudera Support at
                    hbase-operator-tools-<version>/hbase-hbck2/hbase-hbck2-<version>.jar.
            


Run the HBCK2 tool by specifying the JAR path with the “-j” option as shown
                    here:

$ hbase hbck -j $HOME/hbase-operator-tools-<version>/hbase-hbck2/hbase-hbck2-<version>.jar
When you run the command, the HBCK2 tool command-line menu appears.


As a Cloudera Support or Professional Services personnel using this tool to
                        remediate an HBase cluster, you can gather useful information using these
                        commands as an HBase super user (typically, hbase), or an HBase principal if
                        Kerberos is
                        enabled:$ hdfs dfs -ls -R /hbase/ 2>&1 | tee /tmp/hdfs-ls.txt
$ hbase hbck -details 2>&1 | tee /tmp/hbase-hbck.txt
$ echo "scan 'hbase:meta'" | hbase shell 2>&1 | tee /tmp/hbase-meta.txt
