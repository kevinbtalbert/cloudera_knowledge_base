HeapDumpPath (/tmp) in Hive data nodes gets full due to .hprof files

Condition
The HeapDumpPath (/tmp) in Hive nodes often gets full because of
                the .hprof files that are generated. Manually deleting these
                files to free up space does not always help because the files are generated every
                time there is an exception. Learn how to resolve this issue by modifying the
                relevant Tez properties.


Cause
A .hprof file is created when a process exits with an Out Of
                    Memory exception, and the file captures the state of Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
                    when it crashes.
The default value for HeapDumpPath in the Tez Application Master and Tez Task
                    Command Line Options properties is set to /tmp and
                    therefore, Tez saves all the heap dump files in this location.
If you do not want the heap dump files to be saved in /tmp,
                    you can either set the HeapDumpPath value to a different location on the node or
                    choose not to capture heap dump (.hprof) files when a process exits.

Solution

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an administrator.

Go to Clusters > Tez > Configuration and search for the 'Tez Application Master Command Line
                            Options' and 'Tez Task Command Line Options' properties.






Choose one of the following solutions:
If you want to...Then...
Choose a different location in the Hive node to capture
                                    heap dumps
Modify the value of XX:HeapDumpPath in the
                                    above properties from /tmp to a different
                                    location, for example, /var/tmp.

Disable automatic capture of heap dumps
Remove -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
                                        -XX:HeapDumpPath=/tmp parameters from the above
                                        properties.noteYou can add these
                                        parameters when you want to work with heap dumps or when you
                                        require heap dumps for debugging purposes.
