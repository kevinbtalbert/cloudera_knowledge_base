Unable to execute queries due to atomic block

Condition
You may see the following error after submitting a query from Hue, while logging into
                Hue, or while saving documents and workflows:
                    "TransactionManagementError: An error occurred in the current
                    transaction. You can't execute queries until the end of the 'atomic'
                    block."


Cause
If there is a load on Hue's backend database and slower processing of operations
                    such as saving documents or workflows, running INSERT or UPDATE queries from
                    multiple users, then the database puts an atomic block on the table rows. If you
                    are using MySQL or MariaDB as the backend database for Hue, then you can
                    increase the value of the innodb-lock-wait-timeout parameter
                    along with a few other timeout parameters in the my.cnf file.

Solution

SSH into the database host as an Administrator.

Back up the my.cnf configuration file as
                            follows:

cp /etc/my.cnf  /[***BACKUP-DIRECTORY***]


Open the my.cnf file for editing and add the following
                            two lines under the [mysqld] section:

vi /etc/my.cnf


[mysqld]
wait_timeout = 28800
interactive_timeout = 28800


Save the file and exit from the editor.

Restart the database server.
