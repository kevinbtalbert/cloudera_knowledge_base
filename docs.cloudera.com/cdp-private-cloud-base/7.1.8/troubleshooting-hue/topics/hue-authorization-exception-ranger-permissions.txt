"Authorization Exception" error on submitting queries in Hue
If you have secured your cluster using Ranger, then you must grant the required
        permissions to your users and groups from the Ranger web UI. If your users do not have
        proper permissions, then they may not be able to access certain databases or tables from the
        Hue editor.
If your users see the "Authorization Exception: User does not have privileges to
            execute..." error on submitting queries from the Hue editor, then grant them the proper
            permissions using the Ranger web UI.

Log into Cloudera Manager as an administrator.

Go to Clusters > Ranger service > Instances tab and note down the hostname corresponding to the Ranger
                        Usersync role type.

Open the Ranger web UI by clicking Ranger Admin Web
                    UI.

SSH into the Ranger Usersync host that you noted in step 2 and add the user or
                    the group as follows:

ssh root@example.domain.site useradd [***USERNAME/GROUP-NAME***] passwd [***PASSWORD***]


On the Ranger web UI, click Hadoop SQL listed under the
                        HADOOP SQL service.
