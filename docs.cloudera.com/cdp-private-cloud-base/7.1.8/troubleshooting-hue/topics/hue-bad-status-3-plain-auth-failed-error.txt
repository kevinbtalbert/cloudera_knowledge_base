Error validating LDAP user in HueCloudera Docs
Error validating LDAP user in Hue
Hive can use LDAP and Kerberos both, if they are enabled on your CDP cluster. By
        default, Hive uses LDAP to authenticate the Hue service instead of Kerberos. As a result,
        you may see the following error after logging in to Hue web interface or while trying to
        access the Hive editor: Bad status: 3 (PLAIN auth failed: Error validating LDAP
            user). 
Additionally, you may not be able to view databases or
            Hive tables. To resolve this issue, you can enforce the client connections (between Hive
            and Hue) to use Kerberos instead of LDAP by configuring the value of the
                hive.server2.authentication property to KERBEROS
            in the Hue hive-site.xml file.

Log into Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                            hive-site.xml.

Click View as XML and add the following lines in the
                    text box:

<property>
    <name>hive.server2.authentication</name>
    <value>KERBEROS</value>
</property>

Alternatively, you can click + to enable the Editor
                    mode and specify hive.server2.authentication in the
                        Name field and KERBEROS in the
                        Value field.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.

The hive.server2.authentication property is
            appended to the hive/conf/hive-site.xml file. From now on, Hive
            will use Kerberos to authenticate access requests from the Hive editor within Hue and
            LDAP when you access Hive using Beeline.
