Unable to connect Oracle database to Hue using SCAN
For high availability purposes, you may want Hue to stay connected to any Oracle
        database instances running in your cluster. Single Client Access Name (SCAN) serves as a
        cluster alias for databases in the cluster. Currently, Cloudera Manager does not provide an
        option to use SCAN to connect to the Oracle database. To use SCAN, you must temporarily
        install a MySQL database to create a Hue service and then specify Oracle settings in the Hue
        advanced configuration snippet.

It is possible that other clusters or services may be able to connect to the database
                using the Oracle SQL Developer. But you may see the following error when you try to
                add the Hue service using the Cloudera Manager Add Service wizard and specifying
                SCAN on the Setup Database page: “Able to find
                    the Database server, but not the specified database. Please check if the
                    database name is correct and make sure that the user can access the
                    database.” 


Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an administrator.

Add the Hue service using a MySQL database.

Check whether the Hue service is added successfully by launching the web
                    UI.

After the Hue service is running, go to Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Hue service > Configuration.

Add the following lines in the Hue Service Advanced Configuration
                        Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini field:

[desktop]
[[database]]
port=0
engine=oracle
name=[***ORACLE-SCAN***]/[***SERVICE-NAME***]
user=[***HUE-DB-USER***]


noteSpecify port=0 because the port used for the Oracle database (1521) is
                        part of the SCAN.


Enter the database password in the Hue Database Password
                    field.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.

Check whether you can access your databases from the Hue web UI.

Uninstall the MySQL database if no longer needed.
