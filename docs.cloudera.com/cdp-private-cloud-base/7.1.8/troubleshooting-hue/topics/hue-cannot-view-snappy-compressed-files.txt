Unable to view Snappy-compressed files
You must install the python-snappy library on your cluster to view
        files compressed with Snappy using the Hue File Browser and the HBase Browser.
        Post-installation, Hue automatically detects and displays the Snappy-compressed
        files.

The python-snappy library is incompatible with the python library
                called snappy. You must uninstall snappy if it is
                present on your cluster.
Run the following command to check whether the snappy library is
                installed on your cluster:/usr/bin/pip show snappy
No output on the console indicates that the snappy library is not
                installed on your cluster. If you get any results for snappy, then
                uninstall it by running the following
                command:/usr/bin/pip uninstall snappy
Next, check whether you have the python-snappy library is installed
                on your cluster by running the following
                command:/usr/bin/pip show python-snappy
Sample
                output:Name: python-snappy
Version: 0.5.4
Location: /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages


Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Stop the Hue service by going to Cluster > Hue service > Action .

Change to the following directory depending on whether you have used parcels or
                    packages to set up your CDH cluster.
For parcels:
                    cd /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hue
For package: cd /usr/lib/hue

Install the python-snappy package by running the following
                    commands:

yum install gcc gcc-c++ python-devel snappy-devel
./build/env/bin/pip install -U setuptools
./build/env/bin/pip install python-snappy


Verify that the python-snappy library is readable by all users
                    by running the following commands:

ls -lart `locate snappy.py`

The output should be similar to the
                    following:-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 11900 Sep  1 12:25 /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/snappy.py
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 10344 Sep  1 12:26 /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/snappy.pyc

Start the Hue service by going to Cluster > Hue service > Action.

Verify that the python-snappy library is working for Hue by
                    running the following command:

sudo -u hue /bin/bash -c "echo 'import snappy' | python"

If the python-snappy library is working as expected, then no
                    output is displayed for this command.

You should be able to view Snappy-compressed files on the
            Hue File Browser and the HBase Browser using the Hue web interface.
