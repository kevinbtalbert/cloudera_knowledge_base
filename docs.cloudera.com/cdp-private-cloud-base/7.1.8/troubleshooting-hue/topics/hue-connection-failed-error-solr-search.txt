Connection failed error when accessing the Search app (Solr) from Hue
If you are using Solr with Hue to generate interactive dashboards and for indexing
        data, and if you have deployed two Solr services on your cluster and selected the second one
        as a dependency for Hue, then Cloudera Manager assigns the hostname of the first Solr
        service and the port number of the second Solr service resulting in an incorrect Solr URL in
        the search section of the hue.ini file. As a result, you may see a “Connection failed” error
        when you try to access the Search app from the Hue web UI.

For example, consider two Solr services with the following configuration:
                Solr-1, hostname=solr1, port:2345Solr-2, hostname=solr2, port=4567
If you select Solr-2 as a dependent service for Hue, then Cloudera Manager updates
                the search section of the hue.ini file as
                follows:[search]
# URL of the Solr Server
 solr_url=http://solr2:2345/solr/
As a result, you may not be able to access the Search app from the Hue web UI. To
                resolve this issue:


Log into Cloudera Manager as an administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration and add the following lines in the Hue Service
                        Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        hue_safety_valve.ini field:

[search]
# URL of the Solr Server
solr_url=http://[***HOSTNAME***]:[***PORT***]/solr/

For example:
                    solr_url=http://solr2:4567/solr/

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
