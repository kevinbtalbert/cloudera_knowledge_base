Disabling the web metric collection for Hue

Condition
You see the following error in the Hue server logs: DatabaseError:
                    ORA-01000: maximum open cursors exceeded, when you are using
                Oracle as the backend database for Hue.


Cause
Cloudera Manager Agent collects web metrics from the Hue server to monitor its
                    health. At times, the number of metrics that are collected can exhaust the
                    number of available cursors on the Oracle database, resulting in the
                        ORA-01000: maximum open cursors exceeded
                    error.

Solution

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue > Configuration and deselect the Web Metric
                                Collection option.

noteRestarting the Hue service from time to time
                                can also clear the cursors, but temporarily. For a long-term
                                resolution, consider turning off the Web Metric
                                    Collection option or reducing the frequency of the
                                metric collection using the Web Metric Collection
                                    Duration option in Cloudera Manager.







Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
