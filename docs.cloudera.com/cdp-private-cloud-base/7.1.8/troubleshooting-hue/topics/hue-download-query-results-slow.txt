Downloading query results from Hue takes time
If downloading query results from the Hue web UI takes time or if the operation
        exits
        with the "Invalid query handle" message, then you can improve the processing speed by
        increasing the number of threads used by the Hue web server.

Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an
                    Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration and search the cherrypy_server_threads
                    property.
The Hue Web Server Threads field is displayed.

Increase the thread count to 100 or a
                    higher
                    value.
The default Hue web server thread count is 50.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
