Unable to log into Hue with Knox
Opening Hue from Cloudera Manager or Knox Gateway Home may fail if the Kerberos
        principal name for the Knox service is different from the default Kerberos principal defined
        in the hue.ini file. To resolve this issue, you must set the value of the knox_principal
        property to your custom Kerberos principal name for Knox in the Hue Advanced Configuration
        Snippet, so that Hue's login mechanism (KnoxSpenegoDjangoBackend) can authenticate using
        Knox's Kerberos principal name.

If logging into Hue fails due to a mismatch between the custom Kerberos principal
                name for Knox and the default Kerberos principal name defined in the hue.ini file,
                then you may see the following error in the access.log file: Failed to
                    verify provided username set(['KNOX-PRINCIPAL-NAME']) with
                    set(['knox']).


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.
Optional: 
Note the Kerberos principal name for the Knox service from Clusters > Knox service > Configuration > Kerberos Principal.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                            hue_safety_valve.ini and enter the following lines:

[desktop]
[[knox]]
knox_principal=[***KNOX-PRINCIPAL-NAME***]

Replace [***KNOX-PRINCIPAL-NAME***] with the Kerberos
                    principal name for the Knox service that you obtained earlier.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.

You should be able to log into Hue from the Knox Gateway UI > cdp-proxy topology.
