If an error such as “The username or password you entered is incorrect” appears when

        in to the Knox Gateway using the command-line interface.

Figure 1. Knox Gateway UI: Incorrect username or password




Open a terminal session.

SSH into the Knox Gateway host by entering the following command:

ssh [***KNOX-USERNAME***]@[***KNOX-HOST***].[***DOMAIN***].site

Replace [***KNOX-HOST***].[***DOMAIN***].site with the
                    Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of your Knox Gateway host.
For example:ssh john@abc-1.example.com

Enter the password that you used on the Knox Gateway web UI.
If you are able to log in using these credentials, then you should be able to
                    log into the Knox Gateway UI.
