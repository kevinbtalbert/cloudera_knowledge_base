Hue load balancer does not start after enabling TLS
If the Hue load balancer does not start after you enable TLS, then check whether your
        TLS private key file is password protected. To resolve this issue, you must configure the
        Hue load balancer to use the corresponding key password using Cloudera Manager.

At startup, the Hue load balancer reads the private key file as defined in the Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Load Balancer TLS/SSL Server Private Key File (PEM
                        Format) configuration property. If the TLS private key file is password
                protected, then you may see error such as Fatal error initialising
                    mod_ssl, exiting and Some of your private key files
                    are encrypted for security reasons. In order to read them you have to provide
                    the pass phrases. in the
                    /var/log/hue-httpd/error_log Hue load balancer log
                file.


SSH into the Hue host as an Administrator.

Create a password file in your chosen security directory and insert the private
                    key password, as shown in the following example:

# echo "abc123" > /etc/security/password.txt
# chown hue:hue password.txt
# chmod 700 password.txt


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration and enter the file path and the filename of the password file in
                    the Hue Load Balancer TLS/SSL Server SSLPassPhraseDialog
                    field.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
