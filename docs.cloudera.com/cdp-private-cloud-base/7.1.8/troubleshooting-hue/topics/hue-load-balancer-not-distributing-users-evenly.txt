The Hue load balancer not distributing users evenly across various Hue servers
The Hue load balancer redirects the new users to the newly added Hue servers and the
        existing users to the existing Hue servers on your cluster. Even though you add more Hue
        servers to meet the growing user base, the resources might not be utilized
        effectively.

The Hue load balancer is tasked to evenly distribute users across the available Hue
                servers for effective resource utilization. However, due to session persistence, it
                does not distribute users evenly. To overcome this issue, you can refresh the
                cookies from Cloudera Manager.
The load balancer uses the cookie ROUTEID with a random string from your browser and
                is stored in the hue.conf file. This random string is used to
                redirect a user to the Hue server. To refresh the cookie and set a new random string
                every time you add a new Hue server, do the following:


Go to Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Hue > Configuration.

Click Scope > Load balancer and select the Hue Load Balancer Cookie
                        Refresh checkbox.
This refreshes the cookie value in the hue.conf file to
                    rebalance the Hue backend connections.

In the Instances tab, select all the Hue services and
                    roles, and click Action for Services > Restart.
This creates a new random string for the cookie which the load balancer can
                    now use to evenly distribute users.

Whenever you restart the Hue server, the load balancer will redistribute users
            evenly based on the server load.
