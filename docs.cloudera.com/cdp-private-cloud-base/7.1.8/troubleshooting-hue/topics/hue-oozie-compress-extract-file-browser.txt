Requirements for compressing and extracting files using Hue File Browser 
Downloading multiple files from the Hue File Browser is not supported directly. If
        you want to download multiple files, you can compress them into a zip file and download the
        zip file. To use the compress and extract function, you must have the Oozie service
        installed on your cluster, along with other zip and unzip utilities.
Condition
You do not see the Compress option on the File
                    Browser page in Hue.


Cause
This can happen because you may not have the Oozie service installed on your
                    cluster, or it is not configured to be used with Hue.

Solution
You must have the Oozie service
                    installed on your cluster. After installing Oozie, go to Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Hue service > Configuration, and select the Oozie Service option.
                    Click Save Changes and restart the Hue service.You
                        must also install the following utilities for compressing and extracting
                        files on your cluster:
zip
unzip
tar
bzip2
noteThe option to compress files is not
                        available in Cloudera Data Warehosue.
