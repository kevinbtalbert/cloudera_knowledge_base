Unable to use pip command in CDP
You may not be able to use the pip command in CDP releases 7.1.7 and above and may
        see the following error when using pip in a command: “ImportError: cannot import name
        chardet”.

To fix this issue and use the pip command, you must download
                    pip from pypi.org
                and
                copy the chardet package to the target directory.


SSH into the Hue host as a root user.

Change to the following directory:

cd /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hue


Check the pip version by running the following command:

./build/env/bin/pip --version


Download the pip package by running the following
                    command:

wget https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/53/7f/55721ad0501a9076dbc354cc8c63ffc2d6f1ef360f49ad0fbcce19d68538/pip-20.3.4.tar.gz -O ~/pip-20.3.4.tar.gz


Extract the tar file by running the following command:

tar xvzf ~/pip-20.3.4.tar.gz -C ~


Copy the chardet package to the target directory by running
                    the following command:

cp -R ~/pip-20.3.4/src/pip/_vendor/chardet build/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip/_vendor/.


Verify that you can run a pip command without any error by running any of the
                    following sample commands:
./build/env/bin/pip freezeor

./build/env/bin/pip list
