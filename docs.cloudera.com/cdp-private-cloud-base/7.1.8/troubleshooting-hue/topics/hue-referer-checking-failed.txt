Referer checking failed because domain does not match any trusted origins
You may see a "Referer checking failed" error in the Hue access.log
        file if the Knox Gateway DNS does not resolve properly when accessing Hue using the Knox
        Gateway UI. 
Follow the steps listed in this topic if you see the
            following error in the Hue access.log
            file:”POST /accounts/login HTTP/1.1" — Referer checking failed -https://<ip_address>:<knoxui_port>/gateway/cdp-proxy/hue/hue/accounts/login?next=%2F%253FdoAs%253Dknoxui does not match any trusted origins.”

The Knox Gateway DNS may not resolve due to various reasons. Verify the following
                before proceeding:
Verify that the Knox
                        proxy
                        user configuration is set properly in the Hue
                        configuration
Check whether the hostnames specified in the Hue service > Configuration > Knox Proxy Hosts fields are spelled correctly
Make sure that the DNS is set up correctly by logging into the DNS server
                        and pinging a few hosts
Make sure that the /etc/hosts file has the correct
                        mapping of the IP address and the hosts



Go to Clusters > $Knox service > Instances and click on the Knox Gateway hostname.

Note down the IP address of the Knox Gateway host from the
                        Details
                    section.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configurations and search for the Knox Proxy Hosts field.
                

Enter the IP address of the Knox Gateway host that you noted earlier.

Click Save Changes.

Verify whether you can access the Knox Gateway through the following URL:

https://[***IP_ADDRESS***]:[***KNOXUI_PORT***]/gateway/cdp-proxy/hue/hue/accounts/login?
