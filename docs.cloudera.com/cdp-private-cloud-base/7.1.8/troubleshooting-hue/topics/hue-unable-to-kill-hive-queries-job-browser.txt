Unable to terminate Hive queries from the Hue Job Browser in a Kerberized cluster
On a Kerberized cluster, if YARN does not have Kerberos authentication enabled for
        HTTP web consoles, then you may not be able to terminate Hive queries from the Hue Job
        Browser, and you may see the following error in the Hue role log
            runcpserver.log file: "The default static user cannot carry out this
        operation. (error 403)".

On a Kerberized cluster, YARN must have Kerberos authentication enabled for HTTP web
                consoles. If authentication is not enabled, then the user or application that is
                trying to access YARN using a REST API is identified as the default "dr.who" user.
                The default user does not have permissions to access the YARN UI and terminate the
                running jobs. As an immediate solution, you can terminate the job from the Hue query
                editor or from the YARN CLI using the following command:
                yarn application -kill [***APPLICATION-ID***]
To enable terminating jobs and running queries from the Hue Job Browser, enable
                Kerberos authentication for HTTP web consoles for YARN as follows:


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > YARN > Configuration and type enable kerberos in the search
                    box.

Select Enable Kerberos Authentication for HTTP
                        Web-Consoles.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the YARN service.
