Already present: FS layout already exists
When Kudu starts, it checks each configured data directory, expecting either for all
      to be initialized or for all to be empty. If a server fails to start with a log message such
      as the following, then this precondition check has failed.Check failed: _s.ok() Bad status: Already present: Could not create new FS layout: FSManager root is not empty: /data0/kudu/data This could be because Kudu was
            configured with non-empty data directories on first startup, or because a
            previously-running, healthy Kudu process was restarted and at least one data directory
            was deleted or is somehow corrupted, perhaps because of a disk error. If it is the
            latter, see Changing directory configuration.
