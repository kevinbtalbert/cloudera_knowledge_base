Block cache size
Kudu uses an LRU cache for recently read data. On workloads that scan a subset of the
    data repeatedly, raising the size of this cache can offer significant performance benefits. To
    increase the amount of memory dedicated to the block cache, increase the value of the --block_cache_capacity_mb flag. The default is 512
    MiB.

          Kudu provides a set of useful metrics for evaluating the performance of the block
          cache, which can be found on the /metrics endpoint of the Web UI. The
          following is an example set:
        
{
  "name": "block_cache_inserts",
  "value": 64
},
{
  "name": "block_cache_lookups",
  "value": 512
},
{
  "name": "block_cache_evictions",
  "value": 0
},
{
  "name": "block_cache_misses",
  "value": 96
},
{
  "name": "block_cache_misses_caching",
  "value": 64
},
{
  "name": "block_cache_hits",
  "value": 0
},
{
  "name": "block_cache_hits_caching",
  "value": 352
},
{
  "name": "block_cache_usage",
  "value": 6976
}

          To judge the efficiency of the block cache on a tablet server, first wait until the
          server has been running and serving normal requests for some time, so the cache is not
          cold. Unless the server stores very little data or is idle,
          block_cache_usage should be equal or nearly equal to
          block_cache_capacity_mb. Once the cache has reached steady state,
          compare block_cache_lookups to
          block_cache_misses_caching. The latter metric counts the number of
          blocks that Kudu expected to read from cache but which weren’t found in the cache.
          If a significant amount of lookups result in misses on expected cache hits, and
          theblock_cache_evictions metric is significant compared to
          block_cache_inserts, then raising the size of the block cache may
          provide a performance boost. However, the utility of the block cache is highly
          dependent on workload, so it’s necessary to test the benefits of a larger block
          cache.
        
note
          Do not raise the block cache size --block_cache_capacity_mb higher
          than the memory pressure threshold (defaults to 60% of
          --memory_limit_hard_bytes). As this would cause poor flushing
          behavior, Kudu servers version 1.8 and higher will refuse to start when misconfigured
          in this way.
