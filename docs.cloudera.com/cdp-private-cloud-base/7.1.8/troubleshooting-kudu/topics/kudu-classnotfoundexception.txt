ClassNotFoundException: com.cloudera.kudu.hive.KuduStorageHandler
You will encounter this exception when you try to access a Kudu table using Hive. This
      is not a case of a missing jar, but simply that Impala stores Kudu metadata in Hive in a
      format that is unreadable to other tools, including Hive itself. and Spark. Currently, there
      is no workaround for Hive users. Spark users can work around this by creating temporary
      tables.
