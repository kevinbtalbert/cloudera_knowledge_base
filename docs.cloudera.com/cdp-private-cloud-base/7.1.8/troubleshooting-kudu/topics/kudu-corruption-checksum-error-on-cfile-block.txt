Corruption: checksum error on CFile block
In versions prior to Kudu 1.8.0, if the data on disk becomes corrupt, you will
    encounter warnings containing "Corruption: checksum error on CFile block" in the tablet server
    logs and client side errors when trying to scan tablets with corrupt CFile blocks. Fixing this
    corruption is a manual process. 

        To fix the issue, first identify all the affected tablets by running a checksum scan on
        the affected tables or tablets using the
        ksck
        tool.
      
sudo -u kudu kudu cluster ksck <master_addresses> -checksum_scan -tables=<tables>
sudo -u kudu kudu cluster ksck <master_addresses> -checksum_scan -tablets=<tablets>
 If there
      is at least one replica for each tablet that does not return a corruption error, you can
      repair the bad copies by deleting them and forcing them to be re-replicated from the leader
      using the remote_replica delete tool. 
sudo -u kudu kudu remote_replica delete <tserver_address> <tablet_id> "Cfile Corruption"

        If all of the replica are corrupt, then some data loss has occurred. Until
        KUDU-2526
        is completed, this can happen if the corrupt replica became the leader and the existing
        follower replicas are replaced.
      
 If data
      has been lost, you can repair the table by replacing the corrupt tablet with an empty one
      using the unsafe_replace_tablet tool. 
sudo -u kudu kudu tablet unsafe_replace_tablet <master_addresses> <tablet_id>

        From versions 1.8.0 onwards, Kudu will mark the affected replicas as failed, leading to
        their automatic re-replication elsewhere.
