After you have identified a reference master, you need to copy the master data to the
    replacement master node. You need to bring the Kudu clusters down. Therefore, identify at least
    a one-hour maintenance window for this task.

Remove the dead master from the Raft configuration of the master using the kudu
            master remove command.
In the following example dead master master-2 is being
          recovered:$ sudo -u kudu kudu master remove master-1,master-2 master-2

On the replacement master host, add the replacement master to the cluster using the
            kudu master add command. 

Look for any success or error messages on the console or the replacement master log
            file. The command is designed to be idempotent so in case of an error after the issue
            mentioned in the error messages is fixed, run the same command again to make forward
            progress. After the completion of the procedure irrespective of whether the procedure is
            successful, the replacement master is shutdown. In the following example, replacement
            master master-2 is used. In case DNS alias is not being used, use the
            hostname of the replacement master.
$ sudo -u kudu kudu master add master-1 master-2 --fs_wal_dir=/data/kudu/master/wal \
--fs_data_dirs=/data/kudu/master/data


If the cluster was set up with DNS aliases, reconfigure the DNS alias for the dead master to point at the replacement master.
          
        

If the cluster was set up without DNS aliases, perform the following steps:


Modify the value of the master_addresses configuration parameter
              for each live master removing the dead master and substituting it with the replacement
              master. 
The new value must be a comma-separated list of all of the masters. Each entry is
              a string of the form <hostname>:<port>:
 hostname 

 The master's previously recorded hostname or alias 

 port 

 The master's previously recorded RPC port number 




Restart the remaining live masters.



Start the replacement master.

If the cluster was set up without DNS aliases, perform the following steps for tablet
          servers:


Modify the value of the tserver_master_addr configuration
              parameter for each live master removing the dead master and substituting it with the
              replacement master. 
The new value must be a comma-separated list of all of the masters. Each entry is
              a string of the form <hostname>:<port>:
 hostname 

 The master's previously recorded hostname or alias 

 port 

 The master's previously recorded RPC port number 




Restart all tablet servers.




To verify that all masters are working properly, consider performing the
        following checks: 

 Using a browser, visit each masterâ€™s web UI and navigate to the
                /masters page. All the masters should now be listed there with one
              master in the LEADER role and the others in the
                FOLLOWER role. The contents of /masters on each
              master should be the same. 


 Run a Kudu system check (ksck) on the cluster using the
                kudu command line tool.
