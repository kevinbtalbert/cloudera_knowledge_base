Runtime error: Could not create thread: Resource temporarily unavailable (error
    11)
You may encounter this error when Kudu is unable to create more threads, usually on
  versions older than Kudu 1.7. It happens on tablet servers, and is a sign that the tablet server
  hosts too many tablet replicas. To fix the issue, you can raise
        the nproc ulimit as detailed in the documentation for your operating system
        or distribution.  However, the better solution is
   to reduce the number of replicas on the tablet server. This may involve rethinking the table's
   partitioning schema. For the recommended limits on number of replicas per tablet server, see the
    Scaling recommendations and limitations  topic.
