Tombstoned or STOPPED tablet replicas
You may notice some replicas on a tablet server are in a STOPPED state and remain on
      the server indefinitely. These replicas are tombstones. A tombstone indicates that the tablet
      server once held a bona fide replica of its tablet.
For
         example, in case a tablet server goes down and its replicas are re-replicated elsewhere, if
         the tablet server rejoins the cluster, its replicas will become tombstones. A tombstone
         will remain until the table it belongs to is deleted, or a new replica of the same tablet
         is placed on the tablet server. A count of tombstoned replicas and details of each one are
         available on the /tablets page of the
         tablet server web UI. The Raft consensus algorithm that Kudu uses for replication requires
         tombstones for correctness in certain rare situations. They consume minimal resources and
         hold no data. They must not be deleted.
