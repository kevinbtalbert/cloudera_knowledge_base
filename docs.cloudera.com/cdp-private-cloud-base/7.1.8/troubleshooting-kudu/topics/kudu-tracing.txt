Kudu tracing
The Kudu master and tablet server daemons include built-in support for tracing based
      on the open source Chromium Tracing framework. You can use tracing to diagnose latency issues
      or other problems on Kudu servers. 
Accessing the tracing web interfaceThe tracing interface is part of the embedded web server in each of the Kudu daemons,   and can be accessed using a web browser. Note that while the interface has been known to work in   recent versions of Google Chrome, other browsers may not work as expected.RPC timeout tracesIf client applications are experiencing RPC timeouts, the Kudu tablet server WARNING level logs should contain a log entry which   includes an RPC-level trace.Kernel stack watchdog traces Each Kudu server process has a background thread called the Stack Watchdog, which   monitors other threads in the server in case they are blocked for longer-than-expected periods of   time. These traces can indicate operating system issues or bottle-necked storage. Parent topic: Performance issues
