Usability issues
This topic lists some common exceptions and errors that you may encounter while using
      Kudu and helps you to resolve issues related to usability.
ClassNotFoundException: com.cloudera.kudu.hive.KuduStorageHandlerYou will encounter this exception when you try to access a Kudu table using Hive. This       is not a case of a missing jar, but simply that Impala stores Kudu metadata in Hive in a       format that is unreadable to other tools, including Hive itself. and Spark. Currently, there       is no workaround for Hive users. Spark users can work around this by creating temporary       tables.Runtime error: Could not create thread: Resource temporarily unavailable (error 11)You may encounter this error when Kudu is unable to create more threads, usually on   versions older than Kudu 1.7. It happens on tablet servers, and is a sign that the tablet server   hosts too many tablet replicas. Tombstoned or STOPPED tablet replicasYou may notice some replicas on a tablet server are in a STOPPED state and remain on       the server indefinitely. These replicas are tombstones. A tombstone indicates that the tablet       server once held a bona fide replica of its tablet.Corruption: checksum error on CFile blockIn versions prior to Kudu 1.8.0, if the data on disk becomes corrupt, you will     encounter warnings containing "Corruption: checksum error on CFile block" in the tablet server     logs and client side errors when trying to scan tablets with corrupt CFile blocks. Fixing this     corruption is a manual process.
