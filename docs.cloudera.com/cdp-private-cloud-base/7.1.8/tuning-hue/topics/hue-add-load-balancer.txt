Adding a load balancer
Cloudera recommends you to configure load balancers for Hue to improve performance or
    if you have more than 10 concurrent users, and access Hue through the Hue load balancer port
    (8889).

Log into Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service.

Click Actions and select Add Role
            Instances.
The Add Role Instances wizard is displayed.

On the Assign Roles page, click Select
            hosts for Load Balancer.
Select a host and click OK.

[Optional] Add 2 additional Hue servers (for a total of 3) to boost
              performance:


Click Select hosts for Hue
              Server.
Select a host and click
                  OK > Continue.



Click Select Hosts for Kerberos Ticket
            Renewer if running Kerberos and select each host that you selected
          earlier.
Every Hue host must have a Renewer.

Click Continue.
The newly added hosts are displayed on the Instances
          tab.

Select all the newly added hosts.

Click Actions for Selected and select
            Start.

noteHue servers can share hosts with Load Balancers. But Hue servers must be on distinct
            hosts from other Hue servers, and Load Balancers must be on distinct hosts from other
            Load Balancers.


Restart the Hue service.

Click Hue Web UI > Load
              Balanced Hue Web UI.

Log on to Hue and ensure the port is 8889.

tipThe Load Balancer instance
                can always be accessed on the Hue Instances tab.
