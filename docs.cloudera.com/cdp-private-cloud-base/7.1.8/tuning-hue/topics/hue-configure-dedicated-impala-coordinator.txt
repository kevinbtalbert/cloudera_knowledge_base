Configuring Hue to use a dedicated Impala coordinator
If you have separate Impala executors and coordinators on your CDP cluster, then you
        can configure Hue to use a dedicated Impala coordinator for running queries.

noteHue must connect to the same Impala daemon for fetching
                query results on which the query was executed. Therefore, do not configure the load
                balancer using a simple round-robin algorithm because the Impala daemons are only
                aware of the queries they handle.


Log into Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue > Configuration > Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                            hue_safety_valve.ini and add the following lines under the [impala]
                    section:

[impala]
	# URL of the Impala coordinator server
	coordinator_url=[***COORDINATOR-SERVER***]:[***PORT***]


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.

Hue uses the dedicated Impala coordinator server to execute
            queries.
