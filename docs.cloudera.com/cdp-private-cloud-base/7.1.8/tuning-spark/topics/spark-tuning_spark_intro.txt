Introduction
This section provides information about evaluating and tuning Spark
    performance.

When tuning Apache Spark applications, it is important to understand how Spark works and
        what types of resources your application requires. For example, machine learning tasks are
        usually CPU intensive, whereas extract, transform, load (ETL) operations are I/O
        intensive.
