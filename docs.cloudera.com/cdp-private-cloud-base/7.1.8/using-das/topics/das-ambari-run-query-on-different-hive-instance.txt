Running a query on a different Hive instance
By default, ZooKeeper redirects your query to run on a Hive instance that is
        available at that time. However, if you have optimized a certain Hive instance, and you want
        to run your workload on that particular Hive instance, then you can switch to that instance
        by specifying the HiveServer2 host name and the port in the JDBC connection field on the DAS
        user interface.

noteThe steps provided in this topic are applicable to DAS deployed on a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster that is managed using
                Ambari.

The JDBC connection string is defined by the
                hive.zookeeper.quorum property under Ambari > Services > Hive > CONFIGS > ADVANCED > Advanced hive-site. It also resides in following DAS configuration file:
                etc/das/conf/das-hive-site.conf.noteThe JDBC connection
                string that you specify through the web interface is a temporary configuration and
                is limited to that particular browser session.To update the JDBC
                connection string:

Sign in to the DAS portal.

Click the profile icon on the top right corner and then click
                        About.

On the Configurations window, click
                        Edit under the JDBC connection
                    field.

Specify the HiveServer2 host name and port that you want to connect to in the
                    following format:

jdbc:hive2//HiveServer2-host:port/


noteThe Hive instance that you want to switch to should be within the same
                        cluster.


To save the changes, click Update.

To revert any changes that you have made to the original connection string,
                    click Reset.

To go back to the Configurations window, click
                        Cancel.

To exit, click OK.

When you run your query after updating the JDBC connection
            string, the query is executed on that particular Hive instance instead of being
            redirected to any Hive instance by ZooKeeper.
