DAS administration using Cloudera Manager in CDP
The topics listed in this section describe how you can run a query on a different Hive
  instance, modify session cookie timeout period, configure user authentication using SPNEGO and
  LDAP, manually configure TLS/SSL, and clean up old queries and DAG information in a CDP Private
  Cloud Base cluster that is managed using Cloudera Manager.
Running a query on a different Hive instanceBy default, ZooKeeper redirects your query to run on a Hive instance which is         available at that time. However, if you have optimized a certain Hive instance, and you want         to run your workload on that particular Hive instance, then you can select that Hive service         to run your queries using Cloudera Manager.Modifying the session cookie timeout valueBy default, the session cookie expire in 86400 seconds (or 24 hours). Depending on         your organizational requirement, you can increase or decrease the session cookie timeout         duration from Cloudera Manager.Configuring user authenticationYou can authenticate the users by using either SPNEGO or LDAP, or choose not to set up   user authentication.Configuring TLS/SSL encryption manually for DAS using Cloudera ManagerTo secure the transfer of sensitive information between Data Analytics Studio (DAS)         and Cloudera Manager as well as with other services within your cluster, you must enable         TLS/SSL for both Event Processor and WebApp. You can configure TLS manually using Cloudera         Manager or have it set up automatically using the “Auto-TLS” feature.Cleaning up old queries, DAG information, and reports dataThe DAS Postgres database stores all the queries that you run from the DAS UI or         beeline, and all the data that is used to generate the DAG information and reports. Over a         period of time, this can grow in size. To optimize the available capacity, DAS has a cleanup         mechanism that, by default, purges all the queries and DAG information older than 30 days         and purges old reports after 365 days. However, you can customize the cleanup frequency from         Cloudera Manager.Disabling the reporting featureGenerating reports in Data Analytics Studio (DAS) make database calls and may keep         them open, utilizing resources. Because DAS is deprecated and you may not be actively using         DAS, you can disable the reporting feature using Cloudera Manager.
