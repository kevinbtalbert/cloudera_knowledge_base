Cleaning up old queries, DAG information, and reports data
The DAS Postgres database stores all the queries that you run from the DAS UI or
        beeline, and all the data that is used to generate the DAG information and reports. Over a
        period of time, this can grow in size. To optimize the available capacity, DAS has a cleanup
        mechanism that, by default, purges all the queries and DAG information older than 30 days
        and purges old reports after 365 days. However, you can customize the cleanup frequency from
        Cloudera Manager.
To customize the cleanup intervals:

Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Data Analytics Studio service > Configuration and search eventprocessor_extra.properties.
The Data Analytics Studio Eventprocessor Advanced Configuration
                        Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        conf/props/eventprocessor_extra.properties field is displayed
                    and is used to set or override properties for DAS in the form of key value
                    pairs.

Add the cleanup.query-info.interval,
                        cleanup.report-info.interval, and
                        cleanup.cron.expression configurations in the
                        event-processing section as shown in the following
                    example:

event-processing: {
        hive.hook.proto.base-directory= "{{data_analytics_studio_event_processor_hive_base_dir}}",
        tez.history.logging.proto-base-dir= "{{data_analytics_studio_event_processor_tez_base_dir}}",
        meta.info.sync.service.delay.millis= 5000,
        actor.initialization.delay.millis= 20000,
        close.folder.delay.millis= 600000,
        reread.event.max.retries= -1,
        reporting.scheduler.initial.delay.millis= 30000,
        reporting.scheduler.interval.delay.millis= 300000,
        reporting.scheduler.weekly.initial.delay.millis= 60000,
        reporting.scheduler.weekly.interval.delay.millis= 600000,
        reporting.scheduler.monthly.initial.delay.millis= 90000,
        reporting.scheduler.monthly.interval.delay.millis= 900000,
        reporting.scheduler.quarterly.initial.delay.millis= 120000,
        reporting.scheduler.quarterly.interval.delay.millis= 1200000,
        cleanup.query-info.interval= 2592000,
        cleanup.report-info.interval= 31536000,
        cleanup.cron.expression= "0 0 2 * * ?"
  },

In this example, the query data will be cleaned up after 2592000 seconds
                    (which is equal to 30 days), the report data will be cleaned up after 31536000
                    seconds (which is equal to 365 days), and the cleanup jobs will be triggered to
                    run at 02:00:00 hours (or 2 AM), as per the server timezone.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the DAS service.
