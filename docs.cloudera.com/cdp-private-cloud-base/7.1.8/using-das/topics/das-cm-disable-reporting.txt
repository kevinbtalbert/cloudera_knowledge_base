Disabling the reporting feature
Generating reports in Data Analytics Studio (DAS) make database calls and may keep
        them open, utilizing resources. Because DAS is deprecated and you may not be actively using
        DAS, you can disable the reporting feature using Cloudera Manager.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > DAS service > Configuration and add the following in the Data Analytics Studio
                        Eventprocessor Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        conf/props/eventprocessor_extra.properties field:
Key:
                    reporting.enabledValue: false
To enable the reporting feature, set reporting.enabled to
                        true.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the DAS service.
