Creating system tables to run query on Hive and Tez DAG events
The Tez DAG events are exposed in the dag_data table, and the Hive query events are
        exposed in the query_data table in the sys database. You can run Hive queries from DAS to
        process these events and generate custom reports.

noteThe steps provided in this topic are applicable to DAS deployed on a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster that is managed using Ambari.

You need to create these system tables before you can run queries on
            them.

From Ambari, go to Data Analytics Studio.

Click Actions > Create Tables.

Navigate through the table creation wizard and make sure that the operation
                    completes successfully.
You can view the dag_data and the query_data tables under the sys database in
                    the DAS UI.
