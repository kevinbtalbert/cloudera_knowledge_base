      query the data.

You can refine your search results on the basis of parameters such as status of the query, queue to which the query belongs, the user of the query, tables read for the query, and tables written for the query,     and execution modes.Refining query search using filtersYou can further refine your query search results using various filters.Saving the search resultsYou have an option to save the filters with which you refined the queries, along with     the result set for future use. It is easy to load, optionally modify, and run queries from the     saved query list.
