Running a query on a different Hive instance
By default, ZooKeeper redirects your query to run on a Hive instance which is
        available at that time. However, if you have optimized a certain Hive instance, and you want
        to run your workload on that particular Hive instance, then you can select that Hive service
        to run your queries using Cloudera Manager.

noteThe Hive instance that you want to switch to should be within the same
                cluster.
