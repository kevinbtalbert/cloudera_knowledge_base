Viewing the query timeline
The Timeline tab shows the time taken by every stage of the query
  execution.
The first stage is Pre-execution and DAG construction. It is executed on
   the Hive engine. It constitutes the time taken to compile, parse, and build the DAG for the next
   phase of the query execution. In the next stage of query execution, the DAG generated in Hive is
   submitted to Tez engine for execution. The DAG Runtime shows the time
   taken by the Tez engine to run the DAG. In the post-execution stage, the HDFS files are moved
   or renamed.
