Enabling all scheduled queries
You can enable a single scheduled query using a SQL command, but to enable multiple
        scheduled queries you need perform a few steps in Cloudera Manager.

To enable all newly created schedules in CDP Private Cloud Base, follow these steps: 


In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > Hive on TEZ > Configuration

In Search, enter safety.

In Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                                    Valve) for hive-site.xml HIVE_ON_TEZ-1
                                    (Service-Wide), click + and
                                add the following property:
                                    hive.scheduled.queries.create.as.enabled

Set the value to true.

Save and restart Hive on Tez.
