Repairing partitions manually using MSCK repair
The MSCK REPAIR TABLE command was designed to manually add partitions that are added
        to or removed from the file system, but are not present in the Hive metastore.

This task assumes you created a partitioned external table named
                    emp_part that stores partitions outside the warehouse. You
                remove one of the partition directories on the file system. This action renders the
                metastore inconsistent with the file system. You repair the discrepancy manually to
                synchronize the metastore with the file system. 


Remove the dept=sales object from the file system.

From the Hive command line, look at the emp_part table
                    partitions.

SHOW PARTITIONS emp_part;

The list of partitions is stale; it still includes the dept=sales
                    directory.+----------------+
|   partition    |
+----------------+
| dept=finance   |
| dept=sales     |
| dept=service   |
+----------------+

Repair the partition manually.

MSCK REPAIR TABLE emp_part DROP PARTITIONS;
