Managing partition retention time
You can keep the size of the Apache Hive metadata and data you accumulate for log
        processing, and other activities, to a manageable size by setting a retention period for the
        data. 
 The table must be configured to automatically synchronize partition metadata with
            directories or objects on a file system. 

If you specify a partition metadata retention period, Hive drops the metadata and
                corresponding data in any partition created after the retention period. You express 
                the retention time using a numeral and the
                following character or characters:
ms (milliseconds)
s (seconds)
m (minutes)
d (days)

In this task, you configure automatic synchronization of the file system partitions
                with the metastore and a partition retention period. Assume you already created a
                partitioned, external table named employees.


If necessary, enable automatic discovery of partitions for the table employees.

ALTER TABLE employees SET TBLPROPERTIES ('discover.partitions'='true'); 

By default, external partitioned tables already set this table property to true.

Configure a partition retention period of one week.

ALTER TABLE employees SET TBLPROPERTIES ('partition.retention.period'='7d');

The partition metadata as well as the actual data for employees in Hive is automatically
                dropped after a week.
