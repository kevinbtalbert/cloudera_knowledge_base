Using functions
You can call a built-in Hive function to run one of a wide-range of operations
        instead of performing multiple steps. You use SHOW FUNCTIONS to search for or list available
        functions. You can create a user-defined function (UDF) when a built-in is not available to
        do what you need. You might need to reload functions to update the availability of functions
        created in another session. 
Reloading, viewing, and filtering functionsTo determine which Hive functions and operators are available, you reload functions,         and then use the SHOW FUNCTIONS statement. An optional pattern in the statement filters the         list of functions returned by the statement. Create a user-defined functionYou export user-defined functionality (UDF) to a JAR from a Hadoop- and         Hive-compatible Java project and store the JAR on your cluster or object store. Using Hive         commands, you register the UDF based on the JAR, and call the UDF from a Hive         query.
