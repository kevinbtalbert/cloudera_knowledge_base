Getting scheduled query information and monitor the query
After you create a scheduled query you can access information about it in the
            scheduled_queries table of the Hive information schema. You can also
        use the information schema to monitor scheduled query execution.

Query the information schema to get information about a schedule.

SELECT *
FROM information_schema.scheduled_queries
WHERE schedule_name = 'scheduled_rebuild'; 

The following information appears about the scheduled query: 
                
scheduled_query_id
Unique numeric identifier for a scheduled query.
schedule_name
Name of the scheduled query.
enabled
Whether the scheduled query is currently enabled or not.
cluster_namespace
Namespace that the scheduled query belongs to.
schedule
Schedule described as a Quartz cron expression.
user
Owner of the scheduled query.
query
SQL query to be executed.
next_execution
When the next execution of this scheduled query is due.



Monitor the most recent scheduled query execution.

SELECT *
FROM information_schema.scheduled_executions; 

You can configure the retention period for this information in the Hive metastore.

                                        progress in configurable intervals.
