Creating a temporary
      table
In CDP Private Cloud Base, you can create a temporary table to improve performance by storing
      data temporarily for intermediate use, or reuse, by a complex query.
Temporary table data persists only during the current Apache Hive session. Hive drops
         the table at the end of the session. If you use the name of a permanent table to create the
         temporary table, the permanent table is inaccessible during the session unless you drop or
         rename the temporary table. You can create a temporary table having the same name as
         another user's temporary table because user sessions are independent. Temporary tables do
         not support partitioned columns and indexes.CDP Private Cloud Base only
