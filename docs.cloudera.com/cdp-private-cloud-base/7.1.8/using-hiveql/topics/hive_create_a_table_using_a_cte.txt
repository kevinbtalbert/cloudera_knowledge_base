Use a CTE in a
      query
You can use a common table expression (CTE) to simplify creating a view or table,
      selecting data, or inserting data.

Use a CTE to create a table based on another table that you select using the 
               CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) clause.

CREATE TABLE s2 AS WITH q1 AS (SELECT key FROM src WHERE key = '4') SELECT * FROM q1;


Use a CTE to create a view.

CREATE VIEW v1 AS WITH q1 AS (SELECT key FROM src WHERE key='5') SELECT * from q1; 


Use a CTE to select data.
WITH q1 AS (SELECT key from src where key = '5') 
  SELECT * from q1;

Use a CTE to insert data.

CREATE TABLE s1 LIKE src; 
WITH q1 AS (SELECT key, value FROM src WHERE key = '5') FROM q1 INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE s1 SELECT *;
