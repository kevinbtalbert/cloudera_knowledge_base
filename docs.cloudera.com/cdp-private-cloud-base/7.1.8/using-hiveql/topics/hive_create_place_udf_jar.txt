Building the project and upload the JAR
You compile the UDF code into a JAR and add the JAR to the classpath on the cluster.
        You choose one of several methods of configuring the cluster so Hive can find the
        JAR.


CDP Private Cloud Base
Use one of these methods to configure the cluster to find the JAR:
Direct reference Straight-forward, but recommended for
                                    development only.
Hive aux library directoryPrevents accidental overwriting of
                                    files or functions. Recommended for tested, stable UDFs to
                                    prevent accidental overwriting of files or functions.
Reloadable aux JARAvoids HiveServer restarts. Recommended if you
                                    anticipate making frequent changes to the UDF logic.

CDP Public Cloud
Use the Direct reference method only.



Build the IntelliJ project.

In IntelliJ, navigate to the JAR in the /target directory of the project.

Configure the cluster so Hive can find the JAR using one of the following
                    methods.

Direct JAR reference
Upload the JAR to HDFS (CDP Private Cloud Base) or S3 (CDP Public Cloud).
Move the JAR into the Hive warehouse. For example, in CDP Private Cloud Base:$ hdfs dfs -put TypeOf-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /warehouse/tablespace/managed/hiveudf-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Hive aux JARs path (CDP Private Cloud Base
                            only)
In CDP Private Cloud Base, click Cloudera Manager > Clusters and select the Hive service, for example, HIVE. Click
                                    Configuration and search for Hive
                                Auxiliary JARs Directory. 
Specify a directory value for the Hive aux JARs property if
                                necessary, or make a note of the path.
Upload the JAR to the specified directory on all HiveServer
                                instances (and all Metastore instances, if separate).

Reloadable aux JAR (CDP Private Cloud Base
                            only)
Upload the JAR to the /hadoop/hive-udf-dyn
                                directory on all HiveServer instances (and all Metastore instances,
                                if separate). An HDFS location is not supported.
In hive-site.xml, set the following property:
                                    hive.reloadable.aux.jars.path=/hadoop/hive-udf-dyn.



In IntelliJ, click Save.

Click Actions > Deploy Client Configuration.

Restart the Hive service. For example, restart HIVE.
