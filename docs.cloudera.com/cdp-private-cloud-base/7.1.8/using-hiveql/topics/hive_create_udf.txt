Create a user-defined function
You export user-defined functionality (UDF) to a JAR from a Hadoop- and
        Hive-compatible Java project and store the JAR on your cluster or object store. Using Hive
        commands, you register the UDF based on the JAR, and call the UDF from a Hive
        query.


You have access rights to upload the JAR to the cluster to your cluster or
                    object store.Cloudera Manager, Minimum Required Role: Configurator (also
                        provided by Cluster Administrator, Full Administrator).
Hive on Tez or Hive LLAP is running on the cluster.
You have installed Java and a Java integrated development environment (IDE) tool
                    on the machine, or virtual machine, where you will create the UDF.



Setting up the development environmentYou can create a Hive UDF in a development environment using IntelliJ, for example,         and build the UDF. You define the Cloudera Maven Repository in your POM, which accesses         necessary JARS hadoop-common-<version>.jar and hive-exec-<version>.jar.Creating the UDF classYou define the UDF logic in a new class that returns the data type of a selected column     in a table.Building the project and upload the JARYou compile the UDF code into a JAR and add the JAR to the classpath on the cluster.         You choose one of several methods of configuring the cluster so Hive can find the         JAR.Registering the UDFIn the cluster, you log into Hive, and run a command from Beeline to make the UDF functional in Hive queries. The UDF persists between HiveServer restarts.Calling the UDF in a queryAfter registration of a UDF, you do not need to restart Hive before using the UDF in         a query. In this example, you call the UDF you created in a SELECT statement, and Hive         returns the data type of a column you specify. Parent topic: Using functions
