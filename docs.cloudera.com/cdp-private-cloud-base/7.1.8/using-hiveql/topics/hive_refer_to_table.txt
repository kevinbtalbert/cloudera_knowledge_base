Hive 3.1 changes to table references using dot notation might require changes to your
        Hive scripts.
 Hive 3.1 in CDP includes SQL compatibility (Hive-16907), which rejects
                `db.table` in SQL queries. The dot (.) is not allowed in table
            names. To reference the database and table in a table name, enclosed both in backticks
            as follows: `db`.`table`
