Using a subquery
Hive supports subqueries in FROM clauses and WHERE clauses that you can use for many
    Apache Hive operations, such as filtering data from one table based on contents of another
    table.
A subquery is a SQL expression in an inner query that returns a result set to the
      outer query. From the result set, the outer query is evaluated. The outer query is the main
      query that contains the inner subquery. A subquery in a WHERE clause includes a query
      predicate and predicate operator. A predicate is a condition that evaluates to a Boolean
      value. The predicate in a subquery must also contain a predicate operator. The predicate
      operator specifies the relationship tested in a predicate query. 

Select all the state and net_payments values from the transfer_payments table if the value of the year column in the table matches a year in the us_census table.
SELECT state, net_payments
FROM transfer_payments
WHERE transfer_payments.year IN (SELECT year FROM us_census); 
The predicate starts with the first WHERE keyword. The predicate operator is the IN
          keyword.
The predicate returns true for a row in the transfer_payments table if the year
          value in at least one row of the us_census table matches a year value in the
          transfer_payments table.
