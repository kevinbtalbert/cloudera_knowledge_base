Options to rerun Oozie workflows in Hue
Oozie workflows consume time and resources to run. You can optimize the rerun of a
  failed Oozie workflow by selecting one of the following two options: “All or skip successful” or
  “Only failed”. These options enable you to select individual actions within your workflow that you
  want to rerun.
importantThe option to rerun the an Oozie workflow is enabled
   in the following conditions:
In case of an external workflow, the rerun button is enabled if the workflow was run by the
     same user who is logged in, or if the user is a Hue superuser.
If the workflow is created in Hue, then the rerun button is enabled only for the user who
     originally ran the workflow, or for the Hue superuser.

The All or skip successful option enables you to either rerun both the
   successful and failed actions or skip the actions that ran successfully and run only the failed
   ones. Using this option, you have more control over selecting the actions that you want to rerun
   from the list of successfully run actions.
If you select the All or skip successful option but do not
   select any or all of the successfully run actions, then Hue reruns the whole Oozie workflow.
If you select the All or skip successful option and select some of the
   successfully run actions, then Hue reruns the selected actions and the failed actions.
Select the Only failed option to only rerun the failed actions within
   your workflow.
