Comparing Hive queries in Hue
You can compare two queries to know how each query is performing in terms of speed
        and cost-effectiveness. Hue compares various aspects of the two queries, based on which you
        can identify what changed between the executions of those two queries, and you can debug
        performance-related issues between different runs of the same query.

noteThis feature is available only for Hive queries.
The query comparison report provides you a detailed side-by-side comparison of your
                queries, including recommendations for each query, metadata about the queries,
                visual explain for each query, query timeline, query configuration, Directed Acyclic
                Graph (DAG) information, DAG flows, DAG swimlanes, DAG counters, and  DAG
                configurations.
