Searching metadata tags
The SQL Editor in Hue provides a search text box where you can search on the metadata
    tags or classifications that are associated with your databases, tables, and
    columns.

 You can search for tags or classifications in either the Hive or the Impala editors. 
noteOn clusters that use Apache Ranger for role-based access control, the Search mechanism
        does not display counts of popular values. Ranger ensures that Hue users can view only
        entities to which their user role (as configured and managed by Ranger) has been granted
        specific permissions.


Go to Query Editor > Impala or Hive.

To locate the tags or classifications in Apache Atlas, in the metadata search box
          located just to the right of the Query drop-down menu, type a tag: or
            classification: facet followed by its name. For example, type
            classification: wine as shown in the following image:





 After you type the search facet and the tag or classification name in the search box,
          the <database>.<table> where the tag or
          classification is found is returned. Click the
            <database>.<table> to view the tags
          and classifications that have been defined for it.
