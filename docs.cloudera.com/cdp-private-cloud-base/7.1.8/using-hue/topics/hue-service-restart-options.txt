Options to restart the Hue service
Restarting the Hue service is necessary after upgrading CDP or making configuration
  changes to Hue. You can restart Hue in regular or rolling restart mode. Rolling restart reduces
  the service downtime to approximately 80 to 90 seconds.
Suppose you restart a cluster containing the Hue service in a regular mode. In that case, the
   Hue service can become unavailable for an average of 30 minutes from the restart time (this could
   vary depending on the number of services in your cluster). To reduce the service downtime, select
   the Rolling Restart option from the Actions menu to restart Hue. Cloudera Manager shows the
   following options to restart Hue in the rolling restart mode:
