Terminating Hive queries
If a query is running for longer than expected, or you have accidentally triggered
        it, then you can stop the query to free up the resources. Hue also allows you to stop
        multiple queries at once.

noteThis feature is available only for Hive queries. Only admin users or Hue
                superusers can stop running queries.


Log in to the Hue web interface.

Click Jobs from the left assist panel.
The Job Browser page is displayed.

Go to the Queries tab.
A list of queries that were run is displayed.

Select the queries that you want to stop and click
                    Kill.
