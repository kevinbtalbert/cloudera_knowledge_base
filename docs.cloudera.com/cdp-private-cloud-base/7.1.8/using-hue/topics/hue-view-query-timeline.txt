Viewing Hive query timeline
The Timeline tab provides a visual representation of Hive performance logs and shows
        the time taken by each stage of the query execution.

noteThis feature is available only for Hive queries.
Following are the stages in which a query is executed:

Pre-execution and DAG construction: It is the first phase of
                            query execution and is executed on the Hive engine. It constitutes the
                            time taken to compile, parse, and build the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
                            for the next phase of the query execution.


DAG submission: It is the second phase in which the DAG that
                            was generated in Hive is submitted to the Tez engine for execution.


DAG runtime: It shows the time taken by the Tez engine to
                            execute the DAG.


Post-execution: It is the last phase of query execution in
                            which the files in S3/ABFS are moved or renamed.


Duration data about each phase are distilled into more granular metrics based on
                query execution logs.
