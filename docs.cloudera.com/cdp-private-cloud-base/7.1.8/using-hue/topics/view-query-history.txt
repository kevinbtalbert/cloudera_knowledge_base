Viewing Hive query history
The Job Browser page displays all the queries that were run on the Hive Virtual
        Warehouse from various query interfaces, such as Beeline, Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC),
        Tableau, and so on.

noteThis feature is available only for Hive queries.
Only Query Store Administrators can view historical queries of all users to monitor
                resource utilization and control costs from the Hue Job Browser. Non-admin users can
                view only their queries.
The Hue Query Store does not clean up automatically. The queries are retained in the
                backend database until you clean up the records. You can view queries up to five
                years old from the Hue web interface.


Log in to the Hue web interface.

Click Jobs from the left assist panel.
The Job Browser page is displayed.

Click Queries.
The Hive queries that were run by all users for the past seven days are
                    displayed. You can select the time period for which you want to view the
                    historical data.
You can also filter queries by their status.
