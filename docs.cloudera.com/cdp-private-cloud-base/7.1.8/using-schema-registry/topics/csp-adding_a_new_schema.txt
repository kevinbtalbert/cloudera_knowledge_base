Adding a new schema
Learn how to add a new
      schema to Schema Registry through the Schema Registry UI. 
A schema is a collection of information that describes your
         data. The metadata of the schema includes group, version, and description. To add a new
         schema to Schema Registry, provide information about the schema, select a compatibility
         policy, and upload the schema text from a file.

Ensure that you understand compatibility policies. Once selected, you cannot change the
            compatibility policy for a schema.

From the Schema Registry UI, click the + icon.

The Add New Schema dialog appears.




Add the schema metadata as follows:



Name
A unique name for each schema. It is used as a key to look up schemas.


Description
A short description of the schema.


Schema Type
The schema format. Select one of the following formats:
Avro schema provider
JSON schema provider



Schema Group
Allows you to group schemas in any logical order.


Compatibility
This option appears only when the Avro schema
                           provider option is selected. Sets the compatibility policy
                        for the schema. Once set, this cannot be changed. Select one of the
                        following options:
Backward
Forward
Both
None

For more information about compatibility, see Compatibility
                           Policies.

To allow schema to evolve over time by creating multiple versions, select the
                  Evolve checkbox. 

note
Unselecting Evolve means that you can only have one
                     version of a schema.
