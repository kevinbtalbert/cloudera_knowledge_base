ID ranges in Schema Registry
You can avoid overlapping IDs for Schema Registry entities across different Schema
  Registry instances by setting ID ranges in each instance.
If your deployment has many Schema Registry instances in different clusters, you can ensure
   that each Schema Registry instance operates in a preset ID range so that there are no overlapping
   IDs. To achieve this, you need to set an ID range.
When an ID range is set, each Schema Registry entity (schema metadata, branches,
   versions, and so on) is created with an ID that falls within the configured range. Configuring a
   range can simplify schema export and import between Schema Registry instances where conflicting
   IDs can cause the import process to fail.
Consequently, having non-overlapping ID ranges allocated to each Schema Registry
   makes data replication easier when schema IDs are embedded in the data. This is important because
   replicated data can only be deserialized with compatible schemas on the replication target
   site.
When IDs reach the range maximum value, adding more schema fails until a new ID range
   is configured. The new range must be larger than the current one. The new range must also not
   overlap with any other ranges.importantCloudera does not recommend that you import
    schemas into a Schema Registryâ€™s ID range. IDs assigned sequentially from the range start value
    might reach the imported IDs.
