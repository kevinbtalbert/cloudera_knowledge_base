Introduction
An Apache Zeppelin notebook is a browser-based GUI you can use for interactive data
      exploration, modeling, and visualization.
As an Apache Zeppelin notebook author or collaborator, you write code in a browser
            window. When you run the code from the browser, Zeppelin sends the code to backend
            processors such as Spark. The processor or service and returns results; you can then use
            Zeppelin to review and visualize results in the browser.
Apache Zeppelin is supported on the following browsers:


Internet Explorer, latest supported releases. (Zeppelin is not supported on
                  versions 8 or 9, due to lack of built-in support for WebSockets.)


Google Chrome, latest stable release.


Mozilla Firefox, latest stable release.


Apple Safari, latest stable release. Note that when SSL is enabled for Zeppelin,
                  Safari requires a Certificate Authority-signed certificate to access the Zeppelin
                  UI.
