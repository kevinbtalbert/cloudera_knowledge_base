      settings in a note
This section describes how to customize Apache Zeppelin interpreter settings on a
      per-note basis. 

You can use the Zeppelin conf interpreter to customize interpreter
            configuration settings on a per-note basis. The conf interpreter is a
            generic interpreter that can be used to customize any Zeppelin interpreter on a per-note
            basis. 
In the following example, zeppelin_custom_note_conf.png to customize the Spark
            interpreter in a Note. 

First paragraph: 

%spark.conf

spark.app.namehelloworld
master  yarn-client
spark.jars.packages com.databricks:spark-csv_2.11:1.2.0

Second paragraph: 

%spark

import com.databricks.spark.csv._

In the first paragraph, the conf interpreter is used to create a custom
            Spark interpreter configuration (set app name, yarn-client mode, and add spark-csv
            dependencies). After running the first paragraph, the second paragraph can be run to use
            spark-csv in the note. 
In order for the conf interpreter to run successfully, it must be
            configured on an isolated per-note basis. Also, the paragraph with the
               conf interpreter customization settings must be run first, before
            subsequent applicable interpreter processes are launched.
