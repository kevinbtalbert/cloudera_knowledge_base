Modify interpreter
      settings
Use the following steps to modify Apache Zeppelin interpreter settings. 
Before using an interpreter, you might want to modify default settings such as the home
            directory for the Spark interpreter, the name of the Hive JDBC driver for the JDBC
            interpreter, or the keytab and principal name for a secure installation.
To set custom configuration values for an interpreter:

Click the user settings menu and navigate to the Interpreter page.
Scroll down to the Properties section for the interpreter of interest, and click
                     "edit":
Make your changes.
Scroll to the end of the list of settings and click "Save".
Some types of changes require restarting the interpreter; use the button next to the
               edit button.

Note: The Interpreter page is subject to access control settings. If the page
            does not list a set of interpreters, check with your system administrator.
