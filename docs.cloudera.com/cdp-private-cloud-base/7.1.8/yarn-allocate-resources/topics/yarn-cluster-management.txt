Resource scheduling and
        management
You can manage
        resources for the applications running on your cluster by allocating resources through
        scheduling, limiting CPU usage by configuring cgroups, and partitioning the cluster into
        subclusters using partitions, and launching applications on Docker containers. 
 The CapacityScheduler is responsible for scheduling. The
            CapacityScheduler is used to run Hadoop applications as a shared,
            multi-tenant cluster in an operator-friendly manner while maximizing the throughput and the
            utilization of the cluster. 
The ResourceCalculator is part of the YARN CapacityScheduler. If
            you have only one type of resource, typically a CPU virtual core (vcore), use the
            DefaultResourceCalculator. If you have multiple resource types, use the
            DominantResourceCalculator.

YARN resource allocation of multiple resource-typesYou can manage your cluster capacity using the Capacity Scheduler in YARN. You can use       the Capacity Scheduler's DefaultResourceCalculator or the          DominantResourceCalculator to allocate available resources. Hierarchical queue characteristicsYou must consider the various characteristics of the Capacity Scheduler hierarchical queues before setting them up.Scheduling among queuesHierarchical queues ensure that guaranteed resources are first shared among the sub-queues of an organization before any remaining free resources are shared with queues belonging to other organizations. This enables each organization to have control over the utilization of its guaranteed resources.Application reservationsFor a resource-intensive application, the Capacity Scheduler creates a reservation on a cluster node if the node's free capacity can meet the particular application's requirements. This ensures that the resources are utilized only by that particular application until the application reservation is fulfilled.Resource distribution workflowDuring scheduling, queues at any level in the hierarchy are sorted in the order of their current used capacity, and the available resources are distributed among them starting with queues that are currently the most under-served.   Resource allocation overviewYou can allocate resources to queues by using either the Absolute mode, in which the     actual units of vCores and memory resources are allocated, the Relative mode, in which resources     are allocated as a percentage of total resources, or in the Weight mode, in which resources are     allocated as a fraction of total resources. Use CPU schedulingCgroups with CPU scheduling helps you effectively manage mixed workloads.Use GPU schedulingOn your cluster, you can configure GPU scheduling and isolation. Currently only Nvidia       GPUs are supported in YARN. You can use Cloudera Manager to configure GPU scheduling on your       cluster.Use FPGA schedulingYou can use FPGA as a resource type.Limit CPU usage with CgroupsYou can use cgroups to limit CPU usage in a Hadoop Cluster.
