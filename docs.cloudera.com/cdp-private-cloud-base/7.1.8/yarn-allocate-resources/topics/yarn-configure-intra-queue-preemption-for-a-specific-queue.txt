Enabling Intra-Queue Preemption for a specific queue
Intra-queue preemption prevents resource imbalances in a queue. 

Intra-queue preemption helps in effective distribution of resources within a queue based on
        configured user limits or application priorities.noteIf the intra-queue preemption policy
          is disabled in the scheduler configurations, you cannot enable intra-queue preemption for
          a specific queue. For information about setting scheduler level intra-queue preemption,
          see Configure Intra-Queue
            Preemption.
