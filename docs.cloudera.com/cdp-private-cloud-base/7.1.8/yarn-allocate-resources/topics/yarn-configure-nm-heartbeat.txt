Configuring NodeManager heartbeat
You can control how many containers can be allocated in each NodeManager heartbeat. 
To configure NodeManager heartbeat for all queues, perform the following:

In Cloudera Manager, select the Clusters > YARN Queue Manager UI
        service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview tab. 
Click the Scheduler Configuration tab.
Select the Enable Multiple Assignments Per Heartbeat checkbox to allow multiple
        container assignments in one NodeManager heartbeat. 
Configure the following NodeManager heartbeat properties: 
Maximum Container Assignments Per Heartbeat - The maximum number of containers
            that can be assigned in one NodeManager heartbeat. Setting this value to -1 disables
            this limit.
Maximum Off-Switch Assignments Per Heartbeat - The maximum number of off-switch
            containers that can be assigned in one NodeManager heartbeat. 

Click Save.
