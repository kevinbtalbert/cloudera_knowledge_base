Enabling preemption for a specific queue
Capacity Scheduler Preemption allows higher-priority applications to preempt lower-priority applications. 
   
 A scenario can occur in which a queue has a guaranteed level of cluster resources, but
      must wait to run applications because other queues are utilizing all of the available
      resources. If Preemption is enabled, higher-priority applications do not have to wait because
      lower priority applications have taken up the available capacity. With Preemption enabled,
      under-served queues can begin to claim their allocated cluster resources almost immediately,
      without having to wait for other queues' applications to finish running.
      
      noteIf the
        preemption policy is disabled in the scheduler configurations, you cannot enable preemption
        for a specific queue. For information about setting scheduler level preemption, see Configuring preemption.
      You can disable the queue preemption (yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.monitor.enable) for a specific queue. 


In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters > YARN Queue Manager UI
          service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview tab. 

Click on the three vertical dots on the queue and select View/Edit Queue
            Properties option.

In the Queue Properties dialog-box, uncheck the
            Enable Preemption checkbox. 

Click Save.
