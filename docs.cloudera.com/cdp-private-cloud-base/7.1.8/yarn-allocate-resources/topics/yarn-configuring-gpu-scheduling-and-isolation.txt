Configure GPU scheduling
      and isolation
You can configure GPU scheduling and isolation on your cluster. Currently only Nvidia
      GPUs are supported in YARN.


YARN NodeManager must be installed with the Nvidia drivers. 



In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Hosts >  Hosts Configuration.

Search for cgroup.

Select the Enable Cgroup-based Resource Management
               checkbox.

Click Save Changes.

Navigate to YARN >  Configuration

Search for cgroup.

Find the Use CGroups for Resource Management property and
               enable it for the applicable clusters.

Find the Always use Linux Container Executor property and
               enable it for the applicable clusters. 

Search for gpu.

Find the Enable GPU Usage property and select the
                  NodeManager Default Group checkbox.

Find the NodeManager GPU Devices Allowed property and define
               the GPU devices that are managed by YARN using one of the following ways.

Use the default value, auto, for auto detection of all GPU
                     devices. In this case all GPU devices are managed by YARN.
Manually define the GPU devices that are managed by YARN.


Find the NodeManager GPU Detection Executable property and
               define the location of nvidia-smi. By default, this property has no value and it
               means that YARN checks the following paths to find nvidia-smi:

/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/local/nvidia/bin


Click Save Changes.

Click the Stale Configuration: Restart needed button on the
               top of the page.

Click Restart Stale Services.
Note that this step restarts all services with stale configurations.

Select Re-deploy client configuration and click
                  Restart Now.


 If the NodeManager fails to start, the following error is
         displayed:INFO gpu.GpuDiscoverer (GpuDiscoverer.java:initialize(240)) - Trying to discover GPU information ... WARN gpu.GpuDiscoverer (GpuDiscoverer.java:initialize(247)) - Failed to discover GPU information from system, exception message:ExitCodeException exitCode=12: continue... 
         Fix the error by exporting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the yarn -env.sh using
         the following command: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/
            usr/local/nvidia/lib:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
