Configure queue-based autoscaling  (Technical Preview)
Queue based autoscaling lets you scale the cluster up and down automatically based on
    memory utilization set within the boundaries at the root queue level. You can now control which
    queues can scale-up and scale-down. 
You can configure the maximum capacity of the root queue
      equivalent to the Compute Cluster level minimum and maximum resources set in Data
      Hub.
noteQueue-based Autoscaling feature is under Technical Preview. The
      technical preview feature and considered under development. Do not use this in your production
      systems. To share your feedback, contact Support by logging a case on our https://my.cloudera.com/support.htmlCloudera Support
      Portal. Technical preview features are not guaranteed troubleshooting guidance and
      fixes.
noteIn this release, only Absolute resource mode is supported for queue
        autoscaling.

Prerequisites for queue autoscaling (Technical Preview)You must configure Load-based autoscaling in Data Hub before configuring queue     autoscaling. Load-based autoscaling scales the host group up or down based upon YARNâ€™s     assessment of pending demand and available capacity. Load-based autoscaling can help control     costs while providing on-demand cluster capacity. Configuring Resource Manager for queue-based autoscalingYou must set the Resource Manager plugin property to fine using the Cloudera Manager. Configuring Queue Manager for autoscalingYou must set the resource allocation mode, root queue memory, and update the child     queue memories to set the boundaries for the queue to scale up or down automatically. Downscaling of resourcesResources are scaled up when the jobs are submitted. The downscale of all the     autoscaled compute nodes happens only after all the submitted jobs are completed.
