Creating a new Dynamic Configuration
In Cloudera Manager, using the YARN Queue Manager UI you can create new Dynamic
        Configurations that will be used by the Dynamic Queue Scheduling feature.

In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Clusters >  YARN Queue Manager UI.

Click Schedule.

Click +Add.
The Add Configuration window is displayed with the
                    current configuration setting.

Configure Queues.
When configuring queues for the Dynamic Configuration, you can either change a
                    queue's configuration or include its current values.


Changing queue configuration:
Edit child queues by clicking the three vertical dots next to the
                            parent queue's name and select Edit Child
                                Queue.

After you edit the child queues, they are included in the
                                Dynamic Configuration which is indicated by a blue background. In
                                relative resource allocation mode if one queue is included in the
                                configuration at a certain level, all other queues on that level
                                (siblings) are also included.A blue asterisk next to the
                                queue’s name indicates that you have changed the properties of that
                                queue to create the Dynamic Configuration.

In this example the user1 and user2 queue’s capacity properties
                                were changed from 40% to 50% and from 30% to 20% respectively. The
                                user3 queue has the same setting as it had in the configuration that
                                is the base of the Dynamic Configuration that is currently being
                                created.


Including the current values in the dynamic configuration:

Click the three vertical dots next to the queue which you
                                want to include in the configuration and click Include in
                                    Configuration.



As a result, in relative resource allocation mode the
                                selected queue and its sibling queues are included in the
                                configuration with their current resource configuration. In absolute
                                resource allocation mode, only the selected queue is added to the
                                configuration. 
As there was no change in the queue’s resource
                                configuration, no asterisk was added next to the queue’s name.



Optional: 
Revert Changes.

If you want to revert changes you made to a queue, click the three vertical
                        dots next to the name of the queue and select Revert
                            Changes.
As a result, in relative resource allocation mode all changes on
                        the selected queue and its sibling queues are reverted. In absolute resource
                        allocation mode, only the changes of the selected queue are reverted. 

Optional: 
Remove from Configuration.

If you want to remove a queue with its current resource
                        configuration from the Dynamic Configuration, click the three vertical dots
                        next to the queue’s name and click Remove from
                            Configuration.
As a result, in relative resource allocation mode the selected
                        queue and its sibling queues are removed from the configuration. In absolute
                        resource allocation mode, only the selected queue is removed to the
                        configuration

Specify Schedule.
importantWhen specifying schedule the date
                        and time that is taken into account is the server date and time, not the
                        local date and time of the user.Set up a schedule to control how
                    frequently the Dynamic Configuration is applied.The time and
                        frequency can be configured using the various options available on the page.
                        Once an option is selected a note appears on the top of the window that
                        tells you the exact time and frequency when the schedule is applied.
                        

Using the Apply at minute: and
                            Of the hours: options, you can set the exact time
                        when a configuration should be applied. The Of the
                            hours: section allows multiple values to be selected
                        simultaneously. The Apply at minute: option however
                        only accepts a single value. This means that while you can specify a
                        schedule to apply at 6:00 AM and at 8:00 AM, you can't specify a schedule to
                        apply for example at 6:00 AM and 8:15 AM. If you use the default 0 value for
                        the Apply at minute: option, and you do not select
                        any hours, then the configuration will be applied at every hour.You can configure the schedule on a weekly or a monthly basis, by
                        selecting either Limit by: Day of the week
                            or Limit by: Day of the month.If
                        you select Day of the week, you can choose from the
                        following options:
Every day of the week
Only on: The configuration is applied
                            on selected day or days of the week.
On the [***FIRST-LAST***]
[***MON-SUN****] of the month: The
                            configuration is applied on the selected day.
If you select Day of the month, you can
                        choose from the following options:
Every day of the month
Every # days starting on day
                                    # of the month: The configuration
                            is applied on the specified days based on the configured starting day
                            and frequency.
On day(s): The configuration is applied
                            on the specified days. This option accepts integers 1-31. You can
                            specify a single integer to select a single day, specify a range to
                            select multiple days, or you can also add a combination of the two. For
                            example, 1-5, 8, 11-13. 

# day before the last day of the
                                month
On the weekday nearest day # of
                                the month
On the last weekday of the month
In addition, you can specify month or months when the schedule
                        is applied. If you do not specify any month, the schedule is applied in
                        every month. Consider the following example: 
Apply at minute: 15
Of the hours: AM 2, 6 and PM 2, 6
Limit by: Day of the week
Only on: Monday, Wednesday
During the months: February, March
Then the configuration will be applied at 02:15 AM,
                        06:15 AM, 02:15 PM and 06:15 PM, only on Monday and Wednesday, only in
                        February and May. The UI will display the schedule:
