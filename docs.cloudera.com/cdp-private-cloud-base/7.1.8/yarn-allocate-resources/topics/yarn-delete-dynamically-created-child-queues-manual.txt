Deleting dynamically created child queues manually
Deleting dynamically created child queues manually is not supported by the YARN Queue Manager UI, but there are some workarounds to remove them. It can be useful, for example, when the applications in that queue are terminated.
  
There are two ways to remove dynamically created child queues manually:
Restart the YARN service: That stops and deletes all dynamically created queues.
Stop and then delete the parent queue of the dynamically created child queues: This will
          delete both the dynamic parent and all of its child queues - both static and dynamic
          ones.
