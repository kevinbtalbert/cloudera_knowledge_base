Deleting queues
You must first stop the queue before deleting the queue. You can delete a single queue and
    also parent queue and its children if all the queues in the hierarchy are stopped.
In Capacity Scheduler, parent queues, child queues, and the root queue can all be stopped. For an application to be accepted at any child queue, all the queues in the hierarchy all the way up to the root queue must be running. This means that if a parent queue is stopped, all of the descendant queues in that hierarchy are inactive, even if their own state is RUNNING.
noteIf the queue is associated with one or more partitions, you must first set the partition
      capacity to zero using Edit Child Queue for that queue for all the
      partitions before you delete the queue.

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters > YARN Queue Manager UI
        service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview tab. 
Click on the three vertical dots on the queue and select Delete Queue .You can use the Delete Queues and its Children option to delete both parent queue
          and its children queues. 
You will be prompted for a confirmation. Click OK to stop the
        queue. 

noteQueue associated with a placement rule cannot be deleted until its associated placement
      rule is deleted. For more information about deleting placement rules, see Deleting placement rules.
