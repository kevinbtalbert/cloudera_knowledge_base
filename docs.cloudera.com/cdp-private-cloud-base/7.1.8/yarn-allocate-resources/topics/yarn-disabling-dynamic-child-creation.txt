Disabling dynamic child creation in weight mode
In the weight resource allocation a dynamic child creation enabled parent queue can
        have both static and dynamic child queues.  If you disable the dynamic child creation
        feature for a parent queue its dynamic child queues are deleted, and it can have only static
        queues. 
Ensure that no placement rule uses the dynamic child
            creation enabled parent queue for which you want to disable the dynamic child creation
            feature. The YARN Queue Manager UI will not let you disable the feature for a parent
            queue that is used by a placement rule. 

In Cloudera Manager navigate to Clusters >  YARN Queue Manager UI

Find the dynamic child creation enabled queue for which you want to disable the
                    dynamic child creation feature.

Click the three vertical dots next to the queue name.

Select Disable Dynamic Child Creation.

Click Yes to confirm to disable.

On the YARN Queue Manager UI, and also on the YARN Web UI, the dynamic
                    child queues of the selected parent queue are removed. However, if there were
                    any running applications on such child queues they will continue running in
                    their original queue. 

Restart the YARN service.

All dynamically created child queues of the selected parent
            queue are deleted. After the YARN service restart placement rules are reevaluated and
            applications that were running on the deleted dynamic child queues are either moved to a
            different queue or are rejected according to the placement rules.
