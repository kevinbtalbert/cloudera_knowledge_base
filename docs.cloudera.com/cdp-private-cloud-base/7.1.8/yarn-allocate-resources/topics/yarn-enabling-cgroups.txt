Enable Cgroups
You can enable CPU Scheduling to enable cgroups. You must configure certain properties
      in yarn-site.xml on the ResourceManager and NodeManager hosts to enable
      cgroups.

cgroups is a Linux kernel feature. cgroups is supported on the following Linux operating
            systems:


CentOS 6.9, 7.3


RHEL 6.9, 7.3


SUSE 12


Ubuntu 16


At this time there is no cgroups equivalent for Windows. cgroups are not enabled by
            default on CDP. cgroups require that the CDP cluster be Kerberos enabled.

The yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.cgroups.mount property
               must be set to false. Setting this value to true is
               not currently supported.



Enable cgroups
The following commands must be run on every reboot of the
               NodeManager hosts to set up the cgroup hierarchy. Note that operating systems use
               different mount points for the cgroup interface. Replace
                  /sys/fs/cgroup with your operating system equivalent.
mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/yarn
chown -R yarn /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/yarn
mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/yarn
chown -R yarn /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/yarn
mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/yarn
chown -R yarn /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/yarn
mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls/yarn
chown -R yarn /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls/yarn
mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/devices/yarn
chown -R yarn /sys/fs/cgroup/devices/yarn

In Cloudera Manager, select the YARN service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Search for Always Use Linux Container Executor and select YARN-1 (Service-Wide) option.

Search for NodeManager Advanced Configuration and set the below property in the NodeManager Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for yarn-site.xml field.
Name:  yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.group
Value: hadoop

Search for CGroups and select YARN-1 (Service-Wide) option in the Use CGroups for Resource Management field.

Search for CGroups Hierarchy and set the NodeManager Default Group value to /hadoop-yarn.

Search for NodeManager Advanced Configuration and set the below property in the NodeManager Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for yarn-site.xml field.
Name:  yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.cgroups.mount
Value: false
Name:  yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.cgroups.mount-path
Value: /sys/fs/cgroup

(Optional) Set the percentage of CPU to be used by YARN. Search for
                  Containers CPU Limit and set the value in the
                  Containers CPU Limit Percentage field.
Set the percentage of CPU that can be allocated for YARN containers. In most
               cases, the default value of 100% should be used. If you have another process that
               needs to run on a node that also requires CPU resources, you can lower the percentage
               of CPU allocated to YARN to free up resources for the other process.

(Optional) Set flexible or strict CPU limits. Search for Strict CGroup
                  Resource Usage and select the  NodeManager Default
                  Group field.

CPU jobs are constrained with CPU scheduling and cgroups enabled, but by default
                  these are flexible limits. If spare CPU cycles are available, containers are
                  allowed to exceed the CPU limits set for them. With flexible limits, the amount of
                  CPU resources available for containers to use can vary based on cluster usage --
                  the amount of CPU available in the cluster at any given time. 
You can use cgroups to set strict limits on CPU usage. When strict limits are
                  enabled, each process receives only the amount of CPU resources it requests. With
                  strict limits, a CPU process will receive the same amount of cluster resources
                  every time it runs. 
Strict limits are not enabled (set to false) by default.
noteIrrespective of whether this property is true or false, at no point will total container CPU usage exceed the limit set in yarn.nodemanager.resource.percentage-physical-cpu-limit. 
noteCPU resource isolation leverages advanced features in the Linux kernel. At this time, setting yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.cgroups.strict-resource-usage to true is not recommended due to known kernel panics. In addition, with some kernels, setting yarn.nodemanager.resource.percentage- physical-cpu-limit to a value less than 100 can result in kernel panics. If you require either of these features, you must perform scale testing to determine if the in-use kernel and workloads are stable. As a starting point, Linux kernel version 4.8.1 works with these features. However, testing the features with the desired workloads is very important.
