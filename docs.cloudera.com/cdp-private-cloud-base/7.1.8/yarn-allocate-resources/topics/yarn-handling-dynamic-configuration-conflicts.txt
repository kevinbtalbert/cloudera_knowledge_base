Handling Dynamic Configuration conflicts
A dynamic queue configuration related scheduling conflict occurs if two or more
        Dynamic Configurations are scheduled to be applied at the same time. You can either enable
        Dynamic Configuration with conflicts or modify the conflicting Dynamic Configuration to
        resolve conflicts. 

When a Dynamic Configuration is created with a schedule that conflicts with one or
                more other Dynamic Configuration, the new Dynamic Configuration will be saved in a
                disabled with conflict state.note Although recurrence
                    patterns of Dynamic Configurations can be open ended, scheduling conflicts are
                    detected only one year ahead of time.


Find the Dynamic Configuration that is conflicted.

Click the three vertical dots in the line of the conflicted Dynamic
                    Configuration.

Select View Conflicts.
All conflicting Dynamic Configurations and conflicting times are
                    displayed.

Review the conflicts and perform one of the following:

                                        the conflicted Dynamic Configurations one after another
                                        without any predetermined order. 

Resolve conflicts by modifying the conflicting schedule:
