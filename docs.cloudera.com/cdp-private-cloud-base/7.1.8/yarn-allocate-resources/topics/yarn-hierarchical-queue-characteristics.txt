Hierarchical queue characteristics
You must consider the various characteristics of the Capacity Scheduler hierarchical queues before setting them up.
 There are two types of queues: parent queues and leaf queues.


 Parent queues enable the management of resources across organizations and sub-
            organizations. They can contain more parent queues or leaf queues. They do not
            themselves accept any application submissions directly.


Leaf queues are the queues that live under a parent queue and accept applications. Leaf
            queues do not have any
child queues, and therefore do not have any configuration property that ends with
            ".queues".




 There is a top-level parent root queue that does not
            belong to any organization, but instead represents the cluster itself.


 Using parent and leaf queues, administrators can specify capacity allocations for
            various organizations and sub-organizations.
