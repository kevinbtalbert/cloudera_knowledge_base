Scheduling among queues
Hierarchical queues ensure that guaranteed resources are first shared among the sub-queues of an organization before any remaining free resources are shared with queues belonging to other organizations. This enables each organization to have control over the utilization of its guaranteed resources.

At each level in the hierarchy, every parent queue keeps the list of its child queues in a sorted manner based on demand. The sorting of the queues is determined by the currently used fraction of each queueâ€™s capacity (or the full-path queue names if the reserved capacity of any two queues is equal).
      
 The root queue understands how the cluster capacity needs to be distributed among the first level of parent queues and invokes scheduling on each of its child queues.
      
Every parent queue applies its capacity constraints to all of its child queues.
 Leaf queues hold the list of active applications (potentially from multiple users) and
        schedules resources in a FIFO (First In, First Out) manner, while at the same time adhering
        to capacity limits specified for individual users.
