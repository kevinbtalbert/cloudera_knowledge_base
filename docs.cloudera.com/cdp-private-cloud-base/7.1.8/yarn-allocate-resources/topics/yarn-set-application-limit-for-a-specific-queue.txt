Setting Maximum Application limit for a specific queue
You can set the maximum number of applications that can run in a specific queue. This
    limit overrides itâ€™s parent queue limit if this specific queue level value is lesser than what
    is set for the parent queue.  

You can set the maximum-application-limit  property using the Maximum
          Application queue property. The limit for running applications in any specific
        queue is a fraction of this total limit, proportional to its capacity. This is a hard limit,
        which means that once this limit is reached for a queue, any new applications to that queue
        will be rejected, and clients will have to wait and retry later. 
To set the application limit (yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.maximum-applications) on a specific queue, perform the following:


In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters > YARN Queue Manager UI
          service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview tab. 

Click on the three vertical dots on the queue and select View/Edit Queue
            Properties option.

In the Queue Properties dialog-box, enter the maximum
          application limit in the Maximum Application text box. 

Click Save.

For information about setting application limits on all the queues, see Set Application
            Limits.
