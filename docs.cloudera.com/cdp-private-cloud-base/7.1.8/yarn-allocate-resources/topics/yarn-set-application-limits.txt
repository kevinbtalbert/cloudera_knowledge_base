Setting global application limits
To avoid system-thrash due to an unmanageable load -- caused either by malicious users, or by accident -- the Capacity Scheduler enables you to place a static, configurable limit on the total number of concurrently active (both running and pending) applications at any one time.
  
You can set the maximum applications limit (yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-applications) using this configuration property. The default value is 10,000.

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters > YARN Queue Manager UI
        service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview tab. 
Click on the Scheduler Configuration tab.
Enter the maximum application limit in the Maximum Applications
        text box. 
Click Save.

For information about overriding this limit on a per-queue basis, see Set Application limit for a specific queue.
