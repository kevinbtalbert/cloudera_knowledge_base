Setting global maximum application priority
You can use Priority Scheduling to run YARN applications at higher priority, regardless of other applications that are already running in the cluster. YARN allocates more resources to applications running at a higher priority over those running at a lower priority. Priority Scheduling enables you to set an application's priority both at the time of submission and dynamically at run time.
  

Priority Scheduling works only with the FIFO (First In, First Out) ordering policy. FIFO is
        the default Capacity Scheduler ordering policy. 
To set appliation priority (yarn.cluster.max-application-priority), perform the following:


In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters > YARN Queue Manager UI
          service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview tab. 

Click the Configuration tab.

Enter the priority in the Maximum Application Priority text box.
        

Click Save.
