Setting maximum parallel application limits for a specific queue
You can set the maximum number of applications that can run in a specific queue. This
    limit overrides itâ€™s parent queue limit if this specific queue level value is lesser than what
    is set for the parent queue.
Learn how the parallel application limits are inherited from the parent queue in the
      queue hierarchy and its evaluation. For more information, see Maximum Parallel Application settings 
      .

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters > YARN Queue Manager UI
          service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview tab. 

Click on the three vertical dots on the queue and select Edit Queue
            Properties option.

In the Queue Properties dialog-box, enter the maximum parallel
          application limit in the Maximum Parallel Applications text
          box.

Click Save.
