Use CPU scheduling
Cgroups with CPU scheduling helps you effectively manage mixed workloads.
noteYou should use CPU scheduling only in a Linux environment, because there is no isolation
         mechanism (cgroups equivalent) for Windows.
MapReduce jobs only

If you primarily run
         MapReduce jobs on your cluster, enabling CPU scheduling does not change performance much.
         The dominant resource for MapReduce is memory, so the DRF scheduler continues to balance
         MapReduce jobs in a manner similar to the default resource calculator. In the case of a
         single resource, the DRF reduces to max-min fairness for that resource.

Mixed workloads

An example of a mixed
         workload is a cluster that runs both MapReduce and Storm on YARN. MapReduce is not
         CPU-constrained, but Storm on YARN is; its containers require more CPU than memory. As you
         add Storm jobs along with MapReduce jobs, the DRF scheduler tries to balance memory and CPU
         resources, but you might see some performance degradation in as a result. As you add more
         CPU-intensive Storm jobs, individual jobs start to take longer to run as the cluster CPU
         resources are consumed.
To solve this problem, you
         can use cgroups along with CPU scheduling. Using cgroups provides isolation for
         CPU-intensive processes such as Storm on YARN, thereby enabling you to predictably plan and
         constrain the CPU-intensive Storm containers.
You can also use partitions
         in conjunction with CPU scheduling and cgroups to restrict Storm on YARN jobs to a subset
         of cluster nodes.

Configure CPU scheduling and isolationYou can configure CPU scheduling on your cluster to allocate the best possible nodes       having the required CPU resources for application containers.Use CPU scheduling with distributed shellYou can run the distributed shell by specifying resources other than memory and       vCores. The following is an example for distributed shell but you can use CPU scheduling with       other frameworks as well.Parent topic: Resource scheduling and management
