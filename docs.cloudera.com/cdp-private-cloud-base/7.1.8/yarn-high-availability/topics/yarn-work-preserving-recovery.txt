Work preserving recovery for YARN components
With work preserving recovery enabled, if a ResourceManager or NodeManager restarts, no
  in-flight work is lost. 
You can configure work preserving recovery separately for a ResourceManager
   or NodeManager. You can use work preserving recovery whether or not you use ResourceManager High
    Availability.noteYARN does not support high availability for the
    JobHistory Server (JHS). If the JHS goes down, Cloudera Manager will restart it
    automatically.
note
After moving the JobHistory Server to a new host, the URLs listed for the
     JobHistory Server on the ResourceManager web UI still point to the old JobHistory Server. This
     affects existing jobs only. New jobs started after the move are not affected. For any existing
     jobs that have the incorrect JobHistory Server URL, there is no option other than to allow the
     jobs to roll off the history over time. For new jobs, make sure that all clients have the
     updated mapred-site.xml that references
     the correct JobHistory Server.
