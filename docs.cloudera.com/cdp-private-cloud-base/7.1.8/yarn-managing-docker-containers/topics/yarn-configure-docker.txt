Configuring Docker
After Docker is installed, edit the Docker's daemon configuration (daemon.json) file
        to add the recommended configuration.

Note that configuring the storage driver is not included. That has to be added after
                reviewing the storage driver options. 


Add the following options to the /etc/docker/daemon.json
                    file: 

{
        "live-restore" : true,
        "debug" : true
}



Ensure that Docker is using the cgroupfs cgroupdriver option
                    when YARN cgroups support is enabled.

vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
Find and add the following line to the cgroupdriver:
--exec-opt native.cgroupdriver=cgroupfs \
