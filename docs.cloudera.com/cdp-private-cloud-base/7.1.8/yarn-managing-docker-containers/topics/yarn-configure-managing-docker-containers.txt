Configuring YARN for managing Docker containers
Use Cloudera Manager to configure YARN for managing Docker containers.


Install Docker binary to all hosts.
If cgroups are enabled, use the cgroupsfs cgroupsdriver for
                    cgroups support.
Ensure that all host has running docker daemon



In Cloudera Manager, select the YARN service.

Select the Configuration tab.

Find the Always Use Linux Container Executor property
                    and select it. That enables the YARN service to use the Linux Container
                    Executor.

Search for Allowed Linux Runtimes and add
                        docker to the list.

Find the Enable Docker Containers property and select
                    the role configuration groups on which you want to enable Docker
                    containers.

If you installed the Docker binaries to a different folder than the default,
                    set the Docker Binary Path property to the applicable
                    folder.
Optional: 
Use the other properties under the Docker on YARN filter
                    to fine-grain the configuration. For more information, see Docker on YARN
                        configuration properties.

Click Save Changes.
