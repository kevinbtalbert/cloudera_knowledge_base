Prerequisites for installing Docker
Docker's container management capabilities are highly dependent on the Linux OS
        kernel version and capabilities. As a result, Docker only supports systems with modern
        kernels. It is recommended to check with your operating system vendor for supported system
        configurations for use with Docker.
See the Support Matrix for the operating system requirements.
