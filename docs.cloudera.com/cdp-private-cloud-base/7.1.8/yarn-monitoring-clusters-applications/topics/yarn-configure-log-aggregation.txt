Configuring log aggregation
Log aggregation is enabled by default. You can configure it using Cloudera
        Manager.

In Cloudera Manager, select the YARN service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select the Log Aggregation filter under Category.
Every log aggregation related property is displayed.

Find the Enable Log Aggregation property and ensure that
                    it is selected, meaning that log aggregation is enabled.

Configure the log aggregation properties as applicable.

The remote-app-log-dir and
                                remote-app-log-dir-suffix configuration properties
                            are not backward compatible. If you change their value later, the logs
                            of applications that are already finished cannot be read.
