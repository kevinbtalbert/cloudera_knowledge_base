Log aggregation file controllers
By default, log aggregation supports two file controllers, TFile and IFile. You can also
  add your own custom file controller.
By default IFile is used to write the aggregated logs.noteTFile and IFile are commonly
    referred as file formats. However, they do not only define the format of the file, but also how
    the log aggregation is managed. Therefore referring to them as file controllers specifies them
    more clearly.
TFile
TFile is the legacy file controller in YARN. It is reliable and well tested. Its buffer and
    chunk sizes are configurable.
    
TFile provides the following features:

Block compression


Named metadata blocks


Sorted or unsorted keys


Seek by key or by file offset



IFile
IFile is a newer file controller than TFile. It also uses TFile internally so it provides the
    same features as TFile.
In an IFile the files are indexed so it is faster to search in the aggregated log file than in
    a regular TFile. It uses checksums and temporary files which help to prevent failures. Its
    buffer sizes and rollover file size are configurable on top of the configuration options of
    TFile.
