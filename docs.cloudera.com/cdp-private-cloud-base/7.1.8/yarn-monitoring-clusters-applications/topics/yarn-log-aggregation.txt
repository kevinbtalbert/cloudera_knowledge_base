YARN log aggregation overview
The YARN Log Aggregation feature enables you to move local log files of any application onto HDFS or a cloud-based storage depending on your cluster configuration.
 
Application logs has great significance: meaningful information can be extracted from them, can
   be used to debug issues or can be kept for historical analysis. YARN can move local logs securely
   onto HDFS or a cloud-based storage, such as AWS. This allows the logs to be stored for a much
   longer time than they could be on a local disk, allows faster search for a particular log file
   and optionally can handle compression.
