Understanding YARN
      architecture
YARN allows you to use
      various data processing engines for batch, interactive, and real-time stream processing of
      data stored in HDFS or cloud storage like S3 and ADLS. You can use different processing
      frameworks for different use-cases, for example, you can run Hive for SQL applications, Spark
      for in-memory applications, and Storm for streaming applications, all on the same Hadoop
      cluster. 


YARN extends the power of Hadoop to new technologies found within the data center so
               that you can take advantage of cost-effective linear-scale storage and processing. It
               provides independent software vendors and developers a consistent framework for
               writing data access applications that run in Hadoop.
               
YARN architecture and workflowYARN has three main components:

ResourceManager: Allocates cluster resources using a Scheduler and
                        ApplicationManager.


ApplicationMaster: Manages the life-cycle of a job by directing the
                        NodeManager to create or destroy a container for a job. There is only one
                        ApplicationMaster for a job. 


NodeManager: Manages jobs or workflow in a specific node by creating and
                        destroying containers in a cluster node.
