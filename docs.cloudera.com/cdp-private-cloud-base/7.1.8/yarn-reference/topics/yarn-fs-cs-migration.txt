Migration from Fair
      Scheduler to Capacity Scheduler 
Starting from the CDP CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1 release,
      Cloudera provides the fs2cs conversion utility, which is a CLI application
      and is a part of the YARN CLI command. This utility helps to migrate from Fair Scheduler to
      Capacity Scheduler.
For information about using the fs2cs
conversion utility, the scheduler conversion process, and manual configurations, see Migrating Fair Scheduler to Capacity Scheduler.
