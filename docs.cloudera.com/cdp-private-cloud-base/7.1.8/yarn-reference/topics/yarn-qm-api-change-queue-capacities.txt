You can specify the capacity for a particular partition using the
                        accessible-node-labels.<name-of-the-partition>.capacity
                     option. The total capacity of all the queues in a given partition must be equal
                     to 100% of the parent queue in the Relative mode. The total allocated capacity
                     of all the queues and the must be less than or equal to the capacity of the
                     parent in the Absolute mode.
YARN Queue Manager does not support mixed allocation of resources. That is,
                     some queues allocated using percentages and some queues using absolute units.
                     Hence, you must not update the capacities in mixed mode at different levels.
                     You must set the capacities at all levels in the same mode and that mode must
                     match with the current Queue Manager mode.
