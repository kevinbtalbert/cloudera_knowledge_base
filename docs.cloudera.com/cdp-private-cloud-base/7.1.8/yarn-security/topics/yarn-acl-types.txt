YARN ACL types
There are three different kinds of YARN ACL types: YARN Admin ACLs, YARN Queue ACLs and
    YARN Application ACLs.
Admin ACLsUse the YARN Admin ACLs to allow users to run YARN administrator sub-commands, which       are executed via the yarn rmadmin <command>.Queue ACLs  Use Queue ACLs to control access rights to users and administrators to the Capacity     Scheduler queues. Application submission can really only happen at the leaf queue level, but an     ACL restriction set on a parent queue will be applied to all of its descendant     queues.Application ACLsUse Application ACLs to provide a user or group access to an application.
