Application ACLs
Use Application ACLs to provide a user or group access to an application. 
Use Application ACLs to provide a user and/or group–neither of whom is the
   owner–access to an application. The most common use case for Application ACLs occurs when you
   have a team of users collaborating on or managing a set of applications, and you need to provide
   read access to logs and job statistics, or access to allow for the modification of a job (killing
   the job) and/or application. Application ACLs are set per application and are managed by the
   application owner.
Users who start an application (the owners) always have access to the
   application they start, which includes the application logs, job statistics, and ACLs. No other
   user can remove or change owner access. By default, no other users have access to the application
   data because the Application ACL defaults to “ “ (single space), which means no one has
   access.
