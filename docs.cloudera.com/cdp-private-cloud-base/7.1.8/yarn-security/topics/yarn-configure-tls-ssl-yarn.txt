Configuring TLS/SSL for YARN
If you enabled TLS/SSL for HDFS, you must also enable it for YARN.

If you enable TLS/SSL for HDFS, you must also enable it for YARN.
Cloudera recommends to enable Web UI authentication for YARN.


In Cloudera Manager, select the YARN service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Search for TLS/SSL.

Find and edit the following properties according to your cluster
                    configuration:
