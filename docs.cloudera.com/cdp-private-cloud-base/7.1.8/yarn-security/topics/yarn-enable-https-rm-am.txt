Enabling HTTPS between ResourceManager and Application Master
If you want to enable HTTPS communication between the ResourceManager and the
        Application Master, you have to use a ResourceManager-level and two Application Master-level
        configuration properties.

Enable HTTPS communication on the ResourceManager’s side:


Navigate to Cloudera Manager.


Select the YARN service.


Search for ResourceManager and find the
                                ResourceManager Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                                Valve) for yarn-site.xml safety valve.


Add the following configuration:

<property>
<name>yarn.resourcemanager.application-https.policy</name>
<value>STRICT</value>
</property>




Restart the ResourceManager to apply the configuration change.

HTTPS communication is enabled on the ResourceManager’s side.
                                Keystore and Truststore are available.
There are two supported Keystore and Truststore formats. The format
                                is automatically set by the ResourceManager:
JKS: when FIPS is not enabled
BCFKS: when FIPS is enabled

The NodeManager collects the Keystore and Truststore related
                                information (location on the file system, password, and format) and
                                uses environment variables to provide the Application Master with
                                the information.




Enable the HTTPS communication on the ApplicationMaster’s side:

When submitting a job set the
                            yarn.app.mapreduce.am.webapp.https.enabled and the
                            yarn.app.mapreduce.am.webapp.https.client.auth
                        properties to true.
The following is an example of a simple ‘pi job’ that can be considered as a
                        test job. Note that the jar file is depending on the deployed CDP version:
                        yarn jar /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-7.1.5-1.cdh7.1.5.p0.6683980/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-3.1.1.7.1.5.0-149.jar pi -Dyarn.app.mapreduce.am.webapp.https.enabled=true -Dyarn.app.mapreduce.am.webapp.https.client.auth=true 1 1000



HTTPS communication between ResourceManager and Application Master is
                        enabled.
