Configure four-letter-word commands in ZooKeeper
Four-letter-words commands are simple diagnostics commands that can be used over
        telnet for ZooKeeper. These commands can be configured with Cloudera Manager.

You can configure which four-letter-words commands you want to enable in ZooKeeper.
                By default the wchp and the wchc commands are disabled. 


In Cloudera Manager, select the ZooKeeper service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Search for 4lw.

Find the ZooKeeper 'Four Letter Word' Command Whitelist
                    property.

Use the minus and plus icon to remove or add four-letter-word commands to the
                    allowlist.

By default the following commands are on the allowlist:
                        conf, cons, crst,
                            dirs, dump, envi,
                            gtmk, ruok, stmk,
                            srst, stat, wchs,
                            mntr, and isro.
The wchp and wchc commands are not enabled
                        by default because of their known DOS vulnerability. For more information,
                        see ZOOKEEPER-2693.
If * is set, all commands are enabled.
