ZooKeeper ACLs Best Practices: HDFS
You must follow the best practices for tightening the ZooKeeper ACLs or permissions for
  HDFS when provisioning a secure cluster.



ZooKeeper Usage: 


hadoop-ha: Default ZNode for unsecured and secured clusters.






Default ACLs:


In an unsecured deployment, the default ACL is world: anyone: cdrwa


In a secured deployment, the default ACL is digest: hdfs-fcs: cdrwa





Security Best Practice ACLs/Permissions and
      Required Steps:


HDFS ZNodes are protected with digest authentication by default in a secure CDP cluster.
        You need not modify Zookeeper ACLs on HDFS ZNodes or alter any ACLs by hand.
