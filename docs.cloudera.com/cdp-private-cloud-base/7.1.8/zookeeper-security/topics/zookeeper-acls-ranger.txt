ZooKeeper ACLs Best Practices: Ranger
You must follow the best practices for tightening the ZooKeeper ACLs or permissions for Ranger when provisioning a secure cluster.


ZooKeeper Usage:

Ranger does not use ZooKeeper directly. Only if Audit to Solr is
         enabled and Solr is configured in SolrCloud mode, Solr nodes will need to access zookeeper
         node /ranger_audits.

/ranger_audits






Default ACLs:


/ranger_audits - world:anyone:cdrwa






Security Best Practice ACLs/Permissions and Required Steps:

Only Solr needs access to this Znode:

/ranger_audits - sasl:solr:cdrwa



After enabling SolrCloud, edit the Ranger collection path permission on Znode:

SSH to the cluster.
For example, any host where the ZooKeeper server is running.


Start the ZooKeeper CLI by running the following
            command:zookeeper-client -server [***ZOOKEEPER SERVER HOST***]:[***ZOOKEEPER CLIENT PORT***]
The default port of zookeeper client port is 2181.


After it connects, run: ls /



Verify there is a folder for the Ranger Solr collection.


Run getAcl /ranger_audits and if the permission is for
             world,anyone: cdrwa, restrict the permission to
             “sasl:solr:cdrwa” using this command: setAcl /ranger_audits
             sasl:solr:cdrwa.


Repeat the above step for all clusters where SolrCloud is installed.
