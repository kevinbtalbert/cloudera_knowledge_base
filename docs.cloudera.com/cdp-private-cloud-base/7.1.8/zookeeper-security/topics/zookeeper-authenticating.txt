ZooKeeper Authentication
ZooKeeper supports mutual server-to-server (quorum peer) authentication using SASL
  (Simple Authentication and Security Layer), which provides a layer around Kerberos authentication. 
Server to server authentication among ZooKeeper servers in an ensemble mitigates the risk of
   spoofing by a rogue server on an unsecured network. For more information about quorum peer
   authentication and how the feature leverages ZooKeeper's SASL support, see the Cloudera
   Engineering Blog post, Hardening Apache ZooKeeper Security.
Configuring ZooKeeper to use Kerberos for client-server or server-server authentication
   requires that your organization's Kerberos instance (MIT Kerberos, Microsoft Active Directory) be
   up and running, and reachable by the ZooKeeper server or client during the configuration
   processes detailed below.
Before enabling mutual authentication, the ZooKeeper servers in the cluster must be configured
   to authenticate using Kerberos.
Cloudera recommends that you ensure your ZooKeeper ensemble is working properly, before you
   attempt to integrate Kerberos authentication.

Configure ZooKeeper server for Kerberos authenticationYou can configure the ZooKeeper server for Kerberos authentication in Cloudera         Manager.Configure ZooKeeper client shell for Kerberos authenticationIn addition to configuring ZooKeeper Server hosts to use Kerberos for authentication,         you must configure the ZooKeeper client shell to authenticate to the ZooKeeper service using         Kerberos credentials.Verify the ZooKeeper authenticationAfter enabling Kerberos authentication and restarting the ZooKeeper cluster, you can         verify that the ZooKeeper authentication is working correctly.Enable server-server mutual authenticationYou can enable mutual authentication between multiple ZooKeeper Servers.Use Digest Authentication Provider in ZooKeeperCloudera recommends to override the default SHA1 algorithm and use a more secure one   when using the Digest Authentication Provider in ZooKeeper.
