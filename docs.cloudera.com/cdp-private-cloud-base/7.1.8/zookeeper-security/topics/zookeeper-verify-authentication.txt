Verify the ZooKeeper authentication
After enabling Kerberos authentication and restarting the ZooKeeper cluster, you can
        verify that the ZooKeeper authentication is working correctly.

Start the ZooKeeper client, passing to it the name of a ZooKeeper server:

zookeeper-client -server fqdn.example.com:port


From the ZooKeeper CLI, create a protected znode using your
                    ZooKeeper client principal.

create /znode1 znode1data sasl:zkcli:cdwra
Cloudera Manager by default maps the Kerberos principal to its short name by
                        setting two parameters in ZooKeeper's service configuration file
                            zoo.cfg:
                        kerberos.removeHostFromPrincipal=true
kerberos.removeRealmFromPrincipal=true
With the help of above settings, for example, the client principal
                            zkcli/myhost@EXAMPLE.COM will be authenticated in
                        ZooKeeper as zkcli.


Verify the znode created and the ACL is set correctly:

getAcl/znode1

The getAcl command returns the znode's scheme and
                    permission values.

Verify that the znode's scheme and permissions values are as expected.
