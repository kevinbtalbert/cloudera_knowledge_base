How to use the CDP Private Cloud Data Services sizing spreadsheet 
You can use the sizing spreadsheet to model the hardware
    requirements for a CDP Private Cloud Data Services deployment. 
Overview
The CDP Private Cloud Data Services Sizing spreadsheet is a
        spreadsheet that you can use to model the quantity and specifications
        for worker hosts required in a CDP Private Cloud Data Services
        deployment. 
This spreadsheet is intended to use information about
        workloads you are planning to run and hardware specifications for worker
        nodes to arrive at an approximate number of worker nodes required for
        your deployment. Due to the complexity of estimating workloads, Cloudera
        recommends you review any sizing or purchasing decisions with Cloudera
        Professional Services before committing to those decisions. 

How to access the spreadsheet
You can access the spreadsheet here:  CDP Private Cloud Data Services Sizing. The file is in
        Microsoft Excel format. You can open the file in Excel, or upload it to
        Google Sheets. 
There are three tabs in the spreadsheet. You will make your
        inputs only on the Worker Node Totals tab. Do not modify the
        following tabs (these tabs contain data used to calculate values in the
        spreadsheet and should not be modified):


Component Lookup


K8s Resources


importantDo not modify any cells except for the ones
        indicated below. Modifying the formulas in other cells will result in
        inaccurate calculations.

Workload inputs
The spreadsheet calculates the total amount vcores, RAM, and storage required
        based on information you enter about the combined workloads you intend to deploy. Then based
        on the hardware specifications entered, calculates the number of worker nodes required,
        which is displayed in cell E24. 
The following sections describe values you must enter into
        the spreadsheet. Values are required for each Data Service you intend to
        deploy, and values to enter for the hardware specifications for your
        worker nodes.

Worker node hardware specifications
Based on the inputs you supplied for your workloads, the
        spreadsheet totals the number of vcores, RAM, and storage required for
        the cluster in cells C20-C26. Then, based on the worker node hardware
        specifications you enter in cells B26-B29, divides the totals for
        vcores, RAM and storage by each of the worker node specifications to
        arrive at the required number of nodes for vcores, RAM and storage shown
        in cells D5-D29. The final number, in cell E27 chooses the higher value
        of these cells. 
You may notice that the calculated values in cells D26 and
        D27 are different. This indicates that some nodes are oversubscribed for
        RAM or vcores. Adjust the hardware specifications for CPU and RAM until
        the two cells are closer together in value. Changing these values may
        also change the calculated number of worker nodes.
