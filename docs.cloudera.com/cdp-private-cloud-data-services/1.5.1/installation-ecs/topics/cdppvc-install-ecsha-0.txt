Enable ECS Server HA and promote agents Post ECS Installation
If you want to enable ECS Server for High Availability after installing ECS, then you
  must proceed with this section. If you do not want to enable ECS HA, you can safely ignore this
  section.
As a prerequisite, during the installation, you must have installed ECS with 1 master (with
   app_domain as Load Balancer URL) + agents. This allows you to promote Agents as masters.

Enabling ECS Server deployment for High AvailabilityLearn how to enable ECS Server deployment for High Availability by installing a Load   Balancer and promoting the existing ECS Agents to ECS Server. By performing this procedure, you   will be able to deploy HA on your existing ECS Server. Preparing the cluster for High Availability:Review the table to understand the requirements for enabling the High   Availability.High Level steps to enable an ECS High Availability clusterReview the high level steps to understand the steps in enabling High   Availability.Verifying DNS setupYou must verify the DNS setup to ensure that the app domain DNS hostname points to         the Load Balancer.Installing Load BalancerTo install the HAProxy Load Balancer, Cloudera uses an example that uses a single         instance of HAProxy, configured with round robin balancing and TCP mode. This allows for         non-terminating https (https passthrough). The HAProxy service can be configured for High         Availability using keepalived. Promoting ECS Agents to ECS ServersYou must promote ECS Agents to ECS Servers.Refreshing ECS After all the ECS Agents are promoted to ECS Servers, you must log in to Cloudera         Manager and refresh the ECS cluster.Parent topic: ECS Server High Availability
