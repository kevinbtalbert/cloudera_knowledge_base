Enabling ECS Server deployment for High Availability
Learn how to enable ECS Server deployment for High Availability by installing a Load
  Balancer and promoting the existing ECS Agents to ECS Server. By performing this procedure, you
  will be able to deploy HA on your existing ECS Server. 
If you have a production quality ECS cluster, then Cloudera recommends you to use ECS Server
   High Availability. You can also consider having an ECS Server HA for any non-production ECS
   cluster that you expect to be available long-term.
If you have Cloudera Manager 7.5.5, then you must have an ECS cluster installed and configured
   with a single ECS Server. 
You can enable an ECS cluster and convert it to a cluster protected by ECS Server HA. Enabling
   ECS Server deployment for High Availability involves preparing your cluster, configuring DNS
   wildcard entry, adding a Load Balancer into the topology, and promoting ECS Agents to the ECS
   Server. An ECS High Availability cluster must consist of:
An odd number of server nodes that will run etcd, the Kubernetes API, and other control
     plane services. Cloudera recommends a minimum of three ECS Server nodes.
Two or more agent nodes that are designated to run CDP data services.
A software or hardware Load balancer using TCP mode (non-terminating https). 
noteA Load Balancer is required for the ECS Server HA. This documentation uses HAProxy as
    an example. However, Cloudera recommends that you use your production quality Load Balancer
    technology from commercial vendors.
