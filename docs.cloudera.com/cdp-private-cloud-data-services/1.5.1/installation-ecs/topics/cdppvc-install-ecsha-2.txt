Preparing the cluster for High Availability:Cloudera Docs
Preparing the cluster for High Availability:
Review the table to understand the requirements for enabling the High
  Availability.


This process has been tested with a minimum of five ECS hosts. However, Cloudera recommends
     six or more hosts. 
DNS requirements for ECS High Availability must be fulfilled. 



Hostname
Subdomain
Expected Roles
DNS ForwardZone
Reverse Zone PTR



“Wildcard” (hostname = *) 
apps.ecs.example.com The string “apps” is required, “ecs” is up to user 
Virtual app domain wildcard
“A Record” wildcard (hostname = *), may be a CNAME on certain DNS systems that use
        text-based config. Resolves to fixed IP of ha_proxy (or VIP of some commerical LB’s) 
N


“apps alias”
apps.ecs.example.com
Virtual app domain alias
“CNAME” alias points to A Record of ha_proxy (or VIP). Alternatively, this can be an
        ARecord with IP of ha_proxy (or VIP)
N/A


HAProxy (or commercial LB)
<domain of your LB>
HA Load Balancer
Depends on vendor/software



ecs-master1
example.com
ECS Server 1 Docker server 
“A Record” resolves to IP of ecs-master1
Y


ecs-master2
example.com
ECS Server 2 Docker server 
“A Record” resolves to IP of ecs-master2
Y


ecs-master3
example.com
ECS Server 3 Docker server 
“ARecord” resolves to IP of ecs-master3
Y


ecs-agentN
example.com
ECS Agent N Docker server N 
“ARecord” resolves to IP of ecs-agentN
Y



note

The above table uses a consistent subdomain (“example.com”) but this is not mandatory. To
     support multiple domains, you must follow certain steps to ensure that the domains are forward
     and reverse resolvable using DNS, from all Base cluster and ECS cluster hosts (that is through
     forest/domain level trusts and/or hosts level /etc/resolv.conf config).
     You must avoid the use of /etc/hosts entries. 
A predefined wildcard DNS record allows the resolution of *.apps.<app domain
      name> to the IP address of the Load Balancer. You cannot proceed further until this is in
     place.
