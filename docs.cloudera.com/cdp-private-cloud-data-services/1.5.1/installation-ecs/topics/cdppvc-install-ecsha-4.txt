Verifying  DNS setup
You must verify the DNS setup to ensure that the app domain DNS hostname points to
        the Load Balancer.

Verify that the app domain DNS hostname has moved from single non-HA ECS Server to the Load Balancer.

ecs-loadbalancer.example.com
Load Balancer
Resolves to IP of LB host (or VIP). The example uses
                                        10.10.0.99. Both *.apps.ecs.example.com and
                                            apps.ecs.example.com resolve to 10.10.0.99.
                                    




Verify the DNS setup with nslookup.

noteYou must verify that a random hostname resolves in the wildcard entry. In
                        this example, Cloudera uses foobar.apps.ecs.example.com as the
                        random name. Both entries should resolve to the same IP address.

For example,
                    $ hosts="apps.ecs.example.com foobar.apps.ecs.example.com"
$ for target in $hosts; do nslookup $target; done

Server:	10.10.xx.xx
Address:	10.10.xx.xx#53

apps.ecs.example.com	canonical name = ecs-loadbalancer.example.com.
Name:	ecs-loadbalancer.example.com
Address: 10.10.0.99

Server:	10.10.xx.xx
Address:	10.10.xx.xx#53

Name:	foobar.apps.ecs.â€‹example.com
Address: 10.10.0.99


 DNS setup is verified.
 You must now install the Load Balancer.
