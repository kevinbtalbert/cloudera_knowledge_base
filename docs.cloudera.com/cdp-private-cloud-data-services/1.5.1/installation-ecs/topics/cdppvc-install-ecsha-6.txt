Promoting ECS Agents to ECS Servers
You must promote ECS Agents to ECS Servers.

After installing the Load Balancer, you must reconfigure the existing ECS Agents to
                ECS Servers. This process is called Promoting the agents to Servers. You must
                promote only one agent at a time. This procedure is explained using an example where
                you promote the ECS agent on agent1.example.com and then promote the ECS
                agent on agent2.example.com.


Prepare the agent node for promotion by running the following commands on the
                    command line of your ECS Server host. sudo
                        /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl --kubeconfig=/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml
                        get nodes
sudo /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl
                        --kubeconfig=/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml drain agent1.example.com
                        --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data. 

noteThis may take a few minutes.


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to ECS Cluster >> ECS. Stop the ECSAgent running
                    on agent1 and then delete the agent.






In Cloudera Manager, navigate to ECS Cluster >>
                        ECS. Click Add Role
                    Instances.






Add the available host agent1 as an ECS Server in the
                        Add Role Instances to ECS pop-up. Click
                        Ok.











Click Continue.






Start the new ECS Server from ECS Instances view. For example, start ECSServer
                    on agent1.






On the command line, uncordon the node by running the following command:
                        sudo /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl
                        --kubeconfig=/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml uncordon
                        agent1.example.com

Confirm the nodeâ€™s status from webUI or the command line by running the command
                        sudo /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl
                        --kubeconfig=/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml get nodes. 

noteDo not proceed until node status is Ready. This may
                        take several minutes.





 When agent1 is ready, you can promote the next agent agent2. To promote the next
            agent, you must perform steps 1-8 again, the example uses
            agent2.example.com.
