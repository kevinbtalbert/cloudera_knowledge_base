Refreshing ECS
 After all the ECS Agents are promoted to ECS Servers, you must log in to Cloudera
        Manager and refresh the ECS cluster.

Navigate to ECS Cluster >> ECS
                        view >> Actions >> Refresh
                        ECS. This sets the ingress proxy so that all three servers are
                    eligible to process incoming commands. 












Confirm that all backends of HAProxy display the status
                        UP. This may take several minutes.






Confirm that all pods are green in the ECS webUI >>
                        (All Namespaces) >>
                    Workloads.






Confirm that there are no alerts in the ECS service.


High Availability is now deployed on your ECS cluster.
