  must proceed with this section. If you do not want to enable ECS HA, you can safely ignore this
  section.
As a prerequisite, during the installation, you must have installed ECS with 1 master (with
   app_domain as Load Balancer URL) + agents. When you are adding more masters, ensure that you add
   Docker server as well.
