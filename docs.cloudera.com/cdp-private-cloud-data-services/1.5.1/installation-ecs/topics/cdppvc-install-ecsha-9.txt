Adding hosts to the containerized cluster
You must add hosts to the containerized cluster.

Log in to Cloudera Manager.
Navigate to the ECS service.
Click the Actions drop-down.
Click the Add Hosts button. The Add Hosts page
    appears.
Select the Add hosts to cluster option.
Select the cluster where you want to add the host from the drop-down list. Click
     Continue.
In the Specify Hosts page, provide a list of available hosts or you
    can add new hosts. You can provide the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) in the following
    patterns: You can specify multiple addresses and address ranges by separating them by commas,
    semicolons, tabs, or blank spaces, or by placing them on separate lines. Use this technique to
    make more specific searches instead of searching overly wide ranges.  For example, use
      host[1-3].network.com to specify these hosts: host1.network.com, host2.network.com,
      host3.network.com.Click Continue.
In the Select Repository page, you must specify the repository
    location. Choose any one of the following:
Cloudera Repository (Requires direct internet access on all
      hosts)

In the Install Parcels page, the selected parcels are downloaded and
    installed on the host cluster. Click Continue.

    tool displays any issues, you can fix those issues and run the inspect tool again. Click
     Continue.
