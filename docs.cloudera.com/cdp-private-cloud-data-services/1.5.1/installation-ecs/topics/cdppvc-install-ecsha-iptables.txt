Install iptables on the new ECS master nodes
You must install iptables on all of the additional ECS master
    nodes.
If your ECS hosts are running the CentOS 8.4, OEL 8.4, or RHEL 8 operating systems, you must
      install iptables on all the ECS hosts. Run the following command on each
      additional ECS master node:

yum --setopt=tsflags=noscripts install -y iptables
