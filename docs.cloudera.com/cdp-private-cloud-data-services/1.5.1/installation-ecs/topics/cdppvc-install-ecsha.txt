ECS Server High Availability 
If you want to enable ECS Server for High Availability after installing ECS, then you
  must proceed with this section. If you do not want to enable ECS HA, you can safely ignore this
  section. You must review the note section and unserstand the ECS Server scenarios that are
  supported before you proceed to the next section.

note

Longhorn replication defaults to two replicas. This can be set only during the installation
      time. Three or more replicas potentially have performance issues.
Kubectl delete node <host> permanently removes host from cluster
      and any data on the host is lost. You must reformat the host before reading to the cluster. 
Single node failure may cause the Control Plane or any other management service to be
      unavailable. In 1.3.4 or later, it will take several minutes to recover automatically. 



ECS Server scenarios
Clusters with only two servers are not supported. This is only for the temporary transition
    from a single server cluster to a three server cluster.


Three or more servers
Redundancy requirements:
One failure requires three or more servers 
Two failures require five or more servers 
For more information see, Fault Tolerance

To recover, you must scale-up the ECS Server roles. For more information on adding ECS
        node to a cluster, see the following section.

Two servers to one server
Only after a double failure in a three server cluster

To recover:
Stop the ECS service 
Remove both the failed ECS server roles and hosts from cluster
On the surviving server, run the following command
                      /opt/cloudera/parcels/ECS/bin/rke2 server
                    --cluster-reset
Start the ECS service


 Single server
No failure supported
