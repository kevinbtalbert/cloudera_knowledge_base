Installing Load BalancerCloudera Docs
Installing Load Balancer
To install the HAProxy Load Balancer, Cloudera uses an example that uses a single
        instance of HAProxy, configured with round robin balancing and TCP mode. This allows for
        non-terminating https (https passthrough). The HAProxy service can be configured for High
        Availability using keepalived. 

You must consult your operating system vendorâ€™s documentation for requirements and
                the install guide for configuring HAproxy with keepalived.
To install a HAProxy Load Balancer, you must ssh into the HAProxy host, install, and then configure HAProxy:


sudo su -

yum install haproxy -y

cp /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
                    /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.bak

cat > /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg << EOF

You can verify that all the hosts are shown from the HAproxy UI. However, at
                    this point the hosts are not listening to the configured ports.



importantSince you already have an ECS cluster running, you
                            must alter your DNS wildcard to point to the IP address of the HAProxy
                            server. You cannot change the Application Domain configured through the
                            ECS wizard. So you must ensure that you send all ingress traffic to the
                            HAProxy IP address by making that change in the IP address of your
                            wildcard DNS Record.
note

Application Domain (app_domain property in Cloudera Manager) maps to your wildcard DNS record (For example, app_domain ecs.example.com maps to your DNS entry *.apps.ecs.example.com)
The resolved IP address must be the host IP (or VIP) of your Load Balancer. For more information, see the Verify DNS Step 5 above.





Load Balancer is now installed.
