CDP Private Cloud Data Services Hardware
    Requirements
Minimum and recommended hardware to successfully install and run
    Private Cloud Data Services.
In addition to the resources required for the Control Plane, additional
      resources will be required depending on the Data Service(s) you intend to
      run. Minimum and recommended additional resource requirements for each of
      the Data Services can be found in the pages below. To calculate the total
      minimum or recommended resource requirements for your CDP Private Cloud
      Data Services cluster, add the resources required for the Control Plane to
      the total minimum or recommended additional resources for your chosen Data
      Service(s).
You can also use the CDP Private Cloud Data Services Spreadsheet to model
      the number and specification of hosts required for a deployment. See How to use the CDP Private Cloud Data Services sizing spreadsheet.

Requirements for HA and Non-HA Control PlaneStandard resource mode requirements for standalone HA and Non-HA Control Plane.Additional resource requirements for Cloudera Data WarehouseStandard resource mode requirements for Cloudera Data Warehouse.Additional resource requirements for Cloudera Data EngineeringFor standalone Cloudera Data Engineering, Cloudera recommends three nodes (one master   and two workers) with the following minimum memory, storage, and hardware requirements for each   node:Additional resource requirements for Cloudera Machine LearningStandard resource mode requirements for standalone Cloudera Machine Learning. Node count   should not be a limiting factor assuming the other memory and CPU minimums are   reached.How to use the CDP Private Cloud Data Services sizing spreadsheetYou can use the sizing spreadsheet to model the hardware     requirements for a CDP Private Cloud Data Services deployment. Docker repository accessYou must ensure that the cluster has access to the Docker Container     Repository in order to retrieve the container images for deployment. Parent topic: Requirements
