Installing CDP Private Cloud Data Services using ECS
Follow the steps in this topic to install CDP Private Cloud Data Services with the Embedded Container Service
        (ECS).

If your ECS hosts are running the CentOS 8.4, OEL 8.4, or RHEL 8 operating
                    systems, you must install iptables on all the ECS hosts. Run
                    the following command on each ECS host:

yum --setopt=tsflags=noscripts install -y iptables


If you are installing ECS on RHEL 8:


Add the hosts you intend to use for ECS to Cloudera Manager, without
                            specifying a cluster. See Add New Hosts To Cloudera
                                Manager.


If you are using RHEL 8, and if the
                                nm-cloud-setup.service and
                                nm-cloud-setup.timer services are enabled, disable
                            them by running the following command on each host you added:
systemctl disable nm-cloud-setup.service nm-cloud-setup.timerFor
                            more information, see Known issues and
                            limitations.


If you disabled the nm-cloud-setup.service and
                                nm-cloud-setup.timer services, reboot the added
                            hosts. 



In Cloudera Manager, click Data Services in the left
                    menu. 






The Add Private Cloud Containerized Cluster page appears. Click
                            Continue. 


noteYou can also click Add > Add Cluster at the top right in Cloudera Manager, then select
                            Private Cloud Containerized Cluster as the
                        cluster type. 


On the Getting Started page of the installation wizard,
                    select Internet or Air Gapped as
                    the Install Method. 

Internet install method (To use a custom repository
                        link provided to you by Cloudera, click Custom
                            Repository) :





If you select the Air Gapped install option, extra
                        steps are displayed. Follow these steps to download and mirror the Cloudera
                        archive URL using a local HTTP server. 


Download everything under https://archive.cloudera.com/p/cdp-pvc-ds/latest
wget -l 0 --recursive --no-parent -e robots=off -nH --cut-dirs=2 --reject="index.html*" -t 10 https://<username>:<password>@archive.cloudera.com/p/cdp-pvc-ds/latest


Edit the manifest.json file in the downloaded
                                directory. Change "http_url": "..." to
"http_url":
                                    "http://your_local_repo/cdp-pvc-ds/latest"


Mirror the downloaded directory to your local http server, e.g.
                                    http://your_local_repo/cdp-pvc-ds/latest


Click Custom Repository and add
                                    http://your_local_repo/cdp-pvc-ds/latest as a
                                custom repository. 

Click the Select Repository drop-down and select
                                http://your_local_repo/cdp-pvc-ds/latest




Click Continue.


On the Cluster Basics page, type a name for the Private
                    Cloud cluster that you want to create in the Cluster Name
                    field. From the Base Cluster drop-down list, select the
                        cluster that has the storage and SDX services that
                    you want this new Private Cloud Data Services instance to connect with. Click
                        Continue.






On the Specify Hosts page, provide a list of available
                    hosts or you can add new hosts. (If you already added the hosts to Cloudera
                    Manager, enter the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for those hosts.) You can
                    provide the FQDN in the following patterns: 
You can specify multiple addresses and address ranges by separating them by
                    commas, semicolons, tabs, or blank spaces, or by placing them on separate lines.
                    Use this technique to make more specific searches instead of searching overly
                    wide ranges.For example, use host[1-3].network.com to specify these
                            hosts: host1.network.com, host2.network.com,
                            host3.network.com.Click
                            Continue.



On the Select JDK page, select any one from the below
                    options:


Manually manage JDK


Install a Cloudera-provided version of
                            OpenJDK


Install a system-provided version of
                            OpenJDK








On the Enter Login Credentials page, select the
                        SSH Username  and provide the password.






The Install Agents page appears.






On the Assign Roles page, you can customize the roles
                    assignment for your new Private Cloud Containerized cluster.

importantCloudera does not recommend altering assignments unless
                        you have specific requirements such as having selected a specific host for a
                        specific role.



Single node ECS installation is supported, but is only intended to enable
                        CDSW to CML migration. If you are installing ECS on a single node, only the
                        Docker and ECS Server roles are assigned. The ECS Agent role is not required
                        for single node installation. 





Click Continue.

Configure a Docker
            Repository. There are several options for
          configuring a Docker Repository. For more information about these
          options, see Docker repository access. 

On the Configure Docker Repository
            page, select one of these options:
Embedded Docker RepositoryIf you select the
                Internet
Install Method option on the
                Getting Started page, images are copied
              over the internet from the Cloudera repository. If you select the Air Gapped option,
              images are copied from a local http mirror you have set up in your
              environment.Select Default  to
              deploy all of the default Docker images to the repository, or
              select Select the Optional Images to choose
              which images to deploy. If you will be deploying Cloudera Machine
              Learning (CML), toggle the Cloudera Machine
                Learning switch on to copy the images for
            CML.
Cloudera default Docker
              RepositoryThis option requires that cluster hosts
              have access to the internet and you have selected Internet
              as the install method.
Ensure that the following ports are opened and allowed. This
                  is required for completing the ECS installation.

Custom Docker Repository

This option requires that you set up a Docker Repository in your environment
              and that all cluster hosts have connectivity to the repository. 
noteIf you are installing ECS on a single node, you should
                select the Use a Custom Docker Repository option. Single node
                ECS installation is supported, but is only intended to enable CDSW to CML migration.
              
You must enter the following options:
Custom Docker Repository – Enter the URL for your Docker
                  Repository 
Docker Username – Enter the username for the Docker
                  Repository.
Docker Password – Enter the password for the Docker
                    Repository.importantDo not use the $ character
                    for this password. 
Docker Certificate – Click the Choose
                    File button to upload a TLS certificate to secure communications
                  with the Docker Repository. 
Click the Generate the copy-docker script button to
            generate and download a script that copies the Docker images from Cloudera, or (for
            air-gapped installation) from a local http mirror in your network. Run the script
              from a machine that is running Docker locally and has access to the Docker images
              using the following
              commands:docker login [***URL for Docker Repository***] -u [***username of user with write access***]

bash copy-docker.txtThe copying operation may take 4 - 5 hours.
            

On the Configure Data Services page, you can modify
                    configuration settings such as the data storage directory, number of replicas,
                    and so on. If there are multiple disks mounted on each host with different
                    characteristics (HDD and SSD), then Local Path Storage Directory must point to
                    the path belonging to the optimal storage. Ensure that you have reviewed your
                    changes. If you want to specify a custom certificate, place the certificate and
                    the private key in a specific location on the Cloudera Manager server host and
                    specify the paths in the input boxes labelled as Ingress Controller TLS/SSL
                    Server Certificate/Private Key File below. This certificate will be copied to
                    the Control Plane during the installation process.

note
The "Ingress Controller TLS/SSL Server Certificate File (PEM Format)"
                            must only contain -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- through
                                -----END CERTIFICATE----- (inclusive) for the
                            server and CA certs. It cannot include any preamble text and, and must
                            not include a private key. 
The "Ingress Controller TLS/SSL Server Private Key File (PEM Format)"
                            must only contain the unencrypted key, and only the header through the
                            footer, with no preamble text. 
Both of these files must be readable by the "cloudera-scm" account. 

Click Continue.
