Manually uninstalling ECS from a cluster
You can manually uninstall ECS from your cluster.

Before performing this procedure, ensure that you have activated the ECS parcel on
                the cluster hosts. 
During the installation time of ECS, the directory for Longhorn and the LSO are
                decided by Cloudera Manager and defaults to /ecs.







On each host in the cluster:


/opt/cloudera/parcels/ECS/docker/docker container stop registry


/opt/cloudera/parcels/ECS/docker/docker container rm -v registry


/opt/cloudera/parcels/ECS/docker/docker image rm registry:2



Stop the ECS cluster in Cloudera Manager

On each host:


cd /opt/cloudera/parcels/ECS/bin


./rke2-killall.sh # usually 2 times is sufficient


Use umount to unmount all NFS disks.


./rke2-uninstall.sh


rm -rf /ecs/* # assumes the default defaultDataPath and
                            lsoDataPath


rm -rf /var/lib/docker_server/* # deletes the auth and certs


rm -rf /etc/docker/certs.d/* # delete the ca.crt


rm -rf /docker # assumes the default defaultDataPath for docker 



Delete the ECS cluster in Cloudera Manager.


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to CDP Private Cloud Data
              Services and click . Click
              Uninstall.







The Delete Cluster wizard appears. Click
                            Delete.








Clean IPtables on each host:

echo "Reset iptables to ACCEPT all, then flush and delete all other chains";
                        declare -A chains=( [filter]=INPUT:FORWARD:OUTPUT [raw]=PREROUTING:OUTPUT [mangle]=PREROUTING:INPUT:FORWARD:OUTPUT:POSTROUTING [security]=INPUT:FORWARD:OUTPUT [nat]=PREROUTING:INPUT:OUTPUT:POSTROUTING );
                        for table in "${!chains[@]}"; do 
                        echo "${chains[$table]}" | tr : $"\n" | while IFS= read -r;
                        do sudo iptables -t "$table" -P "$REPLY" ACCEPT
                        done
                        sudo iptables -t "$table" -F
                        sudo iptables -t "$table" -X
                        done
                    


noteAlternatively, an experimental script is available. This script combines
                        steps three through five. The script is available here:
                        https://github.com/cloudera-labs/snippets/blob/main/private-cloud/kill-2-rke.sh
