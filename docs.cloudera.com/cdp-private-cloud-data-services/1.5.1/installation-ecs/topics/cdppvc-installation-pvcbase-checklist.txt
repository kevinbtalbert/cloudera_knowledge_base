CDP Private Cloud Base
                                            requirements



If you do not install these components, you see an error
                            when creating an environment in your CDP Private Cloud Data Services.


Network requirement 
If you are installing on the OpenShift Container Platform
                            (OCP), ensure that the CDP Private Cloud Base and OpenShift Container
                            Platform are on the same network.
Network infrastructure
                                    considerations

Ensure that all the network routing hops in production.
                            Cloudera recommends not to use more than 4:1 oversubscription between
                            the spine-leaf switches. 


Cloudera Manager database requirement
Refer to the the CDP Private Cloud Base database
                            requirements.

Cloudera Manager TLS configuration
Ensure that Cloudera Manager in the CDP Private Cloud Base
                            cluster is configured to use TLS.
Configuring TLS Encryption for
                                    Cloudera Manager Using Auto-TLS

You can also manually configure TLS to complete this task.
                                See 
Manually Configuring TLS
                                        Encryption for Cloudera Manager



Cloudera Manager JKS-format TLS truststore
Ensure that the Cloudera Manager is configured with a
                            JKS-format (not PKCS12) TLS truststore. 
Obtain and Deploy Keys and
                                    Certificates for TLS/SSL

Cloudera Manager truststore and root certificate 
Ensure that the Cloudera Manager truststore contains a root
                            certificate that trusts the certificate for all Cloudera Manager server
                            hosts used with CDP Private Cloud Data Services.
How to Add Root and Intermediate
                                    CAs to Truststore for TLS/SSL

Import the necessary certificates into the truststore
                            configured in Configure Administration > Settings > Security > Cloudera
                                    Manager TLS/SSL Client Trust Store File.


LDAP configuration
Ensure that you configure LDAP using Cloudera Manager. 
N/A
Only Microsoft Active Directory (AD) and OpenLDAP are
                            currently supported.


Apache Ranger configuration for LDAP
Ensure that the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster is
                            configured with Apache Ranger and LDAP for user authentication.
Configure Ranger authentication
                                    for LDAP

N/A


Apache Ranger usersync configuration
Ensure that you have configured Apache Ranger and Apache
                            Ranger usersync. 
Ranger usersync
Apache Ranger user synchronization is used to get users and
                            groups from the corporate ActiveDirectory to use in policy
                            definitions.


Kerberos configuration
Ensure that Kerberos is enabled for all services in the
                            cluster. 
Enabling Kerberos for
                                    authentication

Custom Kerberos principals are not currently supported.
                            



Internet access or air gap installation 
Ensure that your CDP Private Cloud Base and your Kubernetes
                            cluster has access to the Internet. If you do not have access to the
                            Internet, you must do an air gap installation.

Install CDP Private Cloud Data
                                        Services in air gap environment


You need access to the Docker registries and the Cloudera
                                repositories during the installation process. 



Services health check
Ensure that all services running in the cluster are healthy.

CDP Private Cloud entitlement
Ensure that you have the necessary CDP entitlement from
                            Cloudera to access the Private Cloud installation.
N/A
To check this, go to Cloudera Manager > Private Cloud > Select Repository >
                                        [***REPOSITORY URL***]. If you have the required entitlements, the You are about
                            to install the CDP Private Cloud version [***VERSION***] message with a
                            list of prerequisites is displayed. An error message is displayed if you
                            do not have the necessary entitlements.


Reuse data from CDH or HDP (Optional) 
To reuse data from your legacy CDH or HDP deployment in
                            your Private Cloud, ensure that you have migrated that data into your
                            CDP Private Cloud Base. You must be using Cloudera Runtime 7.1.7 for
                            migrating data from your CDH or HDP cluster.

(Recommended) Configure HDFS properties to optimize logging
CDP uses “out_webhdfs” Fluentd output plugin to write records into
                            HDFS, in the form of log files, which are then used by different data
                            services to generate diagnostic bundles. To optimize the size of logs
                            that are captured and stored on HDFS, you must update a few HDFS
                            configurations in the hdfs-site.xml file using Cloudera Manager.
