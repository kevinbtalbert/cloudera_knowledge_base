Certificate management and DNS
You must be aware of the reasons why an external DNS is required for CDP Private Cloud Data Services installation along with the required
        setup in the cluster.
        
An external DNS must be available to route inbound traffic to the cluster through the
            load balancer. The external DNS should contain forward and reverse zones for both the
            OpenShift and the CDP Private Base cluster nodes.
Ensure that the canonical load balancers required for OpenShift is routable
            from within the OpenShift cluster and from any other location that you want to access
            resources in the Management Console; this is a standard requirement for on-premises load
            balancers communicating Kubernetes clusters.
There must also be a set of certificates set up for use by the OpenShift Route
            ingress controller as defined in the OpenShift bare metal install guide
            that the Cloudera services
            use.
