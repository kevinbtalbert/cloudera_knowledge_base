Use this checklist to ensure that your OpenShift Container Platform
            (OCP) is configured and
        ready for installing CDP Private Cloud Data Services.

OpenShift Platform version

Check the the installed OpenShift Container Platform
                                version.

DNS configuration
Ensure that you have set up the DNS and
              Reverse DNS between OpenShift Container Platform
                (OCP) hosts and CDP Private Cloud Base. This is required
              for obtaining Kerberos ticket-granting tickets.
Certificate management and
                  DNS

A wildcard DNS entry is required for resolving the ingress
                            route for applications. The ingress route is usually behind a load
                            balancer. 


Check if you can
                access the OpenShift hostnames outside the cluster
Ensure that OpenShift
                Container Platform (OCP) application hostnames can be
              accessed from outside the cluster. 
            
A minimal
                  Ingress resource example

Perform a DNS query on the route generated, to check if you can access the hostnames outside
                the cluster.



Storage classes configuration

Ensure that you have configured separate storage classes
                                for the control plane and the compute clusters. Both the storage
                                classes must be provisioned from Persistent Volumes.

OpenShift Container Platform
                (OCP)Kubeconfig file
Ensure that you have access to the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) Kubeconfig
              file, cluster administrator privileges, and sufficient expiry time
              for you to complete your installation.
Download Kubernetes
                  Configuration

The kubeconfig should have valid certificates in it
              for the cluster. If the kubeconfig does not have certificates,
              then the you must upload custom certifications during CDP
              installation.


Allow WebSocket traffic in addition to HTTPS
When a load balancer is used for your OpenShift Container
                            Platform external API, you must allow WebSocket traffic in addition to
                            HTTPS. The load balancer must allow WebSockets on port 80. Also, ensure
                            that you set the load balancer server timeout to 5 minutes.

Clock time from NTP source
Ensure that the NTP clock in CDP
              Private Cloud Base is in sync with the time configured in the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster.
              This is an important step if your setup does not have access to
              the Internet. 
Enable an NTP Service

Install CDP Private Cloud Data
                Services in air gap environment



Route admission policy
Ensure OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster is
              configured to run applications in multiple namespaces with the
              same domain name.
