Load balancing and ingress
OpenShift Route must be the default ingress controller setup on the
        cluster.
A non-terminating external load balancer must be configured to route ingress traffic on
            HTTP/HTTPS to the OpenShift cluster.
When a load balancer is used in front of the OCP external API, it must
      allow “Websocket traffic”, in addition to https.
