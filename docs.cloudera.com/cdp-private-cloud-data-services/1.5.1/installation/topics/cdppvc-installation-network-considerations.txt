CDP Private Cloud Data Services network infrastructure
        considerations
Learn about the networking infrastructure consideration necessary to install CDP
        Private Cloud. The networking considerations for CDP Private Cloud Data Services are similar to the networking
        requirements for Cloudera Manager Virtual Private Clusters (CM VPC).
In CDP Private Cloud Data Services, the network bandwidth
            requirements are less stringent than those of the Cloudera Manager Virtual Private
            Cluster (VPC) because of data caching technology introduced at the compute layer, which
            is not available in VPCs.
While the initial load of data from the remote storage would require
            significant bandwidth between the compute and storage clusters, subject to the quantity
            of data ingested; subsequently, the network bandwidth requirements are lower.
The following list of network considerations will help you plan your network
            infrastructure before you install CDP Private Cloud Data Services:
Use 1 Gbps guaranteed bandwidth between each OpenShift worker node and each CDP
                    Private Cloud Base DataNode. Cloudera recommends 10 Gbps guaranteed
                    bandwidth.
Stress test the network infrastructure with all the OpenShift nodes trying to
                    read or write from the CDP Private Cloud Data Services nodes
                    at the same time.
Use the Spine-Leaf network architecture with no more than a 4:1 oversubscription
                    between the spine and leaf switches.

            designing a network topology, see Networking Considerations for Virtual Private
                Clusters.
