Credentials
You must have a kubeconfig file that has the cluster access
        information and authentication information for a single user, who has the “cluster-admin”
        pre-provisioned ClusterRole assigned.
Cloudera recommends that you use a kubeconfig file that does not expire, to avoid access issues
            to the installed software.
