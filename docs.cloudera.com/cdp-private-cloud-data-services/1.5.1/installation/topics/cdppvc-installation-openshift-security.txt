Security context credentials
The Cloudera software must have privileged access at runtime. Cloudera recommends
        that you configure security context in your OpenShift cluster to ensure access to CDP Private Cloud Data Services. 
You must install additional scc definitions into OpenShift that Cloudera
            provides as part of the installation software. For more information about security
            context credentials in OpenShift, see Introduction to Security Contexts and
            SCCs.
