Storage classes
You need to have persistent storage classes defined in your OpenShift cluster.
        Storage classes can be defined by OpenShift cluster administrators.
The exact amount of storage classified as block or filesystem storage depends on the
            specific workloads (Machine Learning or Data Warehouse) and how they are used.
See the Red Hat OpenShift documentation for more information about OpenShift
            storage classes and persistent volumes.
To use Portworx as a storage platform, you must first create a Portworx storage class on
            your OCP cluster and then specify it in the Storage Class field
            while installing CDP Private Cloud Data Services on the
            OCP cluster. For information on how to create the storage class, see Step 4: StorageClass Setup in the Portworx
            documentation. See Installing in internet environment for
            information on how to install CDP Private Cloud Data Services on
            OCP.
After you specify the storage class while installing CDP Private Cloud Data Services, all
            other data services can use it.
