Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform software requirements
You must understand the various OpenShift Container Platform
    (OCP) requirements before you install CDP Private Cloud Data Services. CDP Private Cloud Data Services requires at least one
    OpenShift cluster for the control plane and the environments. The Cloudera
    Data Warehouse (CDW), Cloudera Machine Learning (CML), and Cloudera Data
    Engineering (CDE) Data Services run on these environments.
Review the Software Support Matrix for OpenShift.
Read the following topics to understand the various OpenShift integration
            requirements:

Credentials
Security context credentials
Load balancing and ingress
Certificate management and DNS
Storage classes
Docker registry access


CredentialsYou must have a kubeconfig file that has the cluster access         information and authentication information for a single user, who has the “cluster-admin”         pre-provisioned ClusterRole assigned.Security context credentialsThe Cloudera software must have privileged access at runtime. Cloudera recommends         that you configure security context in your OpenShift cluster to ensure access to CDP Private Cloud Data Services. Load balancing and ingressOpenShift Route must be the default ingress controller setup on the         cluster.Certificate management and DNSYou must be aware of the reasons why an external DNS is required for CDP Private Cloud Data Services installation along with the required         setup in the cluster.         Storage classesYou need to have persistent storage classes defined in your OpenShift cluster.         Storage classes can be defined by OpenShift cluster administrators.Volume snapshot supportVolume snapshot support for the storage class must be installed in your OpenShift         cluster.
