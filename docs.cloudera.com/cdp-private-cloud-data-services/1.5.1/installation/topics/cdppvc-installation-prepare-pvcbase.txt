Preparing CDP Private Cloud Base
Use Cloudera Manager to configure your CDP Private Cloud Base
        in preparation for the CDP Private Cloud Data Services
        installation.

Configure the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster to use TLS.
For configuration steps, see Configuring TLS Encryption for Cloudera
                            Manager Using Auto-TLS.

Configure Cloudera Manager with a JKS-format (not PKCS12) TLS truststore. 
For configuration steps, see Database requirements.

Configure Cloudera Manager to include a root certificate that trusts the
                    certificate for all Cloudera Manager server hosts expected to be used with
                    Private Cloud.


Import the necessary certificates into the truststore configured in Configure Administration > Settings > Security > Cloudera Manager TLS/SSL Client Trust Store
                                    File.noteThis requires a Cloudera Manager
                            restart.



Configure Ranger and LDAP for user authentication. Ensure that you have
                    configured Ranger user synchronization. 
For configuration steps, see Configure Ranger authentication for
                            LDAP and  Ranger usersync.noteUpgrading to Oracle JDK 1.8.351 causes a Kerberos
                        issue when deprecated 3DES and RC4 permitted encryption types are used.
                            Workaround: Remove the deprecated 3DES and RC4 encryption types in
                            the krb5.conf and kdc.conf
                            files.

Enable Kerberos for all the services in the cluster.
For configuration steps, see Enabling Kerberos for
                        authentication.

Configure LDAP using Cloudera Manager. Only Microsoft Active Directory (AD) and
                    OpenLDAP are currently supported.
For configuration steps, see Configure authentication using an
                        LDAP-compliant identity service.

Check if all the running services in the cluster are healthy. To check this
                    using Cloudera Manager, go to Cloudera Manager > Clusters > [***CLUSTER NAME***] > Health Issues. If there are no health issues, the No Health Issues message is
                    displayed.

Verify if you have the necessary CDP entitlements from Cloudera to access the
                    Private Cloud installation. To check this using Cloudera Manager, go to Cloudera Manager > Private Cloud  > Select Repository > [***REPOSITORY URL***]. If you have the required entitlements, the You are
                        about to install CDP Private Cloud version
                        [*VERSION*] message with a list of
                    prerequisites is displayed. An error message is displayed if you do not have the
                    necessary entitlements.
Contact your Cloudera account team to get the necessary entitlements.

If you want to reuse data from your legacy CDH or HDP deployment in your
                    Private Cloud, ensure that you have migrated that data into your CDP Private
                    Cloud Base. You must be using Cloudera Runtime 7.1.7 for migrating your data
                    from your CDH or HDP cluster.
For more information about data migration, see the Data Migration Guide.
