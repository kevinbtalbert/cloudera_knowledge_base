Software Support Matrix for OpenShiftThis support matrix lists the supported software for the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster and the CDP Private Cloud Data Services containerized cluster when installing using     the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform hardware requirementsCloudera Data Platform (CDP) Private Cloud requires hardware for a dedicated         OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster. An OpenShift cluster consists of several master         nodes for managing OpenShift and many worker nodes for running your application on CDP. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform software requirementsYou must understand the various OpenShift Container Platform     (OCP) requirements before you install CDP Private Cloud Data Services. CDP Private Cloud Data Services requires at least one     OpenShift cluster for the control plane and the environments. The Cloudera     Data Warehouse (CDW), Cloudera Machine Learning (CML), and Cloudera Data     Engineering (CDE) Data Services run on these environments.CDP Private Cloud Base requirementsYour CDP Private Cloud Base cluster must have the operating     system, JDK, database, CDP components, and CDP Runtime version required to install CDP Private Cloud Data Services. CDP Private Cloud Data Services Hardware RequirementsYou must learn about the minimum and recommended hardware and network infrastructure         requirements before deploying CDP Private Cloud Data Services.CDP Private Cloud Data Services network infrastructure considerationsLearn about the networking infrastructure consideration necessary to install CDP         Private Cloud. The networking considerations for CDP Private Cloud Data Services are similar to the networking         requirements for Cloudera Manager Virtual Private Clusters (CM VPC).CDP Private Cloud Data Services Software RequirementsYou must learn about the software and configuration requirements before deploying CDP         Private Cloud. Administrators and operators must understand these requirements to install             CDP Private Cloud Data Services in your data center.
