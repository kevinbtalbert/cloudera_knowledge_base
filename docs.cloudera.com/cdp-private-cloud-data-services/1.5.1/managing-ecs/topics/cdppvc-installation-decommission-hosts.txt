Decommissioning ECS Hosts 
You can decommission ECS hosts and remove them from the cluster. 



Cordon the node. Longhorn will automatically disable the node
            scheduling when a Kubernetes node is cordoned. Run the following
            command on any ECS Server
            host:kubectl cordon [***node***]


Drain the node to move the workload to somewhere else. Run the
            following command on any ECS Server
            host:kubectl drain [***node***] --ignore-daemonsets --pod-selector='app!=csi-attacher,app!=csi-provisioner' --delete-emptydir-data


Detach all the volumes on the node. Navigate to the ECS Service
            page on Cloudera Manager UI.
a. In the Web UI dropdown, select Storage UI  to open
            the Longhorn UI.
b. Under the Volume tab in Longhorn UI, select the volumes
            on this node. Click Detach and select Yes on the screen
            prompt.
 If the node has been drained, all the workloads should be migrated
            to another node already.
 If there are any other volumes remaining attached, detach them
            before continuing.


Remove the node from Longhorn using the Delete in the
              Node tab. Or, remove the node from Kubernetes. Run the
            following command on any ECS Server host:
            kubectl delete node [***node-name***]
Longhorn will automatically remove the node from the cluster.


Uninstall ECS and Docker artifacts from the host. Run below
            commands on the
            host:cd /opt/cloudera/parcels/ECS/bin
./rke2-killall.sh # usually 2 times is sufficient
./rke2-uninstall.sh
rm -rf /ecs/* # assumes the default defaultDataPath and lsoDataPath
rm -rf /var/lib/docker_server/* # deletes the auth and certs
rm -rf /etc/docker/certs.d/* # delete the ca.crt
rm -rf /docker # assumes the default defaultDataPath for docker

Go to the Hosts page for the ECS Cluster, select that host,
          and under Actions for Selected, click Begin Maintenance
            (Suppress Alerts/Decommission)
