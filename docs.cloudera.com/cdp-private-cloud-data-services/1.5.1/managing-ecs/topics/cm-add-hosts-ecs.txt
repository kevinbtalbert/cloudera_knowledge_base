Adding hosts to a CDP Private Cloud Data Services Cluster 
Procedure to expand a Embedded Container Service
    cluster

You can add hosts to a Embedded Container Service
        cluster to increase capacity and performance.


Follow the steps to Add a Host.

If your ECS hosts are running the CentOS 8.4, OEL 8.4, or RHEL 8 operating systems, you
          must install iptables on all the ECS hosts. Run the following command on
          each ECS host:

yum --setopt=tsflags=noscripts install -y iptables

Add the following role instances to each new host: ECS Agent
          Docker Server 


ECS Agent


Docker Server


noteThe Regenerate missing keytab command on
            the Actions menu for these roles does not perform this action. There
            is no need to regenerate missing keytabs. 

Restart the Embedded Container Service
          cluster.
