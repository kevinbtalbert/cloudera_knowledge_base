The Embedded Container Service (ECS)Cloudera Docs
The Embedded Container Service
    (ECS) 
 Cloudera Manager provides tools for managing and monitoring the CDP
    Private Cloud Embedded Container Service.
The Embedded Container Service (ECS)
      service enables you to run CDP Private Cloud Data Services by creating container-based clusters in your data center. In addition
      to the option to use OpenShift, which requires that you deploy and manage
      the Kubernetes infrastructure, you can also deploy a Embedded Container Service
      cluster, which creates and manages an embedded Kubernetes infrastructure
      for use with CDP Private Cloud Data Services. Installing, configuring, and managing OpenShift is not required. You
      only need to provide hosts on which to install the service and Cloudera
      Manager sets up the Embedded Container Service cluster
      and also provides management and monitoring of the cluster.
When you create an Embedded Container Service
      cluster, two new services are added to the cluster:


Embedded Container Service
          (ECS) service. The ECS service has two roles: 


ECS Server -- runs on a single host in the Embedded Container Service
              cluster.


ECS Agent -- runs on all hosts except the host running
              the Server role in the Embedded Container Service
              Cluster. 




Docker service. The Docker service has a single role: 


Docker Server -- runs on all hosts in the Embedded Container Service
              Cluster. 





Configuring the Embedded Container ServiceYou use Cloudera Manager to configure the Embedded Container Service and     clusters.Adding hosts to a CDP Private Cloud Data Services ClusterProcedure to expand a Embedded Container Service     clusterStarting, stopping, restarting, and refreshing Embedded Container Service ClustersProcedures to start, stop, restart, and refresh Private Cloud     Experience clustersMonitoring Embedded Container Service ClustersProcedures to monitor Embedded Container Service     clustersPerforming maintenance on an Embedded Container Service clusterYou can perform maintenance on the nodes in your ECS cluster by     shutting down the nodes one at a time while keeping your Data Services     running with slightly diminished capacity. Configuring a Containerized cluster with SELinuxYou can configure a Containerized Cluster running the Embedded     Compute Service (ECS).Decommissioning ECS HostsYou can decommission ECS hosts and remove them from the cluster.
