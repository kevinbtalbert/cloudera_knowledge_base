Configuring a Containerized cluster with SELinux
You can configure a Containerized Cluster running the Embedded
    Compute Service (ECS).
Ensure that the hosts you use for the Containerized cluster
          meet all hardware and software requirements for use
          with CDP Private Cloud Data Services.Enable SELinux in Permissive mode by updating the
            /etc/selinux/config file on all ECS hosts by
          running the following commands: 
sed -i 's/SELINUX=disabled/SELINUX=permissive/' /etc/selinux/config
reboot
Add the SELinux policies provided by RKE2 by installing the
          RPMs on all ECS hosts. Use the following commands:
yum localinstall -y http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/extras/x86_64/Packages/container-selinux-2.107-3.el7.noarch.rpm
wget https://github.com/rancher/rke2-selinux/releases/download/v0.8.stable.2/rke2-selinux-0.8-2.el7.noarch.rpm
yum install -y rke2-selinux-0.8-2.el7.noarch.rpm
Uninstall the nscd service by running the
          following command on all ECS hosts : 
yum erase -y nscd
Install a Containerized Cluster on all hosts. See Adding a Containerized
          Cluster. Enable SELinux in Enforced mode by running the following
          commands on all ECS hosts:
setenforce 1
You can confirm that SELinux is running in Enforced mode by running
            the following command:getenforce
Verify that the ECS Cluster hosts are sending heartbeats to the
          Cloudera Manager server.
Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
Click
                  Hosts > All
                  Hosts.
Check the Last Heartbeat column
              for heartbeat status. 
Verify that your workloads are functioning as expected.
