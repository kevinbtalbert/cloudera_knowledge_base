Deployment and high-level architecture
A CDP Private Cloud Data Services
  deployment includes an Environment, a Data Lake, the Management Console, and Data Services (Data
  Warehouse, Machine Learning, Data Engineering). Other tools and utilities include Replication
  Manager, Data Recovery Service, CDP CLI, and monitoring using Grafana.
To deploy CDP Private Cloud Data Services you
   need a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, along with container-based clusters
   that run the Data Services. You can either use a dedicated RedHat OpenShift container cluster or
   deploy an Embedded Container Service (ECS) container
   cluster.
The Private Cloud deployment process involves configuring Management Console, registering an
   environment by providing details of the Data Lake configured on the Base cluster, and then
   creating the workloads.
Platform Managers and Administrators can rapidly provision and deploy the data services through
   the Management Console, and easily scale them up or down as required.



You can install CDP Private Cloud Base on virtual machines or bare-metal hardware. CDP Private
   Cloud Base provides the following components and services that are used by CDP Private Cloud Data
    Services:
SDX Data Lake cluster for security, metadata, and governance
HDFS and Ozone for storage
Powerful and open-source Cloudera Runtime services such as Ranger, Atlas, Hive
     Metastore (HMS), and so on
Networking infrastructure that supports network traffic between storage and
     compute environments
