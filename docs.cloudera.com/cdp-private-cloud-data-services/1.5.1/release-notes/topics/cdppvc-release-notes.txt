note
As of CDP Private Cloud Data Services
          1.5.1, external Control Plane metadata databases are no longer supported. New installs
          require the use of an embedded Control Plane database. Upgrades from CDP Private Cloud Data Services 1.4.1 or
          1.5.0 to 1.5.1 are supported, but there is currently no migration path from a previous
          external Control Plane database to the embedded database. Upgrades from 1.4.0 or 1.5.0
          with external Control Plane metadata databases also require additional steps, which are
          described in the CDP Private Cloud Data Services 1.5.1
          upgrade topics.
