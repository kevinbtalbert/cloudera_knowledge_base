Pre-upgrade - Upgrading CDE Service with Endpoint StabilityYou can seamlessly upgrade an old Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service to a new         version with endpoint stability. This enables you to access the CDE service of the new         version with the previous endpoint. Thus, you can use the existing endpoints without         changing configurations at the application level.Pre-upgrade - Regenerate external DB cert as SAN (if applicable)If you are upgrading from CDP Private Cloud Data Services 1.4.1         or 1.5.0 to 1.5.1, and you were previously using an external Control Plane metadata         database, you must regenerate the DB certificate with SAN before upgrading to CDP Private         Cloud Data Services 1.5.1.Upgrading Cloudera ManagerYou must use Cloudera Manager version 7.10.1 to set up the CDP Private Cloud Data Services cluster.
