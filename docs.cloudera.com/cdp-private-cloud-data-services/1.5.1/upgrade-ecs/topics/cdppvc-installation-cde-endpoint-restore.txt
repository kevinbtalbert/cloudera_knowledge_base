Restoring a CDE serviceCloudera Docs
Restoring a CDE service 
You can restore the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service with its jobs, resources,
        job run history, and job logs from a backed-up ZIP file.
You must back up the CDE service, you must expand the resource pool, and then
            upgrade your Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) to restore the CDE service. You must validate
            that the Ozone Gateway is working as expected by performing the steps listed in the
                Post upgrade - Ozone Gateway validation topic. importantIt is recommended to copy the logs of the commands run from the terminal and save
                them on your machine. This will be helpful in debugging or when raising a support
                ticket. You can also increase the terminal buffer size and save the terminal logs of
                each command for reference.

 If you have exited from the previous terminal where the
                        pre-upgrade commands were run for CDE Service being
                    upgraded, then you have to export these variables before running any docker
                    command. 

export BASE_WORK_DIR=<host_machine_path>
export BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR=/home/dex/backup


 Run the dex-upgrade-utils docker image to restore the
                    service on the same machine where you have completed the prerequisite steps. 

$ docker run \
-v <kubeconfig_file_path>:/home/dex/.kube/config:ro \
-v <cdp_credential_file_path>:/home/dex/.cdp/credentials:ro \
-v <cde-upgrade-util.properties_file_path>:/opt/cde-backup-restore/scripts/backup-restore/cde-upgrade-util.properties:ro \
-v <local_backup_directory>:$BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR \
-e KUBECONFIG=/home/dex/.kube/config \
<docker_image_name>:<docker_image_version> restore-service -s <cde-cluster-id> -f $BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR/<backup-zip-file-name>
 Here -s is the CDE service ID and -f is
                        the backup output filepath in the container.
Example:
$ docker run \
-v $BASE_WORK_DIR/secrets/kubeconfig:/home/dex/.kube/config:ro \
-v $BASE_WORK_DIR/secrets/credentials:/home/dex/.cdp/credentials:ro \
-v $BASE_WORK_DIR/cde-upgrade-util.properties:/opt/cde-backup-restore/scripts/backup-restore/cde-upgrade-util.properties:ro \
-v $BASE_WORK_DIR/backup:$BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR \
-e KUBECONFIG=/home/dex/.kube/config \
docker-private.infra.cloudera.com/cloudera/dex/dex-upgrade-utils:1.19.1 restore-service -s cluster-c2dhkp22 -f $BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR/cluster-c2dhkp22-2023-03-10T06_00_05.zip


[Optional] If you are using a CDP database that is external and is not
                    accessible from the container which is running the CDE upgrade command, then the
                    following SQL statements are displayed in the logs.

Example:
2023-05-17 13:02:29,551 [INFO] CDP control plane database is external and not accessible
2023-05-17 13:02:29,551 [INFO] Please rename the old & new cde service name manually by executing below SQL statement
2023-05-17 13:02:29,551 [INFO]     update cluster set name = 'cde-base-service-1' where id = 'cluster-92c2fkgb';
    2023-05-17 13:02:29,551 [INFO]     update cluster set name = 'cde-base-service-1-18-1' where id = 'cluster-rtc234g8';
2023-05-17 13:02:29,551 [INFO] Please update the lastupdated time of old cde service in db to extend the expiry interval of db entry for supporting CDE CLI after old CDE service cleanup
2023-05-17 13:02:29,551 [INFO]     update cluster set lastupdated = '2023-05-05 06:16:37.786199' where id = 'cluster-rtc234g8';
                -----------------------------------------------------------------
You must execute the above SQL statements to complete the restore
                        process.
If you have closed the terminal or do not have this information, run the
                        following SQL statements and specify the cluster details. Use the cluster ID
                        that you noted when performing the steps listed in the Prerequisites
                            for upgrading CDE Service with endpoint stability section.

Rename old CDE service to a different name.
update cluster set name = '<modified_service_name>' where id = '<old_cde_cluster_id>';
Example:update cluster set name = 'cde-base-service-1' where id = 'cluster-92c2fkgb'
Rename the new CDE service to the old CDE service name.
                            update cluster set name = '<old_cde_service_name>' where id = '<new_cde_cluster_id>';
                            Example:
                            update cluster set name = 'cde-base-service-1-18-1' where id = 'cluster-rtc234g8'

Run the following command so that when the old CDE service is
                            deleted/disabled then it is not cleared from the database for the next
                            two years. The timestamp format must be the same and should be two years
                            of the current time.
                            update cluster set lastupdated = 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss[.nnn]' where id = '<old_cde_cluster_id>';
                            Example:
                            update cluster set lastupdated = '2023-05-05 06:16:37.786199' where id = 'cluster-rtc234g8'




[Optional] When the cluster is restored, self-signed certificates are
                    automatically added to the new virtual clusters. To use a signed certificate and
                    private key, perform the following:


Identify the virtual cluster endpoint: 
In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP)
                                    console, click the Data Engineering tile.
                                    The CDE Home page displays. 
Click Administration in the left
                                    navigation menu. The Administration page
                                    displays. 
In the Services column on the left, click
                                         corresponding to the CDE service whose endpoint you want to
                                    migrate. 
Click the JOBS API URL link to copy the
                                    URL to your clipboard. 
Paste the URL into a text editor to identify the endpoint host.
                                    For example, the URL is similar to the following:
                                    http://dfdj6kgx.cde-2cdxw5x5.ecs-demo.example.com/dex/api/v1
                                    The endpoint host is
                                        dfdj6kgx.cde-2cdxw5x5.ecs-demo.example.com.

Provide a signed certificate and private key. Make sure that the
                            certificate is a wildcard certificate for the cluster endpoint. For
                            example,
                            *.dfdj6kgx.cde-2cdxw5x5.ecs-demo.example.com../cdp-cde-utils.sh init-virtual-cluster -h <endpoint_host> -c /path/to/cert -k /path/to/keyfile For
                            example, using the previous example URL, the endpoint host is
                                dfdj6kgx.cde-2cdxw5x5.ecs-demo.example.com:
                            ./cdp-cde-utils.sh init-virtual-cluster -h dfdj6kgx.cde-2cdxw5x5.ecs-demo.example.com -c /tmp/cde-pvc.crt -k /tmp/cde-pvc.key
                            You must perform this procedure for each virtual cluster you use. 



After the restore operation completes, validate that the jobs and resources are
                    restored by running the cde job list and cde
                        resource list CLI commands or check the virtual cluster job UI. 
In the Administration page of the CDE UI, you can see
                    the old CDE service is appended with a version number. For example, if the old
                    CDE service name was cde-sales, after the restore, the old
                    CDE service name is something similar to
                    cde-sales-1-18.2.

[Optional] You can now delete the old CDE service after validating that
                    everything is working as expected. If you delete the old CDE service, then you
                    can shrink the resource pool size back to its initial value which you expanded
                    in the Prerequisite steps.
