Rolling back the CDE Service Endpoint migration 
You can use the rollback command to delete the new CDE service and restore the old
        CDE service in working condition.
importantIt is recommended to copy and save the logs of the commands run from the terminal and save them on your machine. This will be helpful in debugging or when raising a support ticket. You can also increase the terminal buffer size and save the terminal logs of each command for reference.
To rollback, the state of the CDE service must be in the Failed or
                    Installed state before you restore it.

 Run the rollback-restore-service command../cdp-cde-utils.sh rollback-restore-service -s <new-new-service-id> -f <path-to-the-backup-file>
Example:./cdp-cde-utils.sh rollback-restore-service -s cluster-j8nnkkh4 -f /home/dex/backup/cluster-sijoekds-2023-05-23T07_57_57.zip
