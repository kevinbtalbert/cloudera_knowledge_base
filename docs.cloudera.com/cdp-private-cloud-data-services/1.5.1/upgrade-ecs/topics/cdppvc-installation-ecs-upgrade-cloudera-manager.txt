Upgrading Cloudera Manager
You must use Cloudera Manager version 7.10.1 to set up the CDP Private Cloud Data Services cluster. 
If you already have a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster set up using an
      earlier version of Cloudera Manager, you must first upgrade the Cloudera Manager version to
      Cloudera Manager 7.10.1 release before proceeding with the CDP Private Cloud Data Services update.
