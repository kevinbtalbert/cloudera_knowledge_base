Pre-upgrade - Upgrading CDE Service with Endpoint Stability 
You can seamlessly upgrade an old Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service to a new
        version with endpoint stability. This enables you to access the CDE service of the new
        version with the previous endpoint. Thus, you can use the existing endpoints without
        changing configurations at the application level.The CDE service endpoint migration process lets you migrate your resources, jobs, job run
            history, spark jobsâ€™ logs and event logs from your old cluster to the new cluster.
Prerequisites for upgrading CDE Service with endpoint stabilityYou must first download the docker image and create the             cde-upgrade-util.properties file to back up the Cloudera Data         Engineering (CDE) service.Backing up CDE service using the docker imageYou must run the docker image to take backup of a Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE)         service. It takes backup of all the active virtual clusters in that CDE service. You can         take backup of only an active CDE service. Parent topic: Upgrading
