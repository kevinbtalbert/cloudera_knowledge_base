Backing up CDE service using the docker imageCloudera Docs
Backing up CDE service using the docker image 
You must run the docker image to take backup of a Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE)
        service. It takes backup of all the active virtual clusters in that CDE service. You can
        take backup of only an active CDE service. You must download the dex-upgrade-utils docker image and create the
                cde-upgrade-util.properties file before backing up jobs as
            described in the Prerequisites for upgrading CDE Service with endpoint
                stability section. warningYou must make sure to allocate
                sufficient downtime before you proceed further. If you start the backup procedure,
                you cannot create, edit, or run jobs in the existing CDE service and its associated
                virtual clusters until the backup is complete. The virtual clusters will be in the
                    read-only mode after you backup the service and until you
                restore it.importantIt is recommended to copy the logs of the
                commands run from the terminal and save them on your machine. This will be helpful
                in debugging or when raising a support ticket. You can also increase the terminal
                buffer size and save the terminal logs of each command for
            reference.

Run the dex-upgrade-utils docker image on the host machine:
              $ export BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR=/home/dex/backup 

$ docker run \
-v <kubeconfig_file_path>:/home/dex/.kube/config:ro \
-v <cdp_credential_file_path>:/home/dex/.cdp/credentials:ro \
-v <cde-upgrade-util.properties_file_path>:/opt/cde-backup-restore/scripts/backup-restore/cde-upgrade-util.properties:ro \
-v <local_backup_directory>:$BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR \
-e KUBECONFIG=/home/dex/.kube/config \
<docker_image_name>:<docker_image_version> prepare-for-upgrade -s <cde-cluster-id> -o $BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR

importantAll the paths to the right side of
                            colon (:) in volume mounts, that is, paths inside the container are
                            fixed paths and must not be changed. Here -s is the CDE
                            service ID and -o is the backup output directory path
                            in the container. The backup output directory value must always be
                                $BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR and should not be
                            changed.

Example: $ docker run \

-v $BASE_WORK_DIR/secrets/kubeconfig:/home/dex/.kube/config:ro \
-v $BASE_WORK_DIR/secrets/credentials:/home/dex/.cdp/credentials:ro \
-v $BASE_WORK_DIR/cde-upgrade-util.properties:/opt/cde-backup-restore/scripts/backup-restore/cde-upgrade-util.properties:ro \
-v $BASE_WORK_DIR/backup:$BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR \
-e KUBECONFIG=/home/dex/.kube/config \
docker-private.infra.cloudera.com/cloudera/dex/dex-upgrade-utils:1.19.1 prepare-for-upgrade -s cluster-c2dhkp22 -o $BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR


You have now taken the CDE service backup as a ZIP file. You can make a note of the
            Zip file name from the logs to use it while restoring the CDE service. You must now expand the resource pool, and then upgrade your Cloudera Data Platform (CDP)
            before you restore the CDE service. For information about configuring resource pool and
            capacity, see Managing cluster resources using Quota Management.
