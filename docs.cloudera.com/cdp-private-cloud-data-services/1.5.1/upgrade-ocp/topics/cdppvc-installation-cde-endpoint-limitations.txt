Limitations 
This page lists the current limitations that you might run into while migrating your
        CDE service endpoint.

Airflow job logs of the old cluster will be lost after the
                    Restore operation.
The Spark UI tab for a completed job does not work on the first click. As a workaround, do the following:
               Click the Spark UI tab. Nothing is displayed.
Click on some other tab. For example, the Logs
                        tab.
Click the Spark UI tab again. The Spark UI
                        loads now.
