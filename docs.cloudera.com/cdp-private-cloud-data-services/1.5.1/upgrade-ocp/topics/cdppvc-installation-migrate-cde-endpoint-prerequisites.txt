Prerequisites for upgrading CDE Service with endpoint stability
You must first download the docker image and create the
            cde-upgrade-util.properties file to back up the Cloudera Data
        Engineering (CDE) service.
Download the dex-upgrade-utils docker image tarball. The file
                    naming convention is
                        dex-upgrade-utils-<version-number>-<build-number>.tar.gz.

Load the downloaded image into the host machine docker runtime:

docker load < dex-upgrade-utils-<version-number>-<build-number>.tar.gz
Example:
docker load < dex-upgrade-utils-1.19.1-b184.tar.gz


 Create a directory in the host machine and export that path as
                        BASE_WORK_DIR.

mkdir <host_machine_path>
export BASE_WORK_DIR=<host_machine_path>
Example: 
mkdir /opt/backup-restore
export BASE_WORK_DIR=/opt/backup-restore


Create backup and secrets directories
                    in the BASE_WORK_DIR directory. The
                        secrets directory stores the
                        kubeconfig and CDP DE Admin credentials
                    files. The backup directory will store the
                    backup file which will be generated when you backup the CDE Service. 

cd $BASE_WORK_DIR
mkdir backup secrets


Place the CDP credentials file of the
                        DEAdmin user and administrator
                    kubeconfig file in the $BASE_WORK_DIR/secrets directory.
                

Create the cde-upgrade-util.properties file with the
                    information described below and save it in the
                        $BASE_WORK_DIR directory. 

cdp_k8s_namespace:<CDP control plane k8s namespace>
cdp_endpoint:<CDP control plane endpoint>
credential_file_path:<Path to the DEAdmin user CDP credentials file>
de_admin_user:<DEAdmin user-id>
de_admin_password:<DEAdmin user's password must be in base64 encoded format. Use the echo -n <password> | base64  command to encode the password. >
tls_insecure:<Keep it false if you are using a self-signed certificate>
auto_unpause_jobs: <Specify it as “true” if you want to automatically resume the jobs that were paused during the backup phase. The jobs will be resumed after you restore the CDE service.>
platform_type:<Platform type, can be ECS (Embedded Container Service) or OCP (OpenShift Container Platform)>
Example:
$ cat $BASE_WORK_DIR/cde-upgrade-util.properties

cdp_k8s_namespace=cdp-test
cdp_endpoint=https://console-cdp-test.apps.cluster.example.com
credential_file_path=/home/dex/.cdp/credentials
de_admin_user=user
de_admin_password=cGFzc3dvcmQ=
tls_insecure=true
auto_unpause_jobs=true
platform_type=ECS
noteYou must always set the value of the
                            credential_file_path property as
                            /home/dex/.cdp/credentials and should not be
                        changed. 
warningYou can specify the
                            cdp_env_override:<environment-name> optional
                        property in the cde-upgrade-util.properties file, if
                        you want to change the environment of the CDE service that is being
                        restored. But, if you change the environment during restore, it will lead to
                            loss of old spark jobs’ logs and event logs that were
                        there in the old virtual clusters. 


Make a note of the details of the CDE service that is being migrated. This
                    information is required if you are using a CDP database that is external and is
                    not accessible from the container which is running the
                        cde-upgrade endpoint stability commands. Identify the
                    cluster endpoint:


In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console,
                            click the Data Engineering tile. The CDE
                                Home page displays. 
Click Administration in the left navigation menu.
                            The Administration page displays. 
In the Services column on the left, click  icon corresponding to the CDE service whose
                            endpoint you want to migrate. 
Make a note of the CDE cluster ID. 



During the restore operation, both old and the new CDE services use the same
                    resources allocated to existing CDE service. Hence, you must double the resource
                    pool size using the Quota Management option. For example, if
                        root.default.sales is the pool that is used for the old
                    or existing CDE service, you must double the CPU and memory resources of this
                    pool. Also, make sure that you have sufficient hardware when doubling the
                    resource pool size.
You must now expand the resource pool, and then upgrade your CDP platform before you
            restore the CDE service. For information about configuring resource pool and capacity,
            see Managing cluster resources using Quota Management
