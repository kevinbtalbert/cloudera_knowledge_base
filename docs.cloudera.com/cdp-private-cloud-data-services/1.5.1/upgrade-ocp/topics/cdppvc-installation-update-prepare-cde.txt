Pre-upgrade - Preparing for CDP Private Cloud Data Services update for CDE
Upgrading the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) version while CDE service is
        enabled, can cause database corruption in the embedded MySQL database used for CDE. Follow
        the below steps before starting the OCP version upgrade.

Stop running jobs and pause scheduled workloads


Kill all the running Spark jobs in the CDE virtual clusters under all
                            CDE services or wait for them to complete.


Pause all Airflow jobs and scheduled Spark jobs.



Identifying the CDE Namespace


Navigate to the Cloudera Data Engineering Overview page by clicking the
                            Data Engineering  tile in the  Cloudera Data Platform (CDP)  management
                            console. 


In the  CDE Services  column, click  Service Details  for the CDE
                            service.


Note the Cluster ID shown in the page. For example, if the Cluster ID
                            is cluster-abcd1234, then the CDE Namespace is dex-base-abcd1234.


Use this CDE Namespace (in the above example, it is dex-base-abcd1234)
                            in the following instructions to run kubernetes commands.



Scale down CDE embedded database

Access the OpenShift cluster with OpenShift CLI or Kubernetes CLI, and scale
                        down the CDE embedded database statefulset to 0 with the following
                        command:
OpenShift
                        CLIoc scale statefulset/cdp-cde-embedded-db --namespace <CDE Namespace> --replicas 0
Kubernetes CLI

kubectl scale statefulset/cdp-cde-embedded-db --namespace <CDE Namespace> --replicas 0
