Pre-upgrade - Regenerate external DB cert as SAN (if applicable)
If you are upgrading from CDP Private Cloud Data Services 1.4.1
        or 1.5.0 to 1.5.1, and you were previously using an external Control Plane metadata
        database, you must regenerate the DB certificate with SAN before upgrading to CDP Private
        Cloud Data Services 1.5.1.

Generate certificates with SAN for the external Control Plane metadata
                    database, for example server.crt and
                        server.key.

Take a backup of the previous certificates and copy them to
                        postgres.

The certificates will be available in the
                            /var/lib/pgsql/12/data directory on the Private Cloud
                        Base cluster host. 


Use the following command format to change the owner to
                        postgres:

chown postgres:postgres <file_name>
For example: 

chown postgres:postgres server.crt
chown postgres:postgres server.key



Restart postgres:

systemctl restart postgresql-12


Update the certificates in all Cloudera Manager agents and restart the
                    agents:

Get the truststore password from the
                            /etc/hadoop/conf.cloudera.HDFS-1/ssl-client.xml file.
                    



To view the certificates in the truststore: 

keytool -list -rfc -keystore /var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks -storetype JKS -storepass <truststore_password>



Delete the existing postgres certificate:


keytool -delete -alias postgresql -rfc -keystore /var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks -storetype JKS -storepass <truststore_password>




Import the new certificate into the truststore:


keytool -import -file <cert_location> -alias postgresql -rfc -keystore /var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks -storetype JKS -storepass <truststore_password>




Restart the agent:


systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent





In the Private Cloud Management Console UI, update the certificate via:
                        Administration > CA Certificates > Certificate type = External
                        Database.

Perform the following additional steps for CDW and CML:


CDW:

When any certificate is updated using the Management console, you
                                must perform a refresh DBC operation.
On the CDW Overview page, select Default DBC Options >
                                    Refresh. 



CML:

Once the certificate is updated, the MLX service should be restarted
                                at the K8s level. Restart the following pods in the
                                    <CDP> namespace:

dp-mlx-control-plane-app-XXX
dp-cadence-worker-XXX
dp-health-poller-XXX
