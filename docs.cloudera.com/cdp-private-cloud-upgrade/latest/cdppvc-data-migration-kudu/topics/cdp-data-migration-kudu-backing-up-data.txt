Backing up data in Kudu
You can back up all your data in Kudu using the kudu-backup-tools.jar Kudu
  backup tool.
The Kudu backup tool runs a Spark job that builds the backup data file and writes it to HDFS or
   AWS S3, based on what you specify. Note that if you are backing up to S3, you have to provide S3
   credentials to spark-submit as described in Specifying Credentials to Access S3 from Spark
The Kudu backup tool creates a full backup of your data on the first run. Subsequently, the
   tool creates incremental backups.
importantIncremental backup and restore functionality is available only CDH 6.3.0
   and later. Therefore, if you have active ingest processes, such as Spark jobs, Impala SQL
   batches, or Nifi inserting or updating data in Kudu, you might need to pause these processes
   before starting full backup to avoid losing data changes happening after starting the Kudu backup
   process. 
Run the following command to start the backup
   process:spark-submit --class org.apache.kudu.backup.KuduBackup <path to kudu-backup2_2.11-1.12.0.jar> \
--kuduMasterAddresses <addresses of Kudu masters> \
--rootPath <path to store the backed up data> \
<table_name>
where
--kuduMasterAddresses is used to specify the addresses of the Kudu masters
     as a comma-separated list. For example,
      master1-host,master-2-host,master-3-host which are the actual hostnames of
     Kudu masters.
--rootPath is used to specify the path to store the backed up data. It
     accepts any Spark-compatible path.
Example for HDFS: hdfs:///kudu-backups
Example for AWS S3: s3a://kudu-backup/
If you are backing up to S3 and see the “Exception in thread "main"
       java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: path must be absolute” error, ensure that
      S3 path ends with a forward slash (/).
<table_name> can be a table or a list of tables to be backed up.

Example:
spark-submit --class org.apache.kudu.backup.KuduBackup /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-7.2.1-1.cdh7.2.1.p0.4041380/lib/kudu/kudu-backup2_2.11.jar \
--kuduMasterAddresses cluster-1.cluster_name.root.hwx.site,cluster-2.cluster_name.root.hwx.site \
--rootPath hdfs:///kudu-backups \
my_table
