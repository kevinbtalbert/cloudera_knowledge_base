Copying the backed up data to the CDP cluster
You can copy your backed up data to the target CDP cluster in two ways: using distcp
        or using the Replication Manager. 
Using distcp to copy the backed up data
Use the following command to copy your backed up Kudu data to the target CDP
                cluster:sudo -u hdfs hadoop distcp hdfs:///kudu/kudu-backups/* hdfs://cluster-2.cluster_name.root.hwx.site/kudu/kudu-backups/

Using Replication Manager to copy the backed up data
HDFS replication enables you to copy (replicate) your HDFS data from one HDFS service
                to another, synchronizing the data set on the destination service with the data set
                on the source service, based on a specified replication policy.
For more information, see HDFS replicaton policy.
