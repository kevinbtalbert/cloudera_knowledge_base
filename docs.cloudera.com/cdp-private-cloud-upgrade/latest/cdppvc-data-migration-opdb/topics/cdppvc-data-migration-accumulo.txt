Migrating Accumulo to CDP
As Operational Database powered by Apache Accumulo (OpDB) is handled as a different
  service from Accumulo, in-place upgrade is not supported. However, an in-place data upgrade is
  supported from CDH 6 to CDP, or you can migrate your data and configuration to OpDB.
Cloudera does not support in-place upgrade because OpDB is handled as a different service from
   Accumulo, so the configuration changes would be lost on upgrade. You can use the migration steps
   to migrate from Accumulo 1.x to OpDB, or if you are migrating from CDH 6 to CDP, you can follow
   the in-place data upgrade process.
