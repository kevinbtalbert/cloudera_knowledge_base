Migrating HBase from CDH or HDP
Before you migrate your data, you must have an Apache HBase cluster created on CDP Private Cloud Base. Your CDH or HDP cluster is your source
        cluster, and your CDP Private Cloud Base cluster is your destination
        cluster.

Deploy HBase replication on both the source and the destination cluster. 
For instructions, see Deploy HBase
                    replication.

Enable replication on both the source and destination clusters by running the
                    following commands in the HBase Shell.

On the source
                        clustercreate 't1',{NAME=>'f1', REPLICATION_SCOPE=>1}
On the destination cluster
create 't1',{NAME=>'f1', KEEP_DELETED_CELLS=>'true'}
noteCloudera recommends enabling KEEP_DELETED_CELLS on column
                        families in the destination cluster, where
                            REPLICATION_SCOPE=1 in the source cluster.


Run the add_peer <ID>, <DESTINATION_CLUSTER_KEY> command
                    in the HBase Shell on the source cluster to add the destination cluster as a
                    peer.

You can get the DESTINATION_CLUSTER_KEY value from the HBase
                        Master user interface that you can access using Cloudera Manager.


Run the disable_peer <ID1> command in the HBase Shell on
                    the source cluster to disable the peer in the source cluster
This stop the replication with the peer, but the logs are retained for
                    future reference.

Take a snapshot in Cloudera Manager.


Select the HBase
                            service.


Click the Table Browser
                            tab.


Click a
                            table.


Click Take
                            Snapshot.


Specify the name of the snapshot, and click Take
                                Snapshot.



Run the ExportSnapshot command in the HBase Shell on the
                    source cluster to export a snapshot from the source to the destination cluster.
                    You must run the ExportSnapshot command as the
                        hbase user or the user that owns the files.

The ExportSnapshot tool executes a MapReduce Job similar to
                            distcp to copy files to the other cluster.
                            ExportSnapshot works at the file-system level, so the
                        HBase cluster can be offline.
hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.snapshot.ExportSnapshot -snapshot <snapshot name> -copy-to hdfs://destination:hdfs_port/hbase -mappers 16
Here, destination (hdfs://destination:hdfs_port/hbase)
                        is the destination CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.
                        Replace the HDFS server path and port with the ones you have used for your
                            cluster.importantSnapshots must be enabled on the source
                            and destination clusters. When you export a snapshot, the table's
                            HFiles, logs, and the snapshot metadata are copied from the source
                            cluster to the destination cluster.


Run the following commands in the HBase Shell on the destination cluster to
                    restore the table. If the table already exists on the destination cluster, use
                        restore_snapshot to restore it to the state recorded in the
                    snapshot.


disable <tablename>
restore_snapshot <snapshotname>

If the snapshot still does not exist, use the clone_snapshot
                        command to recreate it.

clone_snapshot <snapshotname> <tablename>



Run the enable_peer <ID1> command in the HBase Shell on the
                    source cluster to enable the peer in the source and destination clusters.

Run the HashTable command on the source cluster and the
                        SyncTable command on the destination cluster to synchronize
                    the table data between your source and destination clusters.

On the source
                        clusterHashTable [options] <tablename> <outputpath>
On the destination cluster
SyncTable [options] <sourcehashdir> <sourcetable> <targettable>
For more information and examples about using HashTable and
                            SyncTable, see Use HashTable and SyncTable
                            tool.
