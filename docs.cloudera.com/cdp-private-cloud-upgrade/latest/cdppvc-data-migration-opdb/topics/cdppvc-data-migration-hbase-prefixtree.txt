Removing PREFIX_TREE Data Block Encoding
Before migrating to CDP Private Cloud Base, ensure that you
        have transitioned all the data to a supported encoding type.

important
Ensure that you complete all the pre-migration steps if you have Apache HBase
                        installed in your existing CDH cluster.
The PREFIX_TREE data block encoding code is removed in CDP Private Cloud Base, meaning that HBase clusters with
                PREFIX_TREE enabled will fail. Therefore, before migrating to CDP Private Cloud Base you must ensure that all data has been
                transitioned to a supported encoding type.
The following pre-upgrade command is used for validation: hbase pre-upgrade
                validate-dbe
If your cluster is Kerberized, ensure that you run the kinit command
                as a hbase user before running the pre-upgrade commands. Ensure you have valid
                Kerberos credentials. You can list the Kerberos credentials using the
                klist command, and you can obtain credentials using the
                kinit command.



Download and distribute parcels for the target version of CDP.importantDo not activate the parcel yet.If the downloaded
                        parcel version is higher than the current Cloudera Manager version, the
                        following error message displayed: Error for parcel
                            CDH-7.x.parcel : Parcel version 7.X is not supported by this version of
                            Cloudera Manager. Upgrade Cloudera Manager to at least 7.X before using
                            this version of the parcel.You can safely ignore
                                this error message.
Find the installed parcel at /opt/cloudera/parcels.For
                    example:
                    /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-7.1.1-1.cdh7.1.1.p0.3224867/bin/hbase

Use the CDP parcel to run the pre-upgrade commands. Cloudera recommends that you run
                them on an HMaster host.


Run the hbase pre-upgrade validate-dbe command using the new
                    installation.

For example, if you have installed the CDH-7.1.1-1 parcel, you must run the
                        following
                        command:/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-7.1.1-1.cdh7.1.1.p0.3224867/bin/hbase pre-upgrade validate-dbe

The commands check whether your table or snapshots use the PREFIX_TREE Data
                        Block Encoding. 
This command does not take much time to run because it validates only the
                        table-level descriptors.

If PREFIX_TREE Data Block Encoding is not used, the following message is displayed:
The used Data Block Encodings are compatible with HBase 2.0.
If you see this message, your data block encodings are compatible, and
                    you do not have to perform any more steps.If PREFIX_TREE Data Block
                        Encoding is used, a similar error message is
                        displayed:2018-07-13 09:58:32,028 WARN  [main] tool.DataBlockEncodingValidator: Incompatible DataBlockEncoding for table: t, cf: f, encoding: PREFIX_TREEIf
                            you got an error message, continue with Step 2 and fix all your PREFIX_TREE
                            encoded tables. 

Fix your PREFIX_TREE encoded tables using the old installation.

You can change the Data Block Encoding type to PREFIX, DIFF, or
                        FAST_DIFF in your source cluster.
Our example validation output reported column family f of
                        table t is invalid. Its Data Block Encoding type is changed
                        to FAST_DIFF in this example:
hbase> alter 't', { NAME => 'f', DATA_BLOCK_ENCODING => 'FAST_DIFF' }
