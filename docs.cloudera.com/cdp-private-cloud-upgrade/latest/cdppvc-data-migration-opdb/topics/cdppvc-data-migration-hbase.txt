Migrating HBase
You can migrate your Apache HBase workloads from CDH and HDP to CDP. To successfully
  migrate your Apache HBase workloads, you must first understand the data management differences
  between the two platforms and prepare your source data to be compatible with the destination CDP
  platform.
Migrating your workload means migrating your data to CDP and making your applications access
   the data in CDP.
When
   migrating your data to the CDP Private Cloud Base deployment, you must use
   the Apache HBase replication and snapshot features, along with the HashTable/SyncTable tool.
Using the Apache HBase replication and snapshot feature ensures that you do not face any data
   migration bottlenecks even when you have large amounts of data in your source cluster. The
   HashTable/SyncTable tool ensures that the data migrated to the destination cluster is
   synchronized with your source cluster, and lets you verify if your migration is successful.

Preparing for data migration Before you start the data migration from CDH 5.x or HDP 2.x to CDP, you must         understand the requirements and complete certain tasks on CDH/HDP and CDP to ensure a         successful migration.Migrating HBase from CDH or HDPBefore you migrate your data, you must have an Apache HBase cluster created on CDP Private Cloud Base. Your CDH or HDP cluster is your source         cluster, and your CDP Private Cloud Base cluster is your destination         cluster.Verifying and validating if your data is migratedYou can use the SyncTable command with the --dryrun parameter to verify if the tables         are in sync between your source and your destination clusters. The SyncTable --dryrun option         makes this run of your SyncTable command as read-only.HBase unsupported featuresYou need to know about some features you might have used in CDH or HDP are no longer   supported in CDP.
