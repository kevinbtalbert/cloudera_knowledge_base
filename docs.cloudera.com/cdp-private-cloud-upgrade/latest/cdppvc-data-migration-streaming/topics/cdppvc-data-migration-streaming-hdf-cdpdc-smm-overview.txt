Migrate Streams Messaging Manager
Overview of the methods that can be used to migrate Streams Messaging Manger from HDF to
    CDP Private Cloud Base.
Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) migration involves the migration of alert policies. The SMM UI
      is stateless and no data migration is required.warningSMM in HDF stores metrics
        in Ambari Metric Server (AMS). This data can not be migrated. Therefore, historic data is
        lost during the migration.
There are two methods you can use to migrate SMM alert policies. You can either copy raw data
      or reuse existing storage. 
In addition to these two migration methods, you can also choose to manually recreate alert
      policies in the new environment. Steps are provided for both storage reuse and data copy
      methods. For more information on manually recreating alert policies, see Managing Alert
        Policies and Notifiers in the SMM documentation.
