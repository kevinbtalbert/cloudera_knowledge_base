Installing CML
After you install CDP Private Cloud, you install CML using UI-based tools for
        migration of CDSW to CML. 
Install CDP Private Cloud Data Services.
        

In Cloudera Manager, click Data Services.





The following dialog appears.



Click Add CDP Private Cloud Containerized Cluster.






In Add Private Cloud Containerized Cluster, specify the repurposed hosts.
                

In Assign Roles, complete the assignment of roles to the hosts.
For example assign the Docker Server and ECS Agent roles to
                    ageorge-cdsw-5.com and the ECS role to ageorge-cdsw-4.com.


The CML Private Cloud cluster is installed, and you can start the
                    migration from legacy CDSW to CML.
