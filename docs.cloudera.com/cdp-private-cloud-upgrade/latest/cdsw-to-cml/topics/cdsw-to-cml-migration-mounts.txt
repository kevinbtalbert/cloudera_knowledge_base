Customizing CDSW for migrating host mounts
 For security reasons, CML does not allow you to mount a directory directly from
        hosts. You need to customize CDSW runtime to make contents of a directory available to your
        CML workloads.

Before migration, you must perform a few pre-migration steps if you mounted additional dependencies from the
                host in CDSW. For example, you might have mounted directories containing libraries
                needed for running your workloads. You need to make these libraries available in
                CML. In the pre-migration steps below, you set up CDSW for the migration to mount
                your libraries in CML.
If you loaded libraries from a host mount in the past, Cloudera recommends you create
                a custom runtime in CDSW, change the project to use the new custom runtime, and then
                do the migration. However, for anything other than the libraries, load the data to
                all the sessions in CML using the custom runtime addons procedure after
                migration to mount data in all the workloads in CML. Custom runtime addons do not
                allow writes to the file system as the host mount in CDSW does.


Create a customized ML runtime.

If libraries were loaded from the host mount, configure your CDSW project to
                    use the custom runtime by adding the custom runtime to CDSW
                        before migration.
noteAfter migration, use the custom runtime addons procedure mentioned above to mount
                        anything other than libraries.
Libraries you add to the custom runtimes will be available to the CML
                    projects using that custom runtime.
