Repurposing CDSW nodes for CML
The description of an example scenario prepares you to repurpose your existing
        Cloudera Data Science Workbench (CDSW) hosts. If you need to repurpose any CDSW nodes for
        CML, you must perform several tasks before starting the CDSW to CML migration.
The pre-migration example is based on five hosts. In Cloudera Manager, the hosts appear
            in the CDSW service Status Summary:


In Instances, in Role Type, you see the following role types.



You see how to repurpose two worker nodes named ageorge-cdsw-4.com and
            ageorge-cdsw-5.com. First, you cordon and drain the Kubernetes nodes, Next, you remove
            cluster hosts and Kubernetes nodes. Finally, you install and configure the Cloudera
            Private Cloud cluster on the repurposed nodes.

Cordoning and draining Kubernetes nodesYou learn kubectl commands to cordon and drain the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. Removing cluster hosts and Kubernetes nodesYou stop roles assigned to the hosts you want to repurpose for the installation of         Cloudera Private Cloud. Next, you delete nodes from Kubernetes. Finally, you go back to         Cloudera Manager and remove hosts from the CDSW cluster.Installing CMLAfter you install CDP Private Cloud, you install CML using UI-based tools for         migration of CDSW to CML.
