Troubleshooting CDSW to CML migration
You need to know how to retry migration if your migration from Cloudera Data Science
  Workbench (CDSW) 1.10.0 to Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) fails. Also, you learn how to find logs
  for debugging migration and other issues.
Failed Migration
Problem: In the event your migration fails, the Migration failed indicator appears.





Solution: In Workspaces, click Options , and select Retry CDSW Migration:




Viewing logs
Problem: In the event your migration fails, and the retry also fails, you need to get
    information about the failure.
Solution: In Workspaces, click Options , and select View Event Logs.

Troubleshooting failure after reboot in Single Node mode
After reboot of the host in a single node Embedded Container Service (ECS) cluster, the cdpcli
    pod in the cdp namespace might end up in an error state. The cdpcli pod was
    part of a Kubernetes job for CDP Private Cloud installation.  You can delete the pod and
    reboot.
If the cdp-embedded-db pod fails to start after the reboot, perform the following steps: 
Check the logs of the pod to determine the cause. The volume might be failing to attach
       to the host.
Find the name of the Private Cloud (pvc) used by the cdp-embedded-db-0
      pod. 
On the host, check the volume.meta  file under
              /<longhorn-storage>/replicas/pvc-xxxxxx-xxxxxx/ .
Verify that the Size field matches the volume size requested by the pod. 
Correct the field to possibly resolve the issue.
