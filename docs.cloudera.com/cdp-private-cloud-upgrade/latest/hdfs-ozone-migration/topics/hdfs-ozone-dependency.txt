HDFS dependency on running Ozone
Although Ozone is an independent service and does not use any runtime component of
        HDFS, Ozone relies on the mechanism of how Cloudera Manager distributes client
        configurations to different services such as Hive, Spark, YARN, and so on. Because this
        mechanism of Cloudera Manager does not work without HDFS, Ozone requires HDFS as a
        dependency when running on a CDP cluster. 
If applications such as Hive, Spark, YARN, or others require the cluster HDFS client
            configurations, Ozone client configurations are also bundled along with the HDFS
            configurations. Therefore, out-of-the-box support for Ozone based storage can be made
            available in Data Warehousing and Machine Learning applications. This dependency also
            implies that changing any Ozone client configuration requires restarting of all the
            dependent client services.
