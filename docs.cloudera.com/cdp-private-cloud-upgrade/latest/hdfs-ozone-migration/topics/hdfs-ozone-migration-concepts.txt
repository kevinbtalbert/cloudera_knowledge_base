Considerations for transferring data from HDFS to Ozone
There are certain factors that you must consider when transferring data from your
        HDFS deployment to Ozone. The factors include HDFS dependency on Ozone, roles and sizing
        considerations, and Ozone namespace concepts.
HDFS dependency on running OzoneAlthough Ozone is an independent service and does not use any runtime component of         HDFS, Ozone relies on the mechanism of how Cloudera Manager distributes client         configurations to different services such as Hive, Spark, YARN, and so on. Because this         mechanism of Cloudera Manager does not work without HDFS, Ozone requires HDFS as a         dependency when running on a CDP cluster. Roles and sizing considerations for OzoneYou must be aware of the hardware sizing requirements for your Ozone deployment.         Further, you must understand the roles for which you need to configure different         nodes.Ozone namespace conceptsThe Ozone namespace includes the following conceptual entities: volumes, keys, and         buckets. Each key is part of a bucket, which, in turn, belongs to a volume. Only an         administrator can create volumes. Depending on their requirements, regular users can create         buckets in volumes. Ozone stores data as keys inside these buckets.Ozone configurationsOzoneâ€™s main configuration file is ozone-site.xml that carries the         server or the client configurations depending on the component. Permission models on OzoneOzone uses Access Control Lists (ACLs) to provide various access permissions to         users. To enable ACLs in ozone, you must set ozone.acl.enabled = true.         Ozone supports two types of authorizers to set the access permissions: native authorizer and         Ranger authorizer. Parent topic: Migrating your data from HDFS to Ozone
