Migrating your data from HDFS to Ozone
You can migrate data from your existing HDFS deployment to Ozone for benefits such as
        scaling the metadata to billions of files; supporting denser, more cost-effective storage
        nodes as a part of a strategy to segregate storage and compute; or cold storage and archival
        storage needs.
This document assumes that you have an existing HDFS cluster from which you
            want a part or whole data to be moved to Ozone. The Ozone service can exist in the same
            cluster as HDFS or in a different cluster. 

Considerations for transferring data from HDFS to OzoneThere are certain factors that you must consider when transferring data from your         HDFS deployment to Ozone. The factors include HDFS dependency on Ozone, roles and sizing         considerations, and Ozone namespace concepts.HDFS namespace mapping to OzoneMapping HDFS directories to Ozone volumes, buckets, and keys is extremely important         to understand as you migrate the content. Apart from how to perform the mapping, the number         of Ozone elements to create for the migration of data is also an important consideration.
