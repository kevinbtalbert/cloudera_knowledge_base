Roles and sizing considerations for Ozone
You must be aware of the hardware sizing requirements for your Ozone deployment.
        Further, you must understand the roles for which you need to configure different
        nodes.
For the Ozone hardware sizing requirements, see Ozone.
The following Ozone roles require different node requirements: 
Six master node instances: Three each of Ozone Manager (OM) and Storage
                    Container Manager (SCM) services. Ozone has no other dependencies for high
                    availability because the three master nodes form a Raft ring and replicate
                    metadata with instantaneous failover without requiring ZooKeeper or Journal
                    Nodes, unlike in HDFS.
One Recon node and S3 Gateway daemons: Recon is a centralized monitoring and
                    management service within an Ozone cluster that provides information about the
                    metadata maintained by different Ozone components such as OM and SCM.S3
                        Gateways provide REST access to Ozone over HTTP and support the
                        AWS-compatible S3 API. Cloudera recommends deploying a number of gateways
                        behind a load balancer. These gateways are stateless and can also be
                        co-hosted with DataNodes.
