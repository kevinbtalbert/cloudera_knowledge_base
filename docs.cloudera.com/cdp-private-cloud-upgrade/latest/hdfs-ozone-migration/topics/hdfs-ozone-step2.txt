Preparing Ozone for data ingestion
You must prepare the Ozone cluster for ingesting the data from the HDFS cluster. 
Consider the example of moving an encrypted HDFS directory to Ozone. The following
            procedure outlines the steps you must perform to create the equivalent bucket and target
            directory in Ozone.

Decide on the HDFS to Ozone mapping scheme.
Consider the example of mapping the HDFS /user directory to
                    an Ozone volume. 

Create the volume /user as an admin user.

> kinit as admin user and create the volume
> ozone sh volume create ofs://<ozone.service.id>/user



Create an encrypted bucket to migrate a user's directory from the HDFS
                    cluster.
The following example shows how you can create an encrypted bucket for a user
                        john.doe.> kinit as admin user and create the bucket for john.doe
> hadoop key create xxx_key
> ozone sh bucket create -k xxx_key /user/john.doe

(Optionally create a target dir inside the bucket if needed)
> hdfs dfs -mkdir ofs://<ozone.service.id>/user/john.doe/target_dir


Provide permissions to the user to access the encrypted bucket.
Use Ranger to provide the required permissions. The following image shows
                        the Ranger policy configured for the user john.doe on
                            the /user/john.doe bucket.

noteIf you run kinit as user
                            john.doe, ensure that john.doe has the
                        permissions to create keys using Ranger KMS. Also, ensure that any user who
                        wants to write data into an encrypted bucket has the Decrypt
                            EEK permissions through Ranger KMS.
