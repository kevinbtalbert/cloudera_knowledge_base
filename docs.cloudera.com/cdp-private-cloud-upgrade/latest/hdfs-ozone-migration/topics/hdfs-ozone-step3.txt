Creating additional Ranger policies for the keyadmin user
After creating the encrypted bucket, add the required policies to allow reads to the
        bucket. 
Consider the key creation example in Preparing Ozone for data ingestion. The
            prefix xxx is an administrator, and therefore, has all the
            privileges.

Add the keyadmin policy to make xxx a key administrator, and
                    allow john.doe access to the encrypted key.
