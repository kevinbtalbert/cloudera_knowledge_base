Moving the HDFS data using the distcp command
Use the hadoop distcp command to move the content from the HDFS
        source cluster. 
You must consider the following before running the
                distcp command:
Ensure that the distcp user can run a MapReduce job on YARN.
                    Otherwise, you must tweak the following configurations to enable the
                        distcp user:
allowed.system.users
banned.users
min.user.id

For source directories with a very high file count, consider creating a manual
                    copy listing, as specified in the following
                        example.> hdfs dfs -ls hdfs://<hdfs-nameservice>/user/john.doe/application1/* > src_files

The
                        copy listing output file can be read, and submitted as input one by one to a
                            distcp job. 


Considering the example of a user john.doe whose data from the
                        /user/john.doe/application1/ directory you want to transfer
                    to Ozone, run the distcp command as specified.

> hadoop distcp -direct hdfs://<hdfs-nameservice>/user/john.doe/application1 ofs://<ozone.service.id>/user/john.doe/


note

If your bucket type is OBS (object-store), you must use the
                                    -direct flag. Ozone supports atomic renames
                                with FSO (file-system optimized) buckets. FSO is the default bucket
                                layout starting OZONE-Parcel 718.2.0 version. 
If using the object store (OBS) bucket type, a rename at a directory
                                level internally means multiple client calls to rename the directory
                                in every subdirectory and key with the required prefix, eventually
                                ending with the top-level directory's renaming. Hence, writing to a
                                temp directory in target and then renaming a top-level directory is
                                a costly operation in Ozone for OBS buckets, unlike FSO
                                buckets.
Ozone does not support file appends, concatenations,
                                and snapshots. Therefore, Ozone also does not support the
                                    distcp flags append,
                                    -diff, -rdiff, and
                                    -blocksperchunk.
From HDFS storage to DistCp in CDH5 and HDP2 to Apache Ozone in CDP,
                                you must set the -skipcrccheck parameter to
                                skip the file checksum comparison. From HDFS storage to DistCp in
                                CDH6, HDP3, and CDP to Apache Ozone in CDP, you must set the
                                    -Ddfs.checksum.combine.mode=COMPOSITE_CRC
                                parameter to enable the file checksum between the two filesystems
                                because the file-level checksum type (HDFS-13056) is only available
                                in CDH/HDP/CDP based on newer Hadoop versions.
