Validating the migrated data
You must run specific commands on the source and destination clusters to validate the
        migrated data from the HDFS cluster.

Considering the example of the user john.doe, run the
                        hdfs du command on the source directory
                        (/user/john.doe/application1) and the target directory
                        (ofs://<ozone.service.id>/user/john.doe/application1).

noteThe Ozone filesystem (ofs) does not currently return the
                        correct replicated size of a file in the du command
                        response. However, for simple listing of files and raw file sizes, the
                            du output comparison helps in testing the success of
                            disctp.
