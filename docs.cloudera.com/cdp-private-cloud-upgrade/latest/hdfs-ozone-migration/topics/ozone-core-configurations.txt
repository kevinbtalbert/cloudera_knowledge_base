Adding Core Configuration service for Ozone
After enabling Kerberos, you can now add the Core
            Configuration service for Ozone using the Cloudera Manager version 7.4.4 and
        higher.
Adding Core Configuration service
You must add the Core Configuration service for your cluster
                using Cloudera Manager. To enable Kerberos on Ozone, HDFS is not required as a
                prerequisite for Ozone to access core-site.xml.

Navigate to the cluster to which you want to add the Core
                            Configuration service.

In the Review Changes page, you can provide the
                        values for the parameters available and click
                            Continue.
The Command Details page appears. You can monitor the
                        status of the Core Configuration service. Click
