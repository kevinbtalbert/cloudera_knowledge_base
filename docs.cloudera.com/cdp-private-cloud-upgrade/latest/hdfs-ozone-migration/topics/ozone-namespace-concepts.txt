Ozone namespace concepts
The Ozone namespace includes the following conceptual entities: volumes, keys, and
        buckets. Each key is part of a bucket, which, in turn, belongs to a volume. Only an
        administrator can create volumes. Depending on their requirements, regular users can create
        buckets in volumes. Ozone stores data as keys inside these buckets.
The three main entities can be explained as follows:
Volume
An Ozone volume is similar to a user account, for example; sales, marketing,
                        engineering, and so on.
Buckets
An Ozone bucket is similar to a directory or an Amazon S3 bucket. A bucket
                        any number of keys but cannot contain other buckets.
Keys
An Ozone key is similar to any key in an object store or a file in a
                        filesystem. If a key is used as a filesystem, the prefixes are treated as
                        directories.

The following image depicts the relationship between volumes, buckets, and keys in the
            Ozone namespace:


When a client writes a key, Ozone stores the associated data on DataNodes in chunks
            called blocks. Therefore, each key is associated with one or more blocks. Within a
            DataNode, multiple unrelated blocks can reside in a storage container. Storage container
            is an internal Ozone abstraction that represents a collection of blocks and that
            singularly forms the unit of replication in Ozone.
