Other Miscellaneous Changes in Impala
Review the changes to Impala syntax or service that might affect Impala after migrating
  your workload from CDH version 5.13-5.16 or CDH version 6.1 or later to CDP Private Cloud Base or CDP
  Public Cloud. The version of Impala you used in CDH version 5.11 - 5.16 or 6.1 or later changes to
  Impala 3.4 in CDP Private Cloud Base.
Decimal V2 Default
 In CDP, Impala uses DECIMAL V2 by default.
 To continue using the first version of the DECIMAL type for the backward
    compatibility of your queries, set the DECIMAL_V2 query option to
     FALSE: SET DECIMAL_V2=FALSE;

Column Aliases Substitution
To conform to the SQL standard, Impala no longer performs alias substitution in the
    subexpressions of GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER
     BY.
The example below references to the actual column sum(ss_quantity) in the
     ORDER BY clause instead of the alias Total_Quantity_Purchased
    and also references to the actual column ss_item_sk in the GROUP
     BY clause instead of the alias Item because aliases are no longer
    supported in the subexpressions.
select
    ss_item_sk as Item,
    count(ss_item_sk) as Times_Purchased,
    sum(ss_quantity) as Total_Quantity_Purchased
    from store_sales
    group by ss_item_sk
    order by sum(ss_quantity) desc
    limit 5;
    +-------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    | item  | times_purchased | total_quantity_purchased |
    +-------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    | 9325  | 372             | 19072                    |
    | 4279  | 357             | 18501                    |
    | 7507  | 371             | 18475                    |
    | 5953  | 369             | 18451                    |
    | 16753 | 375             | 18446                    |
    +-------+-----------------+--------------------------+

Default PARQUET_ARRAY_RESOLUTION
The PARQUET_ARRAY_RESOLUTION query option controls the behavior of the
    indexed-based resolution for nested arrays in Parquet. In Parquet, you can represent an array
    using a 2-level or 3-level representation. The default value for the PARQUET_ARRAY_RESOLUTION is
    THREE_LEVEL to match the Parquet standard 3-level encoding. See Parquet_Array_Resolution Query Option for more
    information.

Clustered Hint Default
The clustered hint is enabled by default, which adds a local sort by the partitioning columns
    in HDFS and Kudu tables to a query plan. The noclustered hint, which prevents clustering in
    tables having ordering columns, is ignored with a warning. 

Query Options Removed 
 The following query options have been removed: 

DEFAULT_ORDER_BY_LIMIT


ABORT_ON_DEFAULT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


V_CPU_CORES


RESERVATION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT


RM_INITIAL_MEM


SCAN_NODE_CODEGEN_THRESHOLD


MAX_IO_BUFFERS


RM_INITIAL_MEM


DISABLE_CACHED_READS



Shell Option refresh_after_connect
 The refresh_after_connect option for starting the Impala Shell is removed. 

EXTRACT and DATE_PART Functions
 The EXTRACT and DATE_PART functions changed in the
    following way: 
 The output type of the EXTRACT and DATE_PART functions
      changed to BIGINT. 

 Extracting the millisecond part from a TIMESTAMP returns the seconds
       component and the milliseconds component. For example, EXTRACT (CAST('2006-05-12
        18:27:28.123456789' AS TIMESTAMP), 'MILLISECOND') returns 28123. 



Port for SHUTDOWN Command
 If you upgraded from CDH 6.1 or later and specified a port as a part of the
     SHUTDOWN command, change the port number parameter to use the Kudu7: RPC
    (KRPC) port for communication between the Impala brokers.

Change in Client Connection Timeout
The default behavior of client connection timeout changes after upgrading.
In CDH 6.2 and lower, the client waited indefinitely to open the new session if the maximum
    number of threads specified by --fe_service_threads has been allocated.
After upgrading, the server requires a new startup flag,
     --accepted_client_cnxn_timeout to control treatment of new connection
    requests. The configured number of server threads is insufficient for the workload.
If --accepted_client_cnxn_timeout > 0, new connection requests are
    rejected after the specified timeout.
If --accepted_client_cnxn_timeout=0, client waits indefinitely to connect to
    Impala. This sets pre-upgrade behavior.
The default timeout is 5 minutes. 

Interoperability between Hive and Impala
Impala supports a number of file formats used in Apache Hadoop. It can also load and query data
    files produced by other Hadoop components such as Hive. After upgrading from any CDH 5.x version
    to CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1, if you create an RC file in Hive using the default
     LazyBinaryColumnarSerDe, Impala can not read the RC file. However you can set
    the configuration option of hive.default.rcfile.serde to
     ColumnarSerDe to maintain the interoperability between hive and impala.

Improvements in Metadata
After upgrading from CDH to CDP, the on-demand use_local_catalog mode is set
    to True by default on all the Impala coordinators so that the Impala
    coordinators pull metadata from catalogd and cache it locally. This reduces memory footprint on
    coordinators and automates the cache eviction.
In CDP, the catalog_topic_mode is set to minimal by default
    to enable on-demand metadata for all coordinators.

Recompute the Statistics
After migrating the workload from any CDH 5.x version to CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1, recompute the
    statistics for Impala. Even though CDH 5.x statistics are available after the upgrade, the
    queries do not benefit from the new features until the statistics are recomputed.

Mitigating Excess Network Traffic
The catalog metadata can become large and lead to excessive network traffic due to
    dissemination through the statestore. The --compact_catalog_topic flag was
    introduced to mitigate this issue by compressing the catalog topic entries to reduce their
    serialized size. This saves network bandwidth at the cost of a small quantity of CPU time. This
    flag is enabled by default.
