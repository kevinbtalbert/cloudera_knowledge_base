ORC Support Disabled for Full-Transactional Tables
 In  CDP 7.1.0 and earlier versions, ORC table support
    is disabled for Impala queries. However, you have an option to switch to the CDH behavior by
    using the command line argument ENABLE_ORC_SCANNER.
New Default Behavior
  In  CDP 7.1.0 and earlier versions, if you use Impala to query ORC tables you will see it
        fail. To mitigate this situation, you must add explicit STORED AS clause to code creating
        Hive tables and use a format Impala can read. Another option is to set global configuration
        in Cloudera Manager to change hive_default_fileformat_managed.
Steps to switch to the CDH behavior:
Set the query option ENABLE_ORC_SCANNER to
      TRUE to re-enable ORC table support. 
This option does not work on a full transactional ORC table, and the queries return an
        error.
noteIf you are using  CDP 7.1.1 or later versions, the argument ENABLE_ORC_SCANNER is enabled by default and you can use Impala
      to query ORC tables without any manual interventions.

ORC vs Parquet in CDP
The differences between Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) file format for storing Hive data and
        Parquet for storing Impala data are important to understand. Query performance improves when
        you use the appropriate format for your application. The following table compares Hive and
        Impala support for ORC and Parquet in CDP Public Cloud and CDP Private Cloud Base.
