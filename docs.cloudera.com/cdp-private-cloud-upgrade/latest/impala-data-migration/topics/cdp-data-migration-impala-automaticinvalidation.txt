Automatic Invalidation/Refresh of Metadata
 To pick up new information when raw data is ingested into Tables you can use the
    hms_event_polling_interval_s flag.
New Default Behavior
When raw data is ingested into Tables, new HMS metadata and filesystem metadata are
        generated. In CDH, to pick up this new information, you must manually issue an Invalidate or
        Refresh command. However in CDP, this feature is controlled by the
        hms_event_polling_interval_s flag. This flag is set to 2 seconds by default. This option
        automatically refreshes the tables as changes are detected in HMS. When automatic
        invalidate/refresh of metadata is enabled, the Catalog Server polls Hive Metastore (HMS)
        notification events at a configurable interval and automatically applies the changes to
        Impala catalog. If  specific tables that are not supported by event polling need to be
        refreshed, you must run a table level Invalidate or Refresh command.
