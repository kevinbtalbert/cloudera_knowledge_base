Automatic Row Count Estimation
To optimize complex or multi-table queries Impala has access to statistics about the
    volume of data and how the values are distributed. Impala uses this information to help
    parallelize and distribute the work for a query.
New Default Behavior
The Impala query planner can make use of statistics about entire tables and partitions.
        This information includes physical characteristics such as the number of rows, number of
        data files, the total size of the data files, and the file format. For partitioned tables,
        the numbers are calculated per partition, and as totals for the whole table. This metadata
        is stored in the Metastore database, and can be updated by either Impala or Hive.
If there are no statistics available on a table, Impala estimates the cardinality by
        estimating the size of table based on the number of rows in the table. This behavior is
        switched on by default and should result in better plans for most cases when statistics are
        not available.
For some edge cases, it is possible that Impala generates a bad plan (when compared to the
        same query in CDH) when the statistics are not present on that table and could negatively
        affect the query performance.
Steps to switch to the CDH behavior:
Set the DISABLE_HDFS_NUM_ROWS_ESTIMATE query option to
          TRUE to disable this optimization.
