Automatic Refresh of Tables on Impala Clusters
The property enable_insert_events is used in CDP to refresh the tables
    or partitions automatically on other Impala clusters when Impala inserts into a
    table.
enable_insert_events
If Impala inserts into a table it refreshes the underlying table or partition. When this configuration
        enable_insert_events is set to True (default) Impala  generates INSERT
        event types which when received by other Impala clusters  automatically refreshes the tables
        or partitions.
noteEvent processing must be ON, for this property to work.
