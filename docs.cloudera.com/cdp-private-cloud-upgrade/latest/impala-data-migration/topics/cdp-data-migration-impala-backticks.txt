Using Reserved Words in SQL Queries
For ANSI SQL compliance, Impala rejects reserved words in SQL queries in CDP. A
        reserved word is one that cannot be used directly as an identifier. If you need to use it as
        an identifier, you must quote it with backticks.
New reserved words are added in CDH 6. To port SQL statements from CDH 5 that has
            different sets of reserved words, you must change queries that use references to such
            Tables or Databases using reserved words in the SQL syntax. 

Find a table having the problematic table reference, such as a create table
                    statement that uses a reserved word such as
                    select in the CREATE
                    statement.

Enclose the table name in backticks.
CREATE TABLE select (x INT): fails
CREATE TABLE `select` (x INT): succeeds
