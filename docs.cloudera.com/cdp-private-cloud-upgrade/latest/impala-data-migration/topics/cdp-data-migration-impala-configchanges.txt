Impala configuration differences in CDH and CDP
There are some configuration differences related to Impala in CDH and CDP. These
    differences are due to the changes  made in CDP for the optimal interoperability between Hive
    and Impala for  improved user experience. Review the changes before you migrate your Impala
    workload from CDH to CDP.

Default File FormatsTo improve useability and functionality, Impala significantly changed table creation.     In CDP, the default file format of the tables is Parquet.Reconnect to HS2 SessionClients can disconnect from Impala while keeping the HiveSever2 (HS2) session running     and can also reconnect to the same session by presenting the session_token.Automatic Row Count EstimationTo optimize complex or multi-table queries Impala has access to statistics about the     volume of data and how the values are distributed. Impala uses this information to help     parallelize and distribute the work for a query.Using Reserved Words in SQL QueriesFor ANSI SQL compliance, Impala rejects reserved words in SQL queries in CDP. A         reserved word is one that cannot be used directly as an identifier. If you need to use it as         an identifier, you must quote it with backticks.
