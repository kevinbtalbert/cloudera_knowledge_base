Default File Formats
To improve useability and functionality, Impala significantly changed table creation.
    In CDP, the default file format of the tables is Parquet.
New Default Behavior
When you issue the CREATE TABLE statement without the STORED
        AS clause, Impala creates a Parquet table instead of a Text table as in CDH.
For example, if you create an external table based on a text file without providing the
          STORED AS  clause and then issue a select query, the query fails in CDP,
        because Impala expects the file to be in the Parquet file format.
Steps to switch to the CDH behavior:

Add the explicitly stored as clause to in the CREATE
              TABLE statements if the file format is not Parquet.
Start Coordinator with the default_transactional_type flag set to
              text for all tables.
Set the default_file_format query option to TEXT to
            revert to the default Text format for one or more CREATE TABLE
            statements.
