Metadata Improvements
In CDP, all catalog metadata improvements are enabled by default. You may use these few
    knobs to control how Impala manages its metadata to improve performance and
    scalability.
use_local_catalog
In CDP, the on-demand use_local_catalog mode is set to True by default on all
        the Impala coordinators so that the Impala coordinators pull metadata as needed from
        catalogd and cache it locally. This results in many performance and scalability
        improvements, such as reduced memory footprint on coordinators and automatic cache
        eviction.

catalog_topic_mode

        The granularity of on-demand metadata fetches is at the partition level between the
        coordinator and catalogd. Common use cases like add/drop partitions do
        not trigger unnecessary serialization/deserialization of large metadata.
      
 The feature can be used in either of the following modes. 
 Metadata on-demand mode 
 In this mode, all coordinators use the metadata on-demand. 
 Set the following on catalogd:
              --catalog_topic_mode=minimal  Set the following on all
                impalad coordinators:
              --use_local_catalog=true 
 Mixed mode 
 In this mode, only some coordinators are enabled to use the metadata on-demand. 
 Cloudera recommends that you use the mixed mode only for testing local catalogâ€™s
              impact on heap usage. 
 Set the following on catalogd:
              --catalog_topic_mode=mixed
 Set the following on impalad coordinators with metdadata on-demand:
              --use_local_catalog=true 
Limitation:

 HDFS caching is not supported in On-demand metadata mode coordinators.
