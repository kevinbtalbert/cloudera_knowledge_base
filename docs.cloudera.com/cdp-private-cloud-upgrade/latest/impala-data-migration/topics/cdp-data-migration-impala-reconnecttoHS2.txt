Reconnect to HS2 SessionCloudera Docs
Reconnect to HS2 Session
Clients can disconnect from Impala while keeping the HiveSever2 (HS2) session running
    and can also reconnect to the same session by presenting the session_token.
New Default Behavior
By default, disconnected sessions are terminated after 15 min.


Clients will not notice a difference because of this behavioral change.
If clients are disconnected without the driver explicitly closing the session (for
            example, because of a network fault), disconnected sessions and the queries associated
            with them may remain open and continue consuming resources until the disconnected
            session is timed out. Administrators may notice these disconnected sessions and/or the
            associated resource consumption.


Steps to switch to the CDH behavior:
You can adjust the --disconnected_session_timeout flag to a lower value so
        that disconnected sessions are cleaned up quickly.
