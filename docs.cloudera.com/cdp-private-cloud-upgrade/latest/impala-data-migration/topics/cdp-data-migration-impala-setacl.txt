Set Storage Engine ACLs
You must be aware of  the steps to set ACLs for Impala to allow Impala to write to
        the Hive Warehouse Directory.

After migration, the (hive.metastore.warehouse.dir) is set to
                    /user/hive/warehouse where the Impala managed tables are
                located. When the Impala workload is migrated from CDH to CDP, the ACL settings are
                automatically set for the default warehouse directories. If you changed the default
                location of the warehouse directories after migrating to CDP then follow the steps
                to allow Impala to write to the Hive Warehouse Directory.
Complete the initial configurations in the free-form fields on the
                    Hive/Impala Configuration pages in Cloudera
                        Manager to allow Impala to write to the Hive Warehouse Directory.


Set Up Impala User ACLs using the Impala Configuration page


Impala > Action Menu > Set the Impala user ACLs on warehouse
                                    directory



Impala > Action Menu > Set the Impala user ACLs on external warehouse
                                    directory









Cloudera Manager sets the ACL for the user "Impala". However
                    before starting the Impala service, verify permissions and ACLs set on the
                    individual database directories using the sub-commands getfacl
                    and setfacl.


Verify the ACLs of HDFS directories for managed and external tables
                            using getfacl.
Example:$ hdfs dfs -getfacl hdfs:///warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive
# file: hdfs:///warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive
# owner: hive
# group: hive
user::rwx
group::rwx
other::---
default:user::rwx
default:user:impala:rwx
default:group::rwx
default:mask::rwx
default:other::---
$ hdfs dfs -getfacl hdfs:///warehouse/tablespace/external/hive
# file: hdfs:///warehouse/tablespace/external/hive
# owner: hive
# group: hive
# flags: --t
user::rwx
group::rwx
other::rwx
default:user::rwx
default:user:impala:rwx
default:group::rwx
default:mask::rwx
default:other::rwx


If necessary,
                            set
                            the ACLs of HDFS directories using
                            setfacl
Example:$ hdfs dfs -setfacl hdfs:///warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive
$ hdfs dfs -setfacl hdfs:///warehouse/tablespace/external/hive
                            For more information on using the sub-commands getfacl
                            and setfacl, see Using CLI commands to create and list
                                ACLs. 


The above examples show the user Impala as part of the
                                Hive group. If in your setup, the user
                                Impala does not belong to the group
                                Hive then ensure that the Group user
                                Impala belongs to has WRITE privileges assigned on
                            the directory.
To view the Group user Impala belongs
                            to:$ id -Gn impala
uid=973(impala) gid=971(impala) groups=971(impala),972(hive)
