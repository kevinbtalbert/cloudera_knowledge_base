Change location of Datafiles
If Impala managed tables are located on the HDFS in /user/hive/warehouse before the
        migration, the tables, converted to external, remain there. The migration process sets the
        hive.metastore.warehouse.dir property to this location, designating it the Hive warehouse
        location. You can change the location of the warehouse using Cloudera
        Manager.

The location of existing tables does not change after a CDH to CDP migration.
                In CDP, there are separate HDFS directories for managed and external tables.
The data files for managed tables are available in the warehouse location
                        specified by the Cloudera Manager configuration setting, Hive
                            Warehouse Directory.
The data files for external tables are available in the warehouse location
                        specified by the Cloudera Manager configuration setting, Hive
                            Warehouse External Directory.

After migration, the (hive.metastore.warehouse.dir) is set to
                    /user/hive/warehouse where the
                Impala managed
                tables are located. 
You can change the location of the warehouse using the Hive Metastore Action menu in Cloudera
                Manager.
