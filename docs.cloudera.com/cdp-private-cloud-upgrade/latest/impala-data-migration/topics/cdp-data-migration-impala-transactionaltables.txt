Default Managed Tables
In CDP, managed tables are transactional tables with the insert_only
    property by default. You must be aware of the new default behavior of modifying file systems on
    a managed table in CDP and the methods to switch to the old behavior.
New Default Behavior


You can no longer perform file system modifications (add/remove files) on a managed
            table in CDP. The directory structure for transactional tables is different than
            non-transactional tables, and any out-of-band files which are added may or may not be
            picked up by Hive and Impala.
The insert_only transactional tables cannot be currently altered in
            Impala. The ALTER TABLE statement on a transactional table currently
            displays an error.
Impala does not currently support compaction on transaction tables. You should use
            Hive to compact the tables. 
The SELECT, INSERT, INSERT
              OVERWRITE, and TRUNCATE statements are supported on the
            insert-only transactional tables.


Steps to switch to the CDH behavior:
If you do not want transactional tables, set the
    DEFAULT_TRANSACTIONAL_TYPE query option to
    NONE so that any newly created managed tables are
    not transactional by default.

External tables do not drop the data files when the table is dropped. To purge the data along
              with the table when the table is dropped, add external.table.purge =
                true in the table properties. When external.table.purge is
              set to true, the data is removed when the DROP TABLE
              statement is executed.
