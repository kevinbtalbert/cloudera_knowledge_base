Migrating Impala Data Overview
Before migrating Impala data from the CDH platform to CDP, you must be aware of
    the semantic and behavioral differences between CDH and CDP Impala and the activities that need
    to be performed prior to the data migration.
To successfully migrate your critical Impala data to the Cloud environment you must learn
   about the capacity requirements in the target environment and also understand the performance
   difference between your current environment and the targeted environment.
