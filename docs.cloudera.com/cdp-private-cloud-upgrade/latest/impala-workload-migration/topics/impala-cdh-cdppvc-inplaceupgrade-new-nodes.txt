In-place upgrade with new nodes for CDW Data Service
The age and hardware refresh cycle of legacy clusters is an important consideration when
  deciding on the in-place upgrade strategy. To add new hardware to the base cluster this mechanism
  is the best choice. Adding new hardware to the base cluster makes it simpler to set up the
  Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Data Service, which reduces the time required and lowers
  risk.
noteCloudera recommends this migration path to move from CDH to CDW Data Service on CDP Private
   Cloud.
In-place upgrade and migration is a two-step process. To get to CDW on Private Cloud, you
    must:
Upgrade an existing CDH cluster to CDP Private Cloud base
Install CDW Data Service on the new hardware alongside the base cluster and then move your
     compute workloads from CDP Private Cloud base to CDW Data Service

The following diagram shows running the CDW Data Service on Private Cloud on the new hardware
   alongside the base cluster after an in-place upgrade from CDH. HW stands for hardware and NW
   stands for new workloads:
