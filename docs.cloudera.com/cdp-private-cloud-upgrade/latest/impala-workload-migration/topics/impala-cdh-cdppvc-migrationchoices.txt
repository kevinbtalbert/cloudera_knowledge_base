Migration choices to migrate workloads to CDP Private Cloud Base
To migrate Impala workloads from CDH to CDP Private Cloud Base, you can perform a
  side-car migration. If your goal is to migrate the workloads to Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW)
  Private Cloud, then perform an in-place upgrade of CDH nodes to CDP Private Cloud Base and then
  migrate the Impala workloads to CDW Private Cloud on new nodes.
Each mechanism has common aspects of work, risk mitigation, and successful outcomes expected
   across all paths from legacy distributions into CDP. Both paths include assessing the workloads,
   testing, validating, and minimizing workload unavailability during the move. Cloudera recommends
   the in-place upgrade and migration method to migrate Impala workloads from CDH to CDW on Private
   Cloud.

Side-car migrationThe side-car migration mechanism is best employed when you have tighter service-level   agreements (SLAs) that preclude an extended, multi-hour downtime for your workloads. This process   aims to minimize downtime on individual workloads while providing a straightforward roll-back   mechanism on a per-workload basis.In-place upgrade with new nodes for CDW Data ServiceThe age and hardware refresh cycle of legacy clusters is an important consideration when   deciding on the in-place upgrade strategy. To add new hardware to the base cluster this mechanism   is the best choice. Adding new hardware to the base cluster makes it simpler to set up the   Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Data Service, which reduces the time required and lowers   risk.Parent topic: Migrating Impala workloads from CDH/HDP to CDP Private Cloud Base
