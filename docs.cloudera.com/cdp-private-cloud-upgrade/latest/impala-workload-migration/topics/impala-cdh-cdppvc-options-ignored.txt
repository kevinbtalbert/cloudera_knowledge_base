Configuration options available in CDW by default
Certain customization that you embraced in a CDH environment need not be imported to
  Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), due to its containerized and compute-isolated architecture and
  available default configurations.
The following lis a ist of customization options that are set by default in CDW and need not be
    configured:
Admission control in CDW is tuned by default because of tenant isolation using multiple
     Virtual Warehouses, and auto-scaling.
Impala multithreading and remote data cache settings can be ignored because CDW provides
     them as default configurations.
