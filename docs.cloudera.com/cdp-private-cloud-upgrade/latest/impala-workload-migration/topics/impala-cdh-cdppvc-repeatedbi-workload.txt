Guidelines for moving repeated BI workloads
Review the guidelines for moving Repeated BI workloads.

Avoid selecting workloads that download data.
Ensure that the datasets are compressed Parquet tables and not in text or ORC format.
Select workloads that are an output of BI queries submitted from any BI tools and repeated
    multiple times.You can find the repeated queries under simple query profile
    analysis.
A small to medium-sized VW is recommended for BI workloads.
Redirect the BI tool to point to CDW for the workloads. 
Check that the performance of the queries in CDW is faster.
Set proper values for run-time filters, EXEC_TIME_LIMIT_S property, and so
    on as recommended for TPC-DS queries.
Set query timeouts and session timeouts to avoid non-responsive queries.
Look at the peak spilled metrics in the query profiles and depending on the value increase
    the data cache size and lower the scratch space (SCRATCH_LIMIT) to cache more
    data for better performance.
Increase the value of the EXEC_SINGLE_NODE_ROWS_THRESHOLD property to at
    least 5000 for small query optimization.
Schedule weekly statistic data collection for better query performance.
