Side-car migration
The side-car migration mechanism is best employed when you have tighter service-level
  agreements (SLAs) that preclude an extended, multi-hour downtime for your workloads. This process
  aims to minimize downtime on individual workloads while providing a straightforward roll-back
  mechanism on a per-workload basis.
For a side-car migration, you must install and configure a new greenfield CDP Private Cloud
   Base cluster on the second set of hardware, consisting of a few dense storage nodes and several
   compute nodes. The side-car migration breaks down into the following three major phases:
Building and configuring the new CDP Private Cloud Base cluster
Configuring a replication process to provide periodic and consistent snapshots of data,
     metadata, and accompanying governance policies
Deploying the workloads onto the new cluster, testing them, and flipping them into a
     production state after validation

After you move the workloads, disable them on the legacy cluster. You will temporarily have
   production workloads running across multiple clusters during the migration period.
noteFor better query performance and more efficient resource utilization by queries and to
   benefit from the new features, recompute the statistics after migrating your compute
   workload.
