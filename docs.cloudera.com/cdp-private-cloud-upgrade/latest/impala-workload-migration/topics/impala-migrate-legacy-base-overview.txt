Migrating Impala workloads from CDH/HDP to CDP Private Cloud Base
If you are running Impala workloads on CDH or HDP platforms, then you must first upgrade
  your cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base and then migrate your Impala workloads. If you are already
  running Impala workloads on CDP Private Cloud Base, then you can skip this step.
Migration choices to migrate workloads to CDP Private Cloud BaseTo migrate Impala workloads from CDH to CDP Private Cloud Base, you can perform a   side-car migration. If your goal is to migrate the workloads to Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW)   Private Cloud, then perform an in-place upgrade of CDH nodes to CDP Private Cloud Base and then   migrate the Impala workloads to CDW Private Cloud on new nodes.
