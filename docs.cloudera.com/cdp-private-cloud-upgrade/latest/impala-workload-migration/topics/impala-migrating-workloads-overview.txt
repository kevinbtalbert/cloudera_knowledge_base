Migrating Impala workloads
Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Private Cloud offers the latest, updated, and managed
  elastic Impala experience. Migrating the Impala workloads to CDW enables you to leverage
  auto-scaling, data sharing, data and result caching, and many other powerful capabilities of the
  Data Lakehouse architecture.
If you are on CDH or HDP platforms, then you must first upgrade your clusters to CDP Private
   Cloud Base before you can install CDP Private Cloud Data Services and migrate your Impala compute
   workloads to CDW. Compute workloads are SQL programs that get generated from either a shell
   script, a JDBC/ODBC client, thick SQL clients, or Hue.
Moving certain Impala workloads from CDP to CDW has the following advantages:
Ability to scale out the Impala compute layer independently from the storage
     layer
Provides better isolation between workloads to prevent interference and maintain
     SLAs
Simplifies the management of Impala clusters, by not having you to focus on
     admission control and tuning configuration parameters
Automatic installation, setup, start-up, scale-up, and scale-down of workloads
     running on a Kubernetes backend
Ability to run different versions of Impala for different types of workloads (For
     example, operational reporting can remain locked on a given version, while data science users
     can always upgrade their Virtual Warehouses to the latest versions)
