Setting up access control lists
Several sources of information about setting up HDFS ACLS plus a brief Ranger overview
  and pointer to Ranger information prepare you to set up Hive authorization.
In CDP Private Cloud Base, HDFS supports POSIX ACLs (Access Control Lists) to assign permissions to users and groups.
   In lieu of Ranger policies, you use HDFS ACLs to check and make any necessary changes in HDFS
   permission changes. For more information, see HDFS ACLs, Apache Software Foundation HDFS
   Permissions Guide, and HDFS ACL Permissions. 
In Ranger, you give multiple groups and users specific permissions based on your use case. You
   apply permissions to a directory tree instead of dealing with individual files. For more
   information, see Authorizing Apache Hive Access.
If possible, you should use Ranger policies over HDFS ACLs to control HDFS access. Controlling
   HDFS access through Ranger provides a single, unified interface for understanding and managing
   your overall governance framework and policy design. If you need to mimic the legacy Sentry HDFS
   ACL Sync behavior for Hive and Impala tables, consider using Ranger RMS.
