Handling government regulations in ACID tables
Your decision to use ACID tables, or not, might depend on your need to conform to
  government regulations. With consumers right to be forgotten growing around the global, you need
  some way to purge these consumers from your datasets. ACID supports features to meet these
  regulations.
Meeting the following government requirements is often subject to interpretation, but involves
   deleting records of consumers who want to be forgotten on a web site. 
Europe - GDPR
California - California Consumer Privacy Act 2018
Before you propagate Hive data, you can check for requests to be forgotten and comply with
   requests. ACID supports deleting records. ACID completely removes data after a major compaction. 
ACID tables support delete operations on datasets using MERGE. Operations are atomic, and are
   built into an ACID table.
