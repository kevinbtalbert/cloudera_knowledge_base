Handling the Keyword APPLICATION
If you use the keyword APPLICATION in your queries, you might need to modify
 the queries to prevent failure. 
To prevent a query that uses a keyword from failing, enclose the query in backticks.
Before Upgrade to CDP
In CDH releases, such as CDH 5.13, queries that use the word APPLICATION in queries execute successfully. For example, you
   could use this word as a table name.
   > select f1, f2 from application
After Upgrade to CDP
A query that uses the keyword APPLICATION fails.
  
Action Required
Change applications. Enclose queries in backticks. SELECT field1, field2 FROM
    `application`;
