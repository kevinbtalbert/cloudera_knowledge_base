Casting invalid dates
Casting of an invalid date differs from Hive 1 in CDH 5 to Hive 3 in CDP.  Hive 3 uses a
  different parser formatter from the one used in Hive 1, which affects semantics. Hive 1 considers
  00 invalid for date fields. Hive 3 considers 00 valid for date fields. Neither Hive 1 nor Hive 3
  correctly handles invalid dates, and Hive-25056 addresses this issue.
Before Upgrade to CDP
Casting of invalid date (zero value in one or more of the 3 fields of date, month, year)
   returns a NULL value:
   SELECT CAST ('0000-00-00' as date) , CAST ('000-00-00 00:00:00' AS TIMESTAMP) ;
After Upgrade to CDP
Casting of an invalid date returns a result.

> SELECT CAST ('0000-00-00' as date) , CAST ('000-00-00 00:00:00' AS TIMESTAMP) ;
...
00002-11-30 00:00:00.0

Action Required
Do not cast invalid dates in Hive 3.
