Dropping partitions
The OFFLINE and NO_DROP keywords in the CASCADE clause for dropping partitions causes performance problems and is no longer supported.
Before Upgrade to CDP
You could use OFFLINE and NO_DROP keywords in  the DROP CASCADE clause to prevent partitions
   from being read or dropped.     
After Upgrade to CDP
OFFLINE and NO_DROP are not supported in the DROP CASCADE clause.       
Action Required
Change applications to remove OFFLINE and NO_DROP from the DROP CASCADE clause. Use
   an authorization scheme, such as Ranger, to prevent partitions from being dropped or read.
