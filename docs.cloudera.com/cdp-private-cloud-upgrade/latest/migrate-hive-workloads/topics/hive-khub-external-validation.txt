Validating external table replication
You need to validate external table replication before migration to CDP. You run the
        external table validation commands on the CDP cluster. 
You run the external table validation commands using the command syntax and options
            below: Command Syntax
hive --replMigration -dumpFilePath <path to external table info file>  \
[-dirLevelCheck] [-fileLevelCheck] [-verifyOpenFiles] [-verifyChecksum] [-filters] \
[-conf] [-queueSize] [-numThreads]
Options


-dumpFilePath: The fully qualified path to the external
                        table info file.


-dirLevelCheck: Validate at directory level.


-fileLevelCheck: Validate at file level.


 -verifyOpenFiles: Validate there are no open files on the
                        source path. Requires superuser privileges.


 -verifyChecksum: Whether the checksum needs to be validated
                        for each file. Cannot be used with -dirLevelCheck. Will fail if the source
                        and target are in different encryption zones or use different checksum
                        algorithms.


-filters: Comma separated list of filters, cannot be used
                        along with -dirLevelCheck.


-conf: Semi-Colon separated list of additional
                        configurations in key1=value1;key2=value2 format.


-queueSize: Queue size for the thread pool executor for
                        table level validation. Default: 200


-numThreads: Number of threads for thread pool executor for
                        table level validation. Default: 10


-checksumQueueSize: Queue size for the thread pool executor
                        for checksum computation. Default: 200


-checksumNumThreads: Number of threads for thread pool
                        executor for checksum computation. Default:5


Running the external table validation commands can take a significant amount of time,
                and writes to the HDP database can occur. You need to check the checkpoint ID again
                after validating external table replication to determine if any writes did indeed
                happen. To validate external table replication, perform the following
                steps:

In CDP, run the external table validation commands as described above.

If validation is successful, proceed to the next step; otherwise, complete the
                    replication.
External table validation fails if external data has not been fully replicated; another replication and verification cycle is required to sync the data.

On the HDP cluster backend RDBMS for Hive metastore (HMS), check that the checkpoint id has not changed since the last time you recorded it. For example: 
select NEXT_EVENT_ID - 1 as last_event_id from  NOTIFICATION_SEQUENCE;
Output looks something like this:

Based on your comparison of the last_event_id and the checkpoint ID, proceed in one of the following ways:
                

If the HDP last_event_id does not match the checkpoint id you recorded,
                        handle a failed verification.
If the HDP last_event_id does match the checkpoint id, the validation is
                        successful. Migrate users to CDP and enable background threads. You are
                        done.
