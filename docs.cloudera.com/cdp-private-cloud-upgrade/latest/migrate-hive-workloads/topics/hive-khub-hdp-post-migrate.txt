Enabling background threads after migration
Before replication, you disabled background threads from running on databases. After migration,
you need to enable background threads to run.

In the CDP cluster, run a query to enable background threads to run on a replicated database. 
alter database <dbName> set dbproperties(‘repl.target.for’=’’)

Repeat the last step on each replicated database to enable background threads
                    to run.

                   You can now stop using the HDP cluster and start working on the CDP cluster.
