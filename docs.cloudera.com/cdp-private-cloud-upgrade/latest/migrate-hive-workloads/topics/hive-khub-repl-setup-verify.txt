Setting up the HDP cluster
You set up the HDP cluster after replicating one or more databases before you can
        verify replication. Set up requires stopping jobs.
 Of course, before you can verify a replication, you must have completed one.
            The first cycle in replicating data is called the bootstrap, and the following cycles
            are called incremental replications. For each database, a completed replication consists
            of one bootstrap and at least one incremental replication cycle. 


Run at least one incremental replication for a databases before attempting
                    verification.
In the CDP cluster, find the dump directory path using the following query: 
select * from sys.replication_metrics 
where policy_name=‘<policy name>’ 
order by scheduled_execution_id desc limit 1; 



Find and copy the external table paths listed in the CDP dump directory path in
                        _file_list_external file. You will use these paths to set up Ranger
                        policies in Ambari. 



On the HDP source cluster, stop all ETL jobs.

In Ambari > Ranger Admin > Service Manager > Hive policies, add a Deny policy (no writes) for all users including ‘hive’ on all databases:
                        Database *, Table *, Hive column *
You need only one policy to deny any writes to managed tables or any access to any
                        external tables









In Ambari > Ranger Admin > Service Manager > HDFS policies, add a Ranger Deny policy for all external table paths. 

In Resource Path, paste the external table paths you copied from in the CDP dump directory
                        path in the _file_list_external file. 
You can add single or multiple policies for all the external table paths in all the
                        databases.
For example: 





Disable the StatsUpdaterThread background thread by configuring the
                        hive.metastore.stats.auto.analyze property to none.
                    

Disable the PartitionManagementTask background thread by configuring the metastore.partition.management.database.pattern property to ^*.
