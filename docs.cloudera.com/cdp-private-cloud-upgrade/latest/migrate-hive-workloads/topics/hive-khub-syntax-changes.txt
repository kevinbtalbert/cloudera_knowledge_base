Key syntax changes
You need to modify queries affected by changes to Hive syntax after upgrading to CDP.
  Hive has changed the syntax related to `db.table` references, such as CREATE TABLE
   `mydb.mytable` â€¦ . Other syntax changes involve the LOCATION clause in CREATE TABLE.
  Hive in CDP supports the enhancement to CREATE TABLE that adds the MANAGEDLOCATION
  clause.


Handling table reference syntaxFor ANSI SQL compliance, Hive 3.x rejects `db.table` in SQL queries as described by the   Hive-16907 bug fix. A dot (.) is not allowed in table names. As a Data Engineer, you need to   ensure that Hive tables do not contain these references before migrating the tables to CDP, that   scripts are changed to comply with the SQL standard references, and that users are aware of the   requirement. LOCATION and MANAGEDLOCATION clausesBefore upgrading, your Hive version might have supported using the LOCATION clause in     queries to create either managed or external tables or databases for managed and external     tables. After upgrading, Hive stores managed and external tables in separate HDFS locations.     CREATE TABLE limits the use of the LOCATION clause, and consequently requires a change to your     queries. Hive in CDP also supports a new location-related clause.Parent topic: Migrating Hive workloads from CDH
