Security tasks
After an in-place upgrade to CDP, as Administrator, you might need to perform a few
  security tasks, depending on the type of security you set up, Ranger or HDFS Access Control Lists
  (ACLs), as well as your data encryption requirements and use of clients to access
  Hive.


Making the Hive plugin for Ranger visibleAfter upgrading from HDP or CDH clusters to CDP, the Hive plugin for the Hive         Metastore and HiveServer2 appears in the Ranger Admin UI unless configuration property         problems due to upgrading exist. You can rectify the incorrect properties to fix the         problem. Configuring authorization to tablesAlthough the upgrade process makes no change to the location of external tables, you need         to set up access to external tables in HDFS. If you choose the recommended Ranger security model for     authorization, you need to set up policies and configure Hive metastore (HMS).Setting up access control listsSeveral sources of information about setting up HDFS ACLS plus a brief Ranger overview   and pointer to Ranger information prepare you to set up Hive authorization.Configure encryption zone security Under certain conditions, you as Administrator, need to perform a security-related         task to allow users to access to tables stored in encryption zones. You find out how to         prevent access problems to these tables.Configure edge nodes as gateways If you use command-line clients, such as Sqoop, to access Hive, you must configure         these gateways to use defaults for your service. You can accomplish this task in a few         steps.Configure HiveServer HTTP modeIf you use Knox, you might need to change the HTTP mode configuration. If you         installed Knox on CDP Private Cloud Base and want to proxy HiveServer         with Knox, you need to change the default HiveServer transport mode         (hive.server2.transport.mode).
