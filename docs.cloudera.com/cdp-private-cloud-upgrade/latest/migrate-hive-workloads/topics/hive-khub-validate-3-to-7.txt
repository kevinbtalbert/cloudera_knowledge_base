Verifying the Hive data replication from HDP 3.1.5 to 7.1.6
After replicating Hive databases from HDP 3.1.5 (with patches) to CDP 7.1.6 (with
    patches) you need to verify that the replication succeeded. After verification that databases on
    both clusters are in sync, you can stop running workloads on the HDP cluster and restart
    workloads on the CDP cluster.
 To verify the replication, follow steps to stop ETL jobs and set up Ranger policies on
      HDP. Disable HDP background threads, and get an event marker for validation later. Finally,
      you validate the replication, or handle possible replication failures. The following diagram
      shows the replication and verification process. 




Setting up the HDP clusterYou set up the HDP cluster after replicating one or more databases before you can         verify replication. Set up requires stopping jobs.Verifying replicationTo verify the replication, you get a checkpoint event id on the HDP cluster and the         last event id. Based on your comparison of the ids, you complete the verification, repeat         the verification, or re-replicate the data.Handing a failed verificationAlthough you stopped ETL jobs and set Ranger policies to prevent writes to databases,         a database write still might occur. This causes a verification failure. You need to find out         if such a write caused the failure.Validating external table replicationYou need to validate external table replication before migration to CDP. You run the         external table validation commands on the CDP cluster. Enabling background threads after migrationBefore replication, you disabled background threads from running on databases. After migration, you need to enable background threads to run.Parent topic: Replicating Hive data from HDP 3 to CDP
