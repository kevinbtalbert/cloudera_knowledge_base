Migration to CDP Private Cloud Base or CDP
  Public Cloud
If your Hive jobs are scheduled, or otherwise considered predictable, consider migrating
  to CDP Private Cloud Base or CDP Public Cloud and
  running your Hive workloads on Hive on Tez.
You learn why you should consider the predictability of your jobs when choosing a migration
   path from HDP 3 to CDP. If you were using LLAP on HDP, a path to CDP can offer equivalent
   performance and might make sense cost-wise.
LLAP is not supported in CDP Private Cloud Base
   and CDP Public Cloud, but Hive-on-Tez performs well for jobs that are not subjected to unexpected
   big spikes in demand that would require elasticity, such as rapid service scaling. Predictable
   jobs do not require the immediate deployment of extra resources to respond to unexpected traffic
   to your cluster. You do not need to shut down resources when traffic drops suddenly.
