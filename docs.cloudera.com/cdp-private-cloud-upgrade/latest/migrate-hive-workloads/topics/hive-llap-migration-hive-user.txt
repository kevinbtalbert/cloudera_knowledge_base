Migration paths for Hive users
If you are on HDP and executing Hive workloads in Hive LLAP mode and want to upgrade to
  CDP, you can follow the migration path that matches your use case.
Using LLAP is recommended for running complex ETL jobs that are unpredictable. LLAP is offered
   as part of Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) and is not available in CDP Public Cloud (Data Hub) and
    CDP Private Cloud Base. Using Hive on Tez (no
   LLAP) is recommended for running jobs that are scheduled and predictable. Hive on Tez is
   supported on CDP Public Cloud and CDP Private Cloud Base.
The following migration paths are recommended based on how predictable your jobs are and your
   workload type:
Migrate to CDP Public Cloud (Data Hub) or CDP Private Cloud Base — If your jobs are scheduled and predictable.
Migrate to Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW)  — If your jobs are unpredictable and if they could
     increase demand on compute resources.

The following diagram shows these recommended paths:


Migration to CDP Private Cloud Base or CDP Public CloudIf your Hive jobs are scheduled, or otherwise considered predictable, consider migrating   to CDP Private Cloud Base or CDP Public Cloud and   running your Hive workloads on Hive on Tez.Migration to Cloudera Data WarehouseIf your Hive jobs are unpredictable, consider migrating to Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW)   and running your Hive workloads on LLAP mode. LLAP offers ETL performance and scalability for   complex data warehousing jobs.Apache Tez processing of Hive jobsAfter migrating to CDP Private Cloud Base CDP Public Cloud, or Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), you must understand how the     Apache Tez execution engine is used to run your Hive workloads.Parent topic: Migration paths from HDP 3 to CDP for LLAP users
