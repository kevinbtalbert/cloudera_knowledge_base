Migration paths from HDP 3 to CDP for LLAP users
If you are running your Hive HDP 3.x workloads using LLAP (low-latency analytical
  processing), you need to decide on the best migration path to CDP without compromising on the
  performance offered by LLAP. Migration recommendations depend on a number of factors, such as your
  workload type and whether you have Hive or Spark users.

It is   recommended that you upgrade to CDP Private Cloud Base and choose either Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC) or native Spark readers to query Hive   from Spark.
