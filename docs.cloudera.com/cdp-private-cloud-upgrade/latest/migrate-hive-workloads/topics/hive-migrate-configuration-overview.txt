Hive Configuration Property ChangesYou need to know the property value changes made by the upgrade process as the change     might impact your work. You might need to consider reconfiguring property value defaults that     the upgrade changes.  Customizing critical Hive configurationsAs Administrator, you need property configuration guidelines. You need to know which   properties you need to reconfigure after upgrading. You must understand which the upgrade process   carries over from the old cluster to the new cluster. Setting Hive Configuration OverridesYou need to know how to configure the critical customizations that the upgrade         process does not preserve from your old Hive cluster. Referring to your records about your         old configuration, you follow steps to set at least six critical property values. Hive Configuration Requirements and RecommendationsYou need to set certain Hive and HiveServer (HS2) configuration properties after     upgrading. You review recommendations for setting up CDP Private Cloud Base for your needs, and understand which configurations remain unchanged after upgrading, which     impact performance, and default values.Configuring HMS for high availability To provide failover to a secondary Hive metastore if your primary instance goes         down, you need to know how to add a Metastore role in Cloudera Manager and configure a         property.Setting up Hive metastore for AtlasAs Administrator, you might plan to recommend Atlas for Hive metadata management and         data governance. You have to check that Hive metastore for Atlas is set up, so users can         build catalogs of data assets, classify, and govern the assets. If Atlas is not set up you         learn how to do so. This section is not applicable if you are upgrading to CDP Private Cloud         Base 7.1.7.Changing the Hive warehouse locationYou can change the location of the Hive warehouse by using the configuration settings in     your Cloudera Manager instance. Removing the LLAP QueueBefore upgrading from HDP to CDP, if you used LLAP, a YARN interactive query queue         was created. This queue is carried over to your CDP cluster. You must remove this queue,         likely named llap, after the upgrade. Parent topic: Migrating Hive workloads from CDHParent topic: Migrating Hive Workloads from HDP 2.6.5 after an in-place upgrade
