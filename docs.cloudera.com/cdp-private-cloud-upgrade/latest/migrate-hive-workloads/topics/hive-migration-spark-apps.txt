Preventing SparkSQL incompatibilityYou need to be aware of two SparkSQL incompatibilities and how to work around these         problems. The upgrade process converted all CDH Hive tables to external tables, however, if         you moved managed, non-ACID tables preventing conversion to external tables, these are not         compatible with native SparkSQL. Also, you might encounter a problem reading Hive 2 external         ORC tables from Spark.Spark integration with HiveYou need to know a little about Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC) and how to find more         information because to access Hive from Spark, you need to use HWC implicitly or explicitly. Removing Hive on Spark ConfigurationsYour scripts, or queries, include the Hive on Spark configuration, which is no longer         supported, and you must know how to recognize and remove these configurations.Parent topic: Migrating Hive workloads from CDHParent topic: Migrating Hive Workloads from HDP 2.6.5 after an in-place upgrade
