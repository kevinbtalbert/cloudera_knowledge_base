Configuring the CDP cluster
You need to take advantage of Hive scheduled queries to load replicated workloads
        from HDP onto CDP using the REPL LOAD command. In the event of replication process problems,
        scheduled query metrics help you troubleshoot. 
To perform Hive replication of external tables, add the hive user to the supergroup.

Run a scheduled query on the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster to create a
                    replication policy, using values for mandatory properties in the Mandatory CDP
                    policy-level properties table in the next topic.

create scheduled query repl_[***replication policy name***â€™
[***FREQ***] as REPL LOAD [***SOURCE DB NAME***] into [***TARGET DB
NAME***] with [***Configuration parameters in key value pairs
separated by comma***] executed as [***user_name***];



Ensure that the replication policy name is in repl_[***policy name***]
                            format. The scheduler is a generic scheduler in Hive and is used for
                                various purposes including replication. 
Make sure to filter the replication-related schedules.



Change the replication policy using the Hive statements in Supported Scheduled
                    Query Operations.


Related informationSupported scheduled query operationsMandatory CDP policy-level propertiesYou need to configure mandatory Hive policies on CDP before you load workload replicated data.     You learn what value to set for each property, whether or not you can specify property     configuration options in the REPL LOAD command, and if the property is modifiable with an alter query in the REPL LOAD command.Optional CDP policy-level propertiesYou must include the following list of optional policy-level configuration properties in   REPL LOAD command on the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster. Put the property after the WITH clause of   the command. Supported scheduled query operationsWhen you configure the CDP cluster, you can change the replication policy using the Hive   scheduled queries that CDP supports.Parent topic: Replicating Hive data from HDP 3 to CDP
