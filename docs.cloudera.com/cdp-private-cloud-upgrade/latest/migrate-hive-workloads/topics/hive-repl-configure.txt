Configuring the HDP cluster
You need to configure the HDP cluster before you dump workload data that you want to replicate on CDP.

            Prepare a cron script to set policies for chained REPL DUMP commands and to control execution, for example to run at a certain time. 
        

In new and existing databases, include the repl.source.for
                    property in the source database dbproperties file.
Set the repl.source.for property value using the following
                    format:
                    'repl.source.for' = [****policy1 name***, ****policy2 name***, ****policy3 name***]                                 

For example, to create a new source database for policies named 1, 2, and 3,
                        configure the source database properties file as follows:
â€˜repl.source.for' = '1, 2, 3'             
For example, to configure an existing source database named testdb, run the
                        following command:
ALTER DATABASE testdb SET
DBPROPERTIES('repl.source.for'=[****policy1 name, policy2 name,
policy3 name***]');                  


On the HDP cluster, configure the mandatory HDP cluster configuration
                    properties listed in the next topic.

Run the REPL DUMP command along the mandatory policy-level configuration
                    parameters using a cron script.
Use the following command syntax:
                    [***cron syntax for regular intervals***] beeline -u jdbc:hive2://[***source database***] hive
-e"repl dump [***source database***] with [***mandatory policy-level configuration
parameters separated by comma***]See

You need to set the values required for a successful     replication.

Put the property after the WITH clause of the command.Optional HDP policy-level propertiesYou must include optional policy-level configuration properties in REPL DUMP command on     the HDP cluster.
