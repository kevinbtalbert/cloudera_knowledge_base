Replicating Hive data
 You need to meet a few prerequisites to perform this type of replication, apply
        patches, and configure the HDP and CDP clusters for replication. From example replication
        commands, you see how to replicate your data. Finally, you follow a step-by-step
        verification procedure. 


Ensure that the HDP cluster can write to the CDP cluster. 
Set up a one-way trust between the clusters if they belong to different Kerberos Key
                     Distribution Centers (KDCs). 
To run the commands, log into beeline using kinit. 



Apply patches required on HDP.

Apply patches required on CDP.

Configure the clusters following step-by-step instructions.

Replicate Hive data as shown in example commands for replicating HDP 3
                    workloads.

Verify the Hive data replication.
