Changing incompatible column types
A default configuration change can cause applications that change column types to fail. 
Before Upgrade to CDP
In HDP 2.x and CDH 5.x and CDH 6
    hive.metastore.disallow.incompatible.col.type.changes is false by default to
   allow changes to incompatible column types. For example, you can change a STRING column to a
   column of an incompatible type, such as MAP<STRING, STRING>. No error occurs.
After Upgrade to CDP
In CDP, hive.metastore.disallow.incompatible.col.type.changes is true by
   default. Hive prevents changes to incompatible column types. Compatible column type changes, such
   as INT, STRING, BIGINT, are not blocked.
Action Required
Change applications to disallow incompatible column type changes to prevent possible
   data corruption. Check ALTER TABLE statements and change those that would fail due to
   incompatible column types.
