Migrating Oozie configurations to CDP
After you migrate the Oozie data to CDP, you must first configure Oozie, and then
    migrate custom ShareLib JARs to your new cluster.
You must configure Oozie to work with different CDP services including Sqoop actions, Yarn
   jobs, and HDFS HA. For information on configuring these services, see Configure Oozie. noteBy default, the Oozie service schedules an
    internal job to purge all the Oozie workflows older than 30 days from the database. However,
    actions associated with long-running coordinators do not purge until the coordinators complete.
    Cloudera recommends that you configure Oozie with an empty database for CDP. To view the old
    data, you can take a backup and run SQL queries on that data. You must recreate long-running
    coordinator jobs because the CDP environment is different from that of HDP and CDH.
After you configure Oozie, you must migrate the custom ShareLib JARs to the new
      cluster. Only the custom JARs and not the service and library JARs as those JARs are used by
      the components, will be present in Oozieâ€™s sharelib.
While upgrading from CDH and HDP, there might have been major third-party library
      version upgrades. If you have any custom JARs which include third-party libraries, then you
      have to rebuild those after you sync their versions with the library versions used in CDP.
      Otherwise, this can lead to runtime binary incompatibility. 
If you are upgrading from a stack where the components used Guava version 11 to a CDP
      version which uses Guava version 28, then you also need to update your custom application JAR
      to use Guava version 28.
