Migrating Oozie Shared Libraries
After you migrate the Oozie data to CDP, you must first configure Oozie, and then
  migrate custom ShareLib jars to your new cluster.
Copy the Oozie ShareLib jar from your HDP or CDH cluster:
     cp /user/oozie/share/lib/lib_{TIMESTAMP}/{COMPONENT}The
             location of the Oozie ShareLib is the same across the HDP, CDH, and CDP
             environments.Paste the ShareLib in the new file system of the CDP
             environment.paste /user/oozie/share/lib/lib_{TIMESTAMP}/{COMPONENT}noteThese
                 files must be present on the storage like HDFS, S3, and so on, and not on the hosts
                 where you installed Oozie.Run a ShareLib
             update:
oozie admin -oozie {OOZIE_URL} -sharelibupdate
After you migrate the custom ShareLib jars, update the workflow XML files for DFS paths, JDBC URLs (for example, Hive), and so on, to manage the new environment.
