Migrating Navigator content to Atlas
While upgrading from CDH to CDP Private Cloud Base, you can migrate the metadata from
        Navigator to Apache Atlas, for a scalable and robust infrastructure that supports enhanced
        metadata searchability by collecting metadata directly from your cluster. 
Cloudera Runtime 7.0.0 includes Apache Atlas to collect technical metadata from cluster
            services. Atlas replaces Cloudera Navigator Data Management for these clusters. Cloudera
            has incorporated many features from Navigator into Apache Atlas to make sure that the
            rich metadata collected in Navigator can be represented in Atlas. Atlas provides
            scalable and robust infrastructure that supports metadata searches and lineage across
            enterprise production clusters.

importantGovernance through Apache Atlas is just one element of a secure
                production cluster: Cloudera supports Atlas when it runs on a cluster where Kerberos
                is enabled to authenticate users. When upgrading from CDH to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.7
                and running Apache Atlas, the new cluster must have Kerberos enabled.

You may choose not to migrate Navigator content to Atlas: this document
            describes how to think about archiving your Navigator audit information and
            metadata.
Whether you choose to migrate Navigator contents to Atlas or not, you must know
            how to use Atlas to accomplish the tasks you are accustomed to performing in
            Navigator.
