Estimating migration time and resources required
You must plan your migration process by checking on the time and resources that are
        required.
While the cluster is starting up, you can plan for and start the migration
            process.

Inspect Navigator installation to determine the number of Navigator
                entities that will be migrationed. See Understanding migrated Navigator entites
Estimate the time and disk space required for each phase of the
                    migration.The following migration rates are approximate and depend on the
                    resources available on the Atlas host and other unknown factors. Note that the
                    number of entities actually imported may be considerably less than the number of
                    entities extracted. The migration process discards HDFS entities that are not
                    referenced by processes that are migrationed such as Hive, Impala, and
                    Spark).



Migration Phase
Migration Rate
Disk Space
Output File Size
Trial Data Points



Extraction
4 minutes / 1 million entities
100 MB / 1 million entities, less as volumes increase
65 MB / 1 million entities
10 million entities takes about 30 minutes; 256 million takes about
                            18 hours.


Transformation
1.5 minutes / 1 million entities
100 to 150 MB / 1 million entities, higher end of range with larger
                            volumes
150 MB / 1 million entities
10 million entities takes about 20 minutes; 256 million takes about 6
                            hours.


Import
35 minutes / 1 million migrated entities

10 million entities takes about 4 hours; 256 million takes about 6
                            days.
