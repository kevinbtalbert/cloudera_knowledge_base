Installing Atlas using the Cloudera Manager upgrade wizard
You can use the wizard in Cloudera Manager to upgrade from CDH to CDP Private Cloud
        Base, install Apache Atlas and its dependencies, and to generate customized commands to
        initiate the migration phases. 
This page describes the Cloudera Manager wizard steps that help you to set up Atlas and
            its service dependencies.

noteBefore you perform the upgrade process, note the following pertaining to Atlas
                operations.

When a cluster is upgraded from CDH 5 or CDH 6 to CDP 7.x, by default the
                atlas.metadata.namespace property is set to
                cm.
If a different namespace property needs to be set, for example: cluster1, the
            same needs to be set while running the nav2atlas script as
                "-clusterName '' parameter and also in the atlas-application
            properties in the upgrade wizard.
Post-upgrade, note that the different value "cluster1" is not automatically
            updated in Hooks for services like Hive, HBase, Impala, Spark, and Kafka. You must make
            sure that before you upgrade your cluster and after the services are installed, you must
            set the value "cluster1" for all the available services. And later complete the upgrade
            process.
As an example process, follow these steps if namespace other than default "cm"
            needs to be set:

Provide the namespace ("cluster1") in the transformation step of the
                Nav2Atlas script.
Add atlas.metadata.namespace =cluster1 in atlas-application
                    properties in the upgrade wizard for Atlas.
Open another tab of the Cloudera Manager while the upgrade process is in
                progress and add atlas.metadata.namespace =cluster1 in advanced
                configuration Safety Valve of atlas-application.properties for all
                the Hook services (Hive, HiveServer2 , Spark , HBase, Impala, and Kafka).
Perform all the other steps in the upgrade wizard and complete the
                upgrade.
Remove Atlas from the migration mode.

To return to the main wizard documentation, go to Upgrading a CDH 6 Cluster.
Follow instructions in the upgrade wizard "Install Services"
            section.
Atlas installation
Refer to Step 10: Run the Upgrade Cluster
                Wizard.

Enable Atlas install. If the CDH cluster being upgraded was running Navigator,
                    the upgrade wizard shows a note recommending that you enable Atlas in the new
                    cluster. Select the Install Atlas option.


Install Atlas dependencies.The wizard steps through the installation for
                        Atlas' dependencies, assuming these services have not already been included
                        in the installation:
ZooKeeper. Assign one or more hosts for the ZooKeeper
                            role.
HDFS. Already included in the installation.
Kafka. Select the optional dependency of HDFS. Atlas requires
                            configuring the Broker service only, not MirrorMaker, Connect, or
                            Gateway.
HBase. Atlas requires configuring HBase Master and
                            RegionServers only, not REST or Thrift Server. Assign a Master role on
                            at least one host. Assign RegionServers to all hosts.
Solr. Assign a host for the Solr Server role. Set the Java
                            Heap Size of Solr Server in Bytes property to 12 GB (to support the
                            migration operation).
For recommendations on where in the cluster to install the service
                        roles, see Runtime Cluster Hosts and Role
                            Assignments.
Click Add Atlas Service. The wizard steps through
                    choosing a host and setting migration details.

Set the host for the Atlas server roles and click Continue.
Tip: Remember this host because you need to
                                SSH to it later to trigger the content migration from Navigator.

The Atlas Migrate Navigator Data screen displays. This
                                    screen contains migration commands that are customized to your
                                    environment. When you fill in the output file paths, the command
                                    text changes to incorporate your settings. 
The Atlas Enable Migration Mode screen displays.
                                    Review the Atlas advanced configuration Safety Valve content and
                                    click Continue. After the migration is complete, you remove
                                    these settings manually to start Atlas.
The Atlas Review Changes screen displays. Review the
                                    configurations and make any necessary changes.You must provide a
                                    value for the following:
Admin Password – choose
                                            a password for the preconfigured admin user.
Atlas Max Heapsize –
                                            set the max heapsize to the default value by clicking
                                            the curved blue arrow. If you plan to migrate content
                                            from Cloudera Navigator to Atlas, consider setting the
                                            heapsize to 16 GB.






Click Continue.

noteTo complete the Navigator-to-Atlas migration outside of the CDP Runtime upgrade,
                see Migrating Navigator data using customized scripts.
The Cloudera Manager upgrade wizard continues with "Other Tasks" and
                "Inspector Checks" sections. The wizard steps for installing Atlas are complete at
                this point and you can continue to complete the CDP Runtime upgrade.
