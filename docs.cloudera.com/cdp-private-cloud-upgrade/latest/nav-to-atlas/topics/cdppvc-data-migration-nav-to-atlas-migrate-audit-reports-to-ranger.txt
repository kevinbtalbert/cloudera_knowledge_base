Migrate audit reports and processes to Ranger
In CDP, Ranger performs auditing against the data access policies defined for each
        service.
For example, if a Ranger policy allows only users from the Finance group to
            access a particular Hive database, Ranger audit information show when those users
            accessed the database successfully and when other users attempted to access the database
            and were denied. While the Ranger audit information are a significant subset of the
            audit information performed by Navigator, the format and content is different enough
            that Cloudera does not provide a migration path for Navigator audit information into the
            same repository as Ranger audit information.
When redirecting reports or processes to Ranger, you need to:


Identify the audited information: does an equivalent exist in Ranger?


Identify the method of accessing the audit data and map it to Ranger:
                    Did the reporting application use the Navigator API? Did it access archived data
                    or the Navigator audit database? Ranger provides an API to access audit
                    information; audit data is written to HDFS (under /ranger/audit/<component
                    name>). 30 days of audit records are indexed in Solr. The audit events are
                    stored in a JSON format. For details, see Managing Auditing with Ranger.
