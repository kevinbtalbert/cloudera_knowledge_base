Move Atlas out of migration mode
Once the installation is completed, you must move Atlas out of migration
        mode.



Atlas does not collect metadata from services running on the
                        cluster. The metadata remains in Kafka topics and collected later.

Atlas imports metadata when it finds a final transformation
                            file in the location you specified in Confirm the output file
                                location from the step "Click Add Atlas Service."



To move Atlas from migration mode into normal operation:


Open Cloudera Manager to the Atlas service.

Go to the Configuration tab.

Filter the list of properties by typing "Safety" in the
                    filter field.

Remove the migration-specific entries from the Atlas Server Advanced
                    Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for conf/atlas-application.properties

Remove the following properties:

Atlas.migration.data.filename
Atlas.migration.mode.batch.size
atlas.migration.mode.workers



Reset the Atlas Max Heapsize property back to the default value.






Click Save Changes.

Restart Atlas. Choose Action.

Restart.
