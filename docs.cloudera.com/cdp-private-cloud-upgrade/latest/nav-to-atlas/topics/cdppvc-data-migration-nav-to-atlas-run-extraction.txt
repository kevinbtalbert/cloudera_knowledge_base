Run the extraction
You can run the extraction in the background as soon as the CDP runtime parcel is
        deployed. To customize and run the extraction command

Go back to the editor where you saved the extraction commands, from Copy the extraction command text from
                    the step "Click Add Atlas Service."

Open a terminal window or command prompt where you have access to the
                    cluster.

Using the provided command, SSH into the Atlas host.

Make sure the JAVA_HOME variable is set; if it is not set, run the export
                    command pointing to the location of the JDK.

Customize the extraction command to include the Navigator admin user and
                    password.

Run the extraction command. When the extraction is complete, a status message
                    is displayed in the command output.

If Navigator is configured with TLS/SSL enabled, the
                            cnav script needs the following credential
                        information:

Truststore path
Truststore password
Keystore path
Keystore password



To make these parameters available, run the following commands
                        before running the cnav script:



export KEYSTORE_PATH=<keystore-path>; 
export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<keystore-password>;
export TRUSTSTORE_PATH=<truststore-path>; 
export TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD=<truststore-password>


For example, the command sequence might look similar to the following (line

                        readability):export KEYSTORE_PATH=/opt/cloudera/CMCA/trust-store/acme_truststore.jks; exportKEYSTORE_PASSWORD=Q01FAeH53dn1HLY74D68Kk1yMAQVGtOI_cLznArccid48DDzS0VXY-DWnzpz0Ug10BvikGMoovYaZT2EEEdBGgLPiDCRKHyzFExE3OITRGazjKPtZxAaXOUzgKMMmQQgJKw-5JW9I6WgLGBhCpKfBa7vP3z6PFtm6XfYB-o3R6qmcdzZLwslDIQ18mowuFV1ouQIzA;export

                            -c flag parameter in the
                            nav2atlas script represents the
                            Navigation Metadata Server (NMS) cluster name and
                            NOT the Cloudera Manager cluster name. You must
                        retrieve the value of -c from the Navigator UI to use
                        it while running the nav2atlas script.
