When Atlas starts up, it checks the output file location for a completed file from
        the transformation phase. When Atlas finds the completed file, it begins importing entities
        automatically. 

Open the Atlas UI.

You can open Atlas web UI from the Atlas service page in Cloudera
                        Manager.







Review the migration process in the Statistics page.
The normal Atlas UI does not appear in migration mode; instead you see the
                    Statistics page, which shows a real-time report of the number of entities,
                    classifications, and other metadata that have been created in Atlas.
