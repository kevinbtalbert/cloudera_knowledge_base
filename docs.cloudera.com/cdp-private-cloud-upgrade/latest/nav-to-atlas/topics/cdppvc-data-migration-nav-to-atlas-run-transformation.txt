Run the transformation
You can run the transformation in the background as soon as the extraction completes.
        To customize and run the transformation command:

Go back to the editor where you saved the transformation commands, from Copy the transformation command text
                    from the step Click Add Atlas Service.

(Optional) Open a terminal window or command prompt where you have access to
                    the cluster.

If needed, SSH into the Atlas host.

If needed, make sure the JAVA_HOME variable is set; if it is not set, run the
                    export command pointing to the location of the JDK.

Run the transformation command.
When the transformation is complete, you see a status message in the
                    command output.
