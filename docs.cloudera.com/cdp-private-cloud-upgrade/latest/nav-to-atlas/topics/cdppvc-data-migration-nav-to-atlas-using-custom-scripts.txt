Migrating Navigator data using customized scripts
You can run the customized scripts generated by the Cloudera Manager wizard to
        configure the Apache Atlas installation and start the Navigator to Atlas data migration
        process when you step into the CDP upgrade wizard. You can also run the migration scripts
        independently from the CDP upgrade.
The migration has three phases: extraction, transformation, and import. If you
            haven't already, estimate the time and resource requirements for the migration steps as
            described in Migration assumptions and prerequisites.

Run the extractionYou can run the extraction in the background as soon as the CDP runtime parcel is         deployed. To customize and run the extraction commandRun the transformationYou can run the transformation in the background as soon as the extraction completes.         To customize and run the transformation command:Run the importWhen Atlas starts up, it checks the output file location for a completed file from         the transformation phase. When Atlas finds the completed file, it begins importing entities         automatically. Validate the migrationTo verify that the migration is successful, use the Statistics page in Atlas to         compare the metadata in Navigator. Move Atlas out of migration modeOnce the installation is completed, you must move Atlas out of migration         mode.
