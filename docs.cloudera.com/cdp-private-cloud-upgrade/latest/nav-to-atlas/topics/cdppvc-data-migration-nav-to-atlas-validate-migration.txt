Validate the migration
To verify that the migration is successful, use the Statistics page in Atlas to
        compare the metadata in Navigator. 
In general, you must verify the following:


Count of migrated entities. Does the total number of imported entities
                    match what you expect from Navigator? Note that not all Navigator entities are
                    not migrated: HDFS entities are only migrated if they are referenced in Hive,
                    Impala, or Spark operations that are included in the migration cycle.


Count of managed metadata that became business metadata in Atlas.


Count of managed metadata assignments. Consider reproducing searches on
                    commonly used business metadata to validate that you see the same results in
                    each system.
