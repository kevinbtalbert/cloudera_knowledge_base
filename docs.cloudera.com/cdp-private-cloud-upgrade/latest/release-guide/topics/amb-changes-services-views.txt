Changes to Ambari and HDP services 
 Review the list of additional components that are added to your cluster, along with
        the deprecated services and views that are removed during the process of upgrading to Ambari
        7.1.x and HDP intermediate bits.
These services are removed automatically as part of the upgrade process. You  can  also  remove these services manually prior to the upgrade by following the steps below:

Log in to the Ambari UI.
Click the service you wish to remove.
From the Service Actions menu, click Delete Service.

caution


Druid is not supported on Ambari 7.1.1. Druid is supported from Ambari 7.1.2
                        version onwards. You can upgrade when Druid is available on CDP Private Cloud Base.


When you upgrade Ambari to a later version, Accumulo service is not supported
                        as Accumulo is not compatible with other components and cannot access the
                        data. Hence, you must delete Accumulo service when upgrading Ambari.



noteYou must remove Accumulo on the Ambari managed HDP cluster as the AM2CM tool does not transition the Accumulo component from HDP to CDP. However, you can add Accumulo as a service on the Cloudera manager managed CDP Private Cloud Base cluster. 
important

Upgrading from HDP 2.6.5.x to HDP intermediate bits does not support HDP Search
                    to Cloudera Search upgrade. 
LLAP is not supported in CDP Private Cloud Base. You can
                    move the LLAP workloads to CDW Public cloud or Private Cloud.
The Hive View and the Tez View (collectively known as Ambari Views) are
                    deprecated in CDP Private Cloud Base.
