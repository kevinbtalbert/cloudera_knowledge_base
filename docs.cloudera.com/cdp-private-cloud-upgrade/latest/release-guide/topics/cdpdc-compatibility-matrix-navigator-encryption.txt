Product Compatibility Matrix for Cloudera Navigator Encryption
Cloudera Navigator encryption comprises several components.See below for the individual compatibility
    matrices for each component.
Parent topic: Product Compatibility Matrices
Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server
Learn about the recommended hardware and supported distributions for Navigator Key Trustee Server.
Because of a change in the ports used by Key Trustee Server, Navigator
        Encrypt versions lower than 3.7 and Ranger KMS versions lower than
        5.4 are not supported in Key Trustee Server 5.4 and higher.
Key Trustee Server: Recommended Hardware and Supported
          Distributions
Recommended Hardware and Supported Distributions
Key Trustee Server must be installed on a dedicated server or virtual
          machine (VM) that is not used for any other purpose. The backing
          PostgreSQL database must be installed on the same host as the Key
          Trustee Server, and must not be shared with any other services. For
          high availability, the active and passive Key Trustee Servers must not
          share physical resources. 
The recommended minimum hardware specifications are as follows:

Processor: 1 GHz 64-bit quad core
Memory: 8 GB RAM
Storage: 20 GB on moderate- to high-performance disk drives

Cloudera Navigator Key HSM
Learn about the recommended hardware and supported distributions for Navigator Key HSM.
Cloudera Navigator Key HSM must be installed on the same host as Key Trustee Server.
        Although Key HSM is compatible across all versions of Key Trustee Server, Cloudera strongly
        recommends also upgrading Key HSM after you upgrade Key Trustee Server. See Installing Cloudera Navigator Key HSM and Upgrading Cloudera Navigator Key HSM for more
        information.
Key HSM: Recommended Hardware and Supported Distributions
The following are prerequisites for installing Navigator Key HSM:

Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or higher with Java Cryptography Extension
            (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files:
JCE for Java SE 8noteJDK 1.8u161 and higher enable unlimited strength
                  encryption by default, and do not require policy files.
OpenJDK 11noteThe Thales JCE libraries do not support Java 11, so running Key
                  HSM with Thales on OpenJDK 11 is unsupported.

A supported HSM device:
Thales (formerly Safenet) Luna

HSM firmware version: 6.2.1
HSM software version: 5.2.3-1


v7
HSM firmware version: 7.0.3
HSM software version: 7.2.0

HSM firmware version: 6.2.1
HSM software version: 8.0.1, 8.1.0, 8.7.0

Thales nSolo, nConnect
HSM firmware version: 11.4.0
Client software version: 2.28.9cam136
noteThales Key HSM is unsupported because the Thales client Java libraries do
                  not support Java 11.
AWS CloudHSM
Client software version: 1.1.1


Key Trustee Server 3.8 or higherimportantYou must
              install Key HSM on the same host as Key Trustee
            Server.

Root access is required to install Navigator Key HSM.

Cloudera Navigator Encrypt
Learn about the recommended hardware and supported distributions for Navigator
      Encrypt.
noteCloudera Enterprise, with the exception of
        Cloudera Navigator Encrypt, is supported on platforms with
        Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enabled and in
        enforcing mode. Cloudera is not responsible for policy
        support or policy enforcement. If you experience issues with SELinux,
        contact your OS provider.
Supported command-line interpreters:

sh (Bourne)
bash (Bash)
dash (Ubuntu)

noteNavigator Encrypt does not support installation
        or use in chroot environments.
Network Requirements
For new Navigator Key Trustee Server installations, Navigator Encrypt
          initiates TCP traffic over port 11371 (HTTPS) to the Key Trustee
          Server. 
For upgrades, Navigator Encrypt initiates TCP traffic over ports 80
          (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to the Navigator Key Trustee Server.

Internet Access
You must have an active connection to the Internet to download many
          package dependencies, unless you have internal repositories or mirrors
          containing the dependent packages.

Maintenance Window
Data is not accessible during the encryption process. Plan for system
          downtime during installation and configuration.

Administrative Access
To enforce a high level of security, all Navigator Encrypt commands
          require administrative (root) access (including installation and
          configuration). If you do not have administrative privileges on your
          server, contact your system administrator before proceeding.

Package Dependencies
Navigator Encrypt requires these packages, which are resolved by your
          distribution package manager during installation:

dkms
keyutils
ecryptfs-utils
libkeytrustee
navencrypt-kernel-module
openssl
lsof
gcc
cryptsetup

These packages may have other dependencies that are also resolved by
          your package manager. Installation works with gcc,
            gcc3, and gcc4.
