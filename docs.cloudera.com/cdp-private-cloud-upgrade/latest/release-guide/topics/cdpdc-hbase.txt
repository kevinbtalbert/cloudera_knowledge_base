Master


100-10,000 regions: 4 GB 
10,000 or more regions with 200 or more Region Servers: 8 GB
10,000 or more regions with 300 or more Region Servers: 12 GB

Set this value using the Java Heap Size of HBase Master in
                    Bytes HBase configuration property.

Minimum 4 dedicated cores. You can add more cores for larger clusters, when
                using replication, or for bulk loads. 
1 disk for local logs, which can be shared with the operating system and/or
                other Hadoop logs


Region Server


Minimum: 8 GB
Medium-scale production: 16 GB
Heap larger than 16 GB requires special Garbage Collection tuning. See
                      Configuring the HBase BlockCache. 

Set this value using the Java Heap Size of HBase RegionServer in
                    Bytes HBase configuration property.

Minimum: 4 dedicated cores


4 or more spindles for each HDFS DataNode
1 disk for local logs (this disk can be shared with the operating system
                    and/or other Hadoop logs




Thrift Server
1 GB - 4 GBSet this value using the Java Heap Size of HBase
                    Thrift Server in Bytes HBase configuration property.

Minimum 2 dedicated cores.
1 disk for local logs, which can be shared with the operating system and other
                Hadoop logs.


noteConsider adding more HBase Thrift Servers for production environments and deployments
        with a large number of Thrift client to scale horizontally.
