Minimum: 10 GB for the database, which grows
                     proportionally according to the cluster size and workloads.When Hue is configured for high availability, add space
                        is required for the /tmp (temporary) directory,
                        approximately 5GB.



The term "cluster size" refers to the number of nodes in the cluster. "Workload" in Hue
         means the number of queries run and the number of concurrent unique users using the
         application in a given period of time.
A minimum of 10GB is needed for the database. The Hive MetaStore service largely uses the
         database. The database grows in size quickly because of the query history that it retains.
         To optimize performance, you must regluarly cleanup old documents and queries.
noteHue is limited by cgroup settings. In Cloudera Manager, all memory soft/hard limits are
        set to -1.
