Supported JDKs 

Please see the Cloudera Support Matrix for
        detailed information about supported JDKs.

noteNote the following about OpenJDK support:
Updates above the minimum that are not listed are supported
                but not tested.  
Cloudera tests only the OpenJDK builds that are provided by
                each operating system, and only the versions listed in the
                support matrix. 


warning

Spark3 in CDE uses OpenJDK 11.0.17 which causes a Kerberos issue when deprecated
              3DES and RC4 permitted encryption types are used. Workaround: Remove the deprecated
                3DES and RC4 encryption types in the krb5.conf and
                  kdc.conf files. 

JDK 8u271, JDK 8u281, and JDK 8u291 may cause socket leak
                issues due to JDK-8245417 and JDK-8256818. Pay attention to the
                build version of your JDK because some later builds are fixed as
                described in JDK-8256818. 
Workaround: Consider using a more recent version of the JDK
                like 8u282, or builds of the JDK where the issue is fixed.

JDK 8u40, 8u45, and 8u60 are not supported due to JDK issues
              impacting CDH functionality:
JDK 8u40 and 8u45 are affected by JDK-8077155, which
                  affects HTTP authentication for certain web UIs.
JDK 8u60 is incompatible with the AWS SDK, and causes
                  problem with DistCP. For more information, see the KB article.

Oozie Workflow Graph
                Display in Hue does not work properly with JDK versions
              lower than 8u40.


important
For JDK 8u241 and higher versions running on Kerberized clusters,
            you must disable referrals by setting
              sun.security.krb5.disableReferrals=true. 
For example, with OpenJDK 1.8.0u242:

Open
                /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.242.b08-0.el7_7.x86_64/jre/lib/security/java.security
              with a text editor.
Add sun.security.krb5.disableReferrals=true (it
              can be at the bottom of the file).
Add this property on each node that has the impacted JDK
              version.
Restart the applications using the JDK so the change takes
              effect.

For more information, see the KB article.





Support Notes

noteCloudera strongly recommends installing Oracle JDK at
            /usr/java/<jdk-version> and
        OpenJDK at /usr/lib/jvm, which allows Cloudera Manager
        to auto-detect and use the correct JDK version. If you install the JDK
        anywhere else, there are additional steps required to configure Cloudera
        Manager with your chosen location. See Configuring a custom Java Home
          Location.
noteA Java optimization called compressed oops (ordinary object
        pointers) enables a 64-bit JVM to address heap sizes up to about 32 GB
        using 4-byte pointers. For larger heap sizes, 8-byte pointers are
        required. This means that a heap size slightly less than 32 GB can hold
        more objects than a heap size slightly more than 32 GB.If you do not
          need more than 32 GB heap, set your heap size to 31GB or less to avoid
          this issue. If you need 32 GB or more, set your heap size to 48 GB or
          higher to account for the larger pointers. In general, for heap sizes
          above 32 GB, multiply the amount of heap you need by 1.5.
Only 64 bit JDKs are supported. 
Unless specifically excluded, Cloudera supports later updates to a
        major JDK release from the release that support was introduced. Cloudera
        excludes or removes support for select Java updates when security is
        jeopardized.
Running Runtime nodes within the same cluster on different JDK releases
        is not supported. All cluster hosts must use the same JDK update
        level.
