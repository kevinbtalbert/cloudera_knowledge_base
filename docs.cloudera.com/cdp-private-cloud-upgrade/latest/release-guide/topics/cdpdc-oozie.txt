Oozie


Minimum: 1 GB (this is the default set by Cloudera Manager). This is
                    sufficient for less than 10 simultaneous workflows, without forking. 
If you notice excessive garbage collection, or out-of-memory errors, increase
                    the heap size to 4 GB for medium-size production clusters or to 8 GB for
                    large-size production clusters. 
 Set this value using the Java Heap Size of Oozie Server in
                      Bytes Oozie configuration property.

Additional tuning: 
For workloads with many coordinators that run with complex workflows (a
          max concurrency reached! warning appears in the log and the Oozie
          admin -queuedump command shows a large queue):
Increase the value of the
              oozie.service.CallableQueueService.callable.concurrency property to
            50.
Increase the value of the oozie.service.CallableQueueService.threads
            property to 200. 


Do not use a Derby database as a backend database for Oozie.
