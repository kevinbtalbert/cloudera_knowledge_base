Reports Manager

The Reports Manager fetches the fsimage from the NameNode at regular intervals. It reads
        the fsimage and creates a Lucene index for it. To improve the indexing performance, Cloudera
        recommends provisioning a host as powerful as possible and dedicating an SSD disk to the
        Reports Manager.

1 dedicated disk that is at least 20 times the size of the fsimage. Cloudera
                strongly recommends using SSD disks.
