CDH Component Changes in CDP Private Cloud Base 7.
Component Changes in CDP Private Cloud Base 7.0
Pig, Flume, Sentry, and Navigator have been removed.


Pig can be replaced with Hive or Spark.


Flume has been replaced with Cloudera Flow Management
            (CFM). CFM is a no-code data ingestion and management solution
            powered by Apache NiFi. Contact your Cloudera account team for more
            information about moving from Flume to CFM. 


Sentry has been replaced with Apache Ranger. A
            Sentry-to-Ranger policy migration tool is available for CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1 and migrations will
            be supported when Replication Manager is used to migrate Hive tables
            from CDH to CDP.


Navigator has been replaced with Apache Atlas. 

Cloudera Director is not supported with CDP Private Cloud Base.
MapReduce v1 was deprecated as of CDH 5.0 and is not supported in
          CDP.
          noteReplacements are not direct replacements and are only alternate product offerings. 


Component Changes in CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1


The YARN Fair Scheduler is being replaced with
            the YARN Capacity Scheduler. A
            migration tool will be provided to convert the Fair Scheduler
            configurations to Capacity Scheduler. 

The Sentry policy files feature option has been deprecated in CDH
          5.x and is entirely removed in CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1. Prior to an upgrade to
            CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1, the Sentry Service
          role must be set up and used for enforcing access policies over
          Hive/Solr. To migrate the existing Sentry Policy file configuration to
          a Sentry Service, see: Migrating from Sentry Policy Files to
            the Sentry Service .

Navigator has been replaced with Apache Atlas. 
Navigator lineage data can be transferred to Atlas as
            part of the CDH to CDP Private Cloud Base upgrade process.  Navigator audit
            data is not transferred to Atlas. 
When you upgrade a CDH cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base, the Navigator
            audits persist. However, services no longer produce audits for
            Navigator. You can continue to run Navigator to be able to access
            the audits. See Transitioning Navigator
              audits.
noteReplacements are not direct replacements and are only alternate product offerings. 

The following CDH components have been included in Cloudera Runtime
        for the first time in CDP Private Cloud Base
        7.1.1. 

Schema Registry
Streams Messaging Manager

Streams Replication
          Manager
 
Deprecated Items
A deprecated item is a feature, component, platform, or functionality
        that Cloudera is planning to remove in a future release. Cloudera
        supports items that are deprecated until they are removed, and the
        deprecation gives customers time to plan for removal.
The following table lists deprecated items:
