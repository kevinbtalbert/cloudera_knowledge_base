Cloudera Runtime Download Information
Important: Access to Cloudera Runtime parcels for production purposes requires
    authentication. To access the parcels at the locations below, you must first have an active
    subscription agreement and obtain a license key file along with the required authentication
    credentials (username and password). 
The license key file and authentication credentials are
      provided in an email sent to customer accounts from Cloudera when a new
      license is issued. If you have an existing license with a CDP Private Cloud Base Edition entitlement, you might
      not have received an email. In this instance you can identify the
      authentication credentials from the license key file. If you do not have
      access to the license key, contact your account representative to receive
      a copy.
To identify your authentication credentials using your license key file, complete the
      following steps:

From cloudera.com, log into the cloudera.com account associated with
        the CDP Private Cloud Base license and
        subscription agreement. 
On the CDP Private Cloud Base Download page, click
          Download Now and scroll down to the Credential
        Generator.
In the Generate Credentials text box, copy and paste the text of
        the “PGP Signed Message” within your license key file and click Get
          Credentials. The credentials generator returns your username and
        password.


importantMake a note of the authentication credentials. You might need them
        during installation to complete tasks such as configuring a remote parcel repository.

When you obtain your authentication credentials, use them to form the URL where you can
      access the Runtime repository in the Cloudera Archive. Cloudera Manager can also download the
      Runtime parcels directly during the installation process.
