ZooKeeper was not designed to be a low-latency service and does not
                  benefit from the use of SSD drives. The ZooKeeper access patterns – append-only
                  writes and sequential reads – were designed with spinning disks in mind. Therefore
                  Cloudera recommends using HDD drives.
