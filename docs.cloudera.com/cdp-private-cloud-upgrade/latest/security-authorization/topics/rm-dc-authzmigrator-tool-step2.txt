Ingesting permissions into Ranger
After you run the authzmigrator tool to export the permissions on the source cluster,
        ingest them into the Ranger service on the target cluster.
To ingest the permissions in the
                /opt/backup/permissions.json file, perform the following
            steps:

In the target cluster, copy the
                        /opt/backup/permissions.json file to the
                        /user/sentry/export-permissions/permissions.json HDFS
                    location.

Make sure the user ranger has read-write permissions on
                    the file. To set the read-write permissions for the
                        ranger user, run the following command:
hdfs dfs -setfacl -m -R user:ranger:rwx
                        /user/sentry/export-permissions/permissions.json

Log in to Cloudera Manager.

In the Ranger service, click Actions > Import Sentry permissions.

The Ranger service ingests the permissions present in the
                            /user/sentry/export-permissions/permissions.json
                        file. You can view the permissions in the Ranger Admin UI.
