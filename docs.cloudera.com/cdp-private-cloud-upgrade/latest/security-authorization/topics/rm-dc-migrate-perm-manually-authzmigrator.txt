Migrate permissions manually using the authzmigrator tool
To migrate Hive object and URL permissions and Kafka permissions from CDH to CDP Private Cloud Base, you can use the authzmigrator tool. The tool
        exports the Hive/Impala and Kafka RBAC Sentry permissions in the CDH cluster to a JSON file,
        and then converts and ingests it into Ranger in the CDP Private Cloud Base 7 cluster. You
        must migrate Solr permissions manually from the CDH cluster to the CDP Private Cloud Base 7 cluster.
You can use one of the following methods to upgrade a CDH cluster to a CDP cluster and to
            migrate the Sentry permissions in CDH to Ranger in CDP:

Upgrade wizard - You export the permissions in the CDH cluster and after the
                in-place upgrade completes, you import the permissions into Ranger. 
Side-by-side migration (side-car migration) - You bring up a second environment that
                is a CDP environment. You then move all the data and metadata to this new
                environment. You can either use the authzmigrator tool to migrate Hive object and
                URL permissions and Kafka permissions to Ranger or run a Hive replication policy in
                the Replication Manager to migrate the Hive object and URL permissions to Ranger.
