Consolidating policies created by Authzmigrator
Before migrating/importing Sentry permission into Ranger policies, add the
      authorization.migration.skip.owner.policy = true configuration in
      authorization-migration-site.xml. 
Migrating Sentry - Ranger with Ownership Feature Enabled


Scenario:

Ownership feature enabled in Sentry. After enabling ownership feature, Sentry would
                have owner permission for all the databases/tables created after enabling this
                feature.

Case:

Bob created 1000 tables tab1, tab2, tab2 ... tab1000 under database demoDB.
Since ownership feature enabled, Sentry will have OWNER-MAPPING.
After migration from Sentry to Ranger using Authzmigrator tool Ranger will have
                1000 OWNER policies for each mapping in sentry. However, Ranger already has default
                OWNER policies. There is no need to have individual table level OWNER policies.
                These 1000 policies will be hard to administer from the Ranger UI.




Skipping OWNER policy creation for each every OWNER-MAPPING in Sentry.
Add authorization.migration.skip.owner.policy = true to
          authorization-migration-site.xml to avoid creating so many policies
        in Ranger during migration. note Beginning in 7.1.7 sp2, you can
          enable / alter the value for the
            authorization.migration.skip.owner.policy property from
            Cloudera Manager, during install.

<property>
        <name>authorization.migration.skip.owner.policy</name>
        <value>true</value>
        </property>
