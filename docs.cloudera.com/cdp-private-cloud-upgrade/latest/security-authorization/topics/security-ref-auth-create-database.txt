Ranger policies allowing create privilege for Hadoop_SQL databases
Users with authorized access through Ranger policies in Hadoop SQL with at least one
        of the following permissions can create databases.

In CDP, an authorized user can create Hadoop_SQL databases with or without specifying
                location. If you do not specify location, then the database is created in the
                default HDFS location used by Hadoop_SQL. If you specify location, then the database
                is created in the HDFS location you specify.
A user creating databases with location clauses requires one of the
                        following additional access:
direct read and write access to the HDFS location

a Ranger Hadoop_SQL URL policy that provides the user
                                    all permissions on the HDFS location


A hive user creating databases with location clauses must have all
                        permissions on the HDFS location using one of the following:
an appropriate HDFS POSIX permission
HDFS ACL
HDFS Ranger policynote If you choose to use
                                an HDFS Ranger policy for this purpose, make sure to refer to
                                the HDFS location in the Ranger policy using a path, such as:
                                /databases/sample/username, not a URL,
                                such as:
                                hdfs://nameservice1/databases/sample/username
                                .

note

For use-cases where only create access is provided
                        and drop access is not provided explicitly, the user
                        might implicitly get a few other permissions through the default policies
                        added (unless the default policies are modified).
The default all database and all database,
                            table policy usually would list {OWNER} as an authorized
                        user.
Removing {OWNER} from these default policies would restrict access to users
                        with specific permissions listed explicitly in policies. Removing {OWNER} is
                        not recommended. Proceed with caution when considering such an action.
