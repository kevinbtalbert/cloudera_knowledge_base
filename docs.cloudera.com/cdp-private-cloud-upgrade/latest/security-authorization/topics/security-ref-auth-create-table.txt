Ranger policies allowing create privilege for Hadoop_SQL tables
Users with authorized access through Ranger policies in Hadoop SQL with at least one
        of the following permissions can create extermal or managed tables on the corresponding
        database(s) listed in the policy.



A user creating external tables with location clauses requires one of the
                        following additional access:
direct read and write access to the HDFS location

a Ranger Hadoop_SQL URL policy that provides the user
                                        read and write
                                    permissions on the HDFS location


A user creating external tables with location clauses must have
                            read and write permissions
                        on the HDFS location using one of the following:
an appropriate HDFS POSIX permission
HDFS ACL
HDFS Ranger policynote If you choose to use
                                    an HDFS Ranger policy for this purpose, make sure to refer to
                                    the HDFS location in the Ranger policy using a path, such as:
                                        /databases/sample/username, not a URL,
                                    such as:
                                        hdfs://nameservice1/databases/sample/username
                                    .  Make sure that the URL defined in Ranger does not have a
                                    trailing /.

note

For use-cases where only create access is provided
                        and drop access is not provided explicitly, the user
                        might implicitly get a few other permissions through the default policies
                        added (unless the default policies are modified).
The default all database and all database,
                            table policy usually would list {OWNER} as an authorized
                        user.
For these use-cases where only permissions were provided at the database and
                        udf levels, the user may still be able to create tables due to the reasons
                        specified above.
Removing {OWNER} from these default policies would restrict access to users
                        with specific permissions listed explicitly in policies. Removing {OWNER} is
                        not recommended. Proceed with caution when considering such an action.
Any managed table creation using an external location would fail with the
                        following error: A managed table's location should be located
                            within managed warehouse root directory or within its database's
                            managedLocationUri.
