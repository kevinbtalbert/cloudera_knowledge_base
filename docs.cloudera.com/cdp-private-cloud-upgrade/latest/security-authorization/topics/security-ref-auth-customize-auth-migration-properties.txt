Customizing authorization-migration-site.xml
You can customize the default behavior of the Sentry to Ranger policy migration,
        using a safety valve in Cloudera Manager.

Ranger configurations now expose a safety-valve for authorization-migration-site.xml
                to allow users to customize properties that control migration of policies from
                Sentry to Ranger. Ranger embeds a default set of configurations in
                    authorization-migration-site.xml, for example, in Ranger
                7.1.7:authorization.migration.export.output_file = hdfs:///user/sentry/export-permissions/permissions.json
authorization.migration.ingest.is_dry_run = false
authorization.migration.role.permissions = true
authorization.migration.translate.url.privileges = false
authorization.migration.ingest.merge.ifexists = true
authorization.migration.export.target_services = HIVE,KAFKA
authorization.migration.migrate.url.privileges = true
authorization.migration.export.migration_objects = ""
authorization.migration.object.filter = ""
  You can now customize these configurations, using the  Ranger Admin
                    Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                    conf/authorization-migration-site.xml "safety valve" in Cloudera
                Manager. 
For example, setting the values of the following properties is required to update the
                location prefix in all URI privileges during the import:
authorization.migration.translate.url.privileges = true
authorization.migration.destination.location.prefix = hdfs://<new_cdp_nameservice>
To customize properties:


In Cloudera Manager > Configuration > Search type authorization-migration-site.xml,
                    then click Search.

In Ranger-1 > Ranger Admin Default Group, click
                        +(Add).

In Name, type a property name, such as
                        authorization.migration.translate.url.privileges.

In Value, type a property value, such as
                        true.

Click Save Changes.

Repeat steps 2-5 for each property that you want to customize.

Each property/value pair that you save adds a property or overwrites the default
            value assigned to that property in
                authorization-migration-site.xml.
