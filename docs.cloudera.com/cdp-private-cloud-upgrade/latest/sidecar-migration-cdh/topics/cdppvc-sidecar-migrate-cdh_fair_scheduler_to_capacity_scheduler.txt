YARN Fair Scheduler to Capacity Scheduler Sidecar migration from CDH to
    CDP
The YARN Fair Scheduler is not supported in CDP. You must migrate to
    use the Capacity Scheduler. 
Cloudera provides a tool to convert the Fair Scheduler into a
      Capacity Scheduler configuration. However, the features of Capacity
      Scheduler are not the same as the features of Fair Scheduler. Hence, the
      conversion utility cannot convert every Fair Scheduler configuration into
      a Capacity Scheduler configuration. After the automatic conversion and
      once the migration is completed, you must manually tune the scheduler
      configurations to ensure that the resulting scheduling configuration fits
      your organizationâ€™s internal goals and SLAs.
For a complete description of the process, and to learn more
      about the differences between Fair Scheduler and Capacity Scheduler, see

For the steps required to run the conversion utility (called
        fs2cs), see Converting Fair Scheduler to Capacity
        Scheduler using the fs2cs conversion utility
