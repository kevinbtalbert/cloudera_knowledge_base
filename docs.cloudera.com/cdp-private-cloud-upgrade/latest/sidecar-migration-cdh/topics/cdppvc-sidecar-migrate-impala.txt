Impala Sidecar migration to CDP
Side-car migration mechanism is best employed when you may have
    tighter service-level agreements that preclude an extended, multi-hour
    downtime for your workloads. This process aims to minimize downtime on
    individual workloads while providing a straightforward roll-back mechanism
    on a per-workload basis.
