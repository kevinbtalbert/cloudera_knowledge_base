Navigator to Atlas Sidecar migration from CDH to CDP
To migrate from Navigator to Apache Atlas, you can extract metadata
    from the source cluster and then transform and import the metadata on the
    destination cluster. 
You can migrate your business metadata such as tags, custom
      properties (definitions and entity assignments), Managed metadata
      properties (definitions and entity assignments), original and updated
      entity names and descriptions. 
You can also migrate technical metadata from Hive, Impala,
      Spark, and Referenced HDFS or S3.
Navigator audit data is not migrated to Atlas. You can,
      however, archive the Navigator audits on the original cluster, and Atlas
      will begin collecting audit data on the new cluster. See Transitioning Navigator
        audits.
Entity metadata from unreferenced S3 and HDFS entities, and
      metadata for Sqoop, Pig, MapReduce, Oozie, and YARN, Navigator policies,
      Navigator configuration settings are not transitioned to Atlas. 
To migrate the technical and business Navigator metadata, you
      run a command-line tool on the destination= cluster, pointing it to the
      source cluster that extracts the metadata from Navigator and then run
      another tool to convert the extracted data for use in Atlas. 

If Navigator is configured with TLS/SSL, run the following
        commands on the destination
        cluster:export KEYSTORE_PATH=<keystore-path-on-source-cluster>; 
export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<keystore-password-on-source-cluster>;
export TRUSTSTORE_PATH=<truststore-path-on-source-cluster>; 
export TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD=<truststore-password-on-source-cluster>
Extract ​​Cloudera Navigator data:
Log in to the Cloudera Manager server host on the
            destination cluster.
Ensure that the JAVA_HOME environment
            variable points to the JDK used by the host. 
Open the following file in a text editor:
            /opt/cloudera/cm-agent/service/navigator/cnav.sh
Run the the cnav.sh script using the following
            options:/opt/cloudera/cm-agent/service/navigator/cnav.sh 
-n <URL of Navigator server on source cluster>:7187 
-u <Navigator username> 
-p <Navigator Password> 
-c <cluster name> 
-o <path to output file>  


Transform the metadata:
On the Cloudera Manager server, run the following command:
          /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/atlas/tools/nav2atlas/nav2atlas.sh 
-f <output file name used in cnav.sh>
-o  ‘/tmp/nav/nav2atlas/[***clustername***]_atlas_data.zip’ clusterName ‘[***clustername***]’


Start the Atlas service. 
Atlas will automatically begin to import the entities.
