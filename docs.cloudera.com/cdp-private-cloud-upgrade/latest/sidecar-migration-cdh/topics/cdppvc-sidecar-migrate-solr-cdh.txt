Migrating from CDH 5

Copy and re-index the data: 
Use Replication Manager in Cloudera Manager to copy
                all of the data you are indexing from the source to the
                destination cluster. See Use Replication Manager to
                  migrate to CDP Private Cloud Base. 
Re-index your collections. See Reindexing Solr
                  collections.




Migrating from CDH 6

The indexes used by Solr 7 in CDH 6 are compatible with Solr 8
        that is included with CDP. In most cases, you can simply copy the data
        and indexes from the source cluster to the destination cluster . If you
        use the MRIT indexer to index your data, this will fail and you will
        need to recreate the indexes on the destination cluster. See Reindexing Solr
        collections.
