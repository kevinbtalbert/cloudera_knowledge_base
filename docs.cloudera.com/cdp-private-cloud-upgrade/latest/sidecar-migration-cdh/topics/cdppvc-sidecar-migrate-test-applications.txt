Testing applications 
After your data, configuration, and workloads are migrated to the
    destination cluster, you should thoroughly test your applications before
    moving the cluster to production.
Testing your applications has several primary goals:
Ensure that your application code has been properly updated to use
          any new APIs in the services. 
Ensure that you compile your applications using the Maven artifacts for the new
          version of CDP Private Cloud Base. 
Ensure that your applications and queries return the expected
          results. 
Ensure that your applications perform as well or better than how
          they performed on the source cluster. You can use Cloudera Workload XM to
          analyze the performance on the source cluster, and then compare those
          results with a similar analysis on the destination cluster. 

Once testing is complete and the cluster is performing as expected, you
      can move the destination cluster into production and decommission the
      source cluster.
