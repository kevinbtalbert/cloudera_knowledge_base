Atlas Sidecar migration from HDP to CDP
You can manually migrate Atlas from HDP to CDP. 
You must manually migrate tags and metadata configurations to
      the destination cluster. Apache Atlas will start to collect lineage
      information in the destination cluster. Lineage for the source cluster
      remains only in the Atlas instance deployed in the source cluster. 
Cloudera Professional Services can assist you with planning
      your Atlas migration.
