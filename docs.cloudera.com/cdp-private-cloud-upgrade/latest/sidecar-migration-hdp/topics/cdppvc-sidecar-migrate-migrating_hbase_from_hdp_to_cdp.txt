HBase Sidecar migration from HDP to CDP
You can use HBase replication and snapshots to migrate HBase tables
    to the destination cluster. 

 Prepare for the migration. Learn about changes in HBase and
        what actions you need to take before migrating your data. See Preparing for data migration. 
 Use the HBase shell on the source cluster to take a
        snapshot of all tables you want to migrate to the destination cluster
        and then export the snapshots to the destination. See: Using Snapshots (HDP 2) or Using Snapshots in HBase (HDP 3)
        


        Export
        the snapshots to the destination cluster. See: Using Snapshots (HDP 2)
Using Snapshots in HBase (HDP 3)
        

 Import the snapshot on the destination cluster by running
        the following command in the HBase shell:
        restore_snapshot <snapshot name> 
If
        you are migrating from HDP 2, you may need to update your client
        application code. See Known Incompatibilities when Upgrading
          from CDH and HDP.
Review the following topics for details for additional
        incompatibilities with HDP 2:
Remove PREFIX_TREE Data Block
              Encoding

Validate HFiles
Check co-processor
            classes

 Verify and validate the migrated data on the destination
        cluster. See Verifying and validating if your data
          is migrated

 Test your applications or queries. 
 When you have verified and tested your application code and
        are ready to move the applications to production, repeat the above steps
        to synchronize the HBase data with the source cluster. You can use
          the Hash Table and Sync Table tool to synchronize table data. This
          tool can help improve performance when synchronizing large tables. See
            Use HashTable and SyncTable
            Tool.
