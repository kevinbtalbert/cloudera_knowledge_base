Browsing HDFS directories
You can browse through the HDFS directories to select the right cluster.
To browse the HDFS directories to view snapshot activity, go to the Cloudera Manager > HDFS service > File Browser tab.
 As you browse the directory structure of your HDFS, basic information (owner, group, and
      so on) about the directory you have selected appears.
