Configuring a peer to use in replication policy
Before you replicate data from source cluster to destination cluster, you must connect
    the Cloudera Manager with the peer and then test the connectivity.

If your cluster uses SAML Authentication, see Configuring peers with SAML authentication before configuring a
        peer.


Go to the Cloudera Manager > Replication > Peers page. 
If there are no existing peers, Add Peer appears along with a
          short message. If peers already exist, they appear in the Peers list.






Click Add Peer.

In the Add Peer dialog box, provide a name, the peer URL
          (including the port) of the Cloudera Manager Server source for the data to be replicated,
          and the login credentials for that server.

importantThe role assigned to the login on the source server must be either
            a User Administrator or a Full Administrator.

Cloudera recommends that TLS/SSL be used. A warning is shown if the URL scheme is http
          instead of https. After configuring both peers to use TLS/SSL, add the remote source
          Cloudera Manager TLS/SSL certificate to the local Cloudera Manager truststore, and vice
            versa.importantWhen Cloudera Manager is configured
            with Knox and the source and target clusters are Knox-SSO enabled, you must ensure that
            you use the Cloudera Manager port in the peer URL when you add the source and target
            clusters as peers.

Click Add to create the peer relationship.

The peer is added to the Peers list. Cloudera Manager
      automatically tests the connection between the Cloudera Manager Server and the peer. You can
      also click Test Connectivity to test the connection. Test Connectivity also tests the Kerberos
      configuration for the clusters.
