Configuring peers with SAML authentication
If your cluster uses SAML Authentication, you can create a Cloudera Manager user
        account that has the User Administrator or Full Administrator role before you create a
        peer.

Create a Cloudera Manager user account that has
                    the User Administrator or Full Administrator role. 
You can also use an existing user that has one of these roles. Since you use
                    this user to create the peer relationship, you can delete the user account after
                    you add the peer.

Create or modify the peer.
Optional: 
Delete the Cloudera Manager user account that was just
                    created.
