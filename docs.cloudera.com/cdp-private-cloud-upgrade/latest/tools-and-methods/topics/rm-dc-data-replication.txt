Prepare to replicate using replication policies
Before you use Replication Manager, you must understand some of the requirements about
    data replication and configure the parameters as necessary.
Cloudera license requirements for Replication ManagerYou must have the necessary licenses to perform your tasks in Replication         Manager.Configuring SSL/TLS certificate exchange between two Cloudera Manager instancesYou must manually set up an SSL/TLS certificate exchange between two Cloudera Manager         instances that manage source and target cluster respectively. Replication Manager uses this         information to set up the peers for secure data replication.Add source cluster as peer to use in replication policiesYou must assign the source cluster as a peer to replicate the data. The Cloudera     Manager Server that you are logged into is the destination for replications set up using that     Cloudera Manager instance. From the Admin Console of this destination Cloudera Manager instance,     you can designate a peer Cloudera Manager Server as a source of HDFS and Hive data for     replication.Enabling replication between clusters with Kerberos authenticationTo enable replication between clusters, additional setup steps are required to ensure     that the source and destination clusters can communicate.Replicating from unsecure to secure clustersYou can use Replication Manager to replicate data from an unsecure cluster, one that     does not use Kerberos authentication, to a secure cluster, a cluster that uses Kerberos. Note     that the reverse is not true.Replication of encrypted dataHDFS supports encryption of data at rest including data accessed through Hive. This     topic describes how replication works within and between encryption zones and how to configure     replication to avoid failures due to encryption. Configuring heap size to replicate large directories using replication policiesBefore you replicate the data in directories that has thousands of files and     subdirectories, increase the heap size in the hadoop-env.sh     file.Retaining logs for Replication ManagerBy default, Cloudera Manager retains Replication Manager logs for 90 days. You can         change the number of days Cloudera Manager retains logs or disable log retention         completely.Parent topic: Use Replication Manager to migrate to CDP Private Cloud Base
