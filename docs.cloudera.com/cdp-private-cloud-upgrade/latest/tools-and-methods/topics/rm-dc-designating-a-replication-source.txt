Add source cluster as peer to use in replication policies
You must assign the source cluster as a peer to replicate the data. The Cloudera
    Manager Server that you are logged into is the destination for replications set up using that
    Cloudera Manager instance. From the Admin Console of this destination Cloudera Manager instance,
    you can designate a peer Cloudera Manager Server as a source of HDFS and Hive data for
    replication.
Minimum Required Role:  Cluster Administrator  (also
      provided by Full Administrator).

Configuring a peer to use in replication policyBefore you replicate data from source cluster to destination cluster, you must connect     the Cloudera Manager with the peer and then test the connectivity.Modifying peers to use in replication policyAfter you add a replication source as a peer, you can modify or delete the peers as     required.Configuring peers with SAML authenticationIf your cluster uses SAML Authentication, you can create a Cloudera Manager user         account that has the User Administrator or Full Administrator role before you create a         peer.Parent topic: Prepare to replicate using replication policies
