 Prepare clusters with Kerberos authentication for replication
Before you create replication policies between clusters that use Kerberos
    authentication to replicate HDFS, Hive, or Impala data, you must prepare the source and
    destination clusters.

On the hosts in the destination cluster, ensure that the
            krb5.conf file (typically located at
            /etc/kbr5.conf) on each host has the following
            information:
The KDC information for the source cluster's Kerberos
              realm. For
              example:[realms]
 SRC.EXAMPLE.COM = {
  kdc = kdc01.src.example.com:88
  admin_server = kdc01.example.com:749
  default_domain = src.example.com
 }
 DST.EXAMPLE.COM = {
  kdc = kdc01.dst.example.com:88
  admin_server = kdc01.dst.example.com:749
  default_domain = dst.example.com
 }
Realm mapping for the source cluster domain. You configure these mappings in
            the [domain_realm] section. For example:
              [domain_realm]
 .dst.example.com = DST.EXAMPLE.COM
 dst.example.com = DST.EXAMPLE.COM
 .src.example.com = SRC.EXAMPLE.COM
 src.example.com = SRC.EXAMPLE.COMnoteIf you have a scenario where the hostname(s) are inconsistent, you must
              navigate to Cloudera
                ManagerHostAll Hosts and
              ensure that all those hosts are covered in a similar manner as seen in
                domain_realm section.

On the destination cluster, use Cloudera Manager to add the
          realm of the source cluster to the Trusted Kerberos
            Realms configuration property:
Go to the HDFS Service. 
Click the Configuration tab.
In the search field type Trusted Kerberos to
              find the Trusted Kerberos Realms
              property.
Click the plus sign icon, and then enter the source
              cluster realm.
Enter a Reason for
            change, and then click Save
            Changes to commit the changes.

Go to
              Administration > Settings.
In the search field, type domain name. 
In the Domain Name(s) field, enter any domain
          or host names you want to map to the destination cluster KDC. Use the
          plus sign icon to add as many entries as you need. The entries in this
          property are used to generate the domain_realm
          section in krb5.conf.
If domain_realm is configured in the Advanced Configuration
            Snippet (Safety Valve) for remaining krb5.conf, remove the entries for
          it.
Enter a Reason for
            change, and then click Save
            Changes to commit the changes.
