Hive replication policy considerations
Before you create a Hive replication policy, you must consider when to specify the
        hosts to improve performance, understand how DDL commands affect Hive tables during
        replication, how to disable parameter replication in Cloudera Manager, and the additional
        properties to configure for Hive replication in dynamic environments.
Specifying hosts to improve Hive replication policy performanceWhen your cluster has Hive clients installed on hosts with limited resources and the     Hive/Impala replication policies use these hosts to run commands for the replication, the     replication job performance might degrade. To improve the replication job performance, you can     specify the hosts to use during replication so that the lower-resource hosts are not     used.Understanding how DDL commands affect Hive tables during replicationBefore you create Hive replication policies, you must understand how DDL commands     affect the Hive tables during replication. Disabling replication of parameters during Hive replicationParameters of databases, tables, partitions, and indexes are replicated by default     during Hive/Impala replications. You can disable the replication of parameters during Hive     replication in Cloudera Manager.Accommodate HMS changes for Hive replication policiesTo use Replication Manager for Hive replication in environments where the Hive     Metastore (HMS) changes often, such as when a database or table gets created or deleted, you     must configure additional properties to accommodate the changes.Parent topic: Hive external table replication policies
