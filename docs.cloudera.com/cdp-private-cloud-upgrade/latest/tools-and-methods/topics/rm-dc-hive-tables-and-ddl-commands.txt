Understanding how DDL commands affect Hive tables during replication
Before you create Hive replication policies, you must understand how DDL commands
    affect the Hive tables during replication. 
The following scenarios explain how the tables are affected when you use the drop
        table and truncate table DDL commands on Hive external tables in a
      Hive external table replication policy:
You drop a table in a replication policy after the policy has run at least once. The
          table remains on the destination cluster and does not get dropped during subsequent
          replication runs.
You rename a table on the source cluster. On the target cluster, a table is
          created with the new name and the old table is also retained.
You drop a table on the destination cluster and the table is still included in the
          replication job. The table is re-created on the destination during the next replication
          job.
You drop a table partition or index on the source cluster. The next replication job
          drops it on the destination cluster.
You truncate a table, and the Advanced > Delete Policy field is set to Delete to Trash or Delete
            Permanently in the Hive external table replication policy wizard. The
          corresponding data files are deleted on the destination during the next replication
          job.

The following table shows the resulting actions in the target cluster when you run DDL
      commands in the source cluster on the Hive external tables used in an Hive external table
      replication policy:
