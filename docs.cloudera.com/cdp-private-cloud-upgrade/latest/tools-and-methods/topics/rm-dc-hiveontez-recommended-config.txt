Recommended Hive configuration parameters for Hive ACID table replication
        policies
Before you create a Hive ACID table replication policy, you can configure the
        recommended parameters for optimum performance.

Configure the following properties on the Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Hive-on-Tez Service > Configuration page, and then restart the Hive-on-Tez service:


Configure maximum concurrent policies to run at a time. 
Search for the Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet
                                (Safety Valve) for hive-site.xml property, enter
                                hive.scheduled.queries.max.executors
                            parameter, and the required value.For example, if you set
                                the value to 30, Replication Manager runs a maximum of 30
                                replication policies at a time.


Configure the connection pool size. Ensure that the value is equal to
                            or higher than the number of configured maximum concurrent
                            policies.
Search for the Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet
                                (Safety Valve) for hive-site.xml property, enter
                                datanucleus.connectionPool.maxPoolSize
                            parameter and the required value.



Enable bootstrap load to run DistCp jobs in parallel from a single replication
                    policy using the REPL LOAD command on the source cluster to set
                        hive.exec.parallel to true, and then set the
                        hive.exec.parallel.thread.number parameter equal to
                    the number of cores at session level. 
For example, if the number of available cores in the source cluster is 128 and
                    you want to run parallel replication policies, run the following
                    commands:set hive.exec.parallel.thread.number=128
REPL LOAD [***database name***] FROM [***directory name***] WITH ('hive.exec.parallel'='true'')

Preserve owner or user permissions, group permissions, and HDFS ACLs in source
                    and target clusters during replication. 
You can append the DistCp command line options in any combination (u for user,
                    g for group, p for permission, and a for ACL) to the
                        distcp.options command to preserve the permissions
                    during Hive ACID table replication. The other DistCp command line options that
                    you can use are r for replication number, b for block size, c for checksum-type,
                    x for XAttr, and t for timestamp.noteYou must have
                            superuser privileges to preserve the user and
                        group permissions, and HDFS ACLs.You can use DistCp options only
                        for the DistCp jobs that are initiated by Hive. To preserve the permissions
                        and ACLs, set the DistCp command line options using the WITH clause in the
                        REPL LOAD and REPL DUMP commands.For example, to preserve the owner
                        or user permissions, group permissions, and ACLs, run the REPL LOAD
                            [***database name***] FROM [***directory name***] WITH
                            distcp.options.puga command.
