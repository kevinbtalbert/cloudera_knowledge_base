Kerberos connectivity test
As part of Test Connectivity, Cloudera Manager tests for
    properly configured Kerberos authentication on the source and destination clusters that run the
    replication. Test Connectivity runs automatically when you add a peer for
    replication, or you can manually initiate Test Connectivity from the
      Actions menu. 
This feature is available when the source and destination clusters run Cloudera Manager
        5.12 or later. You can disable the Kerberos connectivity test by setting
          feature_flag_test_kerberos_connectivity to false with
        the Cloudera Manager API: api/<version>/cm/config.
If the test detects any issues with the Kerberos configuration, Cloudera Manager provides
        resolution steps based on whether Cloudera Manager manages the Kerberos configuration
        file.
Cloudera Manager tests the following scenarios:
Whether both clusters have Kerberos enabled or not.
Replication is supported from unsecure cluster to secure cluster starting Cloudera
            Manager 6.1 and later.
Replication is not supported if the source cluster uses Kerberos and target cluster is
            unsecure.
Whether both clusters are in the same Kerberos realm. Clusters in the same realm must
            share the same KDC or the KDCs must be in a unified realm.
Whether clusters are in different Kerberos realms. If the clusters
            are in different realms, the destination cluster must be configured
            according to the following criteria:
Destination HDFS services must have the correct
                  Trusted Kerberos Realms setting.
The krb5.conf file has the correct
                  domain_realm mapping on all the hosts.
The krb5.conf file has the correct
                  realms information on all the hosts.

Whether the local and peer KDC are running on an available port.
            This port must be open for all hosts in the cluster. The default
            port is 88.
After Cloudera Manager runs the tests, Cloudera Manager makes recommendations to
        resolve any Kerberos configuration issues.
Kerberos Recommendations
If Cloudera Manager manages the Kerberos configuration file, Cloudera Manager configures
        Kerberos correctly for you and then provides the set of commands that you must manually run
        to finish configuring the clusters. If Cloudera Manager does not manage the Kerberos
        configuration file, Cloudera manager provides the manual steps required to correct the
        issue.
