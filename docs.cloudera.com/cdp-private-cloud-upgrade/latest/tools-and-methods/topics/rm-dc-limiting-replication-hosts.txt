Specifying hosts to improve HDFS replication policy performance
If your cluster has clients installed on hosts with limited resources, HDFS replication
    may use these hosts to run commands for the replication, which can cause performance
    degradation. You can limit HDFS replication to run only on selected DataNodes by specifying a
    "whitelist" of DataNode hosts.

Go to the Cloudera Manager > Clusters > HDFS service > Configuration tab.

Locate the HDFS Replication Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet
            (Safety Valve) property.

Add the HOST_WHITELIST property, and enter a comma-separated
          list of hostnames to use for HDFS replication policies.
For example,
          HOST_WHITELIST=host-1.mycompany.com,host-2.mycompany.com

Click Save Changes.
