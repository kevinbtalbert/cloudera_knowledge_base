Managing Ozone replication policies
After you create an Ozone replication policy, you can perform and monitor various
        tasks related to the replication policy. You can view the job progress and replication logs.
        You can edit the advanced options to optimize a job run. You can suspend a job and also
        activate a suspended job. 

On the Replication Policies page, you can view the
                    following details about the replication policy: 


Shows a row of information for each replication policy, and the
                            following columns for each replication policy:


Internally generated ID for the
                                    replication policy. Click the column label to sort the
                                    replication policies.
Replication policy Name that you
                                    provide during replication policy creation.
Replication policy Type.
Source cluster in the replication
                                    policy.
Destination cluster in the
                                    replication policy.
Average Throughput per
                                    mapper/file for all the files written.noteThe throughput does not include the
                                        combined throughput of all mappers and the time taken to
                                        perform a checksum on a file after the file is
                                        written.
Replication job Progress.
Timestamp when the replication job
                                        Completed.

                            menu:


Show History opens the

                                    replication policy.
Edit Configuration allows you
                                    to change the replication policy options as required.
Dry Run simulates a run of the
                                    replication job where no files or tables are copied. After
                                        the dry run completes, select Actions > Show History to view the potential error messages and the
                                        number and size of files or tables that would be copied in

                                    job.
Collect Diagnostic Data opens
                                    the Send Diagnostic Data dialog box where
                                    you can:

Disable an active replication
                                    policy. You can Enable it later, as
                                        necessary.
Delete the replication policy
                                    permanently. Deleting a replication policy does not delete
                                    copied files or tables.

Full Performance
Performance report of the job which
                                                  includes the samples taken for all mappers during
                                                  the replication job. 



Run As Username is the username
                                    specified during replication policy creation to run the
                                    replication job.
Run on Peer as Username is the
                                    username specified during replication policy creation.
Message shows the total number
                                    of files copied to target cluster and the number of files that
