HDFS replication in Sentry-enabled clusters
When you run an HDFS replication policy on a Sentry-enabled source cluster, the
    replication policy copies files and tables along with their permissions. Cloudera Manager
    version 6.3.1 and above is required to run HDFS replication policies on a Sentry-enabled source
    cluster. 
Use the hdfs user to run HDFS replication policies on a
        source cluster that is Sentry-enabled. To use a different user account, you must configure
        the user account to bypass the Sentry ACLs during the replication process. 
Consider the following points before you create an HDFS replication policy:
When Sentry is not available or when Sentry does not manage the authorization for a
            resource such file or directory in the source cluster, HDFS uses its internal ACLs to
            manage resource authorization. 
When Sentry is enabled for the source cluster and you use the
              hdfs user to create the HDFS replication policy, HDFS copies
            the ACLs configured in Sentry for the replicated files and tables to the target cluster. 
When Sentry is enabled and you use a different user name to run the HDFS replication
            policy, both Sentry ACLs and HDFS internal ACLs are copied which results in incorrect
            HDFS metadata in the target cluster. If the Sentry ACLs are not compatible with HDFS
            ACLs, the replication job fails. Create another user to avoid such  compatibility
            issues.

To avoid compatibility issues between HDFS and Sentry ACLs for a non-hdfs
        user, you must complete the following steps:


Create a user account that Replication Manager jobs can use to bypass the Sentry
          ACLs.
For example, create a user named bdr-only-user.

Perform the following steps on the source cluster:


In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to the Clusters > HDFS service > Configuration tab.


Search for NameNode Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                hdfs-site.xml property.


Enter the following property details:
Name - Enter
                dfs.namenode.inode.attributes.provider.bypass.users.Value
                - Enter [***USERNAME,
                    USERNAME@REALMNAME***], where
                  [***USERNAME***] is the user you created in step 1 and the
                  [***REALMNAME***] is the Kerberos realm name.For
                example, if the username is bdr-only-user on the realm elephant, enter
                  bdr-only-user, bdr-only-user@ElephantRealm


Restart the NameNode.



Repeat step 2 on the destination cluster.

When you create an HDFS replication policy, specify the user you created in step 1 in
          the Run As Username and Run on Peer as
            Username fields.

noteThe Run As Username field launches the MapReduce job to copy
            data. The Run on Peer as Username field runs copy listing on
            source, if different than Run as Username.


noteEnsure that you set the value of Run on Peer as
          Username same as Run as Username. Otherwise,
        Replication Manager reads ACL from the source as hdfs, which pulls
        the Sentry provided ACLs over to the target cluster and applies them to the files in HDFS.
        This can result in additional usage of NameNode heap in the target cluster.
