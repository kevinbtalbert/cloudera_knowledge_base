Guidelines to add or delete source data during replication job run
When a replication policy is replicating data, you must ensure that you follow a few
    guidelines to maintain source data for successful data replication.
Follow the below guidelines for successful data replication:
Do not modify the source directory. This is because a file added during replication is
          not replicated, and the replication fails if you delete a file during replication.
All the files in the directory are closed. This is because replication fails if any
          source files are open. tipIf you cannot ensure that
            all source files are closed, clear the Abort on Error option in
            the replication policy to continue replication despite errors. After the replication job
            completes, identify the opened files in the log. Ensure that these files are closed
            before the next replication occurs.
