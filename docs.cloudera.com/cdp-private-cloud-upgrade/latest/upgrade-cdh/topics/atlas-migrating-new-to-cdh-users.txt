What's new in Atlas for Navigator Users?
Reviewing the differences between Navigator and Apache Atlas helps you to know more about the features and functionalities available for metadata management in Apache Atlas.
Customers migrating from CDH with Navigator will be able to take advantage
     of these Atlas features:
Control data access in Ranger using Atlas metadata. Atlas
        classifications can control table, row, or column level access; Ranger
        can use Atlas classifications as the trigger to instruct services to
        mask data. See Configure Atlas Authorization using
          Ranger.
Reliability and scalability. Atlas uses Kafka to pass metadata
        and HBase and Solr to store it. These services leverage the distributed
        nature of the cluster to provide scalability and can be further annealed
        to be highly-available. See Apache Atlas architecture
Additional metadata sources. Atlas is flexible when it comes
        to adding metadata models for additional sources through REST APIs for
        metadata capture; it supports NiFi and Kafka metadata in addition to the
        sources integrated with Navigator. See Extending Atlas to manage metadata from
          additional sources.
Business Glossary. Atlas provides an interface to create and
        manage a glossary of business terms that can clarify and standardize how
        data is identified and used in an organization. See Atlas Glossaries overview
Data profiling. Data Catalog includes automatic data tagging
        for a list of common types of data and allows you to tag additional
        types that can be identified using regular expressions. 
When running Atlas in CDP's public cloud offering, you'll
                 also get the benefit of being able to see metadata across all
                 the workloads in a single environment.
