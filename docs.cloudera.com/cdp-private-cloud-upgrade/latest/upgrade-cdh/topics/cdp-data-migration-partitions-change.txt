Disabling Partition Type Checking
An enhancement in Hive 3 checks the types of partitions. This feature can be disabled by
  setting a property. For more information, see the ASF Apache Hive Language Manual.
Before Upgrade to CDP
In CDH 5.x, partition values are not type checked.
After Upgrade to CDP
Partition values specified in the partition specification are type checked,
   converted, and normalized to conform to their column types if the property
    hive.typecheck.on.insert is set to true (default). The values
   can be numbers.
Action Required
If type checking of partitions causes problems, disable the feature. To disable
   partition type checking, set hive.typecheck.on.insert to false.
   For example:

SET hive.typecheck.on.insert=false;
