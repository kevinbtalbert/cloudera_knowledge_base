Configuring a Ranger or Ranger KMS Database: Oracle
Prior to upgrading your cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base you must configure the Oracle
    database instance for Ranger by creating a Ranger database and user. Before
    you begin the transition, review the support policies of database and admin
    policy support for transactions.

A supported version of Oracle must be running and available to be used
        by Ranger. 


On the Ranger host, install the appropriate JDBC .jar file.


Download the Oracle JDBC (OJDBC) driver from https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html.


For Oracle Database 12c: select Oracle Database 12c
                  Release 2 driver > ojdbc8.jar.




Copy the .jar file to the Java share directory.

cp ojdbc8-12.2.0.1.jar /usr/share/java/ 


Make sure the .jar file has the appropriate permissions. For
                example:
                chmod 644 /usr/share/java/ojdbc8-12.2.0.1


Log in to the host where the Oracle database is running and
          launch Oracle sqlplus:
sqlplus sys/root as sysdba


Create the Ranger database and user. Run the following
          commands:

CREATE USER rangeradmin IDENTIFIED BY rangeradmin;
GRANT SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE TO rangeradmin;
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO rangeradmin;
QUIT;
GRANT CREATE SESSION,CREATE PROCEDURE,CREATE TABLE,CREATE VIEW,CREATE SEQUENCE,CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM,CREATE ANY SYNONYM,CREATE TRIGGER,UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO rangeradmin;
ALTER USER rangeradmin DEFAULT TABLESPACE <tablespace>;
ALTER USER rangeradmin quota unlimited on <tablespace>;


Continue installing or upgrading your
      cluster.
