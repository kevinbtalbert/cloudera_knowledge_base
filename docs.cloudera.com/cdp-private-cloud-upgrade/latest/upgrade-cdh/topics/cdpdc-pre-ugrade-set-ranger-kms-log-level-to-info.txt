Set log level for KeyTrustee KMS to INFOCloudera Docs
Set log level for KeyTrustee KMS to INFO
 Reduce the log output from org.apache.ranger.plugin.* by
        changing the log level setting for your Ranger KMS from DEBUG to INFO.

Upgrading a CDH cluster to CDP includes converting KeyTrustee KMS to Ranger KMS.
In some rare cases, the KeyTrustee KMS logging may be set to DEBUG level when
                investigating services issues. When KeyTrustee KMS is converted to Ranger KMS during
                a CDH to CDP upgrade, some configuration settings, such as the log_threshold
                setting, may be transferred over. While log_level set to DEBUG minimally impacts CDH
                clusters, clusters upgraded to CDP may experience a negative performance impact from
                Ranger KMS if the log_threshold setting remains at DEBUG. 
Recommended Practice: leave the log_threshold setting configured to INFO or higher, unless actively debugging a service issue in Ranger KMS.
            
Setting the log_threshold to DEBUG on Ranger KMS can produce a huge number of log entries from
                org.apache.ranger.plugin.*. Due to the frequency of logs generated, the Ranger KMS can experience periods of slow response, negatively impacting file operations on HDFS.
note Additional information:For CDH5 clusters, setting log
                    level to DEBUG does not afftect Tomcat logging.For CDH6 clusters, Jetty
                    embedded inside KMS magnifies this issue. 


During pre-upgrade, review the logging level of your KeyTrustee KMS
                    service.
