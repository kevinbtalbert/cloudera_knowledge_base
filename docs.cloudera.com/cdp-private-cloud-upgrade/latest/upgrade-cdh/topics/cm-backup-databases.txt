Backing up Cloudera Manager databases
Cloudera recommends that you schedule regular backups of the
    databases that Cloudera Manager uses to store configuration, monitoring, and
    reporting data and for managed services that require a database:

Backing Up PostgreSQL Databases

To back up a PostgreSQL database, use the same procedure whether the database is
        embedded or external:
Log in to the host where the Cloudera Manager Server is installed.
Get the name, user, and password properties for
            the Cloudera Manager database from
              /etc/cloudera-scm-server/db.properties:com.cloudera.cmf.db.name=scm
com.cloudera.cmf.db.user=scm
com.cloudera.cmf.db.password=NnYfWIjlbk
Run the following command as root using the parameters from the
            preceding
            step:# pg_dump -h hostname -p 7432 -U scm > /tmp/scm_server_db_backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)
Enter the password from the
              com.cloudera.cmf.db.password property in step
            2.
To back up a database created for one of the roles on the local
            host as the roleuser
            user:# pg_dump -h hostname -p 7432 -U roleuser > /tmp/roledb
Enter the password specified when the database was created.




Backing Up MariaDB Databases

To back up the MariaDB database, run the mysqldump command on the
        MariaDB host, as follows:
mysqldump -hhostname -uusername -ppassword database > /tmp/database-backup.sql
For example, to back up the Activity Monitor database
          amon created in Creating Databases for Cloudera
          Software, on the local host as the root user, with the password
          amon_password:mysqldump -pamon_password amon > /tmp/amon-backup.sql
To back up the sample Activity Monitor database amon
        on remote host myhost.example.com as the root user,
        with the password
        amon_password:mysqldump -hmyhost.example.com -uroot -pamon_password amon > /tmp/amon-backup.sql



Backing Up MySQL Databases

To back up the MySQL database, run the mysqldump
        command on the MySQL host, as
        follows:mmysqldump -hhostname -uusername -ppassword database > /tmp/database-backup.sql
For example, to back up the Activity Monitor database
          amon created in Creating Databases for Cloudera
          Software, on the local host as the root user, with the password
          amon_password:mysqldump -pamon_password amon > /tmp/amon-backup.sql
To back up the sample Activity Monitor database amon
        on remote host myhost.example.com as the root user,
        with the password
        amon_password:mysqldump -hmyhost.example.com -uroot -pamon_password amon > /tmp/amon-backup.sql
You can back up all database using the following command:
        mysqldump --all-databases -ppassword > /tmp/all1/all.sql



Backing Up Oracle Databases

For Oracle, work with your database administrator to ensure databases are
        properly backed up.
