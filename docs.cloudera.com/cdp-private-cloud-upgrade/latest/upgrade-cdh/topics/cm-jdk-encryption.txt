Using AES-256 Encryption





noteThis step is not required when using JDK 1.8.0_162 or greater. JDK
        1.8.0_162 enables unlimited strength encryption by default.

If you are using CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 or higher, or Ubuntu, which use AES-256
      encryption by default for tickets, you must install the Java Cryptography Extension
        (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy File on all cluster and Hadoop user
      machines. For JCE Policy File installation instructions, see the README.txt
      file included in the jce_policy-x.zip file. For more information, see Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength
        Jurisdiction Policy File

Alternately, you can configure Kerberos to not use AES-256 by removing
        aes256-cts:normal from the
        supported_enctypes field of the
        kdc.conf or krb5.conf file. After
      changing the kdc.conf file, you must restart both the KDC
      and the kadmin server for those changes to take affect. You may also need
      to re-create or change the password of the relevant principals, including,
      potentially the Ticket Granting Ticket principal
        (krbtgt/REALM@REALM). If AES-256 is still used after
      completing steps, the aes256-cts:normal setting existed
      when the Kerberos database was created. To fix this, create a new Kerberos
      database and then restart both the KDC and the kadmin server.
To verify the type of encryption used in your cluster:

On the local KDC host, type this command to create a test
        principal:kadmin -q "addprinc test" 
On a cluster host, type this command to start a Kerberos session as
        the test
        principal:kinit test 
On a cluster host, type this command to view the encryption type in
          use:klist -e If AES
          is being used, output like the following is displayed after you type
          the klist command; note that AES-256
          is included in the
        output:Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_0
