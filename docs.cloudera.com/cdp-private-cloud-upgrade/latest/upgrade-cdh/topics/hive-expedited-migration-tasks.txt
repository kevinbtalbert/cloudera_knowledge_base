Apache Hive Expedited Migration Tasks
If you chose to expedite the Hive upgrade process by postponing migration of your tables
  and databases, you need to identify any problems in tables and get help with fixing those problems
  before migrating the tables to CDP. You then need to migrate these tables to CDP before you can
  use them.


Preparing tables for migrationYou download the Hive Upgrade Check tool and use it to identify problems in         unmigrated tables. These problems can cause upgrade failure. It saves time to fix the         problems and avoid failure. The tool provides help for fixing those problems before         migrating the tables to CDP. Creating a list of tables to migrateTo run Hive Strict Managed Migration process (HSMM) after upgrading, you need to know         how to create a YAML file that specifies the tables for migration. Migrating tables to CDP         You set a Hive property to point to your YAML list of tables you want to migrate, and then migrate the tables by manually running the Hive Strict Managed Migration process on the tables. You perform this action to use the tables in CDP.      Parent topic: CDH 5 to CDP Private Cloud Base post-upgrade transition steps
