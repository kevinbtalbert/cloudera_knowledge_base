Configuring HSMM to prevent migration
You need to know how to configure the Hive Strict Managed Migration (HSMM) to prevent
        migrating your tables and databases as you run the upgrade process in Cloudera Manager. You
        briefly leave the upgrade process, do the configuration, and than proceed with the
        upgrade.


You are in the middle of the CDH to CDP Private Cloud Base in-place upgrade and
                    installed Hive-on-Tez.


 In this task, you set the table migration control file URL
            property to an arbitrary value, deliberately causing HSMM to fail to migrate your tables
            and databases. You must manually migrate these tables later. 

In Cloudera Manager, go to Clusters > Hive-on-Tez.

Stop the Hive-on-Tez service.

In Configuration, search for table migration control file
                        URL.

Set the value of the Table migration control file URL
                    property to the absolute path and file name of your YAML include list. 

Save configuration changes. 

Start the Hive-on-Tez service.

Return to the CDH to CDP Private Cloud Base in-place upgrade wizard to complete
                    the cluster upgrade.
