Warnings and prerequisites
Preparing Cloudera Search in your CDH cluster for an upgrade is a complex task. 
warning
If your CDH 5.x cluster used SolrCell with Morphlines to index data to Solr, you can only
    upgrade to CDP 7.1.6 or higher.
The SolrCell version shipped with Cloudera Runtime 7.1.6 no longer contains the dateFormats
    field. As Solr is still able to convert most strings to dates, it is possible that removing the
    dateFormats field from your Morphlines is enough.
If you want to explicitly add a specific date format, Cloudera suggests one of the options in
    the following example.
To replace dateFormats : [ "MM-dd-yyyy" ]
You can either add the following to Morphlines for all the affected date fields:
{{convertTimestamp

{ field : document_header2 inputFormats : ["MM-dd-yyyy"] }
}}
or you can change the solrconfig.xml file, by adding the
     <str>MM-dd-yyyy</str> date format:
<updateProcessor class="solr.ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory" name="parse-date">
    <arr name="format">
      <str>MM-dd-yyyy</str>
      <str>yyyy-MM-dd['T'[HH:mm[:ss[.SSS]][z</str>
      <str>yyyy-MM-dd['T'[HH:mm[:ss[,SSS]][z</str>
      <str>yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm[:ss[.SSS]][z</str>
      <str>yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm[:ss[,SSS]][z</str>
      <str>[EEE, ]dd MMM yyyy HH:mm[:ss] z</str>
      <str>EEEE, dd-MMM-yy HH:mm:ss z</str>
      <str>EEE MMM ppd HH:mm:ss [z ]yyyy</str>
    </arr>
  </updateProcessor>

warningAn empty Solr service with no added
      collections causes the upgrade process to fail. The entire CDH 5.x to CDP Private cloud
        Base upgrade fails if there is a Solr service with no added collections present in your CDH
        5.x cluster. To avoid this, you need to remove the empty Solr service from your cluster
        before you start the upgrade.
warningDue to changes in the underlying Apache Lucene file format between the CDH 5
   and Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher versions
   of Solr, it is not possible to directly upgrade your existing indexes. The procedures update only
   your Solr configuration and metadata to be compatible with the new Solr version. After upgrading
   to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher, you must
   reindex your
    collections.Make sure that the source data that was used to index your collections is
    available before
    upgrading. Plan downtime for any applications or services that use your Search
   deployment.
warning
The solr-upgrade.sh script shipped with Cloudera Manager 7.3.1 or earlier
        downloads aliases.json from ZooKeeper during the pre-upgrade transition,
        but it fails to upload the file to the upgraded cluster. You need to recreate aliases
        manually on the upgraded cluster. For more information on aliases, see Collection aliasing.
If you run Cloudera Manager 7.4.2 or higher, you can disregard this warning.

warningAlthough the configuration
        transformation script addresses known incompatibilities, there might be incompatible
        configurations that are not detected by the script. Do not upgrade your production Cloudera
        Search services to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher until you have
        tested the migrated configuration with Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher on a testing or development
        cluster.
Prerequisites

Make sure you are running Cloudera Manager 7.1 or higher.
If you use Apache Sentry with policy files, you must transition to Sentry service before the
     upgrade.
Stop making changes to your Cloudera Search environment. Make sure that no configuration
     changes are made to Cloudera Search for the duration of the transition and upgrade. This
     includes adding or removing Solr Server hosts, moving Solr Server roles between hosts, changing
     hostnames, and so on.
Plan for an outage for any applications or services that use your Search deployment until
     you have completed re-indexing after the upgrade.
If you use Kerberos, create a jaas.conf file for the Search service
     superuser (solr by default).
If you are using the Lily HBase Indexer service, stop writing to any tables that are indexed
     into Solr, and stop the Lily HBase Indexer service (Key-Value Store Indexer service > Actions > Stop).
Do not create, delete, or modify any collections for the duration of the transition and
     upgrade.

You can continue indexing to existing collections (except Lily HBase indexing) until otherwise
    instructed.
