Copy the transitioned configuration to the upgrade metadata directory
After you have successfully migrated the Solr configuration, and verified that the
        updated configuration works in Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher, you
        have to copy it to the Upgrade Metadata Directory and change its
        ownership to the Solr service superuser. 
You specified the Upgrade Metadata
                Directory in Set upgrade configuration properties in Cloudera Manager. In this example, it is
                /cr7-solr-metadata/migrated-config. 




Copy the upgraded configuration to the upgrade metadata directory:

sudo mkdir -p /cr7-solr-metadata/migrated-config
sudo cp -r $HOME/cr7-migrated-solr-config/* /cr7-solr-metadata/migrated-config


Change ownership to the Solr service superuser (solr in this example):

sudo chown -R solr:solr /cr7-solr-metadata


If you have made any changes to the configuration after testing on a Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher cluster,  you must copy the updated configuration from the Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher test cluster to the CDH 5 cluster you are upgrading.


After copying the upgraded configuration to the upgrade metadata directory, you are
                ready to upgrade to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher
                following the regular process as documented in Upgrading a CDH 5 Cluster. After the upgrade is complete, continue to Cloudera Search post-upgrade tasks.
