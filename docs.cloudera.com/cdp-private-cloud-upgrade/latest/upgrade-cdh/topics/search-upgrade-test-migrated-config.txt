Test transitioned Solr configuration on a Cloudera Runtime cluster
Copy the upgraded Solr configuration to a test or development CDP cluster to test it
        for incompatibilities not detected by the upgrade script before you initiate the upgrade on
        your production environment.

warningAlthough the configuration
        transformation script addresses known incompatibilities, there might be incompatible
        configurations that are not detected by the script. Do not upgrade your production Cloudera
        Search services to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher until you have
        tested the migrated configuration with Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher on a testing or development
        cluster.
To test the migrated configuration on a Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher
                cluster, you can either provision a new host in your upgraded Cloudera Manager 7
                environment and add a Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher
                cluster using that host, or you can upgrade a development or test cluster to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher. You can then use the Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher
                cluster to test the migrated configuration to make sure that it works on Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1
    or higher
                before upgrading your production environment.


Create a TAR file of the configuration files in the
                        [***SOLR/METADATA/OUTPUT/DIRECTORY***] (in this example
                        cr7-migrated-solr-config) directory and copy them over to a
                    Solr host on the test CDP cluster.

tar -czvf cr7-migrated-solr-config.tar.gz \
/home/solruser/cr7-migrated-solr-config


On the Solr host in the test CDP cluster, extract the TAR file created in the
                    previous step.

tar -xzvf cr7-migrated-solr-config.tar.gz


Kinit as a
                        solr
                    user in the test CDP cluster:

kinit solr@EXAMPLE.COM
Replace solr@EXAMPLE.COM with your Kerberos realm name.


Run the following commands to create a Solr collection: 

solrctl instancedir --create /[***PATH/TO/MIGRATED/CONFIG***]/cr7-migrated-solr-config/configs/testcollection_config

solrctl collection --create testcollection_config

Replace [***CONFIG***] with the name of the
                            configuration (NOT the name fo the collection) that you want to
                            test.
Replace [***PATH/TO/MIGRATED/CONFIG***] with the path
                            to where you extracted
                            cr7-migrated-solr-config.tar.gz.

If Kerberos is enabled and configured ZooKeeper Access Controll Lists (ACLs),
                        specify your JAAS configuration file by adding the --jaas
                        parameter to the command. For example:
solrctl --jaas $HOME/solr-jaas.conf \
instancedir --create testcollection_config \
/[***PATH***]/cr7-migrated-solr-config/configs/testcollection_config

solrctl collection --create testcollection_config


Check the Solr web UI on the host where the above collections were created, and
                    make sure the collection is created.

Repeat the above steps for all collections you want to transition to CDP.
