Upgrade Navigator Encrypt to 7.1.x
How to upgrade Navigator Encrypt from CDH to CDP Private Cloud 7.1.x.

Running Upgrading a Cluster will not upgrade Navigator Encrypt, because
                Navigator Encrypt is not part of the overall CDH parcel and needs to be upgraded
                separately. Upgrading NavEncrypt can be done at any point after performing
                    Upgrading Cloudera Manager. 
You can upgrade from Navigator Encrypt 3.16-6.2 to 7.1.x. If you are upgrading from
                an older version of Navigator Encrypt, first upgrade to 3.16+ using Upgrading
                    Cloudera Navigator Encrypt.

Upgrading Navigator Encrypt (RHEL/Centos/Oracle)

Back up the /etc/navencrypt directory before
                        upgrading.If you have problems accessing encrypted data after upgrading
                        the OS or kernel, restore /etc/navencrypt from your
                        backup and try again.
Add your internal package repository to Cloudera Manager following the
                    instructions in Configuring a Local Package Repository.
Install the Cloudera Repository:
Add the internal repository you created by following the instructions in
                                Configuring a Local Package Repository (see Configuring
                                Hosts to Use the Internal Repository.)
Import the GPG key by running the following command:
                            sudo rpm --import http://repo.example.com/path/to/gpg_gazzang.asc

Stop Navigator
                    Encrypt:sudo systemctl stop navencrypt-mount
Upgrade Navigator Encrypt client:
                    sudo yum update navencrypt
Start Navigator
                    Encrypt:sudo systemctl start navencrypt-mount
If using an RSA master key file, then you should change the master key to use
                    OAEP
                        padding:# navencrypt key --change --rsa-oaep

 1) Passphrase (single)
 2) Passphrase (dual)
 3) RSA private key

Stop Navigator

Upgrade the Kernel Module Package
                            (KMP):sudo zypper update cloudera-navencryptfs-kmp-kernel_flavorReplace
                                kernel_flavor with the kernel flavor for your
                            system. Navigator Encrypt supports the default,
                                xen, and ec2 kernel
                        flavors.
Upgrade Navigator Encrypt client:
                        sudo zypper update navencrypt
Enable Unsupported Modules:Edit
                                /etc/modprobe.d/unsupported-modules and set
                                allow_unsupported_modules to
                                1. For
                            example:#
# Every kernel module has a flag 'supported'. If this flag is not set loading
# this module will taint your kernel. You will not get much help with a kernel
# problem if your kernel is marked as tainted. In this case you firstly have
# to avoid loading of unsupported modules.
#
# Setting allow_unsupported_modules 1 enables loading of unsupported modules
# by modprobe, setting allow_unsupported_modules 0 disables it. This can
# be overridden using the --allow-unsupported-modules command line switch.
