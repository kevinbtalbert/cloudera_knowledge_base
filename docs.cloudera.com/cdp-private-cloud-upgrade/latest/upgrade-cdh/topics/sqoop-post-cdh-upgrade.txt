Apache Sqoop Changes
 After upgrading from CDH to CDP, Sqoop action errors are not logged due to an change
        in the log4j configuration. You must configure Oozie to log Sqoop action errors in the Oozie
        launcher log.





Before Upgrade to CDP
The Sqoop action in an Oozie workflow log errors to the Oozie launcher log.
                For example:
                >>> Invoking Sqoop command line now >>>
 2021-01-11 09:58:21,438 [main] WARN  org.apache.sqoop.tool.SqoopTool  - $SQOOP_CONF_DIR has not been set in the environment. Cannot check for additional configuration.

After Upgrade to CDP
The Sqoop action in an Oozie workflow does not log errors to the Oozie
                launcher log. For example:
                >>> Invoking Sqoop command line now >>>
09:39:49.715 [main] INFO  org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.deprecation - mapred.jar is deprecated. Instead, use mapreduce.job.jar

Action Required
Configure the Sqoop action to use the log4j1 configuration for this Sqoop
                action and the Hue workspace only.


Create a log4j.properties file and upload it to the
                        lib directory in the workflow.xml
                    path inside HDFS.

log4j.rootLogger=INFO , A
log4j.logger.org.apache.sqoop=INFO, A
log4j.additivity.org.apache.sqoop=false
log4j.appender.A=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.A.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.A.layout.ConversionPattern=%d [%t] %-5p %c %x - %m%n
log4j.logger.org.apache.sqoop=INFO, A              


In the workflow.xml file or in the Sqoop action in Hue
                    interface, configure the Sqoop action to use the
                        log4j.properties file by configuring
                        SqoopAction > Properties > yarn.app.mapreduce.am.admin-command-opts:
                        Dlog4j.configuration=log4j.properties. 


Parent topic: CDH 5 to CDP Private Cloud Base post-upgrade transition steps
Check Parquet writer implementation property
You might need to set the Parquet writer implementation property to
                hadoop. In releases before CDP 7.1.6/Cloudera Manager 7.3.1, the
            Parquet writer implementation property (parquetjob.configurator.implementation) default
            was not
hadoop.
If you upgraded to a CDP release earlier than CDP 7.1.6, change the default value of the Parquet writer implementation property to hadoop.
            Making this change prevents encountering the following error when using the Sqoop client:
                Post upgrade sqoop failed with the error "Invalid Parquet job configurator implementation is set: kite. Supported values are: [HADOOP]" , 

In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > Sqoop 1 Client > Configuration, and search for Parquet writer implementation.

Change the value to hadoop.









Configure a Sqoop Action globally and for all Hue workspaces


In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > Oozie-1 > Configuration, and search for Oozie Server Advanced
                            Configuration.


Scroll down, locate the Oozie Server Advanced Configuration
                            Snippet (Safety Valve) for oozie-site.xml, and click
                            +.


Add the following property name and value.

<property>
  <name>oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.action.configurations</name>
  <value>*=/var/lib/oozie/action-conf</value>
</property>                    


Login to the server running the Oozie service as root and run the following commands.

mkdir -p /var/lib/oozie/action-conf
chown -R oozie:oozie /var/lib/oozie                   


Create a sqoop.xml file that configures the
                            yarn.app.mapreduce.am.admin-command-opts
                        property.

<configuration>
<property>
<name>yarn.app.mapreduce.am.admin-command-opts</name>
<value>-Dlog4j.configuration=log4j.properties</value>
</property>
</configuration>


Copy the file to /var/lib/oozie/action-conf and ensure
                        it is owned by oozie:oozie.

Copy the log4j.properties file to Oozie shared lib
                            /user/oozie/share/lib/lib_<timestamp>/sqoop and
                        restart Oozie service.
