Bootstrap Solr collections after upgrading the cluster
As a part of the upgrade process, you must perform bootstrapping of Solr collections
    using Cloudera Manager to recreate the empty collections.
The Solr upgrade script provided by Cloudera does not perform
      bootstrapping of Solr collections as part of the upgrade process. You need to perform this
      step using Cloudera Manager to recreate the empty collections. 

In Cloudera Manager > Clusters, select the Solr service. Click Actions and click
            Botostrap Solr Collections.
After the bootstrap porcess completes, you find the recreated empty collections
          in Solr.
