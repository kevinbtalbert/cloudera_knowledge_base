Recreate aliases 
If you have used aliases in your pre-upgrade cluster and the version of the Cloudera
        Manager you are using is 7.3.1 or lower, you need to recreate aliasing now, as the
        solr-upgrade.sh script does not handle aliasing.

noteIf you upgraded the cluster
        using Cloudera Manager 7.4.2 or higher, you do not need to recreate
        aliases.

The solr-upgrade.sh script downloads aliases.json
            from ZooKeeper during the pre-upgrade transition, it fails to upload the
                json to the upgraded cluster.

To recreate aliases, select one of the following options:

Upload aliases.json to the upgraded cluster
Recreate the aliases using CREATEALIAS API calls.



Upload aliases.json to the upgraded clusterYou can upload the existing aliases.json file to the upgraded         cluster to recreate aliases.Parent topic: Cloudera Search post-upgrade tasks
