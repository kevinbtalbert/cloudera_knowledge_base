Configure SMM to monitor SRM replications
Following a successful upgrade, if you want to use SMM to monitor SRM replications,
    you must reconnect the two services. This is done by enabling the STREAMS_REPLICATION_MANAGER
    Service SMM property which is disabled by default. 





This configuration is only required if you are upgrading from CDH 5 or CDH 6 to Cloudera
        Runtime 7.1.6 and higher or from Cloudera Runtime 7.1.5 and lower to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.6
        and higher.importantSMM can only connect to and monitor an SRM service that is
          running in the same cluster as SMM. Monitoring an SRM service that is running in a cluster
          that is external to SMM is no longer supported.

In Cloudera Manager, select the SMM service.Go to Configuration.Find and enable the STREAMS_REPLICATION_MANAGER Service
          property.Click Save Changes.Restart the service.
SMM is configured to monitor SRM replications. The Cluster Replications tab
      is available in the SMM UI.
