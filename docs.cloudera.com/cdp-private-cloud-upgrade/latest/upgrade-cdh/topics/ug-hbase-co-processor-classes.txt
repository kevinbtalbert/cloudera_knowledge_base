Check co-processor classes
External co-processors are not automatically upgraded, you must upgrade them manually. Before upgrading, ensure that your co-processors are compatible with the upgrade.

important
Ensure that you complete all the pre-upgrade steps if you have Apache HBase
                        installed in your existing CDH cluster.
 There are two ways to handle co-processor upgrade:
Upgrade your co-processor jars manually before continuing the upgrade.
Temporarily unset the co-processors and continue the upgrade.Once they
                            are manually upgraded, they can be reset.

Attempting to upgrade without upgrading the co-processor jars can result in
                unpredictable behaviour such as HBase role start failure, HBase role crashing, or
                even data corruption.
If your cluster is Kerberized, ensure that you run the kinit command
                as a hbase user before running the pre-upgrade commands.


Download and distribute parcels for target version of CDP Private Cloud Base.

importantDo not activate the parcel yet.
If the downloaded parcel version is higher than the current Cloudera Manager
                        version, the following error message displayed: 
Error for parcel CDH-7.X.parcel : Parcel version 7.X is not
                            supported by this version of Cloudera Manager. Upgrade Cloudera Manager
                            to at least 7.X before using this version of the
                        parcel.
You can safely ignore this error message.


Run the hbase pre-upgrade validate-cp commands to check if
                    your co-processors are compatible with the upgrade.

Use the CDP parcel to run the pre-upgrade commands. Cloudera recommends that
                        you run them on an HMaster host.
For example, you can check for co-processor compatibility on
                        master:$ /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-7.1.1-1.cdh7.1.1.p0.3224867/bin/hbase pre-upgrade validate-cp -jar /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-7.1.1-1.cdh7.1.1.p0.3224867/jars/ -config
Or, you can validate every table level co-processors where the table name
                        matches to the .* regular
                        expression:$ /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-7.1.1-1.cdh7.1.1.p0.3224867/bin/hbase pre-upgrade validate-cp -table '.*'

Optinally, you can run the following command for a more detailed
                        output:HBASE_ROOT_LOGGER=DEBUG,console hbase pre-upgrade validate-cp -table '.*'This
                        way you can verify that all of the required tables were checked. The
                        detailed output should contain lines like the following where
                            test_table is a table on the
                        server:21/05/10 11:07:58 DEBUG coprocessor.CoprocessorValidator: Validating table test_table

Check the output to determine if your co-processors are compatible with the
                    upgrade.
The output looks similar to the following:

$ hbase pre-upgrade validate-cp -config
... some output ...
$ echo $?
0
If echo $? prints 0, the check was
                        successful and your co-processors are compatible. A non-zero value means
                        unsuccessful, your co-processors are not compatible.


Once your co-processors are prepared for the cluster upgrade, check the
                        Yes, I have manually upgraded the HBase co-processor
                        classes upgrade checkbox.


Continue the upgrade using the Cloudera Manager upgrade wizard.
