Remove transactional=false from Table Properties 
In CDH 5.x it is possible to create tables with having the property transactional=false set. While
        this is a no-op setting, if any of your Hive tables explicitly set this, the upgrade process fails.

You must remove 'transactional'='false' from any tables you want to upgrade
                from CDH 5.x to CDP.Â 
                 


Alter the table as follows:
ALTER TABLE my_table UNSET TBLPROPERTIES ('transactional');
