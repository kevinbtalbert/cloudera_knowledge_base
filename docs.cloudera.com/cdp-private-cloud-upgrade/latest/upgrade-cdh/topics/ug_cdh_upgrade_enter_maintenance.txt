Step 9: Enter Maintenance Mode
You can enable Maintenance Mode to avoid unnecessary alerts during
    the upgrade.



To avoid unnecessary alerts during the upgrade process, enter maintenance
      mode on your cluster before you start the upgrade.  Entering maintenance mode stops email
        alerts and SNMP traps from being sent, but does not stop checks and
        configuration validations. Be sure to exit maintenance mode when you
        have finished the upgrade to re-enable Cloudera Manager alerts. More Information. 

 On the Home >
        Status tab, click the actions menu next to the
      cluster name and select Enter Maintenance Mode.
