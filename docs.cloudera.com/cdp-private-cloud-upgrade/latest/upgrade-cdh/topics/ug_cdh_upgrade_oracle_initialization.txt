      upgrading from CDH 5 check the value of the COMPATIBLE
      initialization parameter in the Oracle Database using the following SQL
      query:Â SELECT name, value FROM v$parameter WHERE name = 'compatible'
The default value is 12.2.0. If the parameter has a
      different value, you can set it to the default as shown in the Oracle Database Upgrade
        Guide.noteBefore
        resetting the COMPATIBLE initialization parameter to
        its default value, make sure you consider the effects of this change can
        have on your system.
