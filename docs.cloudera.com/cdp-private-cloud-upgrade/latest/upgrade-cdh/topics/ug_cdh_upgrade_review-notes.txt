Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
Note the following before upgrading your clusters:
important

The embedded
          PostgreSQL database is NOT supported in production
          environments.
 If you use the Solr Search service in your
          cluster, there are significant manual steps you must follow both
          before and after upgrading CDH. See Transitioning Cloudera Search configuration before upgrading to Cloudera Runtime.
The following services are no longer supported as of Enterprise
          6.0.0: 
Sqoop 2
MapReduce 1
Spark 1.6
Record Service

Running Apache Accumulo on top of CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.x
          cluster is not currently supported. If you try to upgrade to CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.x, you will be asked to remove the Accumulo
          service from your cluster.
Upgrading Apache HBase from CDH to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1 gives you a warning in
          Cloudera Manager that the Dynamic Jars Directory feature property
            hbase.dynamic.jars.dir is deprecated. You can ignore this warning when
          using Apache HBase with HDFS storage on CDP Private Cloud Base. The
            hbase.dynamic.jars.dir property is incompatible with Apache HBase on
          cloud deployments using cloud storage.


The minor version of Cloudera Manager you
              use to perform the upgrade must be equal to or greater than the
              CDH or Cloudera Runtime minor version. Cloudera recommends that
              you upgrade to the latest maintenance version of Cloudera Manager
              before upgrading your cluster. See Supported Upgrade
              Paths. To upgrade Cloudera Manager, see Upgrading Cloudera Manager 5. 
For example:
Supported:
Cloudera Manager 7.1 or higher and Cloudera Runtime
                    7.0
Cloudera Manager 7.1 and CDH 5.
Cloudera Manager 6.0.0 and CDH 5.14.0
Cloudera Manager 5.14.0 and CDH 5.13.0
Cloudera Manager 5.13.1 and CDH 5.13.3

Not Supported:
Cloudera Manager 5.14.0 and CDH 6.0.0
Cloudera Manager 5.12 and CDH 5.13
Cloudera Manager 6.0.0 and CDH 5.6






note
After upgrading from CDH to CDP, the NodeManager recovery feature is
        enabled by default. This means that the
          yarn.nodemanager.recovery.enabled property is set to
          true. Cloudera recommends that you keep the
        NodeManager recovery feature enabled. If you set this property to
          false in your CDP cluster and then upgrade to a later
        CDP version, the feature will remain disabled.


noteUpgrades to Cloudera Runtime 7.0.3 are not supported.


note
When upgrading CDH using Rolling Restart
          (Minor Upgrade only): 

Automatic failover does not affect the rolling restart
            operation.
After the upgrade has completed, do not remove the old parcels if
            there are MapReduce or Spark jobs currently running. These jobs
            still use the old parcels and must be restarted in order to use the
            newly upgraded parcel.
Ensure that Oozie jobs are idempotent.
Do not use Oozie Shell Actions to run Hadoop-related commands. 
Rolling upgrade of Spark Streaming jobs is not supported. Restart
            the streaming job once the upgrade is complete, so that the newly
            deployed version starts being used. 
Runtime libraries must be packaged as part of the Spark
            application. 
You must use the distributed cache to propagate the job
            configuration files from the client gateway hosts.
Do not build "uber" or "fat" JAR files that contain third-party
            dependencies or CDH/Cloudera Runtime classes as these can conflict with the classes
            that Yarn, Oozie, and other services automatically add to the
            CLASSPATH.
Build your Spark applications without bundling CDH/Cloudera Runtime JARs.







warningCruise Control might fail during the restart
          process when upgrading to CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.4. For more
          information, see the Cruise Control Release
          Notes.



warningCruise Control does not work properly during the upgrade process of the
        Kafka service. This also applies to rolling upgrades.


important
In Cloudera Runtime 7.1.6 and higher, the way Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) integrates
          with Streams Replication Manager (SRM) has changed. SMM can only connect to and monitor an
          SRM service that is running in the same cluster as SMM. Monitoring an SRM service that is
          running in a cluster that is external to SMM is no longer supported. 
Connectivity between the two services is disabled by default after a successful upgrade.
          If you want to continue using SMM to monitor SRM, you must reconnect the two services
          following the upgrade.
