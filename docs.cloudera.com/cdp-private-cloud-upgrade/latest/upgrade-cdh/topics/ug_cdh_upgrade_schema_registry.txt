Parent topic: Upgrading a CDH 5 Cluster


If your cluster uses Schema Registry, you need to update database related configuration
        properties. In addition, if you are using MySQL to store Schema Registry metadata, you also
        need to download the JDBC Driver for MySQL (Connector/J) to Schema Registry hosts.


Configure database related properties:noteYou can skip this step if you have already
              configured database related properties during the Cloudera Manager upgrade. 
In Cloudera Manager, select the Schema Registry service.
Go to Configuration.
Find and configure the following properties:
Schema Registry Database User Password
Schema Registry Database Type
Schema Registry Database Name
Schema Registry Database User
Schema Registry Database Host
Schema Registry Database Port 

Click Save Changes.

Download the JDBC Driver for MySQL (Connector/J) to the Schema Registry host and make
            it available in the required locations:noteThis step is only required if you are using
              MySQL to store Schema Registry metadata. Skip this step if you are using Postgres or
              Oracle.
Log in to the Schema Registry
                host.ssh [MY_SCHEMA_REGISTRY_HOST]
Download the JDBC Driver for MySQL (Connector/J) from the MySQL Product Archives.Cloudera recommends that you use version 5.1.46.
                  Examples in the following steps assume that you downloaded version 5.1.46. Make
                  sure that you download or copy the JDBC Driver for MySQL (Connector/J) archive to
                  the host that Schema Registry is deployed on.
If your cluster has internet access, download the archive directly to the
                      host.
                      wget https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/get/p/3/file/mysql-connector-java-5.1.46.tar.gz

If internet access is not available, download it on a machine that has
                      access and then copy it over to your host.


Extract the archive.Use the tar command or any other archive
                  manager to extract the
                  archive.tar -xzvf [ARCHIVE_PATH]Replace
                    [ARCHIVE_PATH] with the path to the archive you have
                  downloaded. For example,
                  /root/mysql-connector-java-5.1.46.tar.gz. 
Copy the mysql-connector-java-5.1.46-bin.jar JAR file from the
                extracted archive to the parcel
                  directory.cp [MYSQL_CONNECTOR_JAR] /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-[VERSION_NUMBER]/jarsReplace
                    [MYSQL_CONNECTOR_JAR] with the path to the connector JAR
                  file. You can find the JAR file within the directory you extracted in the previous
                  step. For example
                    /root/mysql-connector-java-5.1.46/mysql-connector-java-5.1.46-bin.jar.
                  Replace [VERSION_NUMBER] with the version number of the parcel
                  you are upgrading to. 
Create symlinks to make the connector available in the required locations by
                running the following
                commands.cd /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-[VERSION_NUMBER]/lib/schemaregistry/bootstrap/libln -s ../../../../jars/mysql-connector-java-5.1.46-bin.jar cd /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-[VERSION_NUMBER]/lib/schemaregistry/libsln -s ../../../jars/mysql-connector-java-5.1.46-bin.jar
