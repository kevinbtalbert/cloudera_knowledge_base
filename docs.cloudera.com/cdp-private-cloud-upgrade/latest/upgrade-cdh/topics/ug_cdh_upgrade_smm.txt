Parent topic: Upgrading a CDH 5 Cluster


If your cluster uses Streams Messaging Manager, you need to update database related
        configuration properties and configure the streamsmsgmgr user’s home
        directory. In addition, if you are using MySQL to store Streams Messaging Manager metadata,
        you also need to download the JDBC Driver for MySQL (Connector/J) to Streams Messaging
        Manager hosts.


Stop the Streams Messaging Manager Service:
In Cloudera Manager, select the Streams Messaging Manager service.
Click
                  Actions > Stop.
Click Stop on the next screen to confirm.When you see a
                  Finished status, the service has stopped.
Click Close.

Configure database related properties:
noteYou can skip this step if you have already configured database related
                properties during the Cloudera Manager upgrade. 

In Cloudera Manager, select the Streams Messaging Manager service.
Go to Configuration.
Find and configure the following properties:
Streams Messaging Manager Database User Password
Streams Messaging Manager Database Type
Streams Messaging Manager Database Name
Streams Messaging Manager Database User
Streams Messaging Manager Database Host
Streams Messaging Manager Database Port 

Click Save Changes.


Change the streamsmsgmgr user’s home directory:
Log in to the Streams Messaging Manager
                host.ssh [MY_STREAMS_MESSAGING_MANAGER_HOST]
Change the streamsmsgmgr user’s home directory to
                  /var/lib/streams_messaging_manager.Rhel-compatible:usermod -d /var/lib/streams_messaging_manager -m streamsmsgmgr

Download the JDBC Driver for MySQL (Connector/J) to the Streams Messaging Manager host
            and make it available in the required locations:noteThis step is only required if you
              are using MySQL to store Streams Messaging Manager metadata. Skip this step if you are
              using Postgres or Oracle. 
Download the JDBC Driver for MySQL (Connector/J) from the MySQL Product Archives. Cloudera recommends that you use version
                  5.1.46. Examples in the following steps assume that you downloaded version 5.1.46.
                  Make sure that you download or copy the JDBC Driver for MySQL (Connector/J)
                  archive to the host that Streams Messaging Manager is deployed on.
If your cluster has internet access, download the archive directly to the
                      host.
                      wget https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/get/p/3/file/mysql-connector-java-5.1.46.tar.gz

If internet access is not available, download it on a machine that has
                      access and then copy it over to your host.


Extract the archive.Use the tar command or any other archive
                  manager to extract the
                  archive.tar -xzvf [ARCHIVE_PATH]Replace
                    [ARCHIVE_PATH] with the path to the archive you have
                  downloaded. For example,
                  /root/mysql-connector-java-5.1.46.tar.gz. 
Copy the mysql-connector-java-5.1.46-bin.jar JAR file from the
                extracted archive to the parcel
                  directory.cp [MYSQL_CONNECTOR_JAR] /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-[VERSION_NUMBER]/jarsReplace
                    [MYSQL_CONNECTOR_JAR] with the path to the connector JAR
                  file. You can find the JAR file within the directory you extracted in the previous
                  step. For example,
                    /root/mysql-connector-java-5.1.46/mysql-connector-java-5.1.46-bin.jar.
                  Replace [VERSION_NUMBER] with the version number of the parcel
                  you are upgrading to. 
Create symlinks to make the connector available in the required locations by
                running the following
                commands.cd /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-[VERSION_NUMBER]/lib/streams_messaging_manager/bootstrap/libln -s ../../../../jars/mysql-connector-java-5.1.46-bin.jar cd /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-[VERSION_NUMBER]/lib/streams_messaging_manager/libsln -s ../../../jars/mysql-connector-java-5.1.46-bin.jar
