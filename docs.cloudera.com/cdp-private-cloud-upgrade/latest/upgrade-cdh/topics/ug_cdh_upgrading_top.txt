This topic describes how to upgrade a CDH or Cloudera Runtime cluster in
      any of the following scenarios:
From CDH 5.13 - CDH 5.16 to Cloudera Runtime 7.1
          or higher.


noteTo upgrade to Cloudera Manager or CDH 5.x or 6.x,
          do not use the instructions on this page. See the Cloudera Enterprise Upgrade
          Guide.

When you upgrade a cluster, you use Cloudera Manager to upgrade the
      cluster software across an entire cluster using Cloudera Parcels.
      Package-based installations are not supported for Cloudera Runtime and CDP Private Cloud Base upgrades. You must transition
      your CDH clusters to use Parcels before upgrading to CDP Private Cloud Base. See Migrating from Packages to
      Parcels.
Cluster upgrades update the Hadoop software and other components. You can
      use Cloudera Manager to upgrade a cluster for major, minor, and
      maintenance upgrades. The procedures vary depending on the version of
      Cloudera Manager you are using, the version of the cluster you are
      upgrading, and the version of Cloudera Runtime you are upgrading to. 
After completing preparatory steps, you use the Cloudera Manager upgrade
      wizard to complete the upgrade. Cloudera Manager will restart all services
      after the upgrade.
