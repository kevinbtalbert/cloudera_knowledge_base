Data Governance Support by AtlasCloudera Docs
Data Governance Support by Atlas
Both CDH  and CDP environments support governance functionality for
  Impala operations. The two environments collect similar information to
  describe Impala activities, including:


Audits for Impala access requests
Metadata describing Impala queries
Metadata describing any new data assets created or updated by
      Impala operations


The services that support these operations are different in the two
    environment. Functionality is distributed across services as
    follows:

Migrating Navigator content to Atlas
As part of upgrading a CDH cluster to CDP, Atlas replaces Cloudera Navigator
     Data Management for your cluster. You can choose to migrate your Navigator metadata to Atlas as part of upgrading.
     Migrating content from Navigator to Atlas involves 3 steps:

extracting the content from Navigator,
transforming that content into a form Atlas can consume,
importing the content into Atlas.

See Migrating Metadata from Navigator to Atlas for more
    information on the high-level migration process.
