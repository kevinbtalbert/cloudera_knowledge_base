    service installed, there are several pre-upgrades steps you are required to complete. 


noteBefore upgrading the dependent services such as HBase, you must
      verify and ensure that the HDFS safemode is off. 
noteYou must complete these steps when you run the Upgrade Wizard, after
      the Cloudera Runtime parcel has been distributed, but before finishing the
      Upgrade Wizard.

Ensure that you complete all the pre-upgrade steps if you have Apache HBase installed in
          your existing CDH cluster.
