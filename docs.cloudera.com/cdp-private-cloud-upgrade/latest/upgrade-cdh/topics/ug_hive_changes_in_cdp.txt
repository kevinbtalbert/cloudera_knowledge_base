Apache Hive Changes in CDP
You need to know where your tables are located and the property changes that the upgrade
  process makes. You need to perform some post-migration tasks before using Hive tables and handle
  semantic changes.


 Understanding Apache Hive 3 major design features, such as default ACID
      transaction processing, can help you use Hive to address the growing needs
      of enterprise data warehouse systems. 
If you are expediting the Hive upgrade process and modified the upgrade
      process to skip materializing every table in the metastore, you need to
      modify the Hive Strict Metastore Migration (HSMM) process by running the
      Hive Upgrade Check tool and provided scripts. Scripts are not included to
      address legacy Kudu storage handler classes. 

Related informationApache Hive 3 Key FeaturesApache Hive 3 Architectural OverviewHive Configuration Property ChangesYou need to know the property value changes made by the upgrade process as the change     might impact your work. You might need to consider reconfiguring property value defaults that     the upgrade changes.  LOCATION and MANAGEDLOCATION clausesBefore upgrading, your Hive version might have supported using the LOCATION clause in     queries to create either managed or external tables or databases for managed and external     tables. After upgrading, Hive stores managed and external tables in separate HDFS locations.     CREATE TABLE limits the use of the LOCATION clause, and consequently requires a change to your     queries. Hive in CDP also supports a new location-related clause.Handling table reference syntaxFor ANSI SQL compliance, Hive 3.x rejects `db.table` in SQL queries as described by the   Hive-16907 bug fix. A dot (.) is not allowed in table names. As a Data Engineer, you need to   ensure that Hive tables do not contain these references before migrating the tables to CDP, that   scripts are changed to comply with the SQL standard references, and that users are aware of the   requirement. Identifying semantic changes and workarounds As SQL Developer, Analyst, or other Hive user, you need to know potential problems         with queries due to semantic changes. Some of the operations that changed were not widely         used, so you might not encounter any of the problems associated with the changes. Hive unsupported interfaces and featuresYou need to know the interfaces available in HDP or CDH platforms that are not     supported.Changes to CDH Hive TablesAs a Data Scientist, Architect, Analyst, or other Hive user you need to locate and use   your Apache Hive 3 tables after an upgrade. You also need to understand the changes that occur   during the upgrade process. The location of existing tables after a CDH to CDP upgrade does   not change. Upgrading CDH to CDP Private Cloud Base converts Hive managed   tables to external tables in Hive 3. Changes to HDP Hive tablesAs a Data Scientist, Architect, Analyst, or other Hive user you need to locate and use your Apache Hive     3 tables after an upgrade. You also need to understand the changes that occur during the upgrade process.Parent topic: CDH 5 to CDP Private Cloud Base post-upgrade transition steps
