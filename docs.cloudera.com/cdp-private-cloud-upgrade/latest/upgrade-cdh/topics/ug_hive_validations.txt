Expediting the Hive upgrade
Preparing the Hive metastore for the upgrade can take a long time. Checking and correcting your Hive metastore partitions and SERDE definitions is critical for a successful upgrade. If you have many tables and partitions, it might be difficult to manually identify these problems. The free Hive Upgrade Check tool helps identify these problems.

 
The Hive Upgrade Check tool is Community software that
   scans your Hive metastore to identify potential upgrade problems. You can also use the tool to
   perform the following tasks: 


Convert legacy managed tables (non-acid) to external tables.


Report potential problems, such as tables that do not have matching HDFS directories, to
     resolve before the upgrade.


The cluster upgrade to CDP runs the Hive Strict Managed Migration (HSMM) process that
   performs the same tasks. During the cluster upgrade, you can skip the HSMM process, migrating
   none of your tables and database definitions.

Overview of the expedited Hive upgradeYou perform tasks before and after the Hive migration to hasten the upgrade. The   sequence of steps involved in expediting the Hive upgrade includes identifying problems in tables   and databases before upgrading, configuring the Hive Strict Managed Migration (HSMM) to prevent   migration, and completing the upgrade. After the upgrade to CDP, you migrate the tables and   databases.Understanding the Hive upgradeYou  need an understanding of the Hive Strict Managed Migration (HSMM) and the Hive   Upgrade Check tool for a successful upgrade.
