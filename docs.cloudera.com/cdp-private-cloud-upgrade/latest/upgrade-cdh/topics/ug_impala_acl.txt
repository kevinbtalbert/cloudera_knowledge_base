Set ACLs for Impala
To allow Impala to write to the Hive Warehouse Directory you must set ACLs for
        Impala.

The location of existing tables after a CDH to CDP upgrade does not change.
                In CDP, there are separate HDFS directories for managed and external tables.
The data files for managed tables are located in warehouse location specified by
                        the Cloudera Manager configuration setting, Hive Warehouse
                            Directory.
The data files for external tables are located in warehouse location specified
                        by the Cloudera Manager configuration setting, Hive Warehouse
                            External Directory.

During the upgrade from CDH to CDP, the ACL settings are taken care automatically for the default
                warehouse directories. If you decide to change the default warehouse directories after upgrading to CDP
                then you must run the commands shown in Step 3.
After upgrading, the
                    (hive.metastore.warehouse.dir) is set to
                    /warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive where the Impala managed tables are
                located. 
You can change the location of the warehouse using the Hive Metastore Action menu in Cloudera
                Manager.

Complete the initial configurations in the free-form fields on the
                    Hive/Impala Configuration pages in Cloudera
                    Manager to allow Impala to write to the Hive Warehouse Directory.


Create Hive Directories using the Hive Configuration page


Hive > Action Menu > Create Hive User Directory



Hive > Action Menu > Create Hive Warehouse  Directory



Hive > Action Menu > Create Hive Warehouse External Directory






Set Up Impala User ACLs using the Impala Configuration page


Impala > Action Menu > Set the Impala user ACLs on warehouse
                                    directory



Impala > Action Menu > Set the Impala user ACLs on external warehouse
                                    directory









Cloudera Manager sets the ACL for the user "Impala" however before starting the Impala service, verify permissions and ACLs set on the
                    individual database directories using the sub-commands getfacl
                    and setfacl.


Verify the ACLs of HDFS directories for managed and external tables
                            using getfacl.
Example:$ hdfs dfs -getfacl hdfs:///warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive
# file: hdfs:///warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive
# owner: hive
# group: hive
user::rwx
group::rwx
other::---
default:user::rwx
default:user:impala:rwx
default:group::rwx
default:mask::rwx
default:other::---
$ hdfs dfs -getfacl hdfs:///warehouse/tablespace/external/hive
# file: hdfs:///warehouse/tablespace/external/hive
# owner: hive
# group: hive
# flags: --t
user::rwx
group::rwx
other::rwx
default:user::rwx
default:user:impala:rwx
default:group::rwx
default:mask::rwx
default:other::--x


If necessary, set the ACLs of HDFS directories using
                                setfacl
Example:$ hdfs dfs -setfacl hdfs:///warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive
$ hdfs dfs -setfacl hdfs:///warehouse/tablespace/external/hive
                            For more information on using the sub-commands getfacl
                            and setfacl, see Using CLI commands to create and list
                                ACLs. 

The above examples show the user Impala as part of the Hive group. If in your setup, the user Impala does not
                        belong to the group Hive then ensure that the Group user Impala belongs to has WRITE privileges assigned on the directory.
To view the Group user Impala belongs
                            to:$ id -Gn impala
uid=973(impala) gid=971(impala) groups=971(impala),972(hive)
