Authorization Provider for Impala
In CDP, Ranger is the authorization provider instead of Sentry.
  There are some changes with how Ranger enforces a policy which may be different from using Sentry.
New behavior:

The CREATE ROLE, GRANT ROLE,
     SHOW ROLE statements are not supported as Ranger
     currently does not support roles.
When a particular resource is renamed, currently, the policy is not
     automatically transferred to the newly renamed resource.
SHOW GRANT with an invalid user/group does not
     return an error.

The following table lists the different access type requirements to run SQL statements in
   Impala.


SQL Statement
Impala Access Requirement



DESCRIBE
view
VIEW_METADATA on the underlying tables


ALTER TABLE RENAMEALTER VIEW
       RENAME
ALL on the target table / viewALTER on the source table
       / view


SHOW DATABASESSHOW
       TABLES
VIEW_METADATA


where:


VIEW_METADATA privilege denotes the SELECT, INSERT, or REFRESH privileges.
ALL privilege denotes the SELECT, INSERT, CREATE, ALTER, DROP and REFRESH
     privileges.

For more information on the minimum level of privileges and the scope
      required to execute SQL statements in Impala, see Impala Authorization.
Migrating Sentry Policies
When upgrading from CDH to CDP, all SQL permissions and Kafka permissions will be migrated.
    However if you must migrate some sentry policies from your CDH environment to the new
    environment you can use the Replication Manager service available in CDH. This service migrates
    Sentry authorization policies into Ranger as part of the replication policy. Sentry policy
    migration takes place as part of a replication policy job. When you create the replication
    policy, choose the resources that you want to migrate and the Sentry policies will be migrated
    for those resources.
For more information on using the Replication Manager service to migrate Sentry policies, see
     Sentry Policy Replication.
noteSince the authorization model in Ranger is different from Sentry's not all policies can be migrated using Replication Manager. For some
  resources you must manually create the permissions after upgrade.
