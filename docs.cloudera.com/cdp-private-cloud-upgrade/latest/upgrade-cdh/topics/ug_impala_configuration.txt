Impala Configuration Changes
The upgrade process to CDP Private Cloud Base changes the default values of some Impala
    configuration properties and adds new properties.
Impala Configuration Property Values
The following list describes Impala configuration property value changes or additions that
    occur after upgrading from CDH or HDP to CDP. These changes in properties ensure that CDP Hive
    and Impala interoperate to the best of their abilities. The CDP default might have changed in a
    way that impacts your work.
noteAfter an upgrade you may see some or all of the configurations listed here. If you do not
    see any of the following configurations by default these are the recommended configurations you
    must consider adding post upgrade in your CDP environment.

default_file_format
Before upgrade: text
After upgrade: parquetIn CDP the default Impala table file format
      changed from text to parquet. If the file format is not
       parquet, add stored as clause in the create table
      statements explicitly or change the query option default_file_format to
       text to revert to the behavior as CDH.


default_transactional_type
Before upgrade: N/A
After upgrade: insert_onlyIn CDP the default table type for managed
      tables is insert_only. If you must revert to the behavior as CDH, set
       default_transactional_type to none. These transactional tables cannot be currently
      altered in Impala using an alter statement. Similarly, Impala does not
      support compaction on transaction tables currently. You must use Hive to compact the tables as
      needed. Other operations like select, insert, insert overwrite, truncate are
      supported. For latest information, see SQL transactions in Impala.
notedefault_file_format and default_transactional_type can be
        set under Impala > Configuration > default_query_options.


hms_event_polling_interval_s
Before upgrade: 0
After upgrade: 2When raw data is inserted ingested into Tables, new
      HMS metadata and filesystem metadata are generated. In CDH, in order to pick up this new
      information, you must manually issue an Invalidate or Refresh command. However in CDP,
       hms_event_polling_interval_s property is set to 2 seconds by default. This
      option automatically refreshes the tables as changes are detected in HMS. If only specific
      tables that are not supported by event polling need to be refreshed issue a table level
      Invalidate or Refresh command.


disconnected_session_timeout
Before upgrade: N/A
After upgrade: 900In CDP Impala supports the ability to disconnect a
      connection to Impala while keeping the session running. Impala clients/drivers may support
      re-connecting to the same session even when the network connection is interrupted. By default
      disconnected sessions are not terminated until 15 minutes if you want to reconnect. You can
      adjust the disconnected_session_timeout flag to a lower value so that
      disconnected sessions are cleaned up more quickly. 


enable_orc_scanner
Before upgrade: True (preview)
After upgrade: TrueWhile using Impala to query ORC tables, set the
      command line argument enable_orc_scanner = true to re-enable ORC table
      support.


enable_insert_events
Before upgrade: N/A
After upgrade: TrueIf Impala inserts into a table it refreshes the
      underlying table/partition. When this configuration enable_insert_eventsis
      set to True Impala will generate INSERT event types which when received by other Impala
      clusters will automatically refresh the tables or partitions. Event processing must be ON, for
      this property to work.


disable_hdfs_num_rows_estimate
Before upgrade: N/A
After upgrade: FalseIn CDP Impala, if there are no statistics
      available on a table, Impala will try to estimate the cardinality by estimating the size of
      table based on the number of rows in the table. This behavior is turned ON by default to use
      when stats are not present. However you can set the query option
      disable_hdfs_num_rows_estimate = true to disable this optimization.


use_local_catalog
Before upgrade: False
After upgrade: TrueIn CDP, the on-demand
       use_local_catalog mode is set to True by default on all the
      Impala coordinators so that the Impala coordinators pull metadata as needed from catalogd and
      cache it locally. This reduces memory footprint on coordinators and automate the cache
      eviction.


catalog_topic_mode
Before upgrade: full
After upgrade: minimalIn CDP, the
      catalog_topic_mode is set to minimal by default to enable on
      demand metadata for all coordinators.
