This topic describes how to upgrade the operating system on a Cloudera
      Manager managed host.

Establish Access to
        the Software

Cloudera Manager needs access to a package repository that contains the
        updated software packages. You can choose to access the Cloudera public
        repositories directly, or you can download those repositories
          and set up a local repository to access them from within your
        network. If your cluster hosts do not have connectivity to the Internet,
        you must set up a local repository. 

 Log in to the Cloudera Manager Server host.
          ssh my_cloudera_manager_server_host

 Log in to each cluster host.
          ssh cluster_host

Remove any older files in the existing
        repository directory:
RHEL / CentOS

sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudera*manager.repo*

SLES

sudo rm /etc/zypp/repos.d/cloudera*manager.repo*

Ubuntu

sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudera*.list*


Fill in the form at the top of this page.
Create a repository file so that the package
          manager can locate and download the binaries. Do one of the following,
          depending on whether or not you are using a local package repository:

Using a local package repository. (Required when cluster
                hosts do not have access to the internet.)


Configure a
                    local package repository hosted on your network.
In the Package Repository URL,
                  replace the entire URL with the URL for your local package
                  repository. A
                    username and password are not required to access
                    local repositories.
Click Apply.



Using the Cloudera public repository


Substitute your
                      USERNAME and
                      PASSWORD in the
                    Package Repository URL where
                  indicated in the URL.
Click Apply



Package Repository URL:

tip If you have a mixed operating system
            environment, adjust the Operating System filter at the top of
            the page for each operating system. The guide will generate the repo
            file for you automatically here. 


RHEL / CentOS

Create a file named
                    /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudera-manager.repo with
                  the following content:
[cloudera-manager]
# Packages for Cloudera Manager
name=Cloudera Manager
baseurl=https://archive.cloudera.com/cm5/redhat/7/x86_64/cm/5.15
gpgkey=https://archive.cloudera.com/cm5/redhat/7/x86_64/cm/RPM-GPG-KEY-cloudera
gpgcheck=1

SLES

Create a file named
                    /etc/zypp/repos.d/cloudera-manager.repo
                  with the following content:
[cloudera-manager]
# Packages for Cloudera Manager
name=Cloudera Manager
baseurl=https://archive.cloudera.com/cm5/sles/12/x86_64/cm/5.15
gpgkey=https://archive.cloudera.com/cm5/sles/12/x86_64/cm/RPM-GPG-KEY-cloudera
gpgcheck=1

Ubuntu
Create a file
                named
                  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudera_manager.list
                with the following
                content:# Packages for Cloudera Manager
deb https://archive.cloudera.com/cm5/debian/jessie/amd64/cm/ jessie-cm5.15 contrib
deb-src https://archive.cloudera.com/cm5/debian/jessie/amd64/cm/ jessie-cm5.15 contrib
                Run the following
                command:sudo apt-get update


The
            repository file, as created, refers to the most recent
            maintenance release of the specified minor release. If you would
            like to use a specific maintenance version, for example 5.15.1, replace 5.15 with 5.15.1 in the generated repository file shown
            above.

A Cloudera Manager upgrade can introduce
          new package dependencies. Your organization may have restrictions or
          require prior approval for installation of new packages. You can
          determine which packages may be installed or upgraded: 
RHEL / CentOS

yum deplist cloudera-manager-agent

SLES

zypper info --requires cloudera-manager-agent

Ubuntu

apt-cache depends cloudera-manager-agent






Reinstall Cloudera Manager Daemon & Agent Packages

Re-install the removed Cloudera packages.

Install the agent packages. Include the
            cloudera-manager-server-db-2 package in the command
          only if you are using the embedded PostgreSQL database.

RHEL / CentOS

sudo yum clean all
sudo yum install cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2

SLES

sudo zypper clean --all
sudo zypper install cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2

Ubuntu

sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2




Verify that the configuration files (that were backed up) are intact.
        Correct if necessary.



Reinstall Cloudera Manager Server, Daemon & Agent Packages

Re-install the removed Cloudera packages.

Install the packages. Include the
            cloudera-manager-server-db-2 package in the command
          only if you are using the embedded PostgreSQL database.

RHEL / CentOS

sudo yum clean all
sudo yum install cloudera-manager-server cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2

SLES

sudo zypper clean --all
sudo zypper install cloudera-manager-server cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2

Ubuntu

sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cloudera-manager-server cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2




Verify that the configuration files (that were backed up) are intact.
        Correct if necessary.
 If you customized the
          /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini file, your
        customized file is renamed with the extension .rpmsave
        or .dpkg-old. Merge any customizations into the
          /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini file that is
        installed by the package manager. 
Edit Cloudera repository file to point to the repositories designed for
        your new operating system.



Start Databases


If you are using the embedded PostgreSQL
        database, start the
        database:sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-server-db

If there were database servers stopped, they must be restarted.




Start Cloudera Manager Server & Agent

The appropriate services typically will start automatically on reboot.
        Otherwise, start the Cloudera Manager Server & Agent as necessary.


          Start the rpcbind service if it is not automatically started.
          sudo service rpcbind start
Start the Cloudera Manager Agent.
        
RHEL 7, SLES 12, Ubuntu 18.04 and higher

sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-agent
              If the agent starts without errors, no response displays. 
RHEL 5 or 6, SLES 11, Debian 6 or 7, Ubuntu
          12.04 or 14.04

sudo service cloudera-scm-agent start
              You should see the following: Starting cloudera-scm-agent: [ OK ]
importantA restart of Cloudera Manager Agents is
                required on all hosts in the cluster.


Start the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-server

Verify that the Cloudera Manager Agent
          downloaded a proper parcel for your new operating system. You can use
          the following command to check in Cloudera Manager logs for downloaded
          parcels:
          grep "Completed download" /var/log/cloudera-scm-agent/cloudera-scm-agent.log
          (Download might take some time. Look for the operating system in the
          names of the downloaded parcels. 




Start Roles


From the All Hosts page, select the host that you have just upgraded.

          Choose End Maintenance (Enable Alerts/Decommission) from the Actions menu
          and confirm.
Start any Cloudera Management Service roles that were running on this host and
          were stopped.

          Choose Host Recommission from the Actions menu and confirm.

          Choose Start Roles on Hosts from the Actions menu and confirm.
Start any services that were stopped due to lack of high availability.
