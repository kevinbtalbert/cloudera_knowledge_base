Step 1: Getting Started with Operating System Upgrades





Parent topic: Upgrading the Operating System
Prerequisites


Ensure that the versions of Cloudera Manager and CDH or Cloudera
          Runtime support your new operating system. 
See Operating System
                Requirements for CDP Private Cloud Base. 
If you are using unsupported versions, see Upgrade Cloudera Manager or Upgrading a
          Cluster.
Ensure that the host has access to the Cloudera Manager server,
          daemon and agent packages that are supported for the new operating
          system, either by having access to
            https://archive.cloudera.com or a local package
            repository. 
Ensure that the Cloudera Manager server has access to the parcels
          that are using supported for the new Operating System, either by
          having access to https://archive.cloudera.com or a
            local parcel
            repository.
If you have a patched package or parcel installed, make sure you
          have the same package or parcel for the new Operating System and it
          has been made available to Cloudera Manager.
Understand that performing a major release upgrade for the operating
          system in-place may be quite tricky and risky.
