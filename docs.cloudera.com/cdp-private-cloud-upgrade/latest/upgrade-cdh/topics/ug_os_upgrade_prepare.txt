This topic describes steps you must perform before upgrading the
      operating system on a host managed by Cloudera Manager.


Parent topic: Upgrading the Operating System
Decommission and Stop Running Roles


Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin
          Console.
From the All Hosts page, select the host that
          you wish to upgrade. Cloudera recommends that you upgrade only one
          host at a time.
 Select Begin Maintenance
            (Suppress Alerts/Decommission) from the
            Actions menu. 
 Select Host
            Decommission from the Actions
          menu. Any roles that do not require decommission will be skipped.
If the operating system upgrade procedure takes less than 30 minutes
          per node, you do not need to decommission the DataNode.If the Cloudera Manager and CDH/
            version are both 5.14 or greater, you can also choose the Take
              DataNode Offline feature.If in doubt, decommission the
            roles.
When a DataNode is decommissioned, the NameNode ensures that
              every block from the DataNode is still available across the
              cluster as specified by the replication factor. This procedure
              involves copying blocks off the DataNode in small batches. In
              cases where a DataNode has several thousand blocks,
              decommissioning takes several hours.
 When a DataNode is turned off without being decommissioned: 
The NameNode marks the DataNode as dead after a default of
                  10m 30s (controlled by the
                    dfs.heartbeat.interval and
                    dfs.heartbeat.recheck.interval
                  configuration properties).
The NameNode schedules the missing replicas to be placed on
                  other DataNodes.
When the DataNode comes back online and reports to the
                  NameNode, the NameNode schedules blocks to be copied to it
                  while other nodes are decommissioned or when new files are
                  written to HDFS. 


You can also speed up the decommissioning of a DataNode by
              increasing values for these properties: 
dfs.max-repl-streams: The number of
                  simultaneous streams used to copy data.
dfs.balance.bandwidthPerSec: The maximum
                  amount of bandwidth that each DataNode can utilize for
                  balancing, in bytes per second.
dfs.namenode.replication.work.multiplier.per.iteration:
                  NameNode configuration requiring a restart, defaults to 2 but
                  can be raised to 10 or higher.This determines the total
                    amount of block transfers to begin in parallel at a DataNode
                    for replication, when such a command list is being sent over
                    a DataNode heartbeat by the NameNode. The actual number is
                    obtained by multiplying this value by the total number of
                    live nodes in the cluster. The result number is the number
                    of blocks to transfer immediately, per DataNode
                    heartbeat.



 Once that  is completed,
          select the same host again and choose Stop Roles on
            Hosts.

warningIf you have not enabled high availability for HDFS,
        HBase, MapReduce, YARN, Oozie, or Sentry, stopping the running single
        master role will cause an outage for that service. Specifically, secondary
        roles on other hosts will stop abruptly. Cloudera recommends that you
        stop these services prior to the host upgrade. 
importantWhen upgrading hosts that are part of a ZooKeeper
        quorum, ensure that the majority of the quorum is still
        available.



Stop Cloudera Manager Agent


Hard Stop the Cloudera Manager
          Agent. 
RHEL 7, SLES 12, Ubuntu 18.04 and higher

sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-supervisord.service

RHEL 5 or 6, SLES 11, Debian 6 or 7, Ubuntu
          12.04 or 14.04


sudo service cloudera-scm-agent hard_stop



importantThis will ask you to confirm with
              hard_stop_confirmed because this will terminate
            any Hadoop services on the host (if any) unconditionally.






Stop Cloudera Manager Server & Agent


Hard Stop the Cloudera Manager
          Agent. 
RHEL 7, SLES 12, Ubuntu 18.04 and higher

sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-supervisord.service

RHEL 5 or 6, SLES 11, Debian 6 or 7, Ubuntu
          12.04 or 14.04


sudo service cloudera-scm-agent hard_stop



importantThis will ask you to confirm with
              hard_stop_confirmed because this will terminate
            any Hadoop services on the host (if any) unconditionally.


 Stop the Cloudera Management Service.
          
Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
Select
                Clusters > Cloudera
                Management Service.
Select
                Actions > Stop.


Stop the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-server





Stop Databases


If you are using the embedded PostgreSQL
        database, stop the Cloudera Manager Embedded PostgreSQL database:
RHEL 7, SLES 12, Ubuntu 18.04 and higher

sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-server-db

RHEL 5 or 6, SLES 11, Debian 6 or 7, Ubuntu
          12.04 or 14.04

sudo service cloudera-scm-server-db stop

If you are not using the embedded PostgreSQL database and you
          attempt to stop it, you might see a message indicating that the
          service cannot be found. If you see a message that the shutdown
          failed, then the embedded database is still running, probably because
          services are connected to the Hive metastore. If the database shutdown
          fails due to connected services, issue the following command:
          RHEL-compatible 7 and higher, Ubuntu
          16.04sudo service cloudera-scm-server-db next_stop_fast
sudo service cloudera-scm-server-db stop

All other Linux
          distributionssudo service cloudera-scm-server-db fast_stop

If there are other database servers running on this host, they must
          be stopped also.




Remove Packages & Parcels

Packages for the older operating system wonâ€™t be able to start on the
        new operating system. Remove old packages from the host.



RHEL / CentOS

sudo yum remove cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2

SLES

sudo zypper remove cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2

Ubuntu

sudo apt-get purge cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2





RHEL / CentOS

sudo yum remove cloudera-manager-server cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2

SLES

sudo zypper remove cloudera-manager-server cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2

Ubuntu

sudo apt-get purge cloudera-manager-server cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2




Remove old CDH parcels from the host. These are built for your old
            operating system.
The Cloudera Manager agent will download and activate the proper
            parcel for the new operating system when it is started.
Empty the contents of the following directories. These are the
            defaults for parcel storage - if you use other directories, please
            change accordingly.
sudo rm -rf /opt/cloudera/parcels/*
sudo rm -rf /opt/cloudera/parcel-cache/*





Upgrade the Operating System

importantWhen there are no Hadoop services or Cloudera
        Manager roles running from this host, you may proceed to upgrade the
        operating system of this host, make sure to leave the data partitions
        (for example, dfs.data.dir) unchanged.
Use the operating system upgrade procedures provided by your operating
        system vendor (for example: RedHat or Ubuntu) to download their software
        and perform the operating system upgrade.
