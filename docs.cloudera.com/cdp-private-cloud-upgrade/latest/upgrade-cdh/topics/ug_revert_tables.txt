Revert to CDH-like Tables
In CDH 5 and CDH 6, CREATE TABLE created managed non-ACID tables in 
        text format. In CDP, CREATE TABLE creates an INSERT-ONLY table
        in parquet format. After upgrading, to avoid code changes due to new features in CDP,
        you might want want to disable the new transactional (ACID) table type and parquet file
        format defaults. The old table type and file format (managed, non-transactional and text)
        take effect when you disable the new defaults. 
To disable the new defaults:

In Cloudera Manager > Clusters select the Impala service. Click
            Configuration and search for Impala
            Daemon Query Options.




In Impala Daemon Query Options Advanced Configuration Snippet
          (Safety Valve) for default_query_options edit the
            default_file_format=text and
            default_transactional_type=none properties.
