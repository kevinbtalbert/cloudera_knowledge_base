Transitioning from MapReduce 1 to MapReduce 2
Before upgrading your cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base, you must import the configuration settings from MapReduce version 1 (MRv1) to MapReduce version 2 (MRv2) for the cluster to benefit from the improvements in MRv2 such as the separation of cluster resource management capabilities from MapReduce-specific logic.


MapReduce 2 is an upgrade to the way that scheduling, resource management, and execution occur
   in Hadoop. At their core, the improvements separate cluster resource management capabilities from
   MapReduce-specific logic. They enable Hadoop to share resources dynamically between MapReduce and
   other parallel processing frameworks, such as Impala, allow more sensible and finer-grained
   resource configuration for better cluster utilization, and permit it to scale to accommodate more
   and larger jobs.
For more information about the new architecture, see Understanding YARN
    architecture in the Cloudera Runtime documentation.

Upgrading an MRv1 installation using Cloudera ManagerYou must manually import the MapReduce configurations to YARN using Cloudera Manager and overwrite existing YARN configuration and role assignments so that  the services use YARN as the computation framework instead of MapReduce version 1 (MRv1).Major changes when migrating to MapReduce 2Reviewing the differences between MapReduce version 1 (MRv1) and MapReduce version 2 (MRv2) helps you to understand the changes to the capabilities and services that have replaced the deprecated ones.Configuration changes between MRv1 and MRv2Reviewing the differences between MapReduce version 1 (MRv1) and YARN/MapReduce version 2 (MRv2) helps you to understand the changes to the configuration parameters that have replaced the deprecated ones.Parent topic: CDP Private Cloud Base Pre-upgrade transition steps
