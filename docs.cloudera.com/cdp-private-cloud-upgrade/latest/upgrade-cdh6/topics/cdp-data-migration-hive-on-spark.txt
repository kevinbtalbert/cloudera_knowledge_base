Removing Hive on Spark Configurations
Your scripts, or queries, include the Hive on Spark configuration, which is no longer
        supported, and you must know how to recognize and remove these configurations.
In CDP, there is no Hive-Spark dependency. The Spark site and libs are not in the classpath.
            This execution engine has been replaced by Apache Tez.
Before Upgrade to CDP
CDH supported Hive on Spark and the following configuration to enable Hive on Spark:
        set hive.execution.engine=spark
After Upgrade to CDP
CDP does not support Hive on Spark. Scripts that enable Hive on Spark do not
      work.
Action Required
Remove set hive.execution.engine=spark from your scripts.
