 After the workloads are executed on Spark 2.4, validate the output, and compare the
            performance of the jobs with CDH/HDP cluster executions. After you perform the post
            migration configurations, do benchmark testing on Spark 2.4. 
Troubleshoot the failed/slow performing workloads by analyzing the application
            event logs/driver logs and fine tune the workloads for better performance.
