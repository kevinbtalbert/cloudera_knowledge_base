Type of change: Property/Spark core changes
Spark 1.6 - 2.3
You can create a managed table having a nonempty location.
Spark 2.4
Creating a managed table with nonempty location is not allowed. In Spark 2.4,
  an error occurs when there is a write operation, such as
  df.write.mode(SaveMode.Overwrite).saveAsTable("testdb.testtable").
  The error side-effects are the cluster is terminated while the
  write is in progress, a temporary network issue occurs, or the job is interrupted. 
Action Required
Set spark.sql.legacy.allowCreatingManagedTableUsingNonemptyLocation to true at
   runtime as
   follows:spark.conf.set("spark.sql.legacy.allowCreatingManagedTableUsingNonemptyLocation","true")
