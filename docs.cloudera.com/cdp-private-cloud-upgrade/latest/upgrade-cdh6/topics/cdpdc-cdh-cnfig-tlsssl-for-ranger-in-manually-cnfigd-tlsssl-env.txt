Configure TLS/SSL for Ranger in a manually configured TLS/SSL environment
How to manually configure TSL/SSL for Ranger in a manually configured TLS/SSL
        environment.

If you use manual TLS encryption on CDH and you plan to enable TLS for Ranger during
                the CDP upgrade, you must ensure that the Ranger Admin certificate is imported into
                the truststore file configuration of all services that support Ranger plugins.
note
If you have existing CA-signed certificates for keystores and truststores deployed
                    across all the cluster hosts, then continue to use the same for the Ranger service.
                    In this case you can skip the steps in this topic that create a self-signed
                    certificate. Proceed to Upgrade the Cluster Step 4 : Add Ranger service from
                        CM Upgrade Wizard and update the TLS/SSL configurations.



Create a keystore file for Ranger Admin.
mkdir -p /etc/security/serverKeys

${JAVA_HOME}/bin/keytool -genkeypair -alias {ALIAS} 
-keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 360 
-keystore /etc/security/serverKeys/ranger-admin-keystore.jks 
-storepass {STOREPASS}Where
ALIAS
A unique alias specified for creating the keystore file. This
            can be Ranger Admin host FQDN/UQDN where it is going to be
            installed or can use custom text.note If
                upgrading to CDP <= 7.1.4, it is recommended to use the
                host FQDN.
STOREPASS
A password which is used to protect the keystore.
chown -R ranger:ranger /etc/security/serverKeys/ranger-admin-keystore.jks

Export the certificate from the Ranger Admin keystore and create a certificate file.
${JAVA_HOME}/bin/keytool -exportcert -keystore 
/etc/security/serverKeys/ranger-admin-keystore.jks -alias {ALIAS} -file 
/etc/security/serverKeys/ranger-admin-trust.cer
Where
ALIAS
Use the same alias used for creating the keystore file
                                ranger-admin-keystore.jks, as we are exporting the certificate
                                associated with that alias.note No need
                                    to provide a -storepass password to secure the
                                    certificate file.


Import Ranger Admin certificate into a truststore file for creating a
                    "trusted certificate".
${JAVA_HOME}/bin/keytool -importcert -file /etc/security/serverKeys/ranger-admin-trust.cer 
-alias {ALIAS} -keystore /etc/security/serverKeys/ranger-truststore.jks -storepass
{STOREPASS}
Where
ALIAS
Assign any alias name.
STOREPASS
A password to secure the truststore file.

note You must also import Solr Server certificate into
                            /etc/security/serverKeys/ranger-truststore.jks, if
                        Solr (CDP-INFRA-SOLR) Server has TLS enabled. This will help Ranger Admin to
                        connect Solr for creating ranger_audits collection.

Enter the alias used for the keystore file
                                                  created in Step 1 : Creating a keystore file

The {{RANGER_ADMIN_HOST}} is a placeholder value
                                                  which will be replaced with the host FQDN where
                                                  Ranger Admin will be installed in the current
                                                  cluster when Auto-TLS is enabled which uses host
                                                  FQDN as alias while creating keystore file. The
                                                  placeholder can be replaced to have custom alias
                                                  value in case of manual TLS/SSL setup. If using a

                                                  short name then use {{RANGER_ADMIN_HOST_UQDN}}
                                                  placeholder as a value.

If a service has an existing truststore file, use that to import the
                            Ranger Admin certificate. If not, then add a new truststore file and
                            update the above configs.


Import the Ranger Admin certificate into the existing/new truststore
                            file.

${JAVA_HOME}/bin/keytool -importcert -file 
/etc/security/serverKeys/ranger-admin-trust.cer -alias {ALIAS} -keystore 
{TRUSTSTORE} -storepass {STOREPASS}
Where
ALIAS
Assign any alias name.
STOREPASS
A password to secure the truststore file.
TRUSTSTORE
EITHER an existing truststore file used by the service
                                            to import the Ranger Admin certificate OR a new
                                            truststore file which will have Ranger Admin
                                            certificate.




If using existing CA-signed certificates then add the path of the
                            existing truststore file.


Proceed to upgrade wizard for further other tasks.



Migrate Key Trustee KMS to Ranger KMS KTS.


If you have Key Trustee service present in the cluster, Ranger KMS KTS will be
                            added from the backend as part of the upgrade flow.


To successfull start Ranger KMS KTS service in the upgrade flow:




Change the alias of the keystore file used by Key Trustee KMS to point to the
                            hostname where it is installed. Check Key Management Server Proxy TLS/SSL
                                Server JKS Keystore File Location config to get the keystore
                            file.
${JAVA_HOME}/bin/keytool -changealias -alias {EXISTING_ALIAS} -destalias 
`hostname -f` -keystore {KT_KMS_KEYSTORE}note
    In a High Availability envrionment, perform this step on all KT KMS
    servers.


Import Ranger Admin certificate into truststore file used by KT KMS. Check
                            Key Management Server Proxy TLS/SSL Trust Store File config to
                            get the truststore file getting used.
