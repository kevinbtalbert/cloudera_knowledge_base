CDH cluster upgrade requirements for Replication Manager
Reviewing the CDH cluster upgrade guidelines and requirements for Replication Manager help you to upgrade successfully. Before you start the upgrade, check the version numbers to ensure that the clusters are in sync. 




Ensure that the supported source and target clusters and the corresponding
                    Cloudera Manager versions are in sync with respect to the cluster configurations
                    prior to starting the upgrade. 
Upgrade your target cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base first. Upgrading the target CDH cluster
                    first ensures that your data on the source cluster is not corrupted or rendered
                    invalid.
Upgrade the source cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base after the data is transitioned to the
                    CDP Private Cloud Base cluster (target). And, later verify that both source and target clusters
                    are upgraded to CDP Private Cloud Base clusters.
