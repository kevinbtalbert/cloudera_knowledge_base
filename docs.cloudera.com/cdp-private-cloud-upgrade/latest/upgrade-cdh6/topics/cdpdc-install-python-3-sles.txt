Installing Python 3.8 on SLES 12 for Hue
You must install Python 3.8 on all hosts on which you want to run the Hue service
        after installing Cloudera Manager and before adding the services to your
        cluster.

Install the necessary developer tools such as gcc and
                    make on your system.
Install the openssl package, and place its binaries in the
                    /lib/ directory. This is needed for installing the MySQL
                client on MySQL and MariaDB databases.
Download the openssl package on the host on which you want to install the
                        Python 3.8 package and decompress the
                        file:cd /opt wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.2o.tar.gztar -xzf openssl-1.0.2o.tar.gz
Change directory to
                        openssl-1.0.2o:cd cd openssl-1.0.2o
Run the following commands to build and compile the
                        files:./config --shared
make
make install
Copy the following files to the /lib/
                        directory:cp libcrypto.so /lib/
cp libssl.so /lib/
cp libcrypto.a /lib/
cp libssl.a /lib/
cp libcrypto.pc /lib/
cp libssl.pc /lib/
cp openssl.pc /lib/
Delete the openssl-1.0.2o.tar.gz file that you had
                        downloaded:rm ./openssl-1.0.2o.tar.gz
Configure openssl as
                        follows:custom_openssl = " --with-openssl=/opt/openssl-1.0.2o"
./configure --enable-shared[***CUSTOM-OPENSSL***]

Install the following packages before installing Python 3.8:
libffi-devel-gcc5
libbz2-devel
libzip2
libffi-devel
libz1
zlib-devel
zypper install -y libffi-devel-gcc5 libbz2-devel libzip2 libffi-devel libz1 zlib-devel


SSH into the host system as a root user.

Download Python 3.8 and decompress the package by running the following
                    commands:

cd /opt
curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.12/Python-3.8.12.tgz


tar -zxvf Python-3.8.12.tgz


Change directory to where you decompressed the Python 3.8 package:

cd /opt/Python-3.8.12


Install Python 3.8 as follows:

./configure --enable-shared --prefix=[***CUSTOM-INSTALL-PATH***]


noteBy default, Python could be installed in any one of the
                        following locations: 
/usr/bin
/usr/local/python38/bin
/usr/local/bin
/opt/rh/rh-python38/root/usr/bin
If you are installing Python 3.8 in any other location, then you
                            must specify the path using the --prefix option. You
                            must also create a symbolic link pointing to
                                /usr/bin or to
                                /usr/local/bin by running the following
                            command:ln -s [***SOURCE***] [***DESTINATION***]For
                            example:
                            ln -s [***CUSTOM-PYTON-PATH***]/python3.8 /usr/bin/python3.8

The --enabled-shared option is used to build a shared library
                    instead of a static library.

Build Python 3.8 as follows:


Run the make command to compile the files:

make



Run the following command to put the compiled files in the default
                            location or in the custom location that you specified using the
                                --prefix option:

make install



Copy the shared compiled library files (libpython3.8.so) to the
                                /lib64/ directory:

cp --no-clobber ./libpython3.8.so* /lib64/

The --no-clobber option is used to prevent
                            overwriting files.


Change the permissions of the libpython3.8.so files as follows:

chmod 755 /lib64/libpython3.8.so*



If you see an error such as error while loading shared libraries:
                        libpython3.8.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
                        directory, then run the following command:
                    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/

Change the permission of the Python 3.8 installation directory to
                        755 so that Hue and its related services can leverage the
                    binary and the site packages, as follows:

chmod -R 755 /usr/local/lib/python3.8




(For Hue) If you have installed Python 3.8 at a custom location, then you must
                    append the custom path in Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Hue > Configuration > Hue Service Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                            Valve) separated by colon (:) as follows and restart the Hue
                            service:Key:
                            PATHValue:
                            [***CUSTOM-INSTALL-PATH***]:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:
Clean up the compiled openssl artifacts by running the following commands:
                    rm /lib/libcrypto.so
rm /lib/libssl.so
rm /lib/libcrypto.a
rm /lib/libssl.a
rm /lib/libcrypto.pc
rm /lib/libssl.pc
rm /lib/openssl.pc
