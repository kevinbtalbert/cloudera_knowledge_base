How to fill in forms to customize the documentation for your
    upgrade.
This online version of the Cloudera Upgrade Guide allows you to
      create a customized version of the guide on many pages that only includes
      the steps required for your upgrade. Use the My
        Environment form at the top of pages in this guide to select
      the Cloudera Manager, CDH or Cloudera Runtime version for your upgrade as
      well as the operating system version, database type, and other information
      about your upgrade. After making these selections, the pages in the guide
      will only include the required steps for your upgrade. The information you
      enter is retained on each page in the guide.
