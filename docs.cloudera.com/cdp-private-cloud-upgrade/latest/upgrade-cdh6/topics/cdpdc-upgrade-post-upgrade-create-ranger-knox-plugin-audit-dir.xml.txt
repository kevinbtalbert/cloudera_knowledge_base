Apache Knox - create plugin audit directory
To create hdfs audit directories, you must create the Ranger Knox plugin audit
        directory manually, post-upgrade.

If you add the Knox service after upgrading a CDH 5.x/6.x cluster to CDP, you must
                create the Ranger Knox plugin audit dirctory manually in order for the hdfs audit
                directory to exist.


Install the Knox service. See related topics for more information about installing
                Knox.


From Cloudera Manager, go to Knox > Action > Create Knox Plugin Audit Directory.

Restart Knox.
