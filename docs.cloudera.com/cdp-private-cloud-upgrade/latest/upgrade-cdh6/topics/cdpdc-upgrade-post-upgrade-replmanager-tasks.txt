Update permissions for Replication Manager service
After the upgrade process is complete, you must update the
    permissions in the Ranger audit log path in HDFS, so that the data
    replication using Replication Manager works as expected.



noteIf your CDP Private Cloud Base cluster has Ranger
        configured, the hdfs user should have access to all Hive datasets, including all
        operations. Else, Hive import fails during the replication process. For more information,
        see Providing access to hdfs user.
Perform the following steps to update the Ranger audit permissions:


Add the user to the user-groups (supergroup, hdfs, hadoop) on all the hosts, including
          the source and target clusters. 
The user name you specify here is to be used in the Run as
            Username field when you create a replication policy to run the replication
          job. 

Provide “hive” user permissions in HDFS in the Ranger UI.




To add the user to the user-groups, run the following
            commands:> sudo usermod -a -G hdfs [***user***]
> sudo usermod -a -G hadoop [***user***]
> id -Gn [***user***]
> sudo groupadd supergroup
> sudo usermod -a -G supergroup [***user***]
> hdfs groups [***user***]

To provide permissions for the Ranger audit log path in HDFS:


Log in to Ranger Admin UI.

Provide "hive" user permission to "all-path" in
              hdfs under the cm_hdfs section.
