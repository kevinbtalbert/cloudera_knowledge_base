note The KTS to Ranger KMS migration utility may exit with output
      similar
      to:Following users do not exist in Ranger DB: [csso_xxxx, user01, csso_xxx2, ser2_old]
Following groups do not exist in Ranger DB: [usergroup1, usergroup2, unknown_test_group, usergroup_old]
To fix this problem, either add the users/groups to your user management system and re-sync the users/groups,    
or, create the listed users/groups in Ranger, using the Ranger Admin Web UI: https://<servername>.root.hwx.site:6182/ The
  workaround is to add the required users and groups in the ranger database, as internal
  users and groups, using the Ranger Admin Web UI, then resume the upgrade
  process.
