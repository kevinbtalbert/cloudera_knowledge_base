Validate TLS configurations
If you are upgrading to from CDH to Cloudera Manager 7.4.4 or earlier, you need to
        validate TLS configurations. By validating TLS, you can avoid upgrade failure by properly
        configuring Cloudera Manager properties if your clusters are TLS-enabled. 
 Cloudera Manager does not configure the following properties for Hive metastore
                (HMS):
HDFS NameNode TLS/SSL Trust Store File (namenode_truststore_file)
HDFS NameNode TLS/SSL Trust Store Password (namenode_truststore_password)
Hive Metastore TLS/SSL Trust Store File
                    (hive.metastore.dbaccess.ssl.truststore.path)
Hive Metastore TLS/SSL Trust Store Password
                    (hive.metastore.dbaccess.ssl.truststore.password)
These configurations are required. Ranger Plugin needs to validate the TLS
            connection to Ranger to download policies. The Hive Strict Managed Migration (HSMM)
            reports success, but actually fails. The HSMM log appears as
                follows:HiveStrictManagedMigration: [main]: Found 0 databases
HiveStrictManagedMigration: [main]: Done processing databasesYou
                must configure the HDFS and HMS truststore file and password properties after
                upgrading Cloudera Manager to 7.3.1 or later.



You completed the upgrade to Cloudera Manager 7.4.4 or earlier.
Your CDP cluster will be TLS-enabled.
