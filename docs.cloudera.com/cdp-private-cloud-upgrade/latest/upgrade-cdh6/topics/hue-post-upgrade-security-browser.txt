Adding Security Browser to the blocked list of applications
The Security Browser application is no longer supported in Hue on CDP. If you were
        using Sentry on your CDH cluster and a Security Browser in Hue, then you must manually add
        the Security Browser application to the list of blocked applications in the Hue Advanced
        Configuration Snippet after upgrading to CDP.

After upgrading from CDH to CDP, you may see the following error when accessing the
                Security Browser: “Failed to connect to Sentry server localhost”.
                To prevent this error:


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                            hue_safety_valve.ini and append security to the
                        app_blacklist property. For example:

[desktop]
app_blacklist=pig,spark,security


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
