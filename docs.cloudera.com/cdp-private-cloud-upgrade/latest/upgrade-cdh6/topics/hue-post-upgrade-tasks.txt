Hue post-upgrade tasks
Review the changes for the Hive editor and the Security Browser after upgrading from CDH
  5 or CDH 6 to CDP to avoid access issues.
You must install the Query Processor service on your CDP Private Cloud Base clusters manually
      to use features and functionality of DAS in Hue.

Updating group permissions for Hive query editorIn CDH 5 and CDH 6, the beeswax.access permission governs access to the Hive editor         in Hue. In CDP, access to the Hive editor is governed by the hive.access permission and the         permission is added to the default group, by default. If you upgrade from CDH 5 or CDH 6 to         CDP, and if you are not a part of the default group, then you may not be able to access the         Hive editor. You must manually grant the hive.access permission to your user         groups.Adding Security Browser to the blocked list of applicationsThe Security Browser application is no longer supported in Hue on CDP. If you were         using Sentry on your CDH cluster and a Security Browser in Hue, then you must manually add         the Security Browser application to the list of blocked applications in the Hue Advanced         Configuration Snippet after upgrading to CDP.Adding Query Processor service to a clusterThe Query Processor service indexes Hive and Tez events and provides APIs to access         them. It is required if you want to view the Queries tab (query history and query details)         on the Hue Job Browser. You must install the Query             Processor service on your CDP Private Cloud Base clusters manually.Parent topic: CDH 6 to CDP Private Cloud Base post-upgrade transition steps
