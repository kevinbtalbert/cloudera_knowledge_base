Upgrading Cloudera Navigator Key HSM
Parent topic: Step 5: After You Upgrade Cloudera Manager
Setting Up an Internal Repository

Although it is possible to upgrade Cloudera Navigator KeyHSM by using the KeyHSM RPM
        package directly, Cloudera recommends setting up a YUM package repository to perform the
        upgrade. The steps given below assume that a repository containing the KeyHSM RPM package
        downloaded from the paywall has been created. For more information on creating such a
        repository, see https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/CreateLocalRepos.



Upgrading Key HSM (Minor and Patch Version Upgrades)

If you are upgrading from Key HSM 1.x (shipped with CDH 5.x and earlier) to Key HSM 7.x,
        use the instructions in Upgrading Key HSM (Major Version Upgrades); do not use
        the procedure documented in this section.
importantIf you have implemented Key Trustee Server high availability, upgrade
        Key HSM on each Key Trustee Server.

Install the KeyHSM RepositoryAdd the internal repository that you
          created.
Stop the Key HSM ServiceStop the Key HSM service before
            upgrading:sudo service keyhsm shutdown
Upgrade Navigator Key HSMUpgrade the Navigator Key HSM package using
              yum:sudo yum update keytrustee-keyhsmCloudera
            Navigator Key HSM is installed to the
              /usr/share/keytrustee-server-keyhsm directory by default.

            service:sudo service keyhsm start




Upgrading Key HSM (Major Version Upgrades)

importantOnly use this procedure if you are upgrading from Key HSM 1.x
          (shipped with CDH 5.x and earlier) to Key HSM 7.x. There is a unique configuration
        issue that impacts this upgrade scenario, and the steps here are different from those
        required for all minor Key HSM upgrades. This procedure is not applicable to minor
        version or patch release upgrades.

Install the KeyHSM RepositoryAdd the internal repository that you
          created.
Stop the Key HSM ServiceStop the Key HSM service before
            upgrading:sudo service keyhsm shutdown
Upgrade Navigator Key HSMUpgrade the Navigator Key HSM package using
              yum:sudo yum update keytrustee-keyhsmCloudera
            Navigator Key HSM is installed to the
              /usr/share/keytrustee-server-keyhsm directory by default.
Rename Configuration Files that were created earlierFor Key HSM major version
            upgrades, previously-created configuration files do not authenticate with the HSM and
            Key Trustee Server, so you must recreate these files by re-executing the
              setup and trust commands. First, navigate to the Key
            HSM installation directory and rename the applications.properties,
              keystore, and truststore
          files:cd /usr/share/keytrustee-server-keyhsm/
mv application.properties application.properties.bak
mv keystore keystore.bak
mv truststore truststore.bak
Initialize Key HSMRun the service keyhsm setup command in
            conjunction with the name of the target HSM distribution:
            sudo service keyhsm setup [keysecure|thales|luna]For
            more details, see Initializing Navigator Key HSM. 
Establish Trust Between Key HSM and the Key Trustee ServerThe Key HSM service
            must explicitly trust the Key Trustee Server certificate (presented during TLS
            handshake). To establish this trust, run the following
            command:sudo keyhsm trust /path/to/key_trustee_server/certFor
            more details, see Integrating Key HSM with Key Trustee
          Server.
Start the Key HSM ServiceStart the Key HSM
            service:sudo service keyhsm start
Establish Trust Between Key Trustee Server and Key HSM
Establish trust between the Key Trustee Server and the Key HSM by specifying the path
            to the private key and
            certificate:sudo ktadmin keyhsm --server https://keyhsm01.example.com:9090 \
--client-certfile /etc/pki/cloudera/certs/mycert.crt \
--client-keyfile /etc/pki/cloudera/certs/mykey.key --trustFor a
            password-protected Key Trustee Server private key, add the --passphrase
            argument to the command (enter the password when
            prompted):sudo ktadmin keyhsm --passphrase \
--server https://keyhsm01.example.com:9090 \
--client-certfile /etc/pki/cloudera/certs/mycert.crt \
--client-keyfile /etc/pki/cloudera/certs/mykey.key --trustFor
            additional details, see Integrating Key HSM with Key Trustee
          Server.
Remove Configuration Files From Previous InstallationAfter completing the
            upgrade, remove the saved configuration files from the previous
            installation:cd /usr/share/keytrustee-server-keyhsm/
rm application.properties.bak
rm keystore.bak
rm truststore.bak




Key Trustee Server SSL Certificate Regeneration

When Key HSM is upgraded to CDP version 7.1.4 or above, the SSL certificates of the Key
        Trustee Server (KTS) might need to be regenerated if the self-signed certificates that are
        created by the ktadmin command are being used.
Perform the following steps to regenerate the KTS SSL certificate:

Stop the KTS service from Cloudera Manager.

Navigate to the location /var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee/.ssl/
            to take a backup of the certificate files
              ssl-cert-keytrustee-pk.pem and
              ssl-cert-keytrustee.pem:

cd /var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee/.ssl/



Backup the certificate
            files:mv ssl-cert-keytrustee-pk.pem ssl-cert-keytrustee-pk_backup.pem
mv ssl-cert-keytrustee.pem ssl-cert-keytrustee_backup.pem



Regenerate the certificate
            file:ktadmin init


Configure the Key HSM to trust the new certificate
            file:keyhsm trust /var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee/.ssl/ssl-cert-keytrustee.pem

Restart the Key HSM service.
Start the KTS service from Cloudera Manager.
Run the following command to test and validate certificate
          regeneration:curl -vk https://$(hostname -f):11371/test_hsm
