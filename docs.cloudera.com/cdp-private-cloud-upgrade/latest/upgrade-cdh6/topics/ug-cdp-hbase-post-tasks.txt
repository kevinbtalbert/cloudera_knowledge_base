Apache HBase post-upgrade tasks
After upgrading from CDH to CDP Private Cloud Base, there are
    certain tasks that you need to perform before you can start using the HBase cluster. 


Switch to relying on shaded artifacts
After upgrading from CDH 5 to CDP, the HBase client applications have
        to switch to hbase-shaded-client and
          hbase-shaded-mapreduce artifacts as dependencies.
        Cloudera recommends relying on the Maven coordinates
          org.apache.hbase:hbase-shaded-client for their
        runtime use.
noteIf you are upgrading from CDH 6, you should already use the shaded
        artifacts. Ensure that you have switched to
          hbase-shaded-client and
          hbase-shaded-mapreduce artifacts as
        dependencies.
Users of HBase's integration for Apache Hadoop MapReduce must switch to
        relying on the org.apache.hbase:hbase-shaded-mapreduce
          module for their runtime use. Neither
          org.apache.hbase:hbase-server nor
          org.apache.hbase:hbase-shaded-server artifacts are
        supported anymore.
Note that both artifacts expose some classes in the
          org.apache.hadoop package space (for example
          o.a.h.configuration.Configuration) to maintain source
        compatibility with the public API. Those classes are included so that
        they can be altered to use the same relocated third party dependencies
        as the rest of the HBase client code. In the event that you need to also
        use Hadoop in your code, you should ensure all Hadoop related jars
        precede the HBase client jar in your classpath.
