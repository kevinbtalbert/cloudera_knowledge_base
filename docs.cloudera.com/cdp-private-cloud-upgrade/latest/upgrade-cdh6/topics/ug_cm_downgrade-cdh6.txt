Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
This topic describes how to reinstall the same version of Cloudera
      Manager you were using previously, so that the version of your Cloudera
      Manager Agents match the server. The steps below assume that the Cloudera
      Manager Server is already stopped (because it failed to start after the
      attempted upgrade).
important
The following instructions assume that a Cloudera Manager upgrade failed, and that the
        upgraded server never started, so that the remaining steps of the upgrade process were not
        performed. The steps below are not sufficient to revert from a running Cloudera Manager
        deployment.
To revert a running Cloudera Manager Server and Cloudera Manager Agents after a successful
        upgrade, see Step 19 of Rolling back a CDP Private Cloud Base Upgrade from version
          7.1.8 to CDH 6 or Rolling back a CDP Private Cloud Base Upgrade from versions
            7.1.1 - 7.1.7 to CDH 6 which has instructions for reverting the Cloudera Manager packages on
        all hosts.



Parent topic: Upgrading Cloudera Manager 6
Ensure Cloudera Manager Server and Agent are stopped.


 Log in to the Cloudera Manager Server host.
          ssh my_cloudera_manager_server_host

Stop the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-server

Stop the Cloudera Manager Agent.
        
RHEL 7, SLES 12, Ubuntu 18.04 and higher

sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-agent

RHEL 5 or 6, SLES 11, Debian 6 or 7, Ubuntu
          12.04 or 14.04

sudo service cloudera-scm-agent stop







Restore the Cloudera Manager Database (if necessary)

If your Cloudera Manager upgrade fails, you need to determine whether
        the upgrade process has successfully completed updating the schema of
        the Cloudera Manager database. If the schema update has begun, you must
        restore the Cloudera Manager database using a backup taken before you began
        the upgrade. 

To determine whether the schema has been updated, examine the
          Cloudera Manager server logs, and look for a message similar to the
          following: Updated Schema Version to 60000. (The
          version number may be different for your environment.)Run the
            following command to find the log entry (f the log file is in a
            different location, substitute the correct
            path):grep 'Updated Schema Version to ' /var/log/cloudera-scm-server/cloudera-scm-server.log
If required, restore the database. The procedure for restoring
            the database depends on the type of database used by Cloudera
            Manager.
If you are using the embedded PostgreSQL
        database, stop the Cloudera Manager Embedded PostgreSQL database:
RHEL 7, SLES 12, Ubuntu 18.04 and higher

sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-server-db

RHEL 5 or 6, SLES 11, Debian 6 or 7, Ubuntu
          12.04 or 14.04

sudo service cloudera-scm-server-db stop

If you are not using the embedded PostgreSQL database and you
          attempt to stop it, you might see a message indicating that the
          service cannot be found. If you see a message that the shutdown
          failed, then the embedded database is still running, probably because
          services are connected to the Hive metastore. If the database shutdown
          fails due to connected services, issue the following command:
          RHEL-compatible 7 and higher, Ubuntu
          16.04sudo service cloudera-scm-server-db next_stop_fast
sudo service cloudera-scm-server-db stop

All other Linux
          distributionssudo service cloudera-scm-server-db fast_stop





Establish Access to the Software

Cloudera Manager needs access to a package repository that contains the
        updated software packages. You can choose to access the Cloudera public
        repositories directly, or you can download those
          repositories and set up a local repository to access them from
        within your network. If your cluster hosts do not have connectivity to
        the Internet, you must set up a local repository. 
If you have enabled high availability for Cloudera Manager, perform the
        following steps on the hosts for both the active and passive instances
        of the Cloudera Manager server.

 Log in to the Cloudera Manager Server host.
          ssh my_cloudera_manager_server_host

Remove any older files in the existing
        repository directory:
RHEL / CentOS

sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudera*manager.repo*

SLES

sudo rm /etc/zypp/repos.d/cloudera*manager.repo*

Ubuntu

sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudera*.list*


Fill in the form at the top of this page.
Create a repository file so that the package
          manager can locate and download the binaries. noteIf you are
            upgrading to a Cloudera Manager patch, substitute the download URL
            for the patch when creating the repository file
              (cloudera-manager.repo or
              cloudera_manager.list).Do one of the
            following, depending on whether or not you are using a local package
            repository:

Use a local package repository. (Required when cluster
                hosts do not have access to the internet.) See Configuring a Local Package epository.

tip If you have a mixed operating system
            environment, adjust the Operating System filter at the top of
            the page for each operating system. The guide will generate the repo
            file for you automatically here. 
A Cloudera Manager upgrade can introduce
          new package dependencies. Your organization may have restrictions or
          require prior approval for installation of new packages. You can
          determine which packages may be installed or upgraded: 
RHEL / CentOS

yum deplist cloudera-manager-agent

SLES

zypper info --requires cloudera-manager-agent

Ubuntu

apt-cache depends cloudera-manager-agent






Downgrade the Cloudera Manager Packages

noteMake sure the repository file above matches the specific
        maintenance version before the upgrade.

 Downgrade the packages. Note: Only add
            cloudera-manager-server-db-2 if you are using the
          embedded PostgreSQL database.

RHEL / CentOS

sudo yum clean all
sudo yum repolist
sudo yum downgrade "cloudera-manager-*"

SLES

sudo zypper clean --all
sudo zypper dup -r baseurl

Ubuntu
 There is no action that downgrades Cloudera Manager to the
              version currently in the repository.



Verify that you have the correct packages installed.

Restore the Cloudera Manager Directory


Run the following commands to extract the
          backups:cd $CM_BACKUP_DIR
tar -xf cloudera-scm-agent.tar
tar -xf cloudera-scm-server.tar
          
 Restore the Cloudera Manager server directory from a backup taken
          during the upgrade process: sudo -E cp -rp $CM_BACKUP_DIR/etc/cloudera-scm-server/* /etc/cloudera-scm-server
sudo -E cp -rp $CM_BACKUP_DIR/etc/default/cloudera-scm-server /etc/default/cloudera-scm-server

If the Cloudera Manager server host has an agent installed, restore
          the Cloudera Manager agent directory from a backup taken during the
          upgrade process: sudo -E cp -rp $CM_BACKUP_DIR/etc/cloudera-scm-agent/* /etc/cloudera-scm-agent
sudo -E cp -rp $CM_BACKUP_DIR/etc/default/cloudera-scm-agent /etc/default/cloudera-scm-agent
sudo -E cp -rp $CM_BACKUP_DIR/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/* /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent
sudo -E cp -rp $CM_BACKUP_DIR/var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/* /var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent





Start Cloudera Manager Again


If you are using the embedded PostgreSQL
        database, start the
        database:sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-server-db

Start the Cloudera Manager Agent.
        
RHEL 7, SLES 12, Ubuntu 18.04 and higher

sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-agent
              If the agent starts without errors, no response displays. 
RHEL 5 or 6, SLES 11, Debian 6 or 7, Ubuntu
          12.04 or 14.04

sudo service cloudera-scm-agent start
              You should see the following: Starting cloudera-scm-agent: [ OK ]
importantA restart of Cloudera Manager Agents is
                required on all hosts in the cluster.


Start the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-server

 Start the Cloudera Management Service.
          
Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
Select
                Clusters > Cloudera
                Management Service.
Select
                Actions > Start.



noteTroubleshooting: If you have problems starting the server, such as
        database permissions problems, you can use the server's log to
        troubleshoot the problem.
vim /var/log/cloudera-scm-server/cloudera-scm-server.log
