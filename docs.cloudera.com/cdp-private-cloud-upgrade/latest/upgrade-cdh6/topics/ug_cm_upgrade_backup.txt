This topic contains procedures to back up Cloudera Manager. Cloudera
      recommends that you perform these backup steps before upgrading. The
      backups will allow you to rollback your Cloudera Manager upgrade if
      needed. 



noteCloudera Manager 7.7.3 should only be used when
          you need to use Python 3.8 for the Cloudera Manager agents. You must install Python 3.8 on
          all hosts before installing or upgrading to Cloudera Manager 7.7.3. Cloudera Manager
          7.7.3-CHF4 supports only RHEL 8.4, RHEL 8.6, RHEL 7.9, and SLES 15 SP4. See the CDP Private Cloud Base Installation Guide for more
          information.


warningUpgrades from Cloudera Manager 5.12 and lower to
          Cloudera Manager 7.1.1 or higher are not supported 


importantUpgrading Cloudera Manager to version 7.7.1 or
          higher from clusters where CDH 5.x is deployed is not supported. To
          upgrade such clusters: 
Upgrade Cloudera Manager to version 6.3.4.
Upgrade CDH to version 6.3.4
Upgrade Cloudera Manager to version 7.6.5 or higher 



warningFor upgrades from CDH clusters with Cloudera
          Navigator to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1 (or higher) clusters where
          Navigator is to be migrated to Apache Atlas, the cluster must have
          Kerberos enabled before upgrading. 


warningBefore upgrading CDH 5 clusters with Sentry to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x
        clusters where Sentry privileges are to be transitioned to Apache Ranger:
The cluster must have Kerberos enabled. 
Verify that HDFS gateway roles exist on the hosts that runs the Sentry service. 

importantIf HDFS ACL sync is enabled (hdfs_sentry_sync_enable=true) on the CDH
        cluster, then you must install Ranger RMS to support the same functionality. For steps to
        install Ranger RMS, see Installing Ranger RMS. 


noteIf the cluster you are upgrading will include Atlas, Ranger, or
          both, the upgrade wizard deploys one infrastructure Solr service to
          provide a search capability of the audit logs through the Ranger Admin
          UI and/or to store and serve Atlas metadata. Cloudera recommends that
          you do not use this service for customer workloads to avoid
          interference with audit and timeline performance.
