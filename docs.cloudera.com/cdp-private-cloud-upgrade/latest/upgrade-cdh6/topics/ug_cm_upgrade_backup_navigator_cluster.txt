important Upgrading from Cloudera Manager 5.9 (Navigator
          2.8) and earlier can take a significant amount of time, depending on
          the size of the Navigator Metadata storage directory. When the
          Cloudera Manager upgrade process completes and Cloudera Navigator
          services restart, the Solr indexing upgrade automatically begins. No
          other actions can be performed until Solr indexing completes (a
          progress message displays during this process). It can take as long as
          two days to upgrade a storage directory with 60 GB. To help mitigate
          this extended upgrade step, make sure to clear out all unnecessary
          metadata using purge, check the size of the storage directory, and
          consider rerunning purge with tighter conditions to further reduce the
          size of the storage directory.


Make sure a purge task has run recently to clear stale and deleted
          entities.

You can see when the last purge tasks were run in the Cloudera
            Navigator console (From the Cloudera Manager Admin console, go to
                Clusters > Cloudera
                Navigator. Select
                Administration > Purge
                Settings.)
If a purge hasn't run recently, run it by editing the Purge
            schedule on the same page.
Set the purge process options to clear out as much of the backlog
            of data as you can tolerate for your upgraded system. See Managing Metadata Storage with
              Purge.



Stop the Navigator Metadata Server. 
Go to
                Clusters > Cloudera
                Management
              Service > Instances.
Select Navigator Metadata Server.
Click Actions for
                Selected > Stop.

If you are using an Oracle database for audit, in SQL*Plus, ensure
          that the following additional privileges are set:

  GRANT EXECUTE ON sys.dbms_crypto TO nav;
  GRANT CREATE VIEW TO nav;
where nav is the user of the Navigator Audit
          Server database.
