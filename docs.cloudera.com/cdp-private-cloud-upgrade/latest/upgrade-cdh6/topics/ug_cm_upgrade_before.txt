noteNot all combinations of Cloudera Manager and Cloudera Runtime are
        supported. Ensure that the version of Cloudera Manager you are using
      supports the version of Cloudera Runtime you have selected. For details,
      see Cloudera Manager support for Cloudera
        Runtime, CDH and CDP Private Cloud Experiences  .

noteCDP Private Cloud Data Services version 1.3.4 requires Cloudera Manager 7.5.5 and Cloudera Runtime
        version 7.1.6 or 7.1.7 For more information, see CDP Private Cloud Data Services.


noteIf you are upgrading to Cloudera Manager 7.5.1 or higher in order to
        install CDP Private Cloud Experiences version 1.3.1, you must use
        Cloudera Runtime version 7.1.6 or 7.1.7. For more information, see CDP Private Cloud
        Exeriences.


importantUpgrades to Cloudera Manager 7.0.3 are not
        supported.

Before you upgrade Cloudera Manager, you need to gather some information
      and review the limitations and release notes. Fill in the My
        Environment form below to customize your Cloudera Manager
      upgrade procedures. See the Collect Information section below for assistance in
      locating the required information. 

noteIf you are upgrading to Cloudera Manager 7.5.1 or higher in order to
        install CDP Private Cloud Experiences version 1.3.1, you must use
        Cloudera Runtime version 7.1.6. 



noteCloudera Manager 7.7.3 should only be used when
          you need to use Python 3.8 for the Cloudera Manager agents. You must install Python 3.8 on
          all hosts before installing or upgrading to Cloudera Manager 7.7.3. Cloudera Manager
          7.7.3-CHF4 supports only RHEL 8.4, RHEL 8.6, RHEL 7.9, and SLES 15 SP4. See the CDP Private Cloud Base Installation Guide for more
          information.


warningUpgrades from Cloudera Manager 5.12 and lower to
          Cloudera Manager 7.1.1 or higher are not supported 


importantUpgrading Cloudera Manager to version 7.7.1 or
          higher from clusters where CDH 5.x is deployed is not supported. To
          upgrade such clusters: 
Upgrade Cloudera Manager to version 6.3.4.
Upgrade CDH to version 6.3.4
Upgrade Cloudera Manager to version 7.6.5 or higher 



warningFor upgrades from CDH clusters with Cloudera
          Navigator to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1 (or higher) clusters where
          Navigator is to be migrated to Apache Atlas, the cluster must have
          Kerberos enabled before upgrading. 


warningBefore upgrading CDH 5 clusters with Sentry to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x
        clusters where Sentry privileges are to be transitioned to Apache Ranger:
The cluster must have Kerberos enabled. 
Verify that HDFS gateway roles exist on the hosts that runs the Sentry service. 

importantIf HDFS ACL sync is enabled (hdfs_sentry_sync_enable=true) on the CDH
        cluster, then you must install Ranger RMS to support the same functionality. For steps to
        install Ranger RMS, see Installing Ranger RMS. 


noteIf the cluster you are upgrading will include Atlas, Ranger, or
          both, the upgrade wizard deploys one infrastructure Solr service to
          provide a search capability of the audit logs through the Ranger Admin
          UI and/or to store and serve Atlas metadata. Cloudera recommends that
          you do not use this service for customer workloads to avoid
          interference with audit and timeline performance. 




warningYou cannot upgrade from a cluster that uses Oracle
          12.

Preparing to Upgrade Cloudera Manager


Access to Cloudera Manager binaries for production purposes requires
          authentication. In order to download the software, you must first have
          an active subscription agreement and obtain a license key file along
          with the required authentication credentials (username and password).
          See Cloudera Manager Download
            Information.
You must have SSH access to the Cloudera Manager server hosts and be
          able to log in using the root account or an account that has
          password-less sudo permission for all hosts.
Review the following when upgrading to Cloudera
          Manager 7.1 or higher:CDP Private Cloud Base
              Requirements and Supported Versions

You may be required to upgrade the operating
            system before upgrading. See Operating System Requirements to determine operating
            system support for the version of Cloudera Manager you are upgrading
            to. Depending on the support, you may need to upgrade the operating
            system. 
If you must or choose to upgrade to a supported operating system,
            you must determine whether to upgrade the operating system first or
            Cloudera Manager first. If the current version of Cloudera Manager
            and the version you are upgrading to both support a newer version of
            the operating system but the new version of Cloudera Manager does
            not support the older operating system, you must upgrade to the
            newer operating system before upgrading Cloudera Manager. If this is
            not true, then you must upgrade Cloudera Manager before upgrading
            the operating system. 
See Upgrading the Operating System.

Install a supported version of the Java
          Development Kit (JDK) on all hosts. If you
            are upgrading to Cloudera Manager and CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.1
            and higher, you can choose to install OpenJDK 1.8 instead of the
            Oracle JDK.There two options for JDK installation:
Manually install the Oracle JDK or OpenJDK on all
                hosts. 
Manually install the Oracle JDK 1.8 on the Cloudera Manager
                host, and then select the Install Oracle Java SE
                  Development Kit checkbox when prompted while
                running the Cloudera Manager Upgrade wizard.

Review the Cloudera Security Bulletins.
The embedded
          PostgreSQL database installed with the Trial Installer is not
            supported in production environments because a trial
          installation cannot easily be upgraded, backed up, or migrated into a
          production-ready configuration without manual steps requiring down
          time. Consider migrating from the Cloudera Manager
              embedded PostgreSQL database server to an external PostgreSQL
              database  before upgrading Cloudera Manager. 

If your cluster uses Oracle for any databases, before
            upgrading CDH 5, check the value of the COMPATIBLE
            initialization parameter in the Oracle Database using the following
            SQL
            query:Â SELECT name, value FROM v$parameter WHERE name = 'compatible'
The default value is 12.2.0. If the parameter has a
            different value, you can set it to the default as shown in the Oracle Database Upgrade
              Guide.noteBefore
              resetting the COMPATIBLE initialization parameter
              to its default value, make sure you consider the effect this
              change can have on your system.


Using Python 3.8 with the Cloudera Manager Agents
If you require Python 3.8 to be used on your cluster hosts, you must
          install Python 3.8 before you upgrade Cloudera Manager. See Installing Python 3.8 for Cloudera
            Manager 7.7.3 
Important: Cloudera Manager 7.7.3 should only be used when you need
          to use Python 3.8 for the Cloudera Manager agents. You must install
          Python 3.8 on all hosts before installing or upgrading to Cloudera
          Manager 7.7.3. Cloudera Manager 7.7.3 is only supported with RHEL 7.9
          . 8.4, and 8.6 . See the CDP Private Cloud Base Installation guide for
          more information.
