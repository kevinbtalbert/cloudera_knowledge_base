You can also use the procedures on this page to install Cloudera Manager
      patches. You must obtain the download URL for the patch before proceeding
      â€“ you will use this information later in this procedure. 

importantUpgrades to Cloudera Manager 7.0.3 are not
        supported.


noteUpgrades from CDH 6.x are supported only for upgrades to Cloudera
        Manager 7.4.4 or higher and Cloudera Runtime 7.1.7 or higher. Upgrades
        from CDH 6.0 are not supported.  For a full list of supported upgrades,
        see Upgade Paths.
warningUpgrading to Cloudera Manager version 7.7.1
        and above introduces a new service called CORE_SETTINGS-2 which leads to stale
        configurations on different services in the cluster.

This topic provides procedures for backing up the Cloudera Manager
      Server.
Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
After you complete the steps in Step 1: Getting Started Upgrading Cloudera Manager 6 and Step 2: Backing Up Cloudera Manager 6, continue with the following:


noteCloudera Manager 7.7.3 should only be used when
          you need to use Python 3.8 for the Cloudera Manager agents. You must install Python 3.8 on
          all hosts before installing or upgrading to Cloudera Manager 7.7.3. Cloudera Manager
          7.7.3-CHF4 supports only RHEL 8.4, RHEL 8.6, RHEL 7.9, and SLES 15 SP4. See the CDP Private Cloud Base Installation Guide for more
          information.


warningUpgrades from Cloudera Manager 5.12 and lower to
          Cloudera Manager 7.1.1 or higher are not supported 


importantUpgrading Cloudera Manager to version 7.7.1 or
          higher from clusters where CDH 5.x is deployed is not supported. To
          upgrade such clusters: 
Upgrade Cloudera Manager to version 6.3.4.
Upgrade CDH to version 6.3.4
Upgrade Cloudera Manager to version 7.6.5 or higher 



warningFor upgrades from CDH clusters with Cloudera
          Navigator to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.1 (or higher) clusters where
          Navigator is to be migrated to Apache Atlas, the cluster must have
          Kerberos enabled before upgrading. 


warningBefore upgrading CDH 5 clusters with Sentry to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x
        clusters where Sentry privileges are to be transitioned to Apache Ranger:
The cluster must have Kerberos enabled. 
Verify that HDFS gateway roles exist on the hosts that runs the Sentry service. 

importantIf HDFS ACL sync is enabled (hdfs_sentry_sync_enable=true) on the CDH
        cluster, then you must install Ranger RMS to support the same functionality. For steps to
        install Ranger RMS, see Installing Ranger RMS. 


noteIf the cluster you are upgrading will include Atlas, Ranger, or
          both, the upgrade wizard deploys one infrastructure Solr service to
          provide a search capability of the audit logs through the Ranger Admin
          UI and/or to store and serve Atlas metadata. Cloudera recommends that
          you do not use this service for customer workloads to avoid
          interference with audit and timeline performance. 




importantPlease note the following:
A valid Cloudera Enterprise license file and a username and
              password are required to download and install the software. You
              can obtain the username and password from the Cloudera CDH Download page. See Your
              license file must be current and uploaded to Cloudera Manager.
                To upload a license: 
Download the license file and save it locally.
In Cloudera Manager, go to the Home
                    page.
Select
                        Administration > License.
Click Upload License.
Browse to the license file you downloaded. 
Click Upload.

If you are using Cloudera Express, you cannot upgrade Cloudera
              Manager or CDH. 
Several steps in the procedures have changed and now require the
              username and password.
Download URLs have changed.


importantIf you encounter problems, see the following:

Parent topic: Upgrading Cloudera Manager 6
Establish Access to the Software

Cloudera Manager needs access to a package repository that contains the
        updated software packages. You can choose to access the Cloudera public
        repositories directly, or you can download those
          repositories and set up a local repository to access them from
        within your network. If your cluster hosts do not have connectivity to
        the Internet, you must set up a local repository. 
If you have enabled high availability for Cloudera Manager, perform the
        following steps on the hosts for both the active and passive instances
        of the Cloudera Manager server.

 Log in to the Cloudera Manager Server host.
          ssh my_cloudera_manager_server_host

Remove any older files in the existing
        repository directory:
RHEL / CentOS

sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudera*manager.repo*

SLES

sudo rm /etc/zypp/repos.d/cloudera*manager.repo*

Ubuntu

sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudera*.list*


Fill in the form at the top of this page.
Create a repository file so that the package
          manager can locate and download the binaries. noteIf you are
            upgrading to a Cloudera Manager patch, substitute the download URL
            for the patch when creating the repository file
              (cloudera-manager.repo or
              cloudera_manager.list).Do one of the
            following, depending on whether or not you are using a local package
            repository:

Use a local package repository. (Required when cluster
                hosts do not have access to the internet.) See Configuring a Local Package epository.

            file for you automatically here. 
A Cloudera Manager upgrade can introduce
          new package dependencies. Your organization may have restrictions or
          require prior approval for installation of new packages. You can
          determine which packages may be installed or upgraded: 
RHEL / CentOS

yum deplist cloudera-manager-agent

SLES

zypper info --requires cloudera-manager-agent

Ubuntu

apt-cache depends cloudera-manager-agent






Install Java (JDK)

Oracle
        JDK 1.8 is required on all cluster hosts managed by Cloudera Manager
        6.0.0 or higher. If it is supported for your
          version of Cloudera Manager, you can also install OpenJDK 1.8
        or OpenJDK 11. See Manually
          Installing OpenJDK. If JDK 1.8 is already installed on your
        hosts, skip the steps in this section.
If you are
        upgrading to Cloudera Manager 6.0.0 or higher, you can manually install
        JDK 8 on the Cloudera Manager server host, and then, as part of the
        Cloudera Manager upgrade process, you can specify that Cloudera Manager
        upgrade the JDK on the remaining hosts. 
A supported JDK is required on all
        hosts. During a Cloudera Manager upgrade, you can install OpenJDK 8 on
        the Cloudera Manager server host, and then Cloudera Manager can install
        the new JDK on the managed hosts. You can also choose to install Oracle
        JDK 8, OpenJDK 8, or OpenJDK 11 manually, on all hosts before beginning
        the upgrade.noteCloudera Manager no longer installs Oracle
          JDKs.

 Log in to the Cloudera Manager Server host.
          ssh my_cloudera_manager_server_host

Stop the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-server

Remove the JDK:
Perform the following steps on all hosts managed by Cloudera Manager:
Run the following command to remove the JDK, using the
                      package names from Step 1: (If you do not delete these files, Cloudera Manager
              and other components may continue to use the old version of the
              JDK.)
RHEL

yum remove <JDK package name>

Ubuntu

apt-get remove <JDK package name>

SLES

zypper rm <JDK package name>


Confirm that the package has been removed: 
RHEL

yum list installed |grep -i oracle

Ubuntu

apt list --installed | grep -i oracle

SLES

zypper search --installed-only |grep -i oracle

                11zypper install java-11-openjdk

Start the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-server





Upgrade the Cloudera Manager Server


Log in to the Cloudera Manager server host. 
Stop the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-server

Open the CLI for the Cloudera
          Manager database using one of the following commands:
MySQL/MariaDB: mysql -u root -p
PostgreSQL: sudo -u postgres psql
Oracle: sqlplus system@localhost

Run the following SQL queries:
select ROLE_ID from ROLES where ROLE_TYPE='STORAGEOPERATIONS';The
              query returns a set of ROLD_ID values. For each ROLE_ID, run the
              following SQL
              commands:delete from CONFIGS where ROLE_ID=<ROLE_ID>;
delete from ROLE_STALENESS_STATUS where ROLE_ID=<ROLE_ID>;
delete from ROLES where ROLE_TYPE='STORAGEOPERATIONS';

The Core Configuration service commonly has the default name
                'core_settings'. Validate this by checking the
              NAME returned by the following
              query:neselect NAME,DISPLAY_NAME from SERVICES where SERVICE_TYPE='CORE_SETTINGS'In
              the next two steps, substitute the NAME returned from the above
              query for
                '[***core_settings***]' in
              the queries.
The following query returns a list of services that are
              dependent on the Core Configuration service. Note the services
              listed. You will need this information later in the Cloudera
              Manager upgrade process  to reset the dependent services, after
              the Cloudera Manager agents are installed. (See Step 5: After You Upgrade Cloudera Manager.)select c.SERVICE_ID,NAME from CONFIGS c join SERVICES s on c.SERVICE_ID=s.SERVICE_ID where value='[***core_settings***]';


delete from CONFIGS where value='[***core_settings***]';



Start the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-server

 If your cluster is running the
          embedded PostgreSQL database, stop all services that are using the
          embedded database. These can include: 
Hive service and all services such as Impala and Hue that use
              the Hive metastore
Oozie
Sentry
Sqoop


Stop the Cloudera Management Service.
Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
Select
                Clusters > Cloudera
                Management Service.
Select
                Actions > Stop.

importantNot stopping the Cloudera Management Service at
            this point might cause management roles to crash or the Cloudera
            Manager Server might fail to restart. 
Ensure that you have disabled any scheduled replication or
            snapshot jobs and wait for any running commands from the
          Cloudera Manager Admin Console to complete before proceeding with the
          upgrade. importantIf there are replication jobs,
            snapshot jobs, or other commands running when you stop Cloudera
            Manager Server, Cloudera Manager Server might fail to start after
            the upgrade. 
If you have any Hive Replication Schedules that replicate to a cloud
          destination, delete these replication clusters before continuing with
          the upgrade. You can re-create these Replication Schedules after the
          Cloudera Manager upgrade is complete.
If your cluster
          is running Ubuntu version 18, stop all clusters before upgrading
          Cloudera Manager. (For each cluster, go to
                Cluster
              Name > Actions > Stop.)
Stop the Cloudera Manager server host, agent, and embedded database
          (if installed). If you have enabled high availability for Cloudera
          Manager, perform the following steps on the hosts for both the
            active and passive instances of Cloudera Manager:
 Log in to the Cloudera Manager Server
              host:ssh my_cloudera_manager_server_host

Stop the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-server

If you are using the embedded PostgreSQL
        database, stop the Cloudera Manager Embedded PostgreSQL database:
RHEL 7, SLES 12, Ubuntu 18.04 and higher

sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-server-db

RHEL 5 or 6, SLES 11, Debian 6 or 7, Ubuntu
          12.04 or 14.04

sudo service cloudera-scm-server-db stop

If you are not using the embedded PostgreSQL database and you
          attempt to stop it, you might see a message indicating that the
          service cannot be found. If you see a message that the shutdown
          failed, then the embedded database is still running, probably because
          services are connected to the Hive metastore. If the database shutdown
          fails due to connected services, issue the following command:
          RHEL-compatible 7 and higher, Ubuntu
          16.04sudo service cloudera-scm-server-db next_stop_fast
sudo service cloudera-scm-server-db stop

All other Linux
          distributionssudo service cloudera-scm-server-db fast_stop

Stop the Cloudera Manager Agent.
        
RHEL 7, SLES 12, Ubuntu 18.04 and higher

sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-agent

RHEL 5 or 6, SLES 11, Debian 6 or 7, Ubuntu
          12.04 or 14.04

sudo service cloudera-scm-agent stop




Upgrade the Cloudera Manager software. If you have enabled high
          availability for Cloudera Manager, perform the following steps on the
          hosts for both the active and passive instances of the Cloudera
          Manager server. 
 Upgrade the packages. Include the
            cloudera-manager-server-db-2 package in the command
          only if you are using the embedded PostgreSQL database.

              troubleshoot the problem:Server
                log:tail -f /var/log/cloudera-scm-server/cloudera-scm-server.log
                Agent
              log:tail -f /var/log/cloudera-scm-agent/cloudera-scm-agent.log
              or
              tail -f /var/log/messages

Verify that all cluster hosts appear in the Cloudera Manager Admin
          Console. 
Use a Web browser to open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console
              using the following
              URL:http://cloudera_Manager_server_hostname:7180/cmf/upgradeIt
              can take several minutes for the Cloudera Manager Server to start,
              and the Cloudera Manager Admin Console is unavailable until the
              server startup is complete and the Upgrade Cloudera
                Manager page displays. 
Verify that all cluster hosts are visible. (Go to
                  Hosts > All
                  Hosts.)

If you have enabled high availability for Cloudera Manager, start
          the host for the passive instance of Cloudera Manager: 
Start the Cloudera Manager Agent.
        
RHEL 7, SLES 12, Ubuntu 18.04 and higher

sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-agent
              If the agent starts without errors, no response displays. 
RHEL 5 or 6, SLES 11, Debian 6 or 7, Ubuntu
          12.04 or 14.04

sudo service cloudera-scm-agent start
              You should see the following: Starting cloudera-scm-agent: [ OK ]
importantA restart of Cloudera Manager Agents is
                required on all hosts in the cluster.


The
              Cloudera Manager server now requires 4GB of heap. On the Cloudera
              Manager server host, edit the
                /etc/default/cloudera-scm-server file and
              change the line that begins with export
                CMF_JAVA_OPTS=. Change the -Xmx2G
              parameter to -Xmx4G. 
Start the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-server

If you have problems starting the server or the agent, such as
              database permissions problems, you can use log files to
              troubleshoot the problem:Server
                log:tail -f /var/log/cloudera-scm-server/cloudera-scm-server.log
                Agent
              log:tail -f /var/log/cloudera-scm-agent/cloudera-scm-agent.log
              or
              tail -f /var/log/messages
