Checking Apache HBase
To upgrade to CDP Private Cloud Base from CDH and have the HBase
    service installed, there are several pre-upgrades steps you are required to complete. 


noteBefore upgrading the dependent services such as HBase, you must
      verify and ensure that the HDFS safemode is off. 
noteYou must complete these steps when you run the Upgrade Wizard, after
      the Cloudera Runtime parcel has been distributed, but before finishing the
      Upgrade Wizard.

Ensure that you complete all the pre-upgrade steps if you have Apache HBase installed in
          your existing CDH cluster.
When you are attempting to upgrade from a CDH cluster to a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, checkboxes appear to ensure you have
      performed all the necessary HBase related pre-upgrade transition step:
Check co-processor classes
Clean the HBase Master procedure store

The upgrade continues only if you check the following
      statements: Yes, I have run the "Cleanup master procedure before upgrade" action, it finished
      sucessfully and I haven't started HBase Master since then.

Before upgrading, ensure that your co-processors are compatible with the upgrade.Clean the HBase Master procedure storeHBase Master procedures changed after HBase 2.1, therefore the procedure store must         be cleaned before upgrading from CDH 6 to CDP.Parent topic: CDP Private Cloud Base Pre-upgrade transition steps
