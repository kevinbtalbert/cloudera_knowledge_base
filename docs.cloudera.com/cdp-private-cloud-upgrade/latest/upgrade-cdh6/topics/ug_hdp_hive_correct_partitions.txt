Handle Missing Table or Partition Locations
You need to identify missing table or partition locations, or both, to prevent
        upgrade failure. If the table and partition locations do not exist in the file system, you
        must either create a replacement partition directory (recommended) or drop the table and
        partition. 
You perform this step if you did not modify the HSMM process to expedite the Hive upgrade.

Ensure the table and partition locations exist on the file system. If these
                    locations donâ€™t exist either create a replacement partition directory
                    (recommended) or drop the table and partition.
