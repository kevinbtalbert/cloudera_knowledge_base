Configure edge nodes as gateways
 If you use command-line clients, such as Sqoop, to access Hive, you must configure
        these gateways to use defaults for your service. You can accomplish this task in a few
        steps.
 By default, the HS2 instances configured in the migration already have the default
            beeline-site.xml file defined for the service. Other hosts do not. Configure these hosts
            as a gateway for that service. 

Find the notes you made before the upgrade about edge nodes and default, connected endpoints.

In Cloudera Manager, configure hosts other than HiveServer (HS2) hosts that you
                    want to be Hive Gateway nodes as gateways for the default beeline-site.xml file
                    for the gateway service.
