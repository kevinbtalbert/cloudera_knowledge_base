Setting Hive Configuration Overrides
You need to know how to configure the critical customizations that the upgrade
        process does not preserve from your old Hive cluster. Referring to your records about your
        old configuration, you follow steps to set at least six critical property values. 
 By design, the six critical properties that you need to customize are not visible
            in Cloudera Manager, as you can see from the Visible in CM column of
            Configurations Requirements and Recommendations. You use the Safety Valve to add these
            properties to hive-site.xml as shown in this task. 

In Cloudera Manager > Clusters select the Hive on Tez service. Click
                        Configuration, and search for
                    hive-site.xml.

In Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
          hive-site.xml, click +.




In Name, add the hive.conf.hidden.list property. 

In Value, add your custom list.

Customize the other critical properties:
                        hive.conf.restricted.list,
                        hive.exec.post.hooks,
                        hive.script.operator.env.blacklist,
                        hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist,
                        hive.security.command.whitelist. 
Use hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist.append, for example, to set up the list.

Save the changes and restart the Hive service.

Look at the Configurations Requirements and Recommendations to understand which
                    overrides were preserved or not.
