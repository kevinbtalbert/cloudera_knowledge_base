Configuring HiveServer for ETL using YARN queues
You need to set several configuration properties to allow placement of the Hive
        workload on the Yarn queue manager, which is common for running an ETL job. You need to set
        several parameters that effectively disable the reuse of containers. Each new query gets new
        containers routed to the appropriate queue.
 Hive configuration properties affect mapping users and groups to YARN queues. You
        set these properties to use with YARN Placement Rules. To set Hive properties for
                YARN queues:
