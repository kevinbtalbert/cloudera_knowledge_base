Apache Hadoop YARN default value changes
A list of default value changes when upgrading from CDH to CDP.



noteThis is not a complete list. It only contains the default value
        changes that cause behaviour changes.

Scheduler: In CDP, Capacity Scheduler is the
          supported and default scheduler. For more information about scheduler
          migration and post-upgrade fine tuning, see Manual configuration of scheduler properties.
YARN and MapReduce daemons: YARN daemons (ResourceManager, NodeManager)
          and the JobHistory Server runs with unix group hadoop instead of yarn:yarn and
          mapred:mapred. 
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing: CORS is enabled for
          every role by default.
YARN admin commands: By default YARN admin commands can be run only as
            yarn. In CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.7 and higher
          a placeholder value  ${yarn_user} is also supported. In such cases Cloudera Manager
          replace the placeholder value with the collected principal name.
ResourceManager recovery: ResourceManager recovery
          is enabled by default.
Filter entity list by use
          (filter-entity-list-by-user): Enabled by default, meaning that users
          can see only those applications on the UI which they have access to.
Log aggregation: IFile is the default file
          controller.
MapReduce shuffle connection keep-alive
              (mapreduce.shuffle.connection-keep-alive.enabled):: Set to
            true by default because Auto TLS requires it.
YARN Admin ACL: If the yarn.admin.acl property is not configured
          before the upgrade, its default value is changed from * to
            yarn. In CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.7 and higher
          a placeholder value  ${yarn_user} is also supported. In such cases Cloudera Manager
          replace the placeholder value with the collected principal name.
