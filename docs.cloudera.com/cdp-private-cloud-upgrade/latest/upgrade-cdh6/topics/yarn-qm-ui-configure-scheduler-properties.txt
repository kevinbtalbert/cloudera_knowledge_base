Use YARN Queue Manager UI to configure scheduler properties
After upgrading to CDP Private Cloud Base, you must configure
        the Capacity Scheduler properties using the output files generated by the
            fs2cs conversion utility. You can configure the properties manually using
        the YARN Queue Manager UI service.



Use the fs2cs conversion utility to generate the
                                capacity-scheduler.xml and
                                yarn-site.xml output files.


Complete the upgrade process.

Identify properties that require manual configuration and can be configured
                        using the Queue Manager UI.
For more information about scheduler properties, see Fair Scheduler
                    feature and conversion details.


In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters and select the
                        YARN Queue Manager UI  service.






In the YARN Queue Manager window, click the Scheduler
                        Configuration tab.






In the Scheduler Configuration window, enter the value
                    of the property and click Save.
