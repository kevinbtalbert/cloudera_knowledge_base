Use Cloudera Manager Safety Valves to configure scheduler properties
Certain scheduler properties can neither be converted by the
        fs2csconversion utility nor be configured using the YARN Queue Manager UI
        service. After upgrading to CDP Private Cloud Base you must manually
        configure these properties using the Cloudera Manager advanced configuration snippet (Safety
        Valves).




Use the fs2cs conversion utility to generate the
                                capacity-scheduler.xml and
                                yarn-site.xml output files.


Complete the upgrade process.


Identify the scheduler properties that need to be configured
                            manually and not supported by the Queue Manager UI.





In Cloudera Manager, select the YARN service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Search for capacity-scheduler, and find the
                        Capacity Scheduler Configuration Advanced Configuration Snippet
                        (Safety Valve).

Click View as XML, and insert the complete
                        capacity-scheduler.xml file, generated by the converter
                    tool.

Add the necessary configuration properties.

Click Save Changes.

Search for yarn-site, and find the YARN
                        Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        yarn-site.xml.

Click View as XML and add the required configuration in
                    an XML format.
Optionally, use + and - to add and remove properties.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the YARN service.
