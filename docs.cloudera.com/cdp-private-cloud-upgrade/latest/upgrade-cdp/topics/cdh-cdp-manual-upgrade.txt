Manual upgrade to CDP Private Cloud Base
Manual steps to follow for upgrading a CDH or Cloudera Runtime
    cluster to a higher version of Cloudera Runtime if the Upgrade Wizard fails. 

warningThe upgrade wizard does not allow a manual upgrade
        option. There is no route or an option from Cloudera Manager to skip restart of custom
        services. In this scenario, the users must proceed with manual upgrade steps.




important
If CDP Upgrade Wizard fails with any error, search for the Knowledge Base article from the
          MyCloudera
        website to find the failure resolution for that particular error. Perform the steps that are
        detailed in the Knowledge Base article to resolve the error and continue with the manual
        upgrade process. If you do not find the Knowledge Base article for any specific failure,
        contact Cloudera Support to open a support case.

important
Perform the steps in this section only if the upgrade
        wizard reports a failure, or if you selected Manual
          Upgrade from the Upgrade Wizard (the Manual Upgrade option
        is only available for minor or maintenance upgrades). Manual upgrades
        allow you to selectively stop and restart services to prevent or
        mitigate downtime for services or clusters where rolling restarts are
        not available.

All steps below assume the starting CDH version is at least
      5.13.0 or the starting Cloudera Runtime version is at least 7.0.3, because
      those are the lowest versions that Cloudera Manager 7.1 supports.
The steps below should be executed roughly in the order that they are
      listed, and should only be executed if the service is configured.

            which services have stale configurations and require restarting.


To start or restart the cluster:


On the
                    Home > 
                    Status page, click the down arrow
                to the right of the cluster name and select

Test the Cluster and Finalize HDFS Metadata

To determine if you can finalize the upgrade,
        run important workloads and ensure that they are successful. After you
        have finalized the upgrade, you cannot roll back to a previous version
        of HDFS without using backups. Verifying that you
          are ready to finalize the upgrade can take a long time. 
When you are ready to finalize the upgrade, do the following: 


Go to the HDFS service.
Click the Instances tab.
Click the link for the NameNode instance. If you have enabled
              high availability for HDFS, click the link labeled
                NameNode (Active).

After completing all of the previous steps, do the following to
        complete the upgrade:
Log in to the Cloudera Manager server host.
Stop the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-server

Log in to the command-line environment for the Cloudera Manager
            database. (mysql, sqlplus, or
              postgres psql).
Run the following
            command:DELETE FROM UPGRADE_STATE;
Start the Cloudera Manager
        Server.sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-server
