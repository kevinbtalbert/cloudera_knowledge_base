Setting Up an Internal Repository

You must create an internal repository to install or upgrade the Cloudera Navigator data
        encryption components. For instructions on creating internal repositories, see the following
        topics: 
Configuring a Local Parcel Repository
Configuring a Local Package Repository




Upgrading Navigator Encrypt (RHEL-Compatible)

Before you begin the upgrade process, refer to Product Compatibility Matrix for Cloudera
        Navigator Encryption and ensure that you have the minimum requisite operating system
        version(s) installed.

Install the Cloudera RepositoryAdd the internal repository you created. See
              Configuring Hosts to Use the Internal Repository
            for more information.Import the GPG key by running the following
            command:sudo rpm --import http://repo.example.com/path/to/gpg_gazzang.asc
Stop Navigator EncryptStop the Navigator Encrypt
            service:sudo service navencrypt-mount stopFor
            RHEL 7, use systemctl
            instead:sudo systemctl stop navencrypt-mount
Upgrade Navigator EncryptUpgrade the Navigator Encrypt client using
              yum:sudo yum update navencrypt
Start Navigator EncryptStart the Navigator Encrypt
            service:sudo service navencrypt-mount startFor
            RHEL 7, use systemctl
            instead:sudo systemctl start navencrypt-mount

If you are using an RSA master key file, change the master key to use OAEP
            padding:
# navencrypt key --change --rsa-oaep
...
>> Choose NEW MASTER key type:
 1) Passphrase (single)
 2) Passphrase (dual)
 3) RSA private key
Select: 3
Type MASTER RSA key file:
Type MASTER RSA key passphrase:

To check the type of padding currently in use:
# navencrypt key --get-rsa-padding
Type your Master key
Type MASTER RSA key file:
Type MASTER RSA key passphrase:

Upgrading Navigator Encrypt (SLES)


Install the Cloudera RepositoryAdd the internal repository that you created.
            See Configuring Hosts to Use the Internal Repository
            for more information.Import the GPG key by running the following
            command:sudo rpm --import http://repo.example.com/path/to/gpg_gazzang.asc
Stop Navigator EncryptStop the Navigator Encrypt
            service:sudo service navencrypt-mount stop
Upgrade the Kernel Module Package (KMP)
sudo zypper update cloudera-navencryptfs-kmp-<kernel_flavor>
Replace kernel_flavor with the kernel flavor for your
            system. Navigator Encrypt supports the default,
              xen, and ec2 kernel
            flavors.
Upgrade the Navigator Encrypt ClientUpgrade Navigator
          Encrypt:sudo zypper update navencrypt
Enable Unsupported ModulesEdit
              /etc/modprobe.d/unsupported-modules and set
              allow_unsupported_modules to
              1. For example:
#
# Every kernel module has a flag 'supported'. If this flag is not set loading
# this module will taint your kernel. You will not get much help with a kernel
# problem if your kernel is marked as tainted. In this case you firstly have
# to avoid loading of unsupported modules.
#
# Setting allow_unsupported_modules 1 enables loading of unsupported modules
# by modprobe, setting allow_unsupported_modules 0 disables it. This can
# be overridden using the --allow-unsupported-modules command line switch.
allow_unsupported_modules 1

            service:sudo service navencrypt-mount start

If using an RSA master key file, then you should change the master key to use OAEP
            padding:

Best Practices for Upgrading Navigator Encrypt Hosts

Following are some best practices for upgrading operating systems (OS) and kernels on hosts
        that have Navigator Encrypt installed:
Make sure that the version you are upgrading to is supported by Navigator Encrypt. See
            the product compatibility matrix for Product Compatibility Matrix for Cloudera Navigator
              Encryption for more information.
Always test upgrades in a development or testing environment before upgrading
            production hosts.
If possible, upgrade the entire operating system instead of only upgrading the
            kernel.
If you need to upgrade the kernel only, make sure that your OS version supports the
            kernel version to which you are upgrading.
Always back up the /etc/navencrypt directory before
            upgrading. If you have problems accessing encrypted data after upgrading the OS or
            kernel, restore /etc/navencrypt from your backup and try
            again.
