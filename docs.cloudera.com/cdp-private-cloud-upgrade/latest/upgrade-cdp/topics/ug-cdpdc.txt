Upgrading CDP Private Cloud Base to a higher version


 An upgrade from CDP Private Cloud Base to a higher
      version of CDP Private Cloud Base has the following
      high-level workflow:
Prepare to upgrade:
Review the Supported Upgrade Paths
              for your upgrade.
Review the Requirements and Supported
                Versions for your upgrade
Review the Release Notes for the
              version of CDP Private Cloud Base you are
              upgrading to.
Review the  CDP Upgrade/Migrate
                Troubleshooting Articles. These Cloudera Knowledge Base
              articles describe common issues encountered by Cloudera customers
              during upgrades and migrations.   (Cloudera login required.) 
Gather information on your deployment. See Step 1: Getting Started Upgrading Cloudera Manager 7 and Step 1: Getting Started Upgrading a Cluster. 
Plan how and when to begin your upgrade.

If necessary, Upgrade the JDK.
If necessary, Upgrade the Operating
            System.
Upgrade Cloudera Manager to version 7.1.1 or higher. After upgrading
          to Cloudera Manager 7.1.1 or higher, Cloudera Manager can manage
          upgrading your cluster to a higher version. See Upgrading Cloudera Manager 7.
Use Cloudera Manager to upgrade from lower version of Cloudera Runtime to a higher
