This topic describes how to back up a cluster managed by Cloudera
        Manager prior to upgrading the cluster. These procedures do not back
          up the data stored in the cluster. Cloudera recommends that you
        maintain regular backups of your data using the Backup and Disaster
        Recovery features of Cloudera Manager. 
Minimum Required Role:
Cluster
            Administrator (also provided by Full
          Administrator) This feature is not available when using Cloudera
            Manager to manage Data Hub clusters.
The following components do not require backups: 
MapReduce
YARN
Spark
Impala

Complete the following backup steps
        before upgrading your cluster:

Back Up Databases

warningBacking up databases requires that you stop some
          services, which might make them unavailable during backup. 
Gather the following information:

Type of database (PostgreSQL, Embedded PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB,
          or Oracle)
Hostnames of the databases
Database names 
Port number used by the databases
Credentials for the databases

Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console to find the database
        information for any of the following services you have deployed in your cluster:
Sqoop, Oozie, and Hue – Go to Cluster Name > Configuration > Database Settings.noteThe
              Sqoop Metastore uses a HyperSQL (HSQLDB) database. See the HyperSQL documentation for
              backup procedures.noteSqoop 2 is not supported in CDP
              Private Cloud Base.
Hive Metastore – Go to the Hive service, select
              Configuration, and select the
              Hive Metastore Database category.
Sentry – Go to the
            Sentry service, select Configuration, and
            select the Sentry Server Database
            category.
Ranger – Go to
            the Ranger service, select Configuration, and
            search on "database."

To back up the databases
Perform the following steps for each database you back up:
If not already stopped, stop the service. If Cloudera Manager
            indicates that there are dependent services, also stop the dependent
              services.
On the
                    Home > Status
                tab, click  to
                the right of the service name and select Stop.
Click Stop in the next screen to
                confirm. When you see a Finished status, the service has
                stopped.


Back up the database. Substitute the database name, hostname,
            port, user name, and backup directory path and run the following
              command:
MySQL

mysqldump --databases
                    database_name
                    --host=database_hostname
                    --port=database_port -u
                    database_username -p >
                    backup_directory_path/database_name-backup-`date
                    +%F`-CDH.sql

PostgreSQL/Embedded

pg_dump -h database_hostname -U database_username -W -p database_port database_name > backup_directory_path/database_name-backup-`date +%F`-CDH.sql

Oracle
 Work with your database administrator to ensure databases
                  are properly backed up. 
For additional information about backing up databases, see
              these vendor-specific links: 
MariaDB 10.2: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/backup-and-restore-overview/
MySQL 5.7: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/backup-and-recovery.html
PostgreSQL10: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/backup.html
Oracle 12c: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/bradv/index.html


Start the service. 
On the
                    Home > Status
                tab, click  to
                the right of the service name and select Start.
Click Start in the next screen to
                confirm. When you see a Finished status, the service has
                started.






Back Up ZooKeeper


On all ZooKeeper hosts, back up the ZooKeeper data directory specified with the
            Data Directory property and ZooKeeper transaction log directory
          specified with the Transaction Log Directory property in the ZooKeeper
          configuration. The default location for both these directories is
            /var/lib/zookeeper. For example:
          cp -rp /var/lib/zookeeper/ /var/lib/zookeeper-backup-`date +%F`CM-CDH
To identify the ZooKeeper hosts, open the Cloudera Manager Admin console and go to the
          ZooKeeper service and click the Instances tab.

Record the permissions of the files and directories; you will need
        these to roll back ZooKeeper. 



Back Up HDFS 

Follow this procedure to back up an HDFS deployment. 
noteTo locate the hostnames required to backup HDFS (for JournalNodes,
        DataNodes, and NameNodes), open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go
        to the HDFS service, and click the Instances
        tab.

If high availability is enabled for HDFS, run the following command
          on all hosts running the JournalNode
          role:cp -rp /dfs/jn /dfs/jn-CM-CDH
On all NameNode hosts, back up the NameNode
          runtime directory. Run the following
            commands:mkdir -p /etc/hadoop/conf.rollback.namenodecd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/ && cd `ls -t1 | grep -e "-NAMENODE\$" | head -1`cp -rp * /etc/hadoop/conf.rollback.namenode/rm -rf /etc/hadoop/conf.rollback.namenode/log4j.propertiescp -rp /etc/hadoop/conf.cloudera.HDFS_service_name/log4j.properties /etc/hadoop/conf.rollback.namenode/These
            commands create a temporary rollback directory. If a rollback to CDH
            5.x is required later, the rollback procedure requires you to modify
            files in this directory. 
Back up the runtime directory for all DataNodes. Run the following
          commands on all
          DataNodes:mkdir -p /etc/hadoop/conf.rollback.datanode/cd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/ && cd `ls -t1 | grep -e "-DATANODE\$" | head -1`cp -rp * /etc/hadoop/conf.rollback.datanode/rm -rf /etc/hadoop/conf.rollback.datanode/log4j.propertiescp -rp /etc/hadoop/conf.cloudera.HDFS_service_name/log4j.properties /etc/hadoop/conf.rollback.datanode/
If high availability is not  enabled for HDFS, backup the
          runtime directory of the Secondary NameNode. Run the following
          commands on all Secondary NameNode
          hosts:mkdir -p /etc/hadoop/conf.rollback.secondarynamenode/cd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/ && cd `ls -t1 | grep -e "-SECONDARYNAMENODE\$" | head -1`cp -rp * /etc/hadoop/conf.rollback.secondarynamenode/rm -rf /etc/hadoop/conf.rollback.secondarynamenode/log4j.propertiescp -rp /etc/hadoop/conf.cloudera.HDFS_service_name/log4j.properties /etc/hadoop/conf.rollback.secondarynamenode/

noteFor more information on backing up HDFS, see Checkpoint HDFS documentation.



Back Up Key Trustee Server and Clients

For the detailed procedure, see Backing Up and Restoring Key Trustee
          Server and Clients.



Back Up HSM KMS

When running the HSM KMS in high availability mode, if either of the
        two nodes fails, a role instance can be assigned to another node and
        federated into the service by the single remaining active node. In other
        words, you can bring a node that is part of the cluster, but that is not
        running HSM KMS role instances, into the service by making it an HSM KMS
        role instance–more specifically, an HSM KMS proxy role instance and an
        HSM KMS metastore role instance. So each node acts as an online ("hot"
        backup) backup of the other. In many cases, this will be sufficient.
        However, if a manual ("cold" backup) backup of the files necessary to
        restore the service from scratch is desirable, you can create that as
        well.
To create a backup, copy the /var/lib/hsmkp and
          /var/lib/hsmkp-meta directories on one or more of the
        nodes running HSM KMS role instances.
To restore from a backup: bring up a completely new instance of the HSM
        KMS service, and copy the /var/lib/hsmkp and
          /var/lib/hsmkp-meta directories from the backup onto
        the file system of the restored nodes before starting HSM KMS for the
        first time.



Back Up Navigator Encrypt

It is recommended that you back up Navigator Encrypt configuration
        directory after installation, and again after any configuration updates.
To manually back up the Navigator Encrypt configuration directory
              (/etc/navencrypt):$ zip -r --encrypt nav-encrypt-conf.zip /etc/navencryptThe
                --encrypt option prompts you to create a password used
              to encrypt the zip file. This password is also required to decrypt
              the file. Ensure that you protect the password by storing it in a
              secure location.
Move the backup file (nav-encrypt-conf.zip) to a
            secure location.
warningFailure to back up the configuration directory
          makes your backed-up encrypted data unrecoverable in the event of data
          loss.



Back Up HBase

Because the rollback procedure also rolls back HDFS, the data in HBase
        is also rolled back. In addition, HBase metadata stored in ZooKeeper is
        recovered as part of the ZooKeeper rollback procedure.
If your cluster is configured to use HBase replication, Cloudera
        recommends that you document all replication peers. If necessary (for
        example, because the HBase znode has been deleted), you can roll back
        HBase as part of the HDFS rollback without the ZooKeeper metadata. This
        metadata can be reconstructed in a fresh ZooKeeper installation, with
        the exception of the replication peers, which you must add back. For
        information on enabling HBase replication, listing peers, and adding a
        peer, see HBase Replication in the CDH 5
        documentation.



Back Up Sqoop 2

If you are not using the default embedded Derby database for Sqoop 2,
        back up the database you have configured for Sqoop 2. Otherwise, back up
        the repository subdirectory of the Sqoop 2 metastore
        directory. This location is specified with the Sqoop 2 Server
          Metastore Directory  property. The default location is:
          /var/lib/sqoop2. For this default location, Derby
        database files are located in
          /var/lib/sqoop2/repository.
noteSqoop 2 is not supported in CDP Private Cloud Base.



Back Up Hue

Back up the app registry file on all hosts running the Hue Server role if you have
        installed CDP using RPM packages.
The app registry file (app.reg) is present in the
          /usr/lib/hue directory if you have installed Hue using the RPM
        package. It is a JSON file which contains the details of all apps that are used within Hue.
        If you have installed Hue using the parcels, then the app.reg file may not
        be present on your system, and you do not need to back it
        up.
Run the following command to back up the app.reg file for installations
        using RPM
        packages:cp -rp /usr/lib/hue/app.reg /usr/lib/hue_backup/app.reg-CM-CDH
