noteBefore upgrading the dependent services such as HBase, you must
      verify and ensure that the HDFS safemode is off. 
To determine if you can finalize the upgrade,
        run important workloads and ensure that they are successful. After you
        have finalized the upgrade, you cannot roll back to a previous version
        of HDFS without using backups. Verifying that you
          are ready to finalize the upgrade can take a long time. 
Make sure you have enough free disk space,
        keeping in mind that the following behavior continues until the upgrade
        is finalized: 
Deleting files does not free up disk space.
Using the balancer causes all moved replicas to be
            duplicated.
All on-disk data representing the NameNodes metadata is retained,
            which could more than double the amount of space required on the
            NameNode and JournalNode disks.

If you have Enabled high
      availability for HDFS, and you have performed a rolling upgrade:
Go to the HDFS service.
Select
              Actions > Finalize
              Rolling Upgrade and click
            Finalize Rolling Upgrade to confirm.


If you have
      not performed a rolling upgrade:
Go to the HDFS service.
Click the Instances tab.
Click the link for the NameNode instance. If you have enabled
              high availability for HDFS, click the link labeled
                NameNode (Active).
The NameNode instance page displays.
Select Actions > Finalize Metadata Upgrade and click Finalize Metadata Upgrade to
            confirm.
