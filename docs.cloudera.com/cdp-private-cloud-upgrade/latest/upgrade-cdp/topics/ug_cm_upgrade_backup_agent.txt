noteCommands are provided below to backup various files and directories
      used by Cloudera Manager Agents. If you have configured custom paths for
      any of these, substitute those paths in the commands. The commands also
      provide destination paths to store the backups, defined by the environment
      variable CM_BACKUP_DIR, which is used in all the backup
      commands. You may change these destination paths in the command as needed
      for your deployment. The tar commands in the steps
        below may return the following message. It is safe to ignore this
        message:
        tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
