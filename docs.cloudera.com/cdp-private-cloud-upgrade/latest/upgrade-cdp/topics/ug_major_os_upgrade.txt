Upgrading the Major Version Operating System




This topic describes the additional steps needed to upgrade the operating system of a host
      managed by Cloudera Manager to a higher version for major releases
Upgrading the operating system to a different major release is called a major release
        upgrade. For example, upgrading from Redhat 6.8 to 7.4. This is a much more complex
      procedure and some operating systems do not support these upgrades without a complete OS
      reinstall. Therefore, this topic does not cover the procedures for upgrading specific
      operating systems.
In general, a major OS upgrade process requires shutting down all cluster components and
      Cloudera Manager. All Cloudera packages and parcels must be removed and reinstalled for the
      new OS.
This topic primarily describes all the additional steps such as backing
      up essential files and removing and reinstalling all the necessary
      Cloudera Enterprise packages and parcels.
noteYou must determine whether to upgrade the operating system or Cloudera
      Manager first:For example, consider the following upgrade from Cloudera
        Manager 5.13.3 to Cloudera Manager 7.1.4 and an operating system upgrade
        from RHEL 7.6 to RHEL 7.8
Cloudera Manager 5.13.3 supports only RHEL 7.6
Cloudera Manager 7.1.4 supports RHEL 7.6 and RHEL 7.8
 In this case you must upgrade Cloudera Manager first, otherwise
        Cloudera Manager version 5.13.3 would be deployed on an unsupported
        operating system (RHEL 7.6) and may fail.
