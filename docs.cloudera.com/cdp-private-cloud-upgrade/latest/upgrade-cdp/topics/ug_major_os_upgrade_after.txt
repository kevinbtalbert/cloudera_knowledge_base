This topic describes how to upgrade the operating system on a Cloudera Manager managed
      host.


Parent topic: Upgrading the Major Version Operating System
Establish Access to the
      Software

Cloudera Manager needs access to a package repository that contains the updated software
        packages. You can choose to access the Cloudera public repositories directly, or you can
          download those repositories and set up a
          local repository to access them from within your network. If your cluster hosts do
        not have connectivity to the Internet, you must set up a local repository. 

 Log in to the
          Cloudera Manager Server host.
          ssh my_cloudera_manager_server_host

 Log in to each cluster host.
          ssh cluster_host

Remove any older files in the existing
        repository directory:
RHEL / CentOS

sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudera*manager.repo*

SLES

sudo rm /etc/zypp/repos.d/cloudera*manager.repo*

Ubuntu

sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudera*.list*


Fill in the form at the top of this page.
Create a repository file so that the package manager can locate
          and download the binaries. Do one of the following, depending on whether or not you are
          using a local package repository:

Using a local package repository. (Required when cluster hosts do not
                  have access to the internet.)


Configure a local package
                    repository hosted on your network.
In the Package Repository URL, replace the entire URL
                  with the URL for your local package repository. A username and password are not
                    required to access local repositories.
Click Apply.



Using the Cloudera public repository


Substitute your
                      USERNAME and
                      PASSWORD in the Package
                    Repository URL where indicated in the URL.
Click Apply



Package Repository URL:

tip If you have a mixed operating system environment, adjust the
              Operating System filter at the top of the page for each operating system. The
            guide will generate the repo file for you automatically here. 


RHEL / CentOS

Create a file named /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudera-manager.repo with
                  the following content:
[cloudera-manager]
# Packages for Cloudera Manager
name=Cloudera Manager
baseurl=https://archive.cloudera.com/cm5/redhat/7/x86_64/cm/5.15
gpgkey=https://archive.cloudera.com/cm5/redhat/7/x86_64/cm/RPM-GPG-KEY-cloudera
gpgcheck=1
Copy this file to the same location on all cluster hosts.

SLES

Create a file named /etc/zypp/repos.d/cloudera-manager.repo with
                  the following content:
[cloudera-manager]
# Packages for Cloudera Manager
name=Cloudera Manager
baseurl=https://archive.cloudera.com/cm5/sles/12/x86_64/cm/5.15
gpgkey=https://archive.cloudera.com/cm5/sles/12/x86_64/cm/RPM-GPG-KEY-cloudera
gpgcheck=1
Copy this file to the same location on all cluster hosts.

Ubuntu
Create a file named
                  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudera_manager.list with the following
                content:# Packages for Cloudera Manager
deb https://archive.cloudera.com/cm5/debian/jessie/amd64/cm/ jessie-cm5.15 contrib
deb-src https://archive.cloudera.com/cm5/debian/jessie/amd64/cm/ jessie-cm5.15 contrib
                Run the following command:sudo apt-get update
Copy this file to the same location on all cluster hosts.

The repository file, as
            created, refers to the most recent maintenance release of the specified minor
            release. If you would like to use a specific maintenance version, for example 5.15.1,
            replace 5.15 with 5.15.1 in
            the generated repository file shown above.

A Cloudera Manager upgrade can introduce new package
          dependencies. Your organization may have restrictions or require prior approval for
          installation of new packages. You can determine which packages may be installed or
          upgraded: 
RHEL / CentOS

yum deplist cloudera-manager-agent

SLES

zypper info --requires cloudera-manager-agent

Ubuntu

apt-cache depends cloudera-manager-agent






Reinstall Cloudera Manager Server, Daemon & Agent Packages

On the Cloudera Manager Server host, re-install the removed Cloudera packages.


Install the packages. 
Include the
            cloudera-manager-server-db-2 package in the command only if you are using the embedded
            PostgreSQL database.  

RHEL / CentOS

sudo yum clean all
sudo yum install cloudera-manager-server cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2

SLES

sudo zypper clean --all
sudo zypper install cloudera-manager-server cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2

Ubuntu

sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cloudera-manager-server cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server-db-2




Verify that the configuration files (that were backed up) are intact. Correct if
            necessary.


 If you customized the /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini file, your
            customized file is renamed with the extension .rpmsave or
              .dpkg-old. Merge any customizations into the
              /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini file that is installed by the
            package manager. 





Start Cloudera Manager Server & local Agent

On the host with Cloudera Manager Server, the appropriate services typically will start
        automatically on reboot. Otherwise, start the Cloudera Manager Server and the local Agent as
        necessary.

Start the Cloudera Manager Server by running the following
          command:sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-server
Start the Cloudera Manager
            Agent.sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-agentIf
            the agent starts without errors, no response displays.
Verify that the Cloudera Manager Agent downloaded a proper
          parcel for your new operating system. You can use the following command to check-in
          Cloudera Manager logs for downloaded parcels:
            grep "Completed download" /var/log/cloudera-scm-agent/cloudera-scm-agent.logThe
            download might take some time. Look for the operating system in the names of the
            downloaded parcels. The output of the command should look similar to the
            following:# grep "Completed download" /var/log/cloudera-scm-agent/cloudera-scm-agent.log
[02/May/2023 07:26:44 +0000] 20004 WorkerThread downloader   INFO     Completed download of http://nightly-7x-rf-1.nightly-7x-rf.root.hwx.site:7180/cmf/parcel/download/CDH-7.2.17-1.cdh7.2.17.p0.40465599-el7.parcel code=200 state=downloaded
[02/May/2023 07:31:00 +0000] 20004 WorkerThread downloader   INFO     Completed download of http://nightly-7x-rf-1.nightly-7x-rf.root.hwx.site:7180/cmf/parcel/download/FLINK-1.12-csa1.4.0.0-cdh7.1.6.0-297-13947709-el7.parcel code=200 state=downloadedVerify
            that the timestamps of the log lines are recent. Re-run the grep command again until the
            log lines appear. Verify the operating system name and major version in the parcel names
            and match the new operating system installed on the host. In the above output
            example, el7 refers to Redhat Enterprise Linux 7.importantIf you are installing parcels from a local
            repository, then parcels for the new operating system must be downloaded to the local
            repository first. For more information, see Step 5: Access Parcels  and Configuring a Local Parcel
          Repository.




Install and start Agent on remaining hosts



Install and start the Cloudera Manager Agent package on all the remaining hosts of the
            cluster by running the following command:

RHEL / CentOS

sudo yum clean all
sudo yum install cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent



SLES

sudo zypper clean â€“all
sudo zypper install cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent



Ubuntu

sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cloudera-amanger-daemons cloudera-manager-agent



Verify that the configuration files (that were backed up) are intact. Correct if
          necessary.

 If you customized the /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini file, your
            customized file is renamed with the extension .rpmsave or
              .dpkg-old. Merge any customizations into the
              /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini file that is installed by the
            package manager.

Start the Cloudera Manager
          Agentsudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-agent




Start Clusters


Do one of the following to start the Cloudera Management
            Service:


Select Clusters > Cloudera Management Service.
Select Actions > Start.


On the Home > Status tab, click the  options menu to the right of Cloudera Management
                Service and select Start.
Start the Cloudera Management Service by running the following
              command:sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-server
noteVerify that the Cloudera Management
            Service is started.
Go to Hosts > All Hosts page and verify that the status of all the hosts are in green.
Go to Clusters > Parcels Parcels page and verify that all needed parcels are in the
            Distributed and Activated state.
On the Home > Status tab, click the options menu to the right of each Cluster
          and select Start to start all the services in each of the
            cluster.noteVerify that all clusters are up and
            running.
