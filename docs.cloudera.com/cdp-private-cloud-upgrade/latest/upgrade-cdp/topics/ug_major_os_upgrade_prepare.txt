This topic describes steps you must perform before upgrading the operating system on all
      hosts managed by Cloudera Manager.

Stop Running Clusters


Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
On the Home > Status tab, click the options menu to the right of each Cluster
          and select Stop to stop all the services in the cluster.
Do one of the following to stop the Cloudera Management
            Service:


Select Clusters > Cloudera Management Service.
Select Actions > Stop.


On the Home > Status tab, click the  options menu to the right of Cloudera Management
                Service and select Stop.





Stop Cloudera Manager Server


On the Cloudera Manager Server host, stop the Cloudera Manager Service by running the
          following
          command:sudo systemctl stop cloudera-scm-server




Remove Packages & Parcels

Packages and parcels for the older operating system will not be able to start on the new
        operating system. Perform the following steps on every host in the cluster:

Run the following command to remove old packages from the host:
RHEL / CentOS

sudo yum remove cloudera-manager-server cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent
sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudera*manager.repo*

SLES

sudo zypper remove cloudera-manager-server cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent
sudo rm /etc/zypp/repos.d/cloudera*manager.repo*

Ubuntu

sudo apt-get purge  cloudera-manager-server cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent 
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudera*.list*



Remove old parcels from the host.
Empty the contents of the following directories. These are the defaults for parcel
            storage - if you use other directories, please change accordingly.
sudo rm -rf /opt/cloudera/parcels/*
sudo rm -rf /opt/cloudera/parcel-cache/*





Upgrade the Operating System

importantWhen there are no Hadoop services or Cloudera Manager roles running,
        you may proceed to upgrade the operating system, make sure to leave the data partitions (for
        example, dfs.data.dir) unchanged.
Use the operating system upgrade procedures provided by your operating system vendor (for
        example: RedHat or Ubuntu) to download their software and perform the operating system
        upgrade.
