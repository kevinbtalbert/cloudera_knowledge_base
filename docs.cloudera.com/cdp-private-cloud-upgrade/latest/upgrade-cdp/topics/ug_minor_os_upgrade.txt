Upgrading the Minor Version Operating System




This topic describes the additional steps needed to upgrade the operating system of a host
      managed by Cloudera Manager to a higher version for minor release.
Upgrading the operating system to a higher version but within the same major release is
      called a minor release upgrade. For example, upgrading from Redhat 6.8 to 6.9. This is
      a relatively simple procedure that involves properly shutting down all the components,
      performing the operating system upgrade, and then restarting everything in reverse order.
This topic primarily describes all the additional steps such as backing up essential files
      and removing and reinstalling all the necessary Cloudera Enterprise packages and parcels.
noteYou must determine whether to upgrade the operating system or Cloudera Manager
        first:For example, consider the following upgrade from Cloudera Manager 5.13.3 to
        Cloudera Manager 7.1.4 and an operating system upgrade from RHEL 7.6 to RHEL 7.8
Cloudera Manager 5.13.3 supports only RHEL 7.6
Cloudera Manager 7.1.4 supports RHEL 7.6 and RHEL 7.8
 In this case you must upgrade Cloudera Manager first, otherwise Cloudera Manager
        version 5.13.3 would be deployed on an unsupported operating system (RHEL 7.6) and may fail.
