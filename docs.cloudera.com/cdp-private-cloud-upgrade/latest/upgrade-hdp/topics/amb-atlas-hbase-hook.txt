Atlas Migration and HBase Hook settings
There are specific settings for the Atlas migration that you must update after the
        cluster upgrade is completed.
After the upgrade to HDP intermediate bits, you must ensure that the Atlas settings
      are unchanged. The atlas.migration.data.filename property will continue
      to point to a non-existent path. For example,
        atlas.migration.data.filename=/tmp/non-existent-path.
noteYou must add Atlas Gateway role to all hosts which have the hook-based
          services like Hive / Hive on Tez / Impala / HBase / Spark / Kafka.You must
        configure the settings for the Atlas migration so that metadata can be imported into Atlas.
        You must remove the configuration after the migration completes.
After the migration import is complete, return to the
            atlas.migration.data.filename property and click
            Remove to remove it. Restart Atlas when prompted by Ambari.
When upgrading to HDP intermediate bits from earlier versions, you might need
        to manually enable the HBase hook.
On the Ambari dashboard, select HBase > Configs > Advanced
              hbase-env, then select Enable
            Atlas Hook. Click Save, then
          restart HBase and any other services that require a restart.
