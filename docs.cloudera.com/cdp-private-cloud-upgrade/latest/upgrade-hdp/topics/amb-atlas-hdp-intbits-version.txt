Place Atlas in migration mode
Before starting the upgrade from HDP 2.6.5.x to HDP intermediate bits, within Atlas
        you must set the atlas.migration.data.filename property to point to a
        non-existent directory.
It is mandatory to ensure that the pre-upgrade checks within Ambari are completed. After
            you upgrade to HDP intermediate bits, the migration is prevented from starting. This
            property will be set to the correct path. Configure the

                atlas.migration.data.filename property. 
In Ambari, select Services > Atlas > Configs > Advanced > Custom
                        application-properties.
Click Add Property, and add the
                        atlas.migration.data.filename property. Example:
                            atlas.migration.data.filename=/tmp/non-existent-path
