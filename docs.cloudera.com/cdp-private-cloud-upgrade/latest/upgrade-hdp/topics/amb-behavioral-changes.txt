Ambari Behavioral changes 
Behavioral changes denote a marked change in behavior from the previously released
        version to this version of Ambari. Between Ambari 2.6.x and Ambari 7.1.x there were changes
        implemented in 2.7.x versions.Ambari 7.1.x


Description
Behavioral Changes


Atlas and Ranger Default Installation
During the service selection process of a new install, you see multiple limited functionality warnings if Atlas, Ranger, and their dependent services are not selected for installation.


Ambari UI uses websocket to communicate with the Ambari
                                Server
The Ambari UI now uses websocket to communicate with the Ambari
                                Server. If you are using Ambari through a proxy like Nginx, Knox, or
                                Apache HTTPD, ensure that that proxy is configured to proxy
                                websocket traffic. If this is not done, the Ambari web UI does not
                                update quickly and performance is sluggish.


Ambari Server and Log Search UI Changes
The look and feel of the Ambari Server UI in Ambari 7.1.x.x
                                and the Log Search UI have changed significantly.


Ambari Server Setup SSO CLI
The ambari-server setup-sso command now includes a prompt
                            to setup SSO for Ambari, Atlas, and Ranger.


KDC Admin host must use FQDN
As of Ambari 7.1.x, the KDC admin host value is expected to
                                be the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the host where the KDC
                                administration server is located. If Kerberos is enabled, then
                                verify and update the KDC Admin host to use FQDN. This must be done
                                before the upgrade can proceed.


Keytab Regeneration
After upgrading to Ambari 7.1.x, clicking Regenerate
                                Keytabs and selecting only to regenerate missing keytabs regenerates
                                all keytabs. This behavior only happens the first time this
                                operation is performed, all subsequent use of Regenerate Keytabs
                                with only missing keytabs selected behaves as usual.


KDC Admin Credentials Needed during Stack upgrade
When upgrading from HDP 2.6.5.x to HDP intermediate bits,
                                additional YARN components are added to the cluster. If your cluster
                                has Kerberos enabled, the Ambari Server must be configured to store
                                the KDC admin credentials so that the principals for these
                                components can be created during the upgrade.


Blueprint Deletion
You can not allow a DELETE operation on an existing Blueprint when a cluster deployment has completed with that Blueprint. In any other case, the DELETE is allowed.


Version API Change
The default response to the /api/v1/clusters has changed.
                                Before Ambari 2.7, each cluster's “version” was reported in the
                                response of this call by default. In Ambari 7.1.x, this “version”
                                field is no longer included in the default response, but can be
                                included in the response if the following query parameters are used:
                                “/api/v1/clusters?fields=Clusters/version”


Ambari Views Removed
Ambari 7.1.x does not support Hive, Tez, and Pig
                                Views.

AMBARI-9016
 HTTP Header Content-Type:text/plain when the content is in JSON format

                            Scenario:
                            Ambari REST API is expecting "Content-Type" HTTP header set to "text/plain" even though content is in JSON format. If the client specified the same header with the value of "application/json", Ambari threw an HTTP 500 error.
                            Previous Behavior: Ambari behaviour was misleading, forcing the user to use "text/plain" Content-Type header in HTTP clients.
                            New Behavior:
                            Ambari expects an "application/json" Content-Type header.
                            Expected Customer Action: Revise any custom code that uses the Ambari REST API and take actions if needed.
