Custom Spark SQL Warehouse Directory
If required, you must configure the Spark SQL warehouse location in the upgraded
        cluster. 
If Applicable: Configure Custom Spark SQL Warehouse Directory
Since Spark 2.0.0, Spark references spark.sql.warehouse.dir as the default Spark SQL
            Warehouse location. In HDP 2.6.5.x, the standard value for the
                spark.sql.warehouse.dir property is
                /apps/hive/warehouse. On an Ambari cluster with HDP 2.6.5.x, this
            property must be set manually in both Custom spark2-defaults and
                Custom spark2-thrift-sparkconf. When upgrading from HDP 2.6.5.x to
            HDP intermediate bits, Ambari migrates the spark.sql.warehouse.dir
            property to Advanced spark2-defaults and Advanced
                spark2-thrift-sparkconf, and changes the value of this property to
                /apps/spark/warehouse. This is done to accommodate the separate
            Spark and Hive catalogs introduced in the HDP intermediate bits. If you used a custom
            setting for the spark.sql.warehouse.dir property in HDP 2.6.5.x, the Ambari upgrade to
            HDP intermediate bits ignores the custom setting and sets the value of the
                spark.sql.warehouse.dir property to
                /apps/spark/warehouse in both Advanced
                spark2-defaults and Advanced spark2-thrift-sparkconf.
If you want to use a custom Spark SQL warehouse after upgrading to the HDP intermediate
            bits, select Spark2 > Configs, then use Add
                Property in Advanced spark2-defaults and
                Advanced spark2-thrift-sparkconf to update the value of the
                spark.sql.warehouse.dir property with the custom setting.
If Hive is configured to run as a custom user, you must change the ownership of your new
            Hive warehouse directory to be owned by that custom user. hdfs dfs -chown
                cstm-hive /warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive/
