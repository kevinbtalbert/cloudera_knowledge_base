Enable Auto Start setting
Ensure that you enable Auto Start Settings in Cloudera Manager
        for all the components.
If you enable Auto Start Settings in Ambari, the Ambari
            services are configured to start automatically on system boot. However, post migration
            to Cloudera Manager, this Auto Start Settings field is enabled
            only for Zookeeper-Server. For other components, enable this setting manually in
            Cloudera Manager.

In the Search box, search for Automatically Restart
                        Process.
Results are displayed for all the components. 

Select the component from the results displayed.

Click the Automatically Restart Process checkbox.
