Hive Policy Additions
Hive Metastore Canary test might fail on clusters migrated from HDP because the service
    account used to perform these tests is different between the two management
    consoles.
The new service account is Hue. You must add the Hue user to the policies defined that hold
      Hive as the superuser. If there is no policy in Ranger defining Hive as a superuser across key
      directories in HDFS, then you are using impersonation. Impersonation is no longer the standard
      or recommended. Consult the Cloudera team for details.
