Kafka 
You must cleanup metadata on broker hosts after migrating the Ambari-managed HDP
    cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base. If you are upgrading to CDP Private
    Cloud Base 7.1.7, you can ignore step 3, step 4, and step 5.
Cleanup Metadata on Broker Hosts
On each Broker host, remove
            $log.dirs/meta.properties file from Kafka broker
          hosts. For example, 

#mv /grid/0/kafka-logs/meta.properties
            /tmp.Remove
              ${log.dirs}/meta.properties file from Kafka
            broker.If the Kafka log.dirs property points to /kafka-logs,
            then the command is #mv /kafka-logs/meta.properties
                /tmp

Set the Kafka port value. For more information, see Change Kafka Port Value.

Enable kerberos.auth.enable. For more information, see Kafka cluster Kerberos.

In the Ambari kafka configuration, get the zookeeper.connect
          configuration value. Find the path defined at the end after port number and update the
          path at Cloudera Manager Kafka zookeeper.chroot configuration. For
          example, if the path is
            zookeeper.connect=hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3/chroot/path,
          then the path is /chroot/path. Another example,  if the path is
            zookeeper.connect=hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3,
          then the path is /. Also, the default path is /.
        

Update the broker IDs:


Log in to Cloudera Manager
Navigate to Clusters
Select the Kafka service
Navigate to the Configurations tab
Search for broker.id and update the IDs for each
              hostname using the output of the third step of Extract broker ID Procedure 2



Start the Kafka service.

Change Kafka port valueChange the Kafka JMX port value if the Ranger KMS port is conflicting with Kafka JMX         port.Kafka cluster KerberosIf the CDP cluster is kerberised, then you must set this parameter. This setting is         applicable only if you are upgrading from HDP 2.6.5 to CDP Private Cloud Base         7.1.6.Unsetting Kafka Protocol versionYou must unset the Kafka protocol version from Cloudera Manager after the upgrade is   complete. This allows you to use the updated Kafka version using Cloudera Manager.Parent topic: Post transition steps
