Change Kafka port value
Change the Kafka JMX port value if the Ranger KMS port is conflicting with Kafka JMX
        port.
The Ranger KMS ranger.service.https.port port value is migrated from
            HDP. In Cloudera Manager, if the Kafka jmx_port port value is the
            same as Ranger KMS port value from HDP, then you must change the Kafka JMX port to a
            different value in Cloudera Manager.
