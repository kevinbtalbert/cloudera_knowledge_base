Managing MPacks
You must review the information mentioned in this section before you proceed with the
  upgrade.


Not all Management Packs are compatible with the HDP intermediate bits. Cloudera Support can
     help you assess the feasibility of your upgrade if you have Management Packs other than HDF
     installed.
Cloudera does not support HDF in-place upgrades if HDF is used in combination with the HDP 2
     cluster. This is because it is not supported to have HDP 2.x + HDF 3.5.2 managed by the same
     Ambari.
If you're running HDF on top of HDF 2.6.5, you cannot upgrade HDF. You have two options: 
You can upgrade both HDP and HDF in order to have Ambari 2.7.5 managing both HDP 3.1.5 and
       HDF 3.5.2. You can then proceed with the in-place upgrade to CDP.
You can detach the HDF services from Ambari, uninstall the HDF mpack from Ambari, and
       proceed with the upgrade for Ambari/HDP. After upgrading to CDP, you can install the
       corresponding services and migrate the workloads from the HDF cluster to the new services
       running on CDP. noteNiFi and NiFi Registry are part of the CFM parcel needs to be installed
        in CDP. Kafka and Schema Registry are part of the CDP runtime. Storm and SAM are deprecated
        and replaced by Flink and SSB. For more information, see CFM Migration on migrating NiFi flows between two
        environments.

If you have any doubts or concerns or questions about the migration process, you must
     contact the Cloudera Support for further assistance to help you determine the best migration
     plan for your business needs.
The latest and supported version of AM2CM is AM2CM 2.0.2. This version is capable of
     handling the HDF 3.5.2.0 â†’ CPD 7.1.7.0 upgrade path.
