Migrating Atlas data
After Atlas is available on the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster,
        you must import the Atlas data that the Atlas migration exporter utility exported from the
        HDP 2.6.5.x cluster.
Use these properties to improve the speed of Atlas data
                import:For a node with 4 cores and 8 GB of heap space, the estimated duration for
                import is 0.75 million entities per hour. 

Navigate to Atlas > Configs > Advanced > Custom
                            application-properties:
atlas.migration.mode.batch.size: Recommended value is
                        3000.
atlas.migration.mode.workers: Value to be set depends on
                        the number of cores on the node on which Atlas runs. Typically, set the
                        value as (number of cores - 1) * 2. For an 8 core node, set this property to
                        (8 - 1) * 2 = 14.

Additional patches are applied after the migration is completed. These are the
                properties that will help with improving the speed of patches.

Configure Atlas in CDP Private Cloud Base with the
                    location of the exported data.

Configure atlas.migration.data.filename property.

In Cloudera Manager, navigate to
                        Clusters and select
                    Atlas.

From Atlas configuration, set the Advanced Configuration Snippet
                        (Safety Valve) value to the location which contains exported
                    Atlas data. For example, 

Set additional properties:


atlas.migration.mode.batch.size=3000.
atlas.migration.mode.workers=<use the value
                                from calculation above>
atlas.patch.batchSize=3000
atlas.patch.numWorkers=<use the value from
                                calculation above>

For example:
atlas.migration.data.filename=/var/lib/atlas-data
atlas.migration.mode.batch.size=3000.
atlas.migration.mode.workers=14
atlas.patch.batchSize=3000
atlas.patch.numWorkers=14






Save the configuration.

Restart Atlas from Cloudera Manager. Go to
                        Atlas>Actions>Restart.






Atlas starts in the migration mode and data import should commence. During the
                    migration process, Atlas blocks all the REST API calls and Atlas Hook
                    notification processing.

To check the migration status 

http://[atlas_server]:21000/api/atlas/admin/status
The migration status is displayed in the browser window:
{"Status":"Migration","currentIndex":139,"percent":67,"
startTimeUTC":"2018-04-06T00:54:53.399Z"}



The progress of import can be monitored using Atlas logs on the node where the
                    migration is running. On the completion of migration, the log should have this
                    entry: Done! loadLegacyGraphSON.
                        (GraphDBGraphSONMigrator:76)


After the migration is complete, change the status of Atlas from migration mode
                    to normal operation by removing the
                        atlas.migration.data.filename property and restarting
                    Atlas in Cloudera Manager.

note

After Atlas is up and running, it continues processing messages from
                                the integrated services. Explicitly importing data through import
                                scripts is not required.
As part of this migration, the value of
                                    atlas.cluster.name is mapped to the new
                                property atlas.metadata.namespace. This value
                                is used within Atlas for generating unique names of entities.
You must restart Atlas and then remove the property
                                    atlas.migration.mode.hdp.to.cdp=true from
                                the Atlas Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                                    Valve) for
                                    conf/atlas-application.properties after the
                                solr collections are migrated to the CDP cluster.
