Post-HDP-upgrade tasks
After the HDP cluster is upgraded to HDP intermediate bits, ensure that you check the
        cluster settings, migration, and restore settings are correct.
Update Ranger passwordsRanger password validation has been updated in HDP intermediate bitsAtlas Migration and HBase Hook settingsThere are specific settings for the Atlas migration that you must update after the         cluster upgrade is completed.Ambari Metrics and LogSearchTake the Ambari Metrics and Log Search Services out of Maintenance Mode by choosing             Actions > Turn Off Maintenance Mode from each Service         page.Ambari infra-migrate and restoreFollow the steps below to restore the data previously backed up:Upload HDFS entity informationYou must also configure the property below to update the values of the Ranger tag         store only if you are using Ranger Tagsync.Custom Spark SQL Warehouse DirectoryIf required, you must configure the Spark SQL warehouse location in the upgraded         cluster. Hive post-HDP-upgrade tasksYou need to perform several critical tasks after upgrading to CDP Private Cloud Base, such as         checking table locations and correcting locations of files. Before beginning these tasks,         you need a little information about Hive changes to ACID properties. Verify Zeppelin settings in AmbariAfter upgrading Ambari and HDP, make sure that the Zeppelin     settings reference the local filesystem paths instead of HDFS.Search post-HDP-upgrade tasksAfter upgrading your HDP cluster to Cloudera Runtime, you need to add a Solr service         to your CDP cluster where you can recreate the collections you transitioned from HDP Search.         Once done, you can proceed with reindexing data to the transitioned collections.Backup Infra Solr collectionsBackup the Infra solr collections from the Ambari managed Infra Solr service and     restore them on the Infra Solr service managed by Cloudera Manager. When you are creating a     backup of the Infra solr data, ensure that only Infra Solr and Zookeeper services are started     and other services are stopped. Similarly, when you are restoring the data on Infra Solr managed     by Cloudera Manager, you must start HDFS and Zookeeper only. This ensures no operations are     performed by services which can push data to Infra Solr. Parent topic: Upgrading HDP to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x
