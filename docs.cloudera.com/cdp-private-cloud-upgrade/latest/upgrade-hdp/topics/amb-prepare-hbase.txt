Preparing HBase for upgrade
Before upgrading to CDP Private Cloud Base, transition your
        HFiles to a supported encoding type and validate HFiles to ensure that you do not have any
        HFiles that use unsupported encoding or are in a bad state.
importantEnsure that you complete all the pre-upgrade steps if you have Apache
            HBase installed in your existing HDP cluster.
Preparing HBase for upgradeYou must perform the
                pre-upgrade tasks after installing the HDP intermediate bits on the hosts, but
                before you upgrade your cluster to HDP intermediate bits. Run these commands on the
                cluster that has the HDP intermediate bits. The HBase validation tool is packaged
                within HDP intermedite bits, and you register the software repositories for the new
                target version with Ambari and then install the software on all hosts in the
                cluster. For more information to get the intermediate bits, see Register software
                repositories.Ensure that you check for any corrupted HFiles and
                rectify them before the upgrade using the HFile content validator
                    (validate-hfile) tool.When upgrading from an HDP 2.6.x
                cluster, you should begin by making a copy of the HBase client configuration
                directory for use with these upgrade checks. In this configuration copy, you should
                delete the metrics collection configuration file
                    hadoop-metrics2-hbase.properties because it is incompatible
                with the newer utilities. If this file is left in place then the pre-upgrade HBase
                commands will not properly check the underlying HFiles for issues. Before you run
                the pre-upgrade checks, ensure that you point to the correct configuration
                directory. For example, you can use the export command or the
                    hbase --config CLI option to point to the configuration
                directory.export HBASE_CONF_DIR=/[**PATH TO THE CONFIGURATION DIRECTORY**]This
            is an example export HBASE_CONF_DIR command that you can use to point to the correct
            configuration directory before you run the validation
                checks.export HBASE_CONF_DIR=/home/dirname/hbase-confShould
                the pre-upgrade check fail due to an old incompatible configuration directory, the
                command will log the following
            exception:java.lang.AbstractMethodError: org.apache.hadoop.metrics2.sink.timeline.HadoopTimelineMetricsSink.init
(Lorg/apache/commons/configuration2/SubsetConfiguration;)
