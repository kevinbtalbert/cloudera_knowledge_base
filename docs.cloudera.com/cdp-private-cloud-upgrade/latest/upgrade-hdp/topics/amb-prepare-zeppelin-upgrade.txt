Preparing Zeppelin for upgrade
Before upgrading HDP to CDP, you must copy the Zeppelin notebooks
    and configuration files from HDFS to the Zeppelin server host
    filesystem.

On the Zeppelin server host, create the
            /var/lib/zeppelin/conf and
            /var/lib/zeppelin/notebook directories:

sudo -u zeppelin mkdir -p /var/lib/zeppelin/conf /var/lib/zeppelin/notebook

If you are using Kerberos, authenticate as the
            zeppelin user first. Otherwise, run the commands as
          the zeppelin user by prefixing the commands with
            sudo -u zeppelin:
kinit zeppelin
Copy all notebooks from HDFS to the
            /var/lib/zeppelin/notebook directory. If you are
          using Kerberos, authenticate as the zeppelin user
          first:
kinit zeppelin
hdfs dfs -get "/user/zeppelin/notebook/*" /var/lib/zeppelin/notebook 

Copy the notebook-authorization.json files from HDFS to the
            /var/lib/zeppelin/conf directory:

hdfs dfs -get /user/zeppelin/conf/notebook-authorization.json /var/lib/zeppelin/conf


Continue with the upgrade.
