Ambari Properties backup
Prior to upgrading from Ambari 2.6.2.x to Ambari 7.1.x.x, you must make a copy of the
        Ambari Server configuration file so that you can reapply any configuration changes you have
        done earlier to the new file.
During the Ambari upgrade, the existing
                /var/lib/ambari-server/ambari-env.sh file is
            overwritten and a backup copy of ambari-env.sh (with extension
                .rpmsave) is created. If you have manually modified
                ambari-env.sh (for example, to change Ambari Server heap), you must
            reapply your changes in the new file.
To purge your Ambari cluster, see Purging Ambari Server Database History.
