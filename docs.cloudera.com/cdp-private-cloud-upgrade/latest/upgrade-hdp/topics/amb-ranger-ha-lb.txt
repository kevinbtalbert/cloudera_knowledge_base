Ranger Installation in High Availability with Load Balancer
For clusters that have multiple users and production availability requirements, you
        may want to configure Ranger high availability (HA) with a load-balancing proxy server to
        relay requests to and from Ranger.
If Ranger Admin High Availability is not configured in
            Ranger, then you must configure it. For more information, see Configure Ranger Admin High
            Availability with a Load Balancer.

Update the Ranger Load Balancer Address property
                        (ranger.externalurl) with the load balancer host URL
                    and port

noteWhile updating this property, avoid adding an extra trailing slash at the
                        end of the load balancer URL.

In kerberos cluster, create a composite keytab file having HTTP principals of
