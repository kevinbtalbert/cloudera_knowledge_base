Configure Ranger in Cloudera Manager-managed CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.
Usually, Ranger and most HDP services are set up to synchronize and authenticate against
            an LDAP/AD service. In the Cloudera Manager-managed CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, additional options are available
            to manage integrations using the aspects of the existing operating system's IDM
            integration. 
The configuration for Ranger in Cloudera Manager-managed CDP Private Cloud Base cluster is through PAM (Pluggable
            Authentication Module). In a Kerberized environment, PAM integration is available at the
            Operating system level. 
You can use the Ranger services for authentication, user, and group synchronization using
            the PAM integration. 
If PAM integration is not an option, then you must record the details from Ambari to
            install and configure Ranger in Cloudera Manager.
