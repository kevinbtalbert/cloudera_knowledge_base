Missing Hive tables
In case you have lost the Hive tables, you can recover them by performing a few
        steps.

Login as Superuser HDFS. For example:

$ sudo su - hdfs


On HDFS, read the snapshots you saved of your table data. For example:

 $ hdfs dfs -cat /apps/hive/warehouse/.snapshot/s20181204-164645.898/students/000000_0

 Example output for a trivial table having two rows and three columns might
                        look something like this:
 fred flintstone351.28
 barney rubble322.32


In Hive, insert the data into the table if the schema exists in the Hive warehouse; otherwise, restore the Hive Metastore, which includes the schemas, from the database dump you created in the pre-upgrade process.
