Remove Existing Collections and Upgrade Binaries 
Once the data has been backed up, the old collections need to be deleted, and the
        Ambari Infra Solr, and Log Search (if installed) components need to be upgraded.

To do all of that, run the following script: 
/usr/lib/ambari-infra-solr-client/ambariSolrMigration.sh \
--ini-file $CONFIG_INI_LOCATION \
--mode delete | tee delete_output.txt
During this process, the script generates Ambari tasks that are
                        visible in the Background Operations dialog in the Ambari Server.After the process has completed, retain the output of the script
                            for your records. This output is helpful when debugging any issues that may
                            occur during the migration process.
