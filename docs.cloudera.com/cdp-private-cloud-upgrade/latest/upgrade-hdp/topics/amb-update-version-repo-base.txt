Update version repository base urls
Use Admin/Versions/Repositories to provide URLs for your source
    repositories.
Browse to Ambari Admin > Versions >
            Manage Versions > OK.

In Admin/Versions, click the version name you want to
          modify.

In Repositories, modify the base URLs for the repositories. To
          use the private software repositories, see the list of available HDP repositories for each
          OS. Or, if you are using a local repository, enter the Base URLs for the local repository
          you have created.

Click Save.

Click Confirm Change. You must confirm the change since you are
          about to change repository Base URLs that are already in use. Please confirm that you
          intend to make this change and that the new Base URLs point to the same exact stack
          version and build.
