Updating Ambari repo files
Some services depend on components that are installed from the Ambari repository. It is not updated automatically. Also, Package Manager displays an error about the unavailable repository URL when you update the package lists. Cloudera recommends you to manually update the URLs located at /etc/yum.repos.d/ambari.repo on all hosts (including server host).
