note

Do not start the Ambari Metrics System service. Do not restart other
                                services. The HDP upgrade process will restart all the services. 
The updated Ambari Metrics Sink jars will be installed on all hosts.
                                During the upgrade process, after the restart, each service start
                                uses the latest sink implementations.
