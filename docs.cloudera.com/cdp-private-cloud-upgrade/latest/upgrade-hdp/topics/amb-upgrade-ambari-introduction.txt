Before you upgrade Ambari
You must be aware of the exact steps and understand the interdependencies and order
        of the steps so that you can adjust and account for any special configurations for your
        cluster before starting the Ambari upgrade process.
Upgrading Ambari is much like any other upgrade in HDP. The main difference here is that
            the underlying platform is running Cloudera Runtime bits for all services. This is
            important because it provides an upgrade path to using the latest bits of the underlying
            stack. These include upgrades to HDFS, Hive, Spark, Ranger, Oozie, HBase, and so on. 
Ambari and the HDP intermediate bits clusters being managed by Ambari can be upgraded
            independently. This section describes the process to upgrade Ambari. You are encouraged
            to read completely through this entire document before starting the upgrade process, so
            that you understand the interdependencies and order of the steps. It is recommended you
            validate these steps in a test environment to adjust and account for any special
            configurations for your cluster.

Preparing to Upgrade Ambari
Upgrade Ambari
The high-level process for upgrading Ambari is as follows:


noteAmbari 7.1.x.x is not intended to be a long-term solution, only a brief interim
                step to CDP Private Cloud Base.
importantIf you stay on HDP 7.1.x you will not be able to upgrade directly
                to HDP 7.1.y (where y > x). You must always first upgrade from HDP 7.1.x to CDP
                7.1.x and then upgrade to CDP-7.1.y.
