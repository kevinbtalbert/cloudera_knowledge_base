In-place upgrade overview
To plan your upgrade from Ambari managed HDP 2.6.5 to CDP Private Cloud Base, you must be aware of the two stages of in-place
    upgrade along with the pre-upgrade, upgrade, and post-upgrade tasks.
 This upgrade path consists of two stages:
Upgrade HDP 2.6.5 to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x using Ambari. 
Transition the management platform from Ambari to Cloudera Manager.
noteHDP 2.6.5 now supports one stage upgrade to the CDP Private
          Cloud Base cluster using the AM2CM 2.6.0.0 tool. However, this is a technical preview
          feature. If you would like to upgrade your HDP 2.6.5 cluster to a CDP Private Cloud Base
          cluster (7.1.8 and 7.1.7 SP2) using the AM2CM 2.6.0.0 tool, you must contact Cloudera
          Professional Services.note
The importance of security in a production environment cannot be understated. TLS and
            Kerberos form the baseline for secure operations of your CDP Runtime environment.
            Cloudera supports security services such as Ranger and Atlas only when
            they are run on clusters where Kerberos is enabled to authenticate users.
To upgrade to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x, you must first upgrade from Ambari
          2.6.2.x (source) to Ambari 7.1.x.x (target) and then upgrade from HDP
          2.6.5 to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x. 
Upgrading and transitioning to CDP Private Cloud Base overview: 




noteIf you are upgrading to Cloudera Manager 7.5.1 or higher in order to install CDP Private
        Cloud Experiences version 1.3.1, you must use Cloudera Runtime version 7.1.6 or 7.1.7. For
        more information, see CDP Private Cloud Experiences.


noteIf you want to upgrade CDP Private Cloud Data Services, you must upgrade using the
          following path: 
Upgrade to Cloudera Manager 7.6.7.
Upgrade the Base cluster to 7.1.7 SP2.
Upgrade CDP Private Cloud Data Services to 1.5.0.



important

While the upgrade process will temporarily install HDP intermediate bits, the HDP
                intermediate bits is an interim artifact that enables you to complete the
              upgrade to CDP Private Cloud Base and is not a new release of
              HDP intended for production use. When the upgrade process is complete, your cluster
              will be using the Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x parcel.
If you stay on HDP 7.1.x you will not be able to upgrade directly to CDP-7.1.y
              (where y > x). You must always first upgrade from HDP 7.1.x to CDP 7.1.x and then
              upgrade to CDP-7.1.y.

                Manager, and Runtime for each upgrade path:

          Manager 7.x.x using the AM2CM tool. It includes the following steps:

HDP cluster blueprint is exported from Ambari and converted to a Cloudera
              Manager deployment template using the AM2CM tool.
Deploy the template to Cloudera Manager 7.x.x and activate the Cloudera
              Runtime 7.1.x parcels. 
Start using the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster with Cloudera Manager
              7.x.x.
Uninstall Ambari and the HDP stack
