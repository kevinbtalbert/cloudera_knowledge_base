Upgrade process
Read through the complete information about the upgrade options, prerequisites, and
        the overall process before starting the upgrade. Cloudera recommends that you validate these
        steps in a test environment to adjust and account for any special configurations for your
        cluster.
The high-level process for performing an HDP intermediate bits upgrade is as
            follows:



 Ambari will guide you through the steps required to upgrade the HDP intermediate bits. Make
            sure Ambari and the cluster are healthy, operating normally, and all service checks are
            passing. noteBe sure to review the available HDP intermediate bits upgrade scenarios
                below. Cloudera recommends that you first upgrade to Ambari 7.1.x.x before upgrading
                to the HDP intermediate bits unless otherwise noted. After upgrading Ambari, ensure
                that the cluster is operating normally and service checks are passing prior to
                attempting an HDP upgrade.Ambari 7.1.x.x supports only the express method for
            upgrading HDP 2.6.5.x to HDP intermediate bits. An Express Upgrade orchestrates the HDP
            upgrade in an order that will incur cluster downtime.
note

 Suspend all the Oozie workflows and cron jobs beforeÂ upgrading.
 Stop all the applications that access the HDP Services.
 Anything that interfaces your cluster or access data must be completely stopped
                    on your HDP 2.6.x cluster.
