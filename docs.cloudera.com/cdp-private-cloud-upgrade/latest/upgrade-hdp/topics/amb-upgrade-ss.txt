Upgrading SmartSense
Make sure you stop SmartSense and Ambari Metrics. Then you must upgrade the HST
        binaries, upgrade Ambari service and Ambari view, upgrade the HST Gateway if installed, and
        then restart the Ambari server.


Confirm that SmartSense and Ambari Metrics are stopped and in Maintenance
                    Mode.


If SmartSense is not stopped, from Ambari Web browse to Services > SmartSense and select Stop from the Service Actions menu.
If Ambari Metrics is not in Maintenance Mode, From Ambari Web browse to Services > Ambari Metrics and select Turn On Maintenance Mode from the Service Actions menu.



Upgrade binaries on the HST server and all HST agents on every node in the cluster, assuming that the Ambari repository is configured on all nodes in the cluster:
RHEL or CentOS:
                    
yum clean all
yum info smartsense-hst
In the info output, visually validate that there is an available version containing "1.5.x‚Äù: yum upgrade smartsense-hst

Ubuntu 18:
                    
apt-get clean all
apt-get update
apt-cache show smartsense-hst | grep Version
In the info output, visually validate that there is an available version containing "1.5.x":apt-get install smartsense-hst 

Upgrade Ambari service and Ambari view by running the hst
                        upgrade-ambari-service command as the root user from the machine
                    running the Ambari server. You can run the command in the interactive or
                    non-interactive mode:
Interactive mode example: # hst upgrade-ambari-service
                    Please enter Ambari Server hostname (ambari-server.hortonworks.local):
                    Please enter Ambari Server port (8080):
                    Please enter Ambari admin user id (admin):
                    Please enter password for admin:

                        restart ambari using ambari-server restart

Restart the Ambari server: # ambari-server restart

If you have HST Gateway installed, you need to also upgrade your HST Gateway:

If the HST Gateway is installed on the same node as HST Server or HST Agent,
                            then the HST Gateway will gets upgraded along with them.
If the HST Gateway is a standalone node outside of the cluster, perform upgrade
                            steps described in Upgrading SmartSense
                                Gateway.

importantIt is very important to make sure you do not start the
                        SmartSense service. It will start automatically during the HDP upgrade
                        process.
