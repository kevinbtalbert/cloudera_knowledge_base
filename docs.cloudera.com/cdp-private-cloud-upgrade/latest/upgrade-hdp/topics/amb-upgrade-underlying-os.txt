Upgrading the cluster’s underlying OS
Ensure that all your hosts in the cluster are on the operating systems supported with
        the HDP intermediate bits and Ambari 7.1.x.x before starting the upgrade from HDP 2.6.5.x to
        HDP intermediate bits.
Only RHEL, CentOS, and Ubuntu operating systems are supported with the HDP intermediate
            bits and Ambari 7.1.x.x. Ensure that all your hosts in the cluster are on the supported
            operating system before starting the upgrade from HDP 2.6.5.x to HDP intermediate bits.
            For more information on the supported versions of Operating systems, see Operating system requirements. noteSLES 12

In-Place and Restore:
Perform an In-place OS refresh and use Ambari Restore Host feature
Move and Decom:
Move Masters and Decom/Recom Workers
Each option has advantages and disadvantages and high-level decision criteria.
