        blueprint of your old cluster is used as the template of the new cluster after you
        transition to Cloudera Manager.




To download the cluster blueprints without hosts, do the following: 

curl ${securecurl} -H "X-Requested-By: ambari" -X GET -u ${ambariuser}:${ambaripwd} ${ambariprotocol}://${ambariserver}:${ambariport}/api/v1/clusters/${clustername}?format=blueprint > "${backupdir}"/${clustername}_blueprint_without_hosts_"$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S")".json
