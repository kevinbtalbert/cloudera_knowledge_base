YARN owner permission
You must change the owner of the Yarn user. If you want to add a VPC or Compute
        cluster after migration, you must make changes for /user/yarn in
        HDFS.

SSH to a cluster node

You must have Sudo permission to perform this.

Change the owner of /user/yarn to
                        hdfs:supergroup
yarn:hadoop with the command: sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs
                        -chown hdfs:supergroup /user/yarn

Change the permissions of /user/yarn to
                        drwxr-xr-x with the command: sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs
                        -chmod 755 /user/yarn
