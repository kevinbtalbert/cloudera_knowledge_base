Reset ZNode ACLs
If you have a kerberized cluster, you manually have to reset the ZNode ACLs after
        upgrading from HDP to CDP.
ZNode ACLs have to be reset only for kerberized cluster.
            If you have a non-kerberized cluster, skip this post-upgrade task.note
If the cluster is heavily used and the
                        yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications is kept
                    high (10k-100k) resetting ACLs on YARN ZooKeeper nodes can take a large amount
                    of time to finish.


Log into Cloudera Manager UI.

Select the YARN service.

Click Actions.

Select the Reset ACLs on YARN Zookeeper nodes
                    action.
