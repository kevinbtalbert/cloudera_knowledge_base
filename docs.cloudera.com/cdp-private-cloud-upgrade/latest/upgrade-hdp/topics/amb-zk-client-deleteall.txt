Delete ZNODES
Remove the ZNode for HDFS, YARN, Hive, HBase, and Oozie
If the cluster is configured for Namenode HA, the Failover controllers cannot
            determine the Active Namenode after the migration. This is because the naming
            conventions used to identify Namenodes for the HA service are different for Ambari and
            Cloudera Manager. You must format the ZooKeeper ZNode for the Failover controller to
            continue further.If the cluster is configured for Yarn HA, the Resource Managers
                cannot elect an Active Resource Manager after the migration. You must clear the
                previous Znode from ZooKeeper so that YARN replaces it.If the cluster is
                configured for Ranger KMS, you must delete the Ranger KMS Znode with superuser
                privileges. When you restart Ranger KMS, the znode gets created with correct
                privileges. You must format the
                ZooKeeper Znode for the failover controller to continue further.

Start ZooKeeper client CLI session from a master node. (Assuming that the
                        skipACL is set to Yes to avoid
                    authentication issues). zookeeper-client -server
                        <zk_hostname>
