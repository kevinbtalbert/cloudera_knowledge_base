Backup Infra Solr collections
Backup the Infra solr collections from the Ambari managed Infra Solr service and
    restore them on the Infra Solr service managed by Cloudera Manager. When you are creating a
    backup of the Infra solr data, ensure that only Infra Solr and Zookeeper services are started
    and other services are stopped. Similarly, when you are restoring the data on Infra Solr managed
    by Cloudera Manager, you must start HDFS and Zookeeper only. This ensures no operations are
    performed by services which can push data to Infra Solr. 
To create a backup of the Infra solr collections from Infra
      Solr service, perform the following steps:

The assumption is /opt/solrdata is the work directory which must
          pre-exist on both local file system and HDFS.

noteIf the Solr cloud is a multi node, then /opt/solrdata  should
            be a common mount accessible from all the Solr server hosts.


mkdir -p /opt/solrdata/
kinit -kt hdfs.keytab hdfs; hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /opt/solrdata


Set the path for the ini configuration file.

CONFIG_INI_LOCATION=/opt/solrdata/ambari_solr_migration.ini


For the backup of data from Infra Solr to HDFS:


Generate the ini configuration file which is used by the migration helper.

/usr/bin/python /usr/lib/ambari-infra-solr-client/migrationConfigGenerator.py --ini-file $CONFIG_INI_LOCATION --host <Ambari Server Host> --port <Ambari Server Port> --cluster <Cluster-Name> --username <Ambari admin username> --password <Ambari admin password> --backup-base-path=/opt/solrdata --hdfs-base-path=/opt/solrdata --java-home <JAVA JDK HOME which is also used by Ambari > -s < use -s if TLS is enabled for Ambari>



Backup collections:

/usr/lib/ambari-infra-solr-client/migrationHelper.py --ini-file $CONFIG_INI_LOCATION --action backup



Copy the backup to HDFS:

/usr/lib/ambari-infra-solr-client/migrationHelper.py --ini-file $CONFIG_INI_LOCATION --action copy-to-hdfs

You can now use the AM2CM tool to migrate from the Ambari-managed HDP
              cluster to the Cloudera Manager-managed CDP cluster.
