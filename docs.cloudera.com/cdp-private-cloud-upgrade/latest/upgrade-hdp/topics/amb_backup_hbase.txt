Backup HBase
The rollback procedure rolls back HDFS and, the data in HBase is also rolled back
        automatically as part of this procedure. In addition, HBase metadata stored in ZooKeeper is
        recovered as part of the ZooKeeper rollback procedure.

If your cluster is configured to use HBase replication, Cloudera recommends that you
                document all replication peers. If necessary (for example, because the HBase znode
                has been deleted), you can roll back HBase as part of the HDFS rollback without the
                ZooKeeper metadata. This metadata can be reconstructed in a fresh ZooKeeper
                installation, with the exception of the replication peers, which you must add back.
            


Stop HBase before backing up HDFS.
