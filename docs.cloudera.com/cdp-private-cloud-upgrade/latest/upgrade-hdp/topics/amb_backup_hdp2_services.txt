Backup HDP Cluster
Cloudera recommends that you back up the HDP 2.6.5.x services managed by Ambari
        2.6.x.x. 

note These backups are required and helps you incase in the middle of the upgrade to
                HDP 7.1.x you decide to downgrade the cluster back to original state.


Backup and Restore DatabasesThe steps for backing up and restoring databases differ depending on the database         vendor and version that you select for your cluster. It is beyond the scope of this         document. Backup Ranger You must stop the Ranger Admin and Ranger KMS Service and its dependent         services.Backup Atlas You can back up Atlas data by backing-up HBase tables. Backup Ambari Infra SolrBack up all your ambari infra solr collections. Run the Solr APIs to backup the         collections individually. You must create the backup directory on each Ambari Infra Solr         node. However, the backup command takes the backup of shards only on the nodes where they         reside.Backup HiveTo backup the Hive service, you must backup the Hive database and create a snapshot         of the Hive warehouse. Backup HBaseThe rollback procedure rolls back HDFS and, the data in HBase is also rolled back         automatically as part of this procedure. In addition, HBase metadata stored in ZooKeeper is         recovered as part of the ZooKeeper rollback procedure.Backup KafkaBefore you begin the upgrade process, you need to explicitly set the Kafka protocol         version to match what's being used currently among the brokers and clients. Update         server.properties on all brokers as follows:Backup OozieTo backup the Oozie service,  you must backup the Oozie database. Backup KnoxWith the backup and rollback of Ambari, Knox is also backed up and rolled back by         default.Backup LogsearchWith the backup of Ambari-Infra, Logsearch is also backed up by default.Backup ZeppelinWith the backup and rollback of HDFS, Zeppelin is also backed up and rolled back by         default.Backup HDFSYou can roll back an upgrade from CDP Private Cloud Base 7 to HDP 2. The rollback         restores your HDP cluster to the state it was in before the upgrade. This means any change         that happened after taking the backups as instructed from points 4 to 7 will be reverted         from the HDFS cluster. You must perform additional steps before upgrading your HDP cluster         if you have configured the NameNode HA. Backup ZooKeeperYou must backup Zookeeper.Backup AmbariYou must backup Ambari.Parent topic: Upgrading HDP to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x
