Transitioning HDP cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base cluster using the AM2CM tool
 Use AM2CM tool to transition from Ambari-managed cluster to Cloudera Manager-managed
        cluster. 
The purpose of this tool is to convert the Ambari blueprint to Cloudera Manager
            Deployment template. Download and export the Ambari blueprint to the AM2CM tool. The
            AM2CM tool converts the Ambari blueprint to Cloudera Manager Deployment template. Import
            the converted template to Cloudera Manager, start the services through the Cloudera
            Manager UI, and validate the cluster. note Before you use the AM2CM tool, you must
                understand the HDP cluster configuration to resolve any edge-case issues that may
                occur during migration.
