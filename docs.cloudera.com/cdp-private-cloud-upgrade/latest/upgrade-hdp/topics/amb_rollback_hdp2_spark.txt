Know more about the Spark roll back. 

The Spark application history lives in HDFS, and with the rollback of HDFS, the
                history at the time of the backup is restored. Any Spark applications run after the
                backup and rollback will not be visible.
After the rollback, versions of Spark applications built against HDP 2 should be
                used instead of versions that are rebuilt against CDP.
