Additional configuration tasks
You can increase or decrease the time for which the audit and event logs are retained in
  the system, after which they are auto-purged. You can also make DAS work with HiveServer2 in case
  your Hive deployment is not LLAP-enabled and does not have Hive Server Interactive.
Making DAS work with HiveServer2
If your Hive deployment is not LLAP-enabled and does not have Hive Server Interactive, you
    need to update the configuration for DAS to work with HiveServer2 as follows:
Go to Ambari > Data Analytics Studio > Configs and change use.hive.interactive.mode=true to
     use.hive.interactive.mode=false

Customizing the retention period of audit and event logs
Audit  and event logs are written by Hive/Tez to HDFS for DAS to consume to generate DAG
    information. Once DAS consumes them, this information on HDFS is no longer required. They are
    cleaned automatically via a thread in HMS (Hive metastore).
The time to live count of the audit logs is defined in the
     hive.hook.proto.events.ttl parameter. By default, the logs are retained for
    seven days. To configure a custom value:


From the Ambari UI, go to Hive > HiveMetaStore > Configs and specify the time to live in the hive.hook.proto.events.ttl
      parameter.
For example, to retain the logs for 30 days, specify 30d.
Typically, a 30-day duration is useful if you want to download older DAG data.

Restart the Hive service.
