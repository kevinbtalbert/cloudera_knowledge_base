You cannot view queries from other users

If you need to view queries and data of other users, then assign admin role to the user by
   going to Ambari > Data Analytics Studio > Config > Advanced data_analytics_studio-security-site, and specifying the user in the admin_users field. For
   example, hive,admin1,admin2.
You can also specify * (asterisk) in the admin_users
   field to make all users administrators.
You can also specify an admin group in the admin_groups field.
