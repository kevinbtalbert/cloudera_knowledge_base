Set up trusted CA certificate
You can enable SSL for the DAS Engine using a certificate from a trusted Certificate
        Authority (CA). Certificates from a trusted CA are primarily used in production
        environments. For a test environment, you can use a self-signed certificate.


You must have root user access to the clusters on which DAS Engine is
                    installed.
You must have obtained a certificate from your CA, following their instructions.
                



Log in as root user on the cluster with DAS Engine installed.

Import the Certificate Chain Certificate and the certificate you obtained from
                    your CA.

keytool -import -alias root -keystore <path_to_keystore_file> -trustcacerts -file <certificate_chain_certificate>
keytool -import -alias jetty -keystore <path_to_keystore_file> -file <certificate_from_CA>


noteIgnore the following warning:
The JKS keystore uses a proprietary format. It is recommended to migrate to PKCS12 which is an industry standard format using "keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <keystore_file_path> -destkeystore <keystore_file_path> -deststoretype pkcs12".
