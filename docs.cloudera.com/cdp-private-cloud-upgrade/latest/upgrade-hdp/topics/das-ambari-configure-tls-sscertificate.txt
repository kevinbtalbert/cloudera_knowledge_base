Set up self-signed certificates
You can enable SSL for the DAS Engine using a self-signed certificate. Self-signed
        certificates are primarily used in test environments. For a production environment, you
        should use a certificate from a trusted CA.
You must have root user access to the clusters on which DAS
            Engine is installed.

Log in as root user on the cluster with DAS Engine installed.

Generate a key pair and keystore for use with DAS Engine.

keytool -genkey -alias jetty -keystore <certificate_file_path> -storepass <keystore_password> -dname 'CN=das.host.com, OU=Eng, O=ABC Corp, L=Santa Clara, ST=CA, C=US' -keypass <key_password> -keyalg RSA


noteIgnore the following warning:
The JKS keystore uses a proprietary format. It is recommended to migrate to PKCS12 which is an industry standard format using "keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <keystore_file_path> -destkeystore <keystore_file_path> -deststoretype pkcs12".


Follow the prompts and enter the required information. 
CN must be the FQDN of the DAS Engine host.
Default value for the key password is password.If you
                                change the password, then you have to update the DAS
                                configuration.
Following is a sample command
                    output:keytool -genkey -alias jetty -keystore ~/tmp/ks -storepass password
