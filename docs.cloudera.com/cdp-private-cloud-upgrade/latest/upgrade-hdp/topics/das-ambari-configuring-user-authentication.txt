Configuring user authentication in Ambari
You can
    authenticate the users by using either Knox SSO, Knox proxy, or SPNEGO. You can also choose not
    to set up user authentication. In this case, all the queries are executed as a Hive service
    user.
Configuring user authentication using Knox SSOIn a  CDP Private Cloud Base deployment, to enable DAS to work with the CDP cluster SSO,         configure the Knox settings as described in this topic.Configuring user authentication using Knox proxyIn the CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.x release, Knox Proxy is configured via the Knox Admin UI.         To set up proxy, you first define the provider configurations and descriptors, and the         topologies are automatically generated based on those settings.Configuring user authentication using SPNEGOSPNEGO uses a Kerberized environment for user authentication. To use SPNEGO to         authenticate users, specify SPNEGO in the user_authentication field. Enabling logout option for secure clustersTo sign out from the application (DAS Webapp) and the identity provider on secure         clusters, you need to create a KnoxSSO out topology in the Ambari console and configure the         knox_ssout_url through the Ambari UI.Parent topic: DAS post-installation tasks
