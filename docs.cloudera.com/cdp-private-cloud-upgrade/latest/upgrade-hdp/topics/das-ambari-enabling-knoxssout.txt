Enabling logout option for secure clustersCloudera Docs
Enabling logout option for secure clusters
To sign out from the application (DAS Webapp) and the identity provider on secure
        clusters, you need to create a KnoxSSO out topology in the Ambari console and configure the
        knox_ssout_url through the Ambari UI.

This section can be used to configure the Knox SSO logout URL for both HA and non-HA
                clusters.


SSH in to the Ambari console on which you have configured Knox as a root
                    user.

If you are configuring KnoxSSOUT for the first time, then you need to create a
                    KnoxSSO out topology called knoxssout.xml in the
                        /etc/knox/x.x.x.x-xx/0/topologies directory.
If you have already configured KnoxSSOUT, then you can skip this step.
Add the following lines in the knoxssout.xml
                    file:<?xml version="1.0"?>
<topology>
  <gateway>
    <provider>
      <role>hostmap</role>
      <name>static</name>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </provider>
  </gateway>
  <service>
    <role>KNOXSSOUT</role>
  </service>
</topology>


noteIf you have configured Knox SSO for HA clusters, then you must create the
                        KnoxSSO out topology on all the Knox hosts.


On the Ambari UI, go to Data Analytics Studio > Config > Advanced data_analytics_studio-security-site and specify the Knox SSO logout URL in the
                        knox_ssout_url field in the following format:

https://{host}:{port}/{cluster-name}/{knox-sso-out-topo}/api/v1/webssout

Where, knox-sso-out-topo is the name of the KnoxSSO out
                    topology xml file that you created earlier. In this case, it is
                        knoxssout.The host and the port that you
                        specify here should be the same as those specified in the
                            knox_sso_url field. To obtain the cluster_name, on the
                        Ambari UI, click admin > Manage Ambari > Cluster Information and note the value from the Cluster
                            Name field.If you have HA clusters, then
                        specify the host and the port of the load balancer pointing to the Knox
                        instance.

Click Save and click through the confirmation
                    pop-ups.

Restart DAS and any services that require restart by clicking Actions >  Restart All Required.
