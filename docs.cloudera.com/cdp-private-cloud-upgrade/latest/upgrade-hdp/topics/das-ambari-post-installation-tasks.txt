DAS post-installation tasks
After adding the DAS service on the CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.x cluster, complete the tasks in
                this section to start using DAS.
Additional configuration tasksYou can increase or decrease the time for which the audit and event logs are retained in   the system, after which they are auto-purged. You can also make DAS work with HiveServer2 in case   your Hive deployment is not LLAP-enabled and does not have Hive Server Interactive.Setting up the tmp directoryDAS allows you to download logs for secure clusters. To download logs, make sure that   the DAS service user has write permission to the /tmp directory. Also make sure   that the /tmp directory has sufficient storage space to hold logs from a query   for the download logs feature to work.Configuring DAS for SSL/TLSIf your HDP cluster is SSL enabled, then you can configure SSL. This is an optional         configuration.Configuring user authentication in AmbariYou can     authenticate the users by using either Knox SSO, Knox proxy, or SPNEGO. You can also choose not     to set up user authentication. In this case, all the queries are executed as a Hive service     user.Parent topic: Installing Data Analytics Studio on a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster using Ambari
