Setting up quick links for the DAS UI
To use the DAS UI quick link from Ambari in case of Knox proxy clusters, you (the
        admin user) need to paste the following quicklink.json file in the Ambari
        server machine.

Create the quicklink.json file as per the following
                    template:

{
  "name": "default",
  "description": "default quick links configuration",
  "configuration": {
    "protocol":
    {
      "type": "HTTPS_ONLY"
    },
    "links": [
      {
        "name": "data_analytics_studio_ui",
        "label": "Data Analytics Studio UI",
        "requires_user_name": "false",
        "component_name": "KNOX_GATEWAY",
        "url": "%@://%@:%@/gateway/<das_ui_topology_name>/das/",
        "port": {
          "https_property": "gateway.port",
          "https_default_port": "8443",
          "regex": "^(\\d+)$",
          "site": "gateway-site"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

Replace the das_ui_topology_name with the actual DAS UI
                    topology.

Change to the following directory:
/var/lib/ambari-server/resources/mpacks/data-analytics-studio-mpack-<VERSION>/hdp-addon-services/DATA_ANALYTICS_STUDIO/<VERSION>/quicklinks/
Replace the <VERSION> with the version of the DAS
                    distribution that you have installed.

Replace the existing quicklink.json file with the file that
                    you created in step 1.
Verify that you have correctly replaced the quicklink.json
                    file.

Restart Ambari by using the following command:

ambari-server restart
