Configuring user authentication using Knox SSO
In a  CDP Private Cloud Base deployment, to enable DAS to work with the CDP cluster SSO,
        configure the Knox settings as described in this topic.

noteFollow these instructions only if you choose to configure secure clusters.


You need to export the Knox certificate from the Knox gateway host. To find the Knox
                gateway host, go to Ambari > Services > Knox > CONFIGS > Knox Gateway hosts.


SSH in to the Knox gateway host with a root or a
                        knoxuser user.

Export the Knox certificate by running the following command:

/usr/hdp/current/knox-server/bin/knoxcli.sh export-cert --type PEM


noteIf you have already integrated Knox SSO earlier, then the
                            gateway-identity.pem file would exist. Check whether
                        the gateway-identity.pem file exists or not before running
                        this command.


/usr/hdp/current/knox-server/data/security/keystores/gateway-identity.pem

If the export is successfully, the following message is displayed:

Certificate gateway-identity has been successfully exported to: /usr/hdp/current/knox-server/data/security/keystores/gateway-identity.pem

Note the location where you save the gateway-identity.pem
                    file.

If not done already, specify KNOX_SSO in the
                        user_authentication field under Ambari > Data Analytics Studio > Config.

Enable the Knox SSO topology settings. From the Ambari UI, go to Data Analytics Studio > Config > Advanced data_analytics_studio-security-site and make the following configuration changes:


Specify KNOX_SSO in the
                                user_authentication field.


Specify the Knox SSO URL in the knox_sso_url
                            field in the following format:
https:knox-host>:8443/gateway/knoxsso/api/v1/websso


Copy the contents of the PEM file that you exported earlier in the
                                knox_publickey field without the header and
                            the footer.


Add the list of users in the admin_users field
                            who need admin access to DAS.
You can specify * (asterisk) in the
                                admin_users field to make all users the admin
                            users.
You can also specify an admin group in the
                                admin_groups field.

note Only admin users have access to all the queries. Non-admin users
                                can access only their queries.



Click Save and click through the confirmation
                            pop-ups. 


Restart DAS and any services that require restart by clicking Actions > Restart All Required.
