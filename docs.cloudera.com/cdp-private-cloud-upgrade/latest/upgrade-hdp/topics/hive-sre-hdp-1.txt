Modifying the HSMM to prevent migration
By default, the Hive Strict Managed Migration process (HSMM) runs across all tables
        and databases. But, you want to prevent HSMM from migrating tables and databases. To change
        the default, you must directly modify the Ambari-DC Hive Upgrade Process. 
 You upgraded to Ambari-DC, but have not yet performed the HDP upgrade of the
            platform stack from Hive 1 to Hive 3. 
 Perform this procedure if you want to expedite the upgrade process. 

Open the following script on the Ambari Server host for editing:
                    /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/stacks/HDP/3.0/services/HIVE/package/scripts/post_upgrade.py

Make the changes as shown in the following example:

FROM
cmd = format("{hive_script} --config /etc/hive/conf --service  strictmanagedmigration --hiveconf hive.strict.managed.tables=true  -m automatic
--modifyManagedTables --oldWarehouseRoot /apps/hive/warehouse")
TO
cmd = format("{hive_script} --config /etc/hive/conf --service  strictmanagedmigration --hiveconf hive.strict.managed.tables=true  -m automatic
--modifyManagedTables --oldWarehouseRoot /apps/hive/warehouse --tableRegex zzzzz") 


Restart the Ambari Server and agents after this change but before starting the upgrade
                   process.
importantAfter upgrading to CDP, you must run the Hive Upgrade Check tool and do any
                        suggested clean up on the Hive metastore, and then migrate the corrected
                        tables to CDP.
