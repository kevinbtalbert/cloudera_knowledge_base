Validate transitioned Solr configuration
The solr-upgrade.sh script includes a
            validate-metadata command that you can run against the migrated Solr
        configuration and metadata to make sure that they can be used to reinitialize the Solr
        service after the CDH cluster
        upgrade.
        

The script performs a series of checks to make sure that:

Required configuration files (such as solr.xml,
                        clusterstate.json, and collection configuration sets) are
                    present.
The configuration files are compatible with the Solr version being upgraded to
                    (Solr 8, in this case).




Validate the configuration by running the following script:
/opt/cloudera/cm/solr-upgrade/solr-upgrade.sh \
validate-metadata -c [***SOLR/METADATA/OUTPUT/DIRECTORY***]Replace
                        [***SOLR/METADATA/OUTPUT/DIRECTORY***] with the path to
                    the directory containing the migrated Solr configuration.If you have enabled
                        Kerberos, specify your JAAS configuration file by adding --jaas
                                [***PATH/TO/SOR/JAAS.CONF***] to the
                        command.
For example:
                    /opt/cloudera/cm/solr-upgrade/solr-upgrade.sh validate-metadata \
-c $HOME/cr7-migrated-solr-config

If the validation is successful, the script outputs a
                message similar to the
            following:Validation successful for metadata in /home/solruser/[***SOLR/METADATA/OUTPUT/DIRECTORY***]For
            example, Validation successful for metadata in 
/home/solruser/cr7-migrated-solr-configIf the validation fails, you can
                revisit the steps in Transition the configuration.
