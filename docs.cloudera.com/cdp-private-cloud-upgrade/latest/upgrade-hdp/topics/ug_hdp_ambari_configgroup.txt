Capture Information about Multiple HiveServers
If you have multiple HiveServer (HS2) pods that either fence business units from each
        other or offer doas impersonation types to aid a transition, you must configure
        Cloudera Manager accordingly after the upgrade. You need to note the configuration
        information from Ambari to use for this configuration task after the upgrade. 

Make a note of the Ambari Config Group settings for each HS2 group, including
                    the edge nodes and connected endpoints. 

Also, make a note of the Config Groups you use for other purposes, if there are
                    any.
