Save Hive Metastore by Dumping
You must dump the Hive metastore metadata immediately before upgrading. Dumping the
        metastore data to a file is critical to prevent data loss. 

On the node where the database you use for Hive Metastore resides, dump Hive
                    Metastore metadata before upgrading to HDP. 
For example, in MySQL, dump each database as
                    follows:mysqldump <hive_db_schema_name> > </path/to/dump_file>
                In Postgres, dump each database as follows:
                    pg_dump --opt <metastore_db_name> > /path/to/dump_file


Proceed to upgrade HDP, assuming no Hive update, delete, or merge occurred
                    after compaction; otherwise, repeat the compaction and Hive Metastore dump
                    procedures, and then upgrade HDP.
