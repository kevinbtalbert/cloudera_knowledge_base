Checking and correcting Hive table locations

        As a Data Engineer, you need to understand the relocation of files after the upgrade process. The file
        type and other factors affect the relocation during the upgrade.
    

The upgrade process changes table types in some cases. The following table compares
                Hive table types and ACID operations before and after upgrading. The ownership of
                the Hive table file is a factor in determining table types and ACID operations after
                the upgrade.

If you had external files before the upgrade, the upgrade process carries the
                external files over to CDP after upgrading with no change in location. The external
                files continue to reside in the /apps/hive/warehouse directory.
Managed, ACID tables that are not owned by the hive user remain managed tables after
                the upgrade, but hive becomes the owner.
After the upgrade, the location of managed tables or partitions do not change
                under any one of the following conditions:


The old table or partition directory was not in its default
                        location /apps/hive/warehouse before the upgrade.


The old table or partition directory is in a different encryption
                        zone than the new warehouse directory.

 The /apps/hive/warehouse directory, which is the location of
            the Hive 2.x warehouse before upgrading, might or might not exist after upgrading. 

Check the /apps/hive/warehouse directory for files that do not belong
                    there after upgrading.

Files that do not belong in /apps/hive/warehouse are
                        files tdescribed in the table above as managed files after upgrading. The
                        upgrade process should have moved the managed files to the new
                            /warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive/warehouse
                        directory.


Check that the upgrade process moved managed files to /warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive.

Check that Hive places any new external tables you create after upgrading in
                        /warehouse/tablespace/external/hive.
