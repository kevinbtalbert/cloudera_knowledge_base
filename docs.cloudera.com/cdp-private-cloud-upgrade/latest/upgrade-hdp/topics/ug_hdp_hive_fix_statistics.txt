Fixing statistics
Upgrading or migrating from Hive 1 or Hive 2 to Hive 3 might result in missing
        statistics. In Hive 3, these missing statistics, when detected by the cost-based optimizer
        (CBO), could cause datasets to be disregarded. As Data Engineer, you need to fix these
        statistics after upgrading.

Run DESCRIBE FORMATTED <table>, and check the value of
                        numrows. 
If the value is 0, you must fix statistics.

Run ANALYZE on the tables and columns to fix the statistics.
ANALYZE TABLE credit_card_01.cc_acct COMPUTE STATISTICS[FOR COLUMNS];
