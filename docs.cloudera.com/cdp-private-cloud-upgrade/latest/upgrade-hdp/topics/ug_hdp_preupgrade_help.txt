Hive Pre-Upgrade Tool Command Help
The pre-upgrade tool command supports a few options that you can consider using while
    running it. Take a look at the output of the help command to see all the options.
-d <database regex>
Regular expressions to define databases. Limits the scope of the tool.
        
      

-execute
Do not use this option unless you want to run the pre-upgrade tool command in Ambari
        instead of on the Beeline command line. Using Beeline instead of this option is strongly
        recommended. This option automatically executes the equivalent of the generated
        commands.

-location <path>
Use this option to specify the location to write the scripts generated by the
        pre-upgrade tool.

-t <table regex>
Regular expressions to define tables. Limits the scope of the tool.

-tn
Number of the thread pool. 
If there is a large number of tables that need to be compacted, run the tool in a parallel
        mode with the -tn option. This controls the number of threads used to scan tables.

--help
You can append --help to the command to see all command options. For
        example:
java -Djavax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly=false -cp /usr/hdp/$STACK_VERSION/hive/lib/derby-10.10.2.0.jar:/usr/hdp/$STACK_VERSION/hive/lib/*:/usr/hdp/$STACK_VERSION/hadoop/*:/usr/hdp/$STACK_VERSION/hadoop/lib/*:/usr/hdp/$STACK_VERSION/hadoop-mapreduce/*:/usr/hdp/$STACK_VERSION/hadoop-mapreduce/lib/*:/usr/hdp/$STACK_VERSION/hadoop-hdfs/*:/usr/hdp/$STACK_VERSION/hadoop-hdfs/lib/*:/usr/hdp/$STACK_VERSION/hadoop/etc/hadoop/*:/tmp/hive-pre-upgrade-3.1.0.3.1.0.258-3.jar:/usr/hdp/$STACK_VERSION/hive/conf/conf.server:/etc/hadoop/conf/:/etc/hive/conf/ org.apache.hadoop.hive.upgrade.acid.PreUpgradeTool --help
