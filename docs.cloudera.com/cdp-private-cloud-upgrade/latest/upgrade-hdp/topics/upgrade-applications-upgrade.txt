Applications Upgrade
After you upgrade, you must test all the services that run on your platform. 


Ideally, you should have an indicative subset of jobs from your workloads. These
            are the tasks that you should have identified and run before the upgrade allowing you to
            compare pre-upgrade versus post-upgrade test results. These tests should also include
            any parts of the application that required code changes due to the changes in the
            platform. For example, to cater for changes in Hive managed versus external tables. The
            tests should also include a performance test. This can help to highlight missed or wrong
            configuration settings or point to other issues with the upgrade. Depending on your
            environment, perform these steps.


Update application code with changes required by the upgraded platform 
Update the dependencies in the pom.xml file for
          custom jar files used in your applications to use the new dependencies
          for CDP.
Restart applications 
Test the applications and verify they are functioning and performing as they were
                    prior to upgrade


noteAfter successfully upgrading from HDP to CDP, you can remove the HDP bits from the CDP
            cluster using the yum commands. Otherwise, when you run any security tool or security
            scanner for CVE detection, the HDP bits on the CDP cluster are detected as CVEs.
