Automated rollback
Automated rollback in CMA 2.4.0 is a tech preview with full functionality. Cloudera
        does not recommend you to use the automated rollback procedure on production clusters. 

Go to the am2cm-ansible folder:

If you have used docker to upgrade, create a bash session inside the
                            container and go to the am2cm-ansible folder: docker container
                                exec -it <container_id> /bin/bashcd
                                am2cm-ansible/



If you have used local installation to upgrade, activate the python
                            virtual environment and go to the am2cm-ansible folder: source
                                <path/to/am2cm-2.x.y.0-bb>/venv/bin/activate
                                cd <path/to/am2cm-2.x.y.0-bb>/am2cm-ansible/
                            



Execute the rollback playbooks: Running the rollback playbooks require you to
                    specify an inventory and extra-vars file. You can review the previous upgrade
                    steps to identify the files specific to your environment.


Rollback Cloudera Manager to Ambari and restore
                                /etc configuration directories
                                ansible-playbook -i <path/to/the/inventory.ini>
                                playbooks/rollback/site.yml --extra-vars
                                "@<path/to/the/vars.json>" --tags
                                ambari-rollback,etc-config-rollback


Rollback Kerberos ansible-playbook -i
                                <path/to/the/inventory.ini> playbooks/rollback/site.yml
                                --extra-vars "@<path/to/the/vars.json>" --tags
                                kerberos-rollback


Rollback HDP Services:

Run the following command for all HDP services installed in the
                                cluster in ansible-playbook -i
                                    <path/to/the/inventory.ini> playbooks/rollback/site.yml
                                    --extra-vars "@<path/to/the/vars.json>" --tags
                                    <service-rollback-tag>
The <service-rollback-tag> defaults to
                                    <service>-rollback, where
                                    <service> is replaced by the name of
                                the HDP service to be rolled back.
For Ambari Infra Solr, the
                                    <service-rollback-tag> tag must be
                                infra-solr-rollback.
You can skip some of the services that your cluster may not require.
                                However, some services are dependent on each other. Cloudera
                                recommends you to rollback in the order listed below. 
zookeeper-rollback 
infra-solr-rollback 
ranger-rollback 
ranger-kms-backup 
hdfs-rollback 
yarn-rollback 
Kafka-rollback 
Kafka-rollback 
hbase-rollback 
atlas-rollback 
hive-rollback 
oozie-rollback
