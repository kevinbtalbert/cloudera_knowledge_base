Backup HDP services 3.1.5 from CDP 7.1.x
 You must take a backup of HDP services before rolling back from CDP to
        HDP.
Automated Backup 
The CMA Server takes the backup of everything except Ambari as it is not affected by
                the upgrade process. To back up Ambari, see the Back Up Ambari documentation.

Manual Backup
In case you skipped the Automated backup steps in CMA, then you can manually perform
                the following steps:
            
Backing up HDP cluster
Backup /etc config symlinks for all HDP services on all
                        hosts by running the following command: cp -d
                            /etc/<service>/conf /etc/<service>/conf.hdp.bak
Backup /etc/krb5.conf by running the following command:
                            cp /etc/krb5.conf /etc/krb5.conf.bak
