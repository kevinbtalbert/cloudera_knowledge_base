Installing Cloudera Management Service 
 You can automate the installation of Cloudera Management Service through the command
        line or using the following steps. Installing Cloudera Management Service is part of
        step 2 in Cloudera Manager
            Installation and Setup.
Port Collisions
Ports from the installed Cloudera Manager roles can conflict with your source cluster
                service ports. You can change or stop the ports in conflict.
For example, if there are default service ports for HDP Services configured in step 8
                of Installing Cloudera Management Service,
                then you must stop the following services: 
SMARTSENSE
Druid
Zeppelin


Stopping the services through Ambari REST API: 
curl -X PUT -u admin:admin_pwd -H "X-Requested-By: ambari" -k
                    "https://your-ambari-server.com:8443/api/v1/clusters/cl1/services/SMARTSENSE" -d
                    "{\"RequestInfo\": {\"context\": \"Stopping Services that collide with Cloudera
                    Management Service Roles\"},\"Body\": {\"ServiceInfo\": {\"state\":
                    \"INSTALLED\"}}}"

Getting CM API version
If you want to use Cloudera Manager 7.7.1, you must use v49 in the
                following commands and replace host, user, name, and password.
curl http://admin:admin@your-cm-server.com:7180/api/[[**version**]
                

Creating the Cloudera Management Service (CMS)
 curl -X PUT -u admin:admin_pwd
                    "http://your-cm-server.com:7180/api/v49/cm/service" -H "Content-Type:
                    application/json" -d "{\"displayName\": \"Cloudera Management Service\"}"
                

Auto-assigning the roles 
curl -X PUT -u admin:admin_pwd
                    "http://your-cm-server.com:7180/api/v49/cm/service/autoAssignRoles" -H "accept:
                    application/json" 

Auto-configuring the CMS roles 
curl -X PUT -u admin:admin_pwd
                    "http://your-cm-server.com:7180/api/v49/cm/service/autoConfigure" -H "accept:
                    application/json"
The Cloudera Manager versions 7.7.1 and higher have different default Reports Monitor
                database configurations described in Install and Configure MySQL for Cloudera
                        Software documentation (refer to rman).
                This can make the rman user unable to connect to its
                database.
You must update the following parameters:
headlamp_database_host = <your DB hostname> 
headlamp_database_name = <your reports manager DB name, rman as default> 
headlamp_database_user = <you reports manager user name, rman as default> 
headlamp_database_password= <your reports manager pwd> 

For updating the parameters, you must create a json file. For example,
                    rman_db.json and update the values of parameters. 
 { "items": [ { "name": "headlamp_database_host", "value":
                    "your-DB-server.com" }, { "name": "headlamp_database_name", "value": "rman_db"
                    }, { "name": "headlamp_database_user", "value": "rman_user" }, { "name":
                    "headlamp_database_password", "value": "rman_pwd" } ] } 

Updating curl to the Cloudera Manager server:
curl -u admin:admin_pwd -X POST
                    "http://your-cm-server.com:7180/api/v49/cm/service/roleConfigGroups/mgmt-REPORTSMANAGER-BASE/config"
                    -d @rman_db.json
Review if Cloudera Manager has the paywall credentials configured. In Cloudera
                Manager, navigate to Parcel > Parcel Repository & Network Settings
                and check:
remote_repo_override_user
remote_repo_override_password 

You can also review the paywall credentials through Rest API call by posting the
                payload (repo_access.json) to Cloudera Manager server:
                     "items": [ { "name": "remote_repo_override_user", "value": "your
                    cloudera repo user name" }, { "name": "headlamp_database_password", "value":
                    "your cloudera repo password" } ] } 
curl -u admin:admin_pwd -X POST
                    "http://your-cm-server.com:7180/api/v49/cm/config" -d
                    @repo_access.json

Starting Cloudera Management service
curl -u admin:admin_pwd -X POST
                    "http://your-cm-server.com:7180/api/v49/cm/service/commands/restart" -H "accept:
                    application/json"
