Kerberos
You must restore krb5.conf, regenerate keytabs, and check Ranger and Oozie HA
        mode.

Restore krb5.conf. In the backup kerberos step, the
                    original /etc/krb5.conf file was copied to the
                        /<path/to/am2cm-kerberos-backup>/krb5.conf.bak. You
                    can restore them on each host using the following command. *
                        <path/to/am2cm-kerberos-backup> defaults to
                        /usr/am2cm/hdp-backup/kerberos
cp <path/to/am2cm-kerberos-backup>/krb5.conf.bak
                        /etc/krb5.conf If the backup kerberos step was skipped during the
                    upgrade process, you must manually reset the krb5.conf
                    file. 

Regenerate keytabs in Ambari UI.

If Ranger is in HA mode, you have to manually regenerate the
                        ranger.ha.keytab

If Oozie is in HA mode, you have to manually regenerate the
                        oozie.ha.keytab.
