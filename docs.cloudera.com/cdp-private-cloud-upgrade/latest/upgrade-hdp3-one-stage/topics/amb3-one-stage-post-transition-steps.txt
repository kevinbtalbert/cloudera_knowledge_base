Post transition steps
 You must prepare all the services for transition. The services are listed under the Preparing for the transition tab. For
            every service there is a tag displayed. You can use the tag to identify the ansible task
            being executed. The actual ansible command is called in the docker container and is
            shown below the tag. After you click the icon, output and error log tabs appear below
            the ansible command, allowing you to check the output logs associated with the ansible
            upgrade playbook that is executed. 


The scripts are modifiable within the docker container and also on the container
                    host as they are mapped from the untarred am2cm folder. CMA UI acts as a wrapper
                    around the scripts to simplify upgrades. 
The third option is to manually transition by clicking  and using
                    the documentation. After the manual transition is complete, you must notify the
                    CMA server by clicking  to indicate that the
                    manual transition is complete. For more information, see Post transition steps.
After CMA finishes the upgrade, you must set oozie service dependency as a post
                    transition step. For more information, see Adding Oozie service
                        dependencies documentation.
