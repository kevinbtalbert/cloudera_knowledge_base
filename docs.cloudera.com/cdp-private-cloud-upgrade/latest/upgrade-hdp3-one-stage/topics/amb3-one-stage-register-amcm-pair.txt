Registering Ambari Cloudera Manager pair
 As a prerequisite, you must have an instance of Cloudera manager available and
        running on a cluster. 
One transition represents a single upgrade path from a base cluster to a target
            cluster. A single Cloudera Migration Assistant (CMA) server is designed to handle
            multiple upgrades of Ambari-CM Pairs.

On the left navigation pane, click New Transition and
                    select Upgrade to CDP PvC Base - 1-stage. Click
                        Next.


Register the Ambari Server by providing Ambari admin
                        user and Ambari admin password. Click
                        Connect. If the connection is successful, click
                        Next






A page for registering adding Cloudera Manager keys to the nodes is
                    displayed. 



Configure the CDP Private Cloud Base Runtime parcel and credentials. You can
                    select CDP Private Cloud Base Runtime parcel from the released versions and also
                    edit the target full version specifying exact hotfix numbers.


Click Next. Click Finish to
                    complete the registration.

noteThe transition data is stored in <AM2CM_ROOT>/data/<Transition ID>
                        directory. The following files are important for future references: 
<TID>-var.json: Parameters collected during
                                the registration process. This is an external VARS file passed to
                                the ansible scripts. 
<TID>-inventory.ini: The hosts and their
                                roles mapped to an ansible inventory file


After the registration is successful, a new light blue tile is added
                    under the Transitions menu.



Execute transition by clicking List & Check Mark
                    icon.
