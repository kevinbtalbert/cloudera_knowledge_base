Restore old configuration symlinks
Restore old /etc configuration symlinks.
In the "Backup /etc configs" step, the original
            etc/<service>/conf symlinks were copied to the /etc/<service>/conf.hdp.bak
            symlink. You can restore them on each host using the following commands.

rm -f /etc/<service>/conf 

cp -d /etc/<service>/conf.hdp.bak /etc/<service>/conf
                    

If the Backup /etc configs step was skipped during the
                        upgrade process, you must manually reset the symbolic links to point to the
                        correct configuration folder.
