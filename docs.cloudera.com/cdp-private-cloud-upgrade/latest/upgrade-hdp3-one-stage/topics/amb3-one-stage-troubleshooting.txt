Troubleshooting
 This section provides you a list of possible causes and solutions to debug and
        resolve issues that you might face while upgrading HDP to CDP Private Cloud Base
        cluster.
Accessing CMA root folder in Docker
If you used docker to upgrade, create a bash session inside the container and go to
                the am2cm folder by running the following command: docker container exec
                    -it <container_id> /bin/bash


Examining CMA Server logs
Access the CMA root folder in docker. The AM2CM (CMA) server logs are in the
                    $AM2CM_ROOT directory with the name
                    am2cm-server.log.

Examining Transition Data 
Access the CMA root folder in docker. Use the transition id of your transition to
                enter $AM2CM_ROOT/data/<transition id>

Adding or removing transition steps 
Access the CMA root folder in docker. Run the following command: cd
                    am2cm-server/config/transitions
You will see transition-definition.yml

Manually editing Ansible input parameters
Access the CMA root folder in docker. Run the following command: cd
                    data/<transition id>

Editing transition parameters
<transition id>-inventory.ini: Inventory file with the
                hostnames and roles
<transition id>-vars.json & group_vars/: Ansible input
                that is extracted during the registration process
<transition id>-user-settings.ini: Input used by the am2cm
                tool. For more information, see Transitioning HDP 3.1.5 cluster to CDP Private
                    Cloud Base 7.1.x cluster using the AM2CM tool. 
conf/: Other configurations used by the am2cm tool
logs/: Logs from the ansible and tools used during the
                transition

Rewriting the Ansible scripts
You can change and add new Ansible scripts. All scripts are located in the folder
                    am2cm-ansible. To change the ansible scripts, grep
                recursively for the tags that you want to change.
