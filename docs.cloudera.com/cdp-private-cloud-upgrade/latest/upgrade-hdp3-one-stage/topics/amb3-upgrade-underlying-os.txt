Upgrading the cluster’s underlying OS
Ensure that all your hosts in the cluster are on the operating systems supported with
        the HDP intermediate bits and Ambari 7.1.x.x before starting the upgrade from HDP 3.1.5.x to
        HDP intermediate bits.
Only RHEL, CentOS, and Ubuntu operating systems are supported with the HDP intermediate
            bits and Ambari 7.1.x.x. Ensure that all your hosts in the cluster are on the supported
            operating system before starting the upgrade from HDP 3.1.5.x to HDP intermediate bits.
            For more information on the supported versions of Operating systems, see Operating system requirements. noteSLES 12
                SP5 is now supported for use with the HDP intermediate bits and CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.4 and higher.
For many, this is a process that  takes time and orchestration between multiple teams within your organization. Two high-level guidelines for moving from one major operating system version to another is as follows:
In-Place and Restore:
Perform an In-place OS refresh and use Ambari Restore Host feature
Move and Decom:
Move Masters and Decom/Recom Workers
Each option has advantages and disadvantages and high-level decision criteria.

In-Place and Restore Review the activities involved in ensuring important metadata and data are stored on         a volume that is not being used by the operating system, and leveraging component high         availability to maintain maximum cluster availability before starting the upgrade to HDP         intermediate bits.Move and DecommissionYou have the option to replace worker nodes with new operating system and move master         nodes to hosts wth new operating system when operating teams either do not have access to         the operating system or have not followed the best practices when setting up the HDP         directory structures.Parent topic: Cluster environment readiness
