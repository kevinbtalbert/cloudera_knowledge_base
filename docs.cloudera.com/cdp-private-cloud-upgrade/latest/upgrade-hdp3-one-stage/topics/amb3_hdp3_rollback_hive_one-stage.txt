Hive
Before starting the rollback procedure, make sure that HDFS and Zookeeper have
        already rolled back.
 You must delete your existing Hive Metastore database to roll back the Hive
            services.
To restore data on the node where the Hive Metastore database is located, perform the
            following steps.
Delete an existing database.Create an empty database in its place. $
                        mysql -u <hive_user>drop database <hive_db>;create database
                        <hive_db>;
Restore Hive Metastore database $ mysql -u <hive_user> <hive_db>
                        < </path/to/dump_file>. If you haveve performed HDFS
                    rollback already, there are no additional rollback steps required for Hive.
Start Hive service in Ambari UI.
