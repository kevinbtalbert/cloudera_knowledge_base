Oozie
 To roll back the Oozie service, you must restore the Oozie database. If the cluster
        is kerberized and Oozie is in HA mode then you must manually regenerate the oozie.ha.keytab
        if you have not already done so.


Start Oozie in Ambari UI.It is needed to re-generate the oozie.ha.keytab file
                        using the spnego.service.keytab files from the Oozie server hosts and from
                        the Oozie load balancer host and then distribute the generated
                        oozie.ha.keytab onto the respective Oozie hosts. In order to achieve this,
                        follow the steps listed in this website. 




Restart Oozie.
