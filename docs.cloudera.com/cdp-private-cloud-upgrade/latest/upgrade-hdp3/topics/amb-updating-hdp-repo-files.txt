Updating HDP repo files
When the cluster settings for the HDP repository URL is updated, repository files on
    hosts are not immediately regenerated. The files are re-generated when you add a new component
    or service. But an inaccessible repository URL causes the Package Manager to display an error
    about the unavailable repository URL when you update the package lists. Cloudera recommends you
    to manually update the URLs in the HDP repository files (for example,
    /etc/yum.repos.d/ambari-hdp-1.repo) on all agent hosts. 
noteAmbari 7.1.x.x and HDP 7.1.x.x are version numbers. For example, Ambari 7.1.8.0 and HDP
        7.1.8.0 or Ambari 7.1.7.0 and HDP 7.1.7.0 or Ambari 7.1.6.0 and HDP 7.1.6.0 and so
        on.
