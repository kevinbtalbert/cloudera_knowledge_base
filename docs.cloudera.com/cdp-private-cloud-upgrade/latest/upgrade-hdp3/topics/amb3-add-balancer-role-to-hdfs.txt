Add Balancer Role to HDFS
Use HDFS Balancer for balancing the data. 
The HDFS Balancer is a tool for balancing the data across the storage devices of a HDFS
            cluster. For more information on HDFS Balancer, see Balancing data across an HDFS
                cluster. noteThis section is required if you are upgrading up to and
                including CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.6. However, if you are upgrading to CDP Private
                Cloud Base 7.1.7 and upwards, then this section is not required as the latest AM2CM
                tool handles it.
