The Hue and DAS services are optional. 


Installing Data Analytics Studio on a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster using AmbariThis section applies only if you were on HDP 2.6.5 running Hive LLAP and Druid   workloads, and using Ambari Views to manage and monitor the performance of your queries. With CDP Private Cloud Base, Data Analytics Studio (DAS) replaces Ambari Views (Hive   View and Tez View) and offers additional analytical capabilities. Troubleshooting DAS installationThis section provides you a list of possible causes and solutions to debug and resolve     issues that you might face while using DAS on a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster managed through     Ambari.Installing DAS on CDP Private Cloud Base using Cloudera ManagerYou can install DAS using Cloudera Manager if you have transitioned from an         Ambari-managed CDP Private Cloud Base cluster to a Cloudera Manager-managed cluster using         the AM2CM tool, or if you were using Ambari Views on HDP 2.6.5 or DAS on HDP 3.1.5 and have         upgraded to CDP Private Cloud Base 7.x.Adding Hue service with Cloudera ManagerHue is a web-based interactive query editor that enables you to interact with databases   and data warehouses. Data architects, SQL developers, and data engineers can use Hue to create   data models, clean data to prepare it for analysis, and to build and test SQL scripts for   applications.Adding Query Processor service to a clusterThe Query Processor service indexes Hive and Tez events and provides APIs to access         them. It is required if you want to view the Queries tab (query history and query details)         on the Hue Job Browser. You must install the Query             Processor service on your CDP Private Cloud Base clusters manually.
