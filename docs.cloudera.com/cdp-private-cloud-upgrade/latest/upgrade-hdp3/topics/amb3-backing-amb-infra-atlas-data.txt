Backing up Ambari infra Solr data
In Ambari 7.1.x.x, Ambari Infra Solr uses Solr 8.4.1. For data stored in the existing
        Solr 5 implementation used by Ambari 2.6.2.x, the data stored in Ambari Infra must be backed
        up and the Ambari Infra Solr services must be upgraded. 
The next section walks you through steps to both back up the data stored in Ambari Infra
            and upgrade the Ambari Infra components. The backed up data will be migrated and
            restored after the HDP upgrade is complete. 

Back up and upgrade Ambari infra Solr and Ambari Log SearchThe Ambari Infra Solr instance is used to index data for Atlas, Ranger, and Log         Search. The version of Solr used by Ambari Infra in Ambari 2.7.5 is Solr 7. The version of         Solr used by Ambari Infra in Ambari 7.1.x.x is Solr 8.4.1. When moving from Solr 7 to Solr         8.4.1 indexed data must be backed up from Solr 7, migrated, and restored into Solr 8.4.1 as         there are on-disk format changes, and collection-specific schema changes.Parent topic: Pre-upgrade steps
