Changes to Ambari services and views 
 Review the list of additional components that are added to your cluster, along with
        the deprecated services and views that are removed during the process of upgrading to Ambari
        7.1.x and HDP intermediate bits.
These services are removed automatically as part of the upgrade process. You  can  also  remove these services manually prior to the upgrade by following the steps below:

Log in to the Ambari UI.
Click the service you wish to remove.
Stop the service.
Delete the service.

Ambari 2.7.5.x  to Ambari 7.1.x.x.
The Ambari 2.7.5.x to Ambari 7.1.x.x upgrade
            removes the following views:


Accumulo


Storm


Superset


Pig


The HDP 2.6.5.x to HDP intermediate bits upgrade removes the following
            services:


Accumulo


Storm


Superset


Pig

SmartSense

caution


When you upgrade Ambari to a later version, Accumulo service is not supported
                        as Accumulo is not compatible with other components and cannot access the
                        data. Hence, you must delete Accumulo service when upgrading Ambari.



noteYou must remove Accumulo on the Ambari managed HDP cluster as the AM2CM tool does not transition the Accumulo component from HDP to CDP. However, you can add Accumulo as a service on the Cloudera manager managed CDP Private Cloud Base cluster. 
important

Upgrading from HDP 3.1.5 to HDP intermediate bits does not support HDP Search to
                    Cloudera Search upgrade. 
LLAP is not supported in CDP Private Cloud Base. You can
                    move the LLAP workloads to CDW Public cloud or Private Cloud.
You must manually remove Storm before upgrading to the HDP Intermediate bits as
                    it is not supported in the HDP intermediate bits.
