Client Configurations
Migrating from Ambari to Cloudera Manager can leave the Ambari-managed HDP artifacts
    and links that may not have changed. After everything has been configured, deploy Client
    Configuration [Cloudera Manager > Clusters >
      Actions > Deploy Client Configurations]. This
    fixes any missing configuration references in the cluster.
