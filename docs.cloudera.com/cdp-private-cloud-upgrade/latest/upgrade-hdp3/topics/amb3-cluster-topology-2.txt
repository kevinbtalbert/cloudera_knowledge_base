Custom Topology
Custom topology configuration in Cloudera Manager. 
In the Ambari HDFS service, if net.topology.script.file.name is
      configured with custom topology file, then, in Cloudera Manager > HDFS Configuration page, you
      must configure net.topology.script.file.name with the same file.
note

You must migrate the net.topology.script.file.name parameter to
          Cloudera Manager only if the value of the
            net.topology.script.file.name parameter is different from the
          default value set in Ambari.
If you had a custom script previously set, you must ensure that it is not in the path
          with symlinks. Symlinks may have changed during the upgrade process.
