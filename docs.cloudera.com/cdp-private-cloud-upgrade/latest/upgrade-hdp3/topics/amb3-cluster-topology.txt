Backup the non-default Rack Awareness Topology script
Backup any custom configurations of the rack awareness topology script.
In the Ambari HDFS service, if net.topology.script.file.name is
      configured with a non default topology script (that is not the default
      /etc/hadoop/conf/topology_script.py script), then take a backup of it. 
After transitioning to Cloudera Manager, you can reconfigure your script.noteThe reason for
      this is that the default script has a different name in Cloudera Manager. That is the
      default script is the same in Ambari and Cloudera Manager but the two management systems
      have different names for that same script.
