Databases
Before you start upgrading from Ambari HDP to Cloudera Manager CDP Private Cloud Base, you must ensure that you have a backup of the
    following component databases: Hive Metastore, Ranger, Ranger KMS, and Oozie.
Cloudera recommends that you transfer data from the old databases to a new set of databases,
      and use the new databases as reference in CDP Private Cloud Base. You
      can retain the old databases for reference, and to research any issues that you may encounter
      when running your applications in CDP Private Cloud Base.
