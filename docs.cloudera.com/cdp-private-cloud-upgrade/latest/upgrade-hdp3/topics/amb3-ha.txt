HDFS HA
You must check HDFS HA and set Failover controller.
 Perform the task.
Cloudera Manager does not support the comma separated entries.  Review
          dfs.data.transfer.protection and
          hadoop.rpc.protection parameters. If SSL is not enabled, then click
          Undo. This will clear the selections.

note Privacy option requires SSL.



Start HDFS service.
Failover Controller fails to start. You must continue with step 3 or
          4.

Format the ZooKeeper Failover controller ZnNode. SSH to the Failover controller host
          And perform the following using the example:# cd
            /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/<xx>-hdfs-FAILOVERCONTROLLER
            /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/bin/hdfs --config
            /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/<xx>-hdfs-FAILOVERCONTROLLER/ zkfc
            -formatZK



Check the output in the log for success. If the error is: `ERROR
              tools.DFSZKFailoverController: DFSZKFailOverController exiting due to earlier
              exception java.io.IOException: Running in secure mode, but config doesn't have a
              keytab`.


The ZooKeeper nodes are not created. You must manually create the ZNodes for the
              Failover controllers to start and allow an Active Namenode to be elected. 


With the zookeeper-client, open a ZooKeeper Shell `zookeeper-client -server
              <a_zk_server>` 


Create the required ZNodes  create /hadoop-ha
create /hadoop-ha/<namenode_namespace>. 



This is an alternative step to the above step 3.


Log in to Cloudera Manager.


Navigate to Clusters


Click HDFS


Go to the Instances tab


Click Failover Controller instance


Click Actions


Initialize Automatic Failover Znode



Start HDFS service again.
