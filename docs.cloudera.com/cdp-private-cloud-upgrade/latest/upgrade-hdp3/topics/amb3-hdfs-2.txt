HDFS
Perform the following post migration steps. 
Configure the ports, check the HA NameNode, custom topology, and review other configurations
      to ensure that HDFS service is set up.

PortsEnsure that you review service configuration warnings and address     inconsistencies.TLS/SSLIf the TLS/SSL is not enabled in the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, then you must         reset the dfs.data.transfer.protection configuration.HDFS HAYou must check HDFS HA and set Failover controller.Custom TopologyCustom topology configuration in Cloudera Manager. Add Balancer Role to HDFSUse HDFS Balancer for balancing the data. Other review configurations for HDFSConfiguring HDFS properties to optimize log collectionCDP         uses “out_webhdfs” Fluentd output plugin to write records into HDFS, in the form of log         files, which are then used by different Data Services to generate diagnostic bundles. Over         time, these log files can grow in size. To optimize the size of logs that are captured and         stored on HDFS, you must update certain HDFS configurations in the hdfs-site.xml file using         Cloudera Manager.Parent topic: Post transition steps
