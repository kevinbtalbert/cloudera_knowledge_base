        you must perform to ensure the cluster is ready for the upgrade.


Ambari upgrade checklistWhen preparing to upgrade Ambari and the HDP Cluster, Cloudera recommends that you         review this checklist to confirm that your cluster operation is healthy. Attempting to         upgrade a cluster that is operating in an unhealthy state can produce unexpected         results.Download cluster blueprints without hostsEnsure you download the cluster blueprints before you begin the upgrade. The         blueprint of your old cluster is used as the template of the new cluster after you         transition to Cloudera Manager.HDP upgrade checklistYou must ensure that your HDP cluster satisfies specific prerequisites before         initiating the upgrade to Ambari 7.1.x.x.Checklist for large clustersIf you have a large cluster with a large data volume, you should configure the Ambari         NameNode restart timeout parameter on the Ambari Server host, to ensure that the Ambari         requests for starting the NameNode do not timeout during an upgrade.Before upgrading any clusterPrior to installing HDP intermediate bits using Ambari as a part of the CDP upgrade         process, your cluster must meet the certain prerequisites to ensure that the cluster is in a         healthy operating mode and can successfully manage the upgrade process.Managing MPacksYou must review the information mentioned in this section before you proceed with the   upgrade.Changes to Ambari services and views Review the list of additional components that are added to your cluster, along with         the deprecated services and views that are removed during the process of upgrading to Ambari         7.1.x and HDP intermediate bits.HDP Core component version changesYou must be aware of the version number changes for the core components included in         HDP 3.1.5.x. Upgrading the clusterâ€™s underlying OSEnsure that all your hosts in the cluster are on the operating systems supported with         the HDP intermediate bits and Ambari 7.1.x.x before starting the upgrade from HDP 3.1.5.x to         HDP intermediate bits.
