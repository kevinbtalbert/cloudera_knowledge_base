Impala
After transitioning your cluster from HDP 3.1.5.x to CDP Private Cloud Base, you can manually install the Impala
        service.
Impala is a new service that is not available in HDP. By default Impala uses the
                cm_hive ranger service for authorization.
If you want to use the same Ranger service which Hive is using, you must: 
 On the Cloudera Manager UI:

Update the service name through safety valve in Cloudera Manager UI for the Impala
                service. In ranger-impala-security.xml, add
                    ranger.plugin.hive.service.name =
                    <migrated_hive_ranger_service_name> hive service name. For
                example, cl1_hive

On the Ranger Admin UI:

Add the Impala user in policy.download.auth.users and
                    tag.download.auth.users configurations in the migrated hive
                ranger service. For example, cl1_hive.
Add the Impala user to the default policies in the migrated hive ranger service. For
                example, cl1_hive.
