Ambari infra-migrate and restore
Follow the steps below to restore the data previously backed up:

SSH to the host where the migrationConfigGenerator.py was run
                    prior to the HDP Upgrade. This will be from one of your Ambari Infra Solr
                    instances. Ensure you are in the current working directory containing the
                        ambari_solr_migration.ini file.

Export the variable used to hold the path to the ini file. 

export CONFIG_INI_LOCATION=ambari_solr_migration.ini 


Migrate the data to ensure itâ€™s in the right format to import into Solr 7. Note that this script can take a long time to run depending on the volume of data backed up. It is recommended to run this script using the nohup command.

nohup /usr/lib/ambari-infra-solr-client/ambariSolrMigration.sh --ini-file \ $CONFIG_INI_LOCATION --mode migrate-restore


Re-index the migrated data into your current collections so the backed up data is visible in all of the tools using the Infra Solr instances. Note that this script can take a long time to run depending on the volume of data backed up. It is recommended to run this script using the nohup command.

nohup /usr/lib/ambari-infra-solr-client/ambariSolrMigration.sh --ini-file \ $CONFIG_INI_LOCATION --mode transport
