Download, extract, and copy the renamed JDBC driver, to
                /usr/share/java/. If the target directory does not yet exist,
            you must create the directory. 
Installing the Postgres JDBC Driver

Install the PostgreSQL JDBC driver. If you would like to use the PostgreSQL JDBC
                        driver version shipped with the OS repositories, run the following command:
                            yum install postgresql-jdbc*You can also
                            download the JDBC driver from the official PostgreSQL JDBC Driver
                            website â€“ https://jdbc.postgresql.org.
Rename the Postgres JDBC driver .jar file to
                    postgresql-connector-java.jarand copy it to the
                    /usr/share/java directory. The following copy command can be used if
                    the Postgres JDBC driver .jar file is installed from the OS
                    repositories: cp /usr/share/java/postgresql-jdbc.jar /usr/share/java/postgresql-connector-java.jar
Confirm that the .jar file is in the Java share directory: ls /usr/share/java/postgresql-connector-java.jar
Change the access mode of the .jar file to 644: chmod 644 /usr/share/java/postgresql-connector-java.jar


Installing the MySQL JDBC Driver for MariaDB
The MariaDB JDBC driver is not supported. Follow the steps in this
        section to install and use the MySQL JDBC driver instead.
Install the JDBC driver on the Cloudera Manager
        Server host, as well as any other hosts running services that require
        database access. 
noteIf you already have the JDBC driver installed on the hosts that need it, you can skip this
                section. However, MySQL 5.6 requires a version 5.1.26 or higher.
Cloudera recommends that you consolidate all roles that require
        databases on a limited number of hosts, and install the driver on those hosts. Locating all
        such roles on the same hosts is recommended but not required. Make sure to install the JDBC
        driver on each host running roles that access the database.noteCloudera recommends using
            only version 5.1 of the JDBC driver.

                                    sure that it is installed before installing the MySQL driver using
                                    yum install. If you want to use OpenJDK,
                                    you can install the driver using

                                        procedure to manually install the driver.

Download the MySQL JDBC driver from http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html (in
                                        .tar.gz format). As of the time of writing, you can
                                        download version 5.1.46 using wget as
                                        follows:wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.46.tar.gz
Extract the JDBC driver JAR file from the downloaded file. For
                                        example:tar zxvf mysql-connector-java-5.1.46.tar.gz
Copy the JDBC driver, renamed, to /usr/share/java/. If the
                                        target directory does not yet exist, create it. For

Installing the Oracle JDBC Connector
You must install the JDBC connector on the Cloudera Manager Server host and any other
                hosts that use a database.
 
Download the Oracle JDBC Driver from the Oracle website. For
                    example, the version 6 JAR file is named
                    ojdbc6.jar.For more information about supported
                        Java versions, see Java Requirements.To
                                download the JDBC driver, visit the Oracle JDBC and UCP
                                    Downloads page, and click on the link for your Oracle
                                Database version. Download the ojdbc6.jar file (or
                                ojdbc8.jar, for Oracle Database 12.2).
Copy the Oracle JDBC JAR file to
                    /usr/share/java/oracle-connector-java.jar. The
                    Cloudera Manager databases and the Hive Mestastore database use this
                    shared file. For
                    example:sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/java
                        sudo cp /tmp/ojdbc8-12.2.0.1.jar /usr/share/java/oracle-connector-java.jar
                        sudo chmod 644 /usr/share/java/oracle-connector-java.jar
