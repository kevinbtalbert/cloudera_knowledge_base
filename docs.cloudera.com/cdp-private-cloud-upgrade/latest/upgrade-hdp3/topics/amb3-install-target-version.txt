Install software on the hosts
If you have successfully registered the software repositories for the new target
                version with Ambari, you can now install the software on all hosts in the
                cluster.
Browse to Cluster Admin > Stack and
                                                Versions.

Click the Versions tab.

On a registered target version, click Install
                                                Packages and click
                                                OK to confirm.
The install version operation starts. This installs the
                                        target version on all hosts in the cluster. You can monitor
                                        the progress of the installation by clicking the
                                                Installing link. When the
                                        installation completes, the Upgrade
                                        button replaces the Install Packages
                                        button.
