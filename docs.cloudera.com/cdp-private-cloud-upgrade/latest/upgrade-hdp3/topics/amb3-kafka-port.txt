Change Kafka port value
Change the Kafka JMX port value if the Ranger KMS port is conflicting with Kafka JMX
        port.
The Ranger KMS ranger.service.https.port port value is migrated from
            the HDP cluster. In Cloudera Manager, if the Kafka jmx_port port
            value is the same as the Ranger KMS port value from HDP, then you must change the value
            of the Kafka JMX port number in Cloudera Manager.
