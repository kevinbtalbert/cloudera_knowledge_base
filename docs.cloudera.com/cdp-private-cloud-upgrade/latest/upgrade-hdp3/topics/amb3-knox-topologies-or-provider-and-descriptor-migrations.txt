Migrate Knoxâ€™s signing key to the CDP cluster.To add Knox signing key, you must add the credential aliases and configure the gateway
      properties.

If you want to migrate the signing key then the following credential aliases must be
          added with the corresponding values from the HDP signing key store:


gateway.signing.keystore.password.alias - The password for the
              signing keystore. 
gateway.signing.key.passphrase.alias - The passphrase to sign
              the private key stored in the signing keystore.



In addition, the following gateway properties must be configured with the Cloudera
          Manager UI:


gateway.signing.keystore.name 
gateway.signing.key.alias

gateway.signing.keystore.type

gateway.signing.keystore.password.alias

gateway.signing.key.passphrase.alias
