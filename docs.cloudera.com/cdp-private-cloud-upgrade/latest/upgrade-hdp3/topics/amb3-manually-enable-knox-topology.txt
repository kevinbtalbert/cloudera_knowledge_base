Topology migration
Migrate the custom HDP topologies to the CDP cluster.
There are existing Knox topologies in the CDP cluster
            available. If you have any custom topologies on the HDP cluster and you want to migrate
            to the CDP cluster, then perform the following steps:

Add a provider configuration with the details from the providers section of the
                    topology (or provider configuration) to be migrated. If the provider
                    configuration contains any credential aliases, then you must add them. For more
                    information on adding a provider configuration, see Add a provider configuration and for
                    aliases, see Saving Aliases

Add a descriptor with the services and corresponding parameters from the
                    topology (or descriptor) to be migrated, referencing the newly added provider
                    configuration. For more information on adding a descriptor, see Add a descriptor
