Preparing ZooKeeper for upgrade

ZooKeeper 3.5 is trying to load an existing 3.4 data directory in which no snapshot
            file is created. This usually happens if transaction count has not reached the limit of
            snapshot creation. An extra startup check is introduced in 3.5.5 (ZOOKEEPER-2325) to
            prevent a potential data inconsistency issue which makes ZooKeeper unable to start when
            no snapshot files are present. It is a valid scenario in 3.4, but in 3.5 it will result
            in failure to start ZooKeeper. For CDP 7.0.2+, you must set the property before the
            upgrade and remove it after the upgrade is finished.note

The updated ZooKeeper 3.5 in CDP 7 will not start properly, if only log
                        files (these are write-ahead-logs) are present for ZooKeeper but there is no
                        snapshot file available. 
You must set the below configuration only if you identify that there is no
                        snapshot file for ZooKeeper before the upgrade. 

This fix allows you to specify a new configuration that will disable the
                sanity check and allows ZooKeeper to start. You can set this configuration in two
                ways, choose one of the following:

 Adding a new system property for the ZooKeeper server:
                            -Dzookeeper.snapshot.trust.empty=true
You can also add this config to the zoo.cfg file, but in this case
                        you need to omit the "zookeeper." prefix and you need to add the
                            snapshot.trust.empty=true property to the
                            zoo.cfg file
