Preparing Spark for upgrade
You must migrate catalog data from dual catalog mode to single catalog mode before you upgrade HDP 3.1.5.x to HDP intermediate bits.
Dual catalog mode is not supported in CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.6.

Cloudera supports only a single catalog HDP 3.1.5 upgrade to CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.6. If your cluster version is HDP 3.1.4 or less, then you must upgrade to HDP 3.1.5 and then migrate to the single catalog. You must validate that all the tables are present in the single shared catalog.
