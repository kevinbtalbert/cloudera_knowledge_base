        workaround in CDP Private Cloud Base.

Log in to the load balancer host.

In the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file, change
                        SSLProxyVerify required to SSLProxyVerify
                        off.

Stop httpd "apachectl -k stop".

Start httpd "apachectl -k start".
You can now access the Oozie load balancer URL.
