Review configurations

Review dfs.client.failover.proxy.provider.mycluster value. If this
                    parameter has a non-default value, then configure this parameter in Cloudera
                    Manager. This configuration is not migrated from the Ambari managed HDP cluster
                    to Cloudera Manager.
Review and add the cloud service-related configurations as those are not transitioned to
                    Cloudera Manager.
