Perform the HDP upgrade
After you have performed the required pre-upgrade steps and backed up all the
        relevant data, you can proceed with the process to upgrade your cluster to HDP intermediate
        bits.

Log into Ambari.

Browse to Cluster Admin  > Stack and Versions. 

Click the Versions tab. 
The registered and installed target HDP version displays an
                        Upgrade button. 

Click Upgrade on the target version.
Based on your current HDP version and the target HDP version, Ambari performs a set of prerequisite checks to determine if you can perform a rolling or an express upgrade. A dialog displays the options available.

Select the Express Upgrade method. (Only supported
                    method for upgrading from HDP 3.1.5 to HDP intermediate bits.) Advanced options
                    are also available.


Skip all Service Check failures: Ambari automatically skips any
                                Service Check failures and completes the task without requiring user
                                actions. After all the Service Checks have run in a task, you see a
                                summary of the failures and options to continue the upgrade or
                                pause.
Skip all Slave Component failures Ambari automatically skips any
                                Secondary Component failures and completes the task of upgrading
                                Secondary components without requiring user actions. After all the
                                Secondary Components have been upgraded, you see a summary of the
                                failures and options to continue the upgrade or pause.



Click Proceed.
