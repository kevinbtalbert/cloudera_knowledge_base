After the HDP cluster is upgraded to CDP Private Cloud Base, ensure that you check the cluster
        settings, migration, and restore settings are correct.
Upload HDFS entity informationYou must also configure specific properties to update the values of the Ranger tag         store only if you are using Ranger Tagsync.Ambari infra-migrate and restoreFollow the steps below to restore the data previously backed up:Ambari Metrics and LogSearchTake the Ambari Metrics and Log Search Services out of Maintenance Mode by choosing             Actions > Turn Off Maintenance Mode from each Service         page.Back up the Ranger configurationYou must backup the Ranger configuration.Backup Infra Solr collectionsBackup the Infra solr collections from the Ambari managed Infra Solr service and     restore them on the Infra Solr service managed by Cloudera Manager. When you are creating a     backup of the Infra solr data, ensure that only Infra Solr and Zookeeper services are started     and other services are stopped. Similarly, when you are restoring the data on Infra Solr managed     by Cloudera Manager, you must start HDFS and Zookeeper only. This ensures no operations are     performed by services which can push data to Infra Solr. Search post-HDP-upgrade tasksAfter upgrading your HDP cluster to Cloudera Runtime, you need to add a Solr service         to your CDP cluster where you can recreate the collections you transitioned from HDP Search.         Once done, you can proceed with reindexing data to the transitioned collections.Parent topic: Upgrading HDP to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x
