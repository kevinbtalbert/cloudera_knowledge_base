Preparing HBase for upgrade
You must remove the HBase backup-and-restore-utility configuration present in your
        HDP 3.1.5 cluster before you migrate to CDP. CDP Private Cloud Base does not support the
        backup-and-restore utility present in HDP 3.1.5.

Remove the configuration properties that you added when you enabled the HBase
                backup-and-restore feature in HDP 3.1.5. If you do not perform this pre-upgrade
                step, HBase service fails to start after upgrading to CDP Private Cloud Base.


Open the hbase-site.xml configuration file on your HDP 3.1.5
                    cluster.

Delete the following properties:

hbase.backup.enable=true
hbase.master.logcleaner.plugins=org.apache.hadoop.hbase.backup.master.BackupLogCleaner
hbase.procedure.master.classes=org.apache.hadoop.hbase.backup.master.LogRollMasterProcedureManager
hbase.procedure.regionserver.classes=org.apache.hadoop.hbase.backup.regionserver.LogRollRegionServerProcedureManager


Edit the hbase.coprocessor.region.classes property to remove
                    the org.apache.hadoop.hbase.backup.BackupObserver class. 
For example, the hbase.coprocessor.region.classes property
                    looks like the following snippet after the
                    edit:hbase.coprocessor.region.classes=org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.access.SecureBulkLoadEndpoint

Save the changes made to the hbase-site.xml configuration file
                    on your HDP 3.1.5 cluster.

Restart the HBase cluster.
