​Preparing to Upgrade Ambari
You must prepare to upgrade Ambari to 7.1.x.x. Review this section before you
        upgrade.

You must have root, administrative, or root-equivalent authorization on the
                    Ambari Server host and all Ambari Agent hosts in the cluster.
You must backup the Ambari Server database.
You must make a safe copy of the Ambari Server configuration file found at
                        /etc/ambari-server/conf/ambari.properties.
If your cluster is SSO-enabled, do not stop Knox before upgrading Ambari.
During the Ambari upgrade, the existing
                /var/lib/ambari-server/ambari-env.sh file is
            overwritten and a backup copy of ambari-env.sh (with extension
                .rpmsave) is created. If you have manually modified
                ambari-env.sh (for example, to change Ambari Server heap), you must
            re-apply your changes in the new file.
