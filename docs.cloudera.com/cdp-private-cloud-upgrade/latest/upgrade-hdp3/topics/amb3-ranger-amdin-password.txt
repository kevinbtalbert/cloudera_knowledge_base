Ranger admin password
During the HDP upgrade, Ranger admin fails to apply the Java patch to change all
        admin passwords if the
        hadoop.security.credstore.java-keystore-provider.password-file
        property is set in core-site.
Before you upgrade from HDP 3.1.5 to HDP intermediate
            bits, you must manually perform the following steps: 

SSH to the ranger admin host

cd /etc/ranger/admin/conf/

vi ranger-admin-env-credstore.sh

add "export HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD=none" in the
                    "ranger-admin-env-credstore.sh" file

chown ranger:ranger ranger-admin-env-credstore.sh

chmod 755 ranger-admin-env-credstore.sh
