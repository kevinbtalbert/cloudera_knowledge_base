You must change the port number for Ranger port numbers on Cloudera
        Manager.
After transitioning the cluster, the ranger.service.https.port and
                ranger.service.http.port configurations must have different
            port numbers in Cloudera Manager. Otherwise, Cloudera Manager displays a warning.
