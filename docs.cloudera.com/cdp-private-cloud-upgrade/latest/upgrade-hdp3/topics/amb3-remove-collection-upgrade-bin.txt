Remove Existing Collections and Upgrade Binaries 
Once the data has been backed up, the old collections need to be deleted, and the
        Ambari Infra Solr, and Log Search (if installed) components need to be upgraded.

To do all of that, run the following script: 
/usr/lib/ambari-infra-solr-client/ambariSolrMigration.sh \
--ini-file $CONFIG_INI_LOCATION \
--mode delete | tee delete_output.txt
During this process, the script generates Ambari tasks that are
                        visible in the Background Operations dialog in the Ambari Server.After the process has completed, retain the output of the script
                        for your records. This output is helpful when debugging any issues that may
                        occur during the migration process.

Starting services in Ambari


Enable the ignore_groupsusers_create property by
                            running the following commands from the ambari server host 
                            cd /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/scripts
python configs.py -l <AMBARI_HOST> -t <AMBARI_PORT> -u <ADMIN_USERNAME> -p
                                <ADMIN_PASSWORD> \
 -n <CLUSTER_NAME> -a set -s http -c cluster-env -k
                                ignore_groupsusers_create -v true


After the ignore_groupsusers_create property is
                            enabled, start services using Ambari and proceed with the upgrade.


After this step is completed, you must revert the
                                ignore_groupsusers_create property by running
                            the following commands from the ambari server host cd
                                /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/scripts

python configs.py -l <AMBARI_HOST> -t <AMBARI_PORT> -u
                                <ADMIN_USERNAME> -p <ADMIN_PASSWORD> \
-n <CLUSTER_NAME> -a set -s http -c cluster-env -k
                                ignore_groupsusers_create -v false
caution By setting the
                                    ignore_groupsusers_create property, you are
                                stopping the Apache Solr migration from creating a new solr user
                                which is already created. If you do not revert the
                                    ignore_groupsusers_create property, then
                                when you get to the step in the upgrade where a new yarn_ats user
                                must be created as it is not available in HDP 3.1.5.x, that yarn_ats
                                user creation fails and an upgrade error is displayed. You must
                                ensure to revert the setting immediately after this Solr upgrade
                                step.
