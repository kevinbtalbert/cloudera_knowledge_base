Solr
The AM2CM tool does not migrate Ambari Infra Solr configuration and data to Cloudera
        Manager. However, it adds a new Solr service. To take a backup, perform the following steps
        after the transition. 


Create a local directory for backups first:
                    mkdir -p [backup_dir]
Execute the following commands on the hosts where Solr is
                        installed.mv /etc/alternatives/solr-conf [backup_dir]/solr-confhdp
mv /etc/alternatives/hue-conf [backup_dir]/hue-confhdp
mv /etc/alternatives/hbase-solr-conf [backup_dir]/hbase-solr-confhdp For
                        RHEL:
                        mv /var/lib/alternatives/solr-conf [backup_dir]/solr-confhdpFor
                        Ubuntu:
                        mv /var/lib/dpkg/alternatives [backup_dir]/solr-confhdpFor
                        Sles:
                        mv /var/lib/rpm/alternatives [backup_dir]/solr-confhdp
