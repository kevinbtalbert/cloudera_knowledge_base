Unsetting Kafka Protocol version
You must unset the Kafka protocol version from Cloudera Manager after the upgrade is
  complete. This allows you to use the updated Kafka version using Cloudera Manager.
On the HDP cluster, using Ambari, you have set the Kafka protocol versions to the older
   Kafka version to make sure that all the messages are stored in a manner that Kafka can handle.
   After upgrading to the CDP cluster, the messages are still stored according to the older version
   of Kafka. This gives you the ability to roll it back if something goes wrong.
After the Kafka Protocol version properties are unset using Cloudera Manager, Kafka will use
   its current version (the new and updated Kafka version) and newly stored messages will not be
   handled by the older Kafka version. noteDo not unset the older Kafka protocol version until you
    have completed your upgrade testing. Unsetting the version will prevent rollback to the older
    Kafka release.
To unset the Kafka Protocol version on Cloudera Manager, perform the following steps: 
Remove the following properties from the Kafka Broker Advanced Configuration
      Snippet (Safety Valve) configuration property:
Inter.broker.protocol.version
log.message.format.version

Save your changes.
Perform a rolling restart:
Select the Kafka service. 
Click Actions > Rolling Restart. 
In the pop-up dialog box, select the options you want and click Rolling
        Restart. 
Click Close after the command has finished.
