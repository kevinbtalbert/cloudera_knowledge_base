Upgrade to Ambari 7.1.8
After reviewing the information related to Ambari UI and the Quick Links, and backing
            up the Ambari Server configuration file, perform the recommended steps for upgrading
            Ambari.

If you are running Ambari Metrics in your cluster, stop the service and put it
                        in Maintenance Mode. From Ambari Web, browse to Services > Ambari
                            Metrics and select Stop from the
                        Service Actions menu.

Stop the Ambari Server. On the host running Ambari Server:
                        ambari-server stop


Stop all Ambari Agents. On each host in your cluster running an
                        Ambari Agent: ambari-agent stop.

Fetch the new Ambari repo and replace the old repository file with the new
                        repository file on all hosts in your cluster. 

importantImportant: Check your current directory before
                            you download the new repository file to make sure that there are no
                            previous versions of the ambaridc.repo file. If you
                            do not, and a previous version exists, the new download will be saved
                            with a numeric extension, such as ambari.repo.1.
                            Make sure that the version you copy is the new version.


Select the repository appropriate for your environment from the following
                            list:

Upgrade Ambari Server database schema. On the host running Ambari Server:
                        ambari-server upgrade. When the Ambari
                        Server database schema has been upgraded, you should see command output like

Open Ambari Web UI. Point your browser to the Ambari Web UI: 



When Ambari Server is configured for HTTPS:
                                    https://<your.ambari.server>:8443


When Ambari Server is configured for HTTP:
                                    http://<your.ambari.server>:8080


where <your.ambari.server> is the name of your ambari server
                            host. For example, c7401.ambari.apache.org.
importantRefresh your browser so that it loads the new version of
                            the Ambari Web code. If you have problems, clear your browser cache
                            manually, then restart Ambari Server.


Log in using the Ambari administrator credentials that you have set up. For
                        example, the default name/password is admin/admin. You will see
                        a Restart indicator next to each service after upgrading. Ambari upgrade has
                        modified the configuration properties of your cluster based on the new
                        configuration types and properties being made available for each service with
                        this release of Ambari. Review these changes by comparing the previous
                        configuration with the latest version created by "ambari-upgrade". 

cautionDo not manually restart these services unless future steps
                            in the upgrade guide prompt you to do so. Manually restarting these services
                            may significantly disrupt your upgrade. Ambari will restart each service
                            automatically during the HDP upgrade. 


noteEven though the installer prompts you to sync LDAP, doing so is not
                            required.




Upgrade to Ambari 7.1.7.1
After reviewing the information related to Ambari UI and the Quick Links, and backing
                up the Ambari Server configuration file, perform the recommended steps for upgrading
                Ambari.

If you are running Ambari Metrics in your cluster, stop the service and put it
                            in Maintenance Mode. From Ambari Web, browse to Services > Ambari
                                Metrics and select Stop from the
                            Service Actions menu.

Stop the Ambari Server. On the host running Ambari Server:
                            ambari-server stop


Stop all Ambari Agents. On each host in your cluster running an
                            Ambari Agent: ambari-agent stop.

Fetch the new Ambari repo and replace the old repository file with the new
                            repository file on all hosts in your cluster. 

importantImportant: Check your current directory before
                            you download the new repository file to make sure that there are no
                            previous versions of the ambaridc.repo file. If you
                            do not, and a previous version exists, the new download will be saved
                            with a numeric extension, such as ambari.repo.1.
                            Make sure that the version you copy is the new version.

Open Ambari Web UI. Point your browser to the Ambari Web UI: 



When Ambari Server is configured for HTTPS:
                                        https://<your.ambari.server>:8443


When Ambari Server is configured for HTTP:
                                        http://<your.ambari.server>:8080


where <your.ambari.server> is the name of your ambari server
                                host. For example, c7401.ambari.apache.org.
importantRefresh your browser so that it loads the new version of
                                the Ambari Web code. If you have problems, clear your browser cache
                                manually, then restart Ambari Server.


Log in using the Ambari administrator credentials that you have set up. For
                            example, the default name/password is admin/admin. You will see
                            a Restart indicator next to each service after upgrading. Ambari upgrade has
                            modified the configuration properties of your cluster based on the new
                            configuration types and properties being made available for each service with
                            this release of Ambari. Review these changes by comparing the previous
                            configuration with the latest version created by "ambari-upgrade". 

cautionDo not manually restart these services unless future steps
                                in the upgrade guide prompt you to do so. Manually restarting these services
                                may significantly disrupt your upgrade. Ambari will restart each service
                                automatically during the HDP upgrade. 


noteEven though the installer prompts you to sync LDAP, doing so is not
                                required.




Upgrade to Ambari 7.1.6.0
After reviewing the information related to Ambari UI and the Quick Links, and backing
            up the Ambari Server configuration file, perform the recommended steps for upgrading
            Ambari.

If you are running Ambari Metrics in your cluster, stop the service and put it
                    in Maintenance Mode. From Ambari Web, browse to Services > Ambari
                        Metrics and select Stop from the
                        Service Actions menu.

Stop the Ambari Server. On the host running Ambari Server:
                        ambari-server stop


Stop all Ambari Agents. On each host in your cluster running an
                    Ambari Agent: ambari-agent stop.

Fetch the new Ambari repo and replace the old repository file with the new
                    repository file on all hosts in your cluster. 

importantImportant: Check your current directory before you
                        download the new repository file to make sure that there are no previous
                        versions of the ambaridc.repo file. If you do not, and
                        a previous version exists, the new download will be saved with a numeric
                        extension, such as ambaridc.repo.1. Make sure that the
                        version you copy is the new version.


Select the repository appropriate for your environment from the following
                        list:

For RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 7:
                            wget -nv https://[***USERNAME***]:[***PASSWORD***]@archive.cloudera.com/p/ambaridc/7.x/7.1.6.0/centos7/ambaridc.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/ambaridc.repo

 After the upgrade process completes, check each host to make sure the new
                    files have been installed:
For RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 7:
rpm -qa | grep ambari-agent For SLES 12:
                    rpm -qa | grep ambari-agent
 For Ubuntu 18: dpkg -l ambari-agent 

Upgrade Ambari Server database schema. On the host running Ambari Server:
                            ambari-server upgrade. When the Ambari
                    Server database schema has been upgraded, you should see command output like
                    this: Ambari Server ‘upgrade’ completed successfully.

Start the Ambari Server. On the host running Ambari Server:
                        ambari-server start

Start all Ambari Agents. On each host in your cluster running an Ambari Agent:
                        ambari-agent start

Open Ambari Web UI. Point your browser to the Ambari Web UI: 



When Ambari Server is configured for HTTPS:
                                    https://<your.ambari.server>:8443


When Ambari Server is configured for HTTP:
                                    http://<your.ambari.server>:8080


where <your.ambari.server> is the name of your ambari server
                        host. For example, c7401.ambari.apache.org.
importantRefresh your browser so that it loads the new version of
                        the Ambari Web code. If you have problems, clear your browser cache
                        manually, then restart Ambari Server.


Log in using the Ambari administrator credentials that you have set up. For
                    example, the default name/password is admin/admin. You will see
                    a Restart indicator next to each service after upgrading. Ambari upgrade has
                    modified the configuration properties of your cluster based on the new
                    configuration types and properties being made available for each service with
                    this release of Ambari. Review these changes by comparing the previous
                    configuration with the latest version created by "ambari-upgrade". 

cautionDo not manually restart these services unless future steps
                        in the upgrade guide prompt you to do so. Manually restarting these services
                        may significantly disrupt your upgrade. Ambari will restart each service
                        automatically during the HDP upgrade. 


noteEven though the installer prompts you to sync LDAP, doing so is not
                        required.
