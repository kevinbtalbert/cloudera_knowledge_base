In-place upgrade overview
To plan your upgrade from Ambari managed HDP 3.1.5 to CDP Private Cloud Base, you must be aware of the two stages of in-place
    upgrade along with the pre-upgrade, upgrade, and post-upgrade tasks.
 This upgrade path consists of two stages:
Upgrade HDP 3.1.5 to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x using Ambari. 
Transition the management platform from Ambari to Cloudera Manager.
note
The importance of security in a production environment cannot be understated. TLS and
            Kerberos form the baseline for secure operations of your CDP Runtime environment.
            Cloudera supports security services such as Ranger and Atlas only when
            they are run on clusters where Kerberos is enabled to authenticate users.
To upgrade to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x, you must first upgrade from Ambari
          2.7.5.x (source) to Ambari 7.1.x.x (target) and then upgrade from HDP
          3.1.5 to Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x. noteFor this in-place upgrade to CDP Private
          Cloud Base 7.1.6 or 7.1.7, or 7.1.8, the minimum supported version of HDP is 3.1.5.
        
Upgrading and transitioning to CDP Private Cloud BaseTo upgrade and transition to CDP Private Cloud Base using
        the documentation, perform the following steps. 


noteIf you are upgrading to Cloudera Manager 7.5.1 or higher in order to install CDP Private
        Cloud Experiences version 1.3.1, you must use Cloudera Runtime version 7.1.6 or 7.1.7. For
        more information, see CDP Private Cloud Experiences.

noteIf you want to upgrade CDP Private Cloud Data Services, you must upgrade using the
        following path: 
Upgrade to Cloudera Manager 7.6.7.
Upgrade the Base cluster to 7.1.7 SP2.
Upgrade CDP Private Cloud Data Services to 1.5.0.

While the upgrade process will temporarily install HDP intermediate bits, the HDP
              intermediate bits is an interim artifact that enables you to complete the upgrade
            to CDP Private Cloud Base and is not a new release of HDP intended
            for production use. When the upgrade process is complete, your cluster will be using the
            Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x parcel.

The following table shows the supported versions of HDP and Ambari on the source
            cluster, Cloudera Manager and CDP on the target cluster, and the AM2CM tool:

 The final step of the upgrade process is to transition from the Ambari to Cloudera
        Manager latest version using the AM2CM tool. It includes the following steps: 

HDP cluster blueprint is exported from Ambari and converted to a Cloudera Manager
            deployment template using the AM2CM tool.
Deploy the template to Cloudera Manager and activate the Cloudera Runtime 7.1.x
            parcels. 
Start using the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster with Cloudera Manager.
Uninstall Ambari and the HDP stack

        of CDP Private Cloud Base. If you are running Hive LLAP workloads,
        contact Cloudera account team or Cloudera Support for further assistance. 
noteRolling Upgrades are not supported when upgrading to CDP Private Cloud Base.
note

If you are upgrading from HDP 3.0.0.x/3.0.1.x/3.1.0.x/3.1.4.x/3.1.5.0 and HBase is
              part of your HDP cluster, you must first upgrade to HDP 3.1.5.6091-7 to prevent HBase data loss.
              Also, ensure that all the previously installed hotfixes on your current HDP version
              are part of HDP 3.1.5.6091-7. If the hotfixes are not a part or you are not certain,
              you must contact Cloudera Support. 
If you are upgrading from a hotfix on top of HDP 3.1.5 and HBase is part of your HDP
              cluster, you must contact Cloudera Support and ask for HBASE-23044 and
                HBASE-25206 in a hotfix and upgrade to the hotfix.
