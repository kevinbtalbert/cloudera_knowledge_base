GPU Scheduling
You must enable GPU on the CDP cluster if GPU was enabled on the HDP
        cluster.


If you have enabled GPU in the HDP cluster and want to enable it in the CDP
                    cluster, then you must turn on the configure GPU scheduling and Isolation. For
                    more information, see  Configure GPU scheduling and
                    Isolation
