Setting the owner and permissions of /user/yarn
 If you want to add a VPC or Compute cluster after migration, ensure that the correct
        owner and permissions are set for /user/yarn in HDFS. 

If either the owner or the permissions of /user/yarn is set
                incorrectly, you can encounter errors when trying to add a VPC or Compute
                cluster.




You have permission to impersonate a hdfs user.
If you use Custom Service Accounts, add it to the supergroup group.




SSH to a cluster node

Change the owner of /user/yarn:

If you do not use Custom Service Accounts, change the owner to
                            hdfs:supergroup:sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -chown hdfs:supergroup /user/yarn
If you use Custom Service Accounts, change the owner to ***HDFS
                            CUSTOM
                        USER***:supergroup:sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -chown ***HDFS CUSTOM USER***:supergroup /user/yarn


Change the permissions of /user/yarn to
                        drwxr-xr-x:

sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -chmod 755 /user/yarn
