Backup HDFS
You can roll back an upgrade from CDP Private Cloud Base 7 to HDP 3. The rollback
        restores your HDP cluster to the state it was in before the upgrade. This means any change
        that happened after taking the backups as instructed from points 4 to 7 will be reverted
        from the HDFS cluster. You must perform additional steps before upgrading your HDP cluster
        if you have configured the NameNode HA. 

If you have configured the NameNode HA, then locate the Active NameNode from
                        Ambari Web > Services > HDFS in the Summary
                    area.

Check the NameNode directory to ensure that there is no snapshot of any prior
                    HDFS upgrade. Specifically, using Ambari Web, browse to Services >
                        HDFS > Configs, and examine the
                        dfs.namenode.name.dir in the NameNode Directories
                    property. Make sure that only a /current directory exists
                    and remove /previous directory on the NameNode host.

Create the following log and other files. The commands below back up additional
                    state from the file system in addition to what fsImage contains. This
                    information can be used to validate the filesystem state after the upgrade by
                    comparing the output before or after the upgrade. This is helpful, but it is not
                    required for troubleshooting any issues that arise during the upgrade.


noteThe fsck or ls command may take a significant amount of time if the
                            number of blocks or files in HDFS is in the ten to a hundred million or
                            more range.Authenticate as the HDFS user su -l
                                    [HDFS_USER]

noteIf the cluster is Kerberized, then you must kinit as the service
                        principal. If the cluster is not Kerberized, then you must run as a cluster
                        administrator user or log in as the service user.Run the following, where
                            [HDFS_USER] is the HDFS Service user. For example, hdfs: 



Run fsck with the following flags and send the results to a log. The
                            resulting file contains a complete block map of the file system.  Use
                            this log later to confirm the upgrade.

hdfs fsck / -files -blocks -locations > dfs-old-fsck-1.log



Create a list of all the DataNodes in the cluster.

hdfs dfsadmin -report > dfs-old-report-1.log



Capture the complete namespace of the file system. The following
                            command does a recursive listing of the root file system:

hdfs dfs -ls -R / > dfs-old-lsr-1.log



Take a backup of the HDFS data to the backup instance of your HDFS, if
                            you have such a system.



Create a backup from the configuration directory under
                        /etc/hadoop/conf into a backup directory on all of your
                    hosts.

Save the namespace. As the HDFS user, " su -l [HDFS_USER] ", you must put the
                    cluster in Safe Mode.

hdfs dfsadmin -safemode enter
hdfs dfsadmin -saveNamespace
noteIn a highly-available NameNode configuration, the command hdfs
                            dfsadmin -saveNamespace sets a checkpoint in the first
                        NameNode specified in the configuration, in
                            dfs.ha.namenodes.[nameserviceID]. You can also use the
                            dfsadmin -fs.


Create a backup from the directory located in
                        $[dfs.namenode.name.dir]/ current into a backup directory.
                

Create a backup from the directory located in
                        $[dfs.journalnode.edits.dir]/current into a backup
                    directory.

As the HDFS user, su -l [HDFS_USER], take the NameNode out of
                    Safe Mode. hdfs dfsadmin -safemode leave

From this point, you have all the data that might be required to restore HDFS
                    to the state where it was at the time when HDFS entered safe mode. 
A few points to consider regarding the backups:
fsck ls, and other command outputs happened before entering safe mode if
                            you went step by step over the guide. The guide initiates safe mode
                            before the commands that require safe mode, however you can enter safe
                            mode earlier. 
If you come out of safe mode, and leave the cluster running, then you
                            are allowing mutations on the filesystem that are not saved in the
                            backup.
