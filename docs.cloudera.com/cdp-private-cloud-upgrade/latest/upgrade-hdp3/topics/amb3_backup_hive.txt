Backup Hive
To backup the Hive service, you must backup the Hive database and create a snapshot
        of the Hive warehouse. 
Backup Hive table data using a snapshot
In Ambari, go to Services > Hive > Configs, and check the value of
                hive.metastore.warehouse.dir to determine the location of the Hive
            warehouse, /apps/hive/warehouse by default.
On any node in the cluster, as the HDFS superuser, enable snapshots. For
                    example, $ sudo su - hdfs
$ hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot /apps/hive/warehouseOutput
                        is:Allowing snaphot on /apps/hive/warehouse succeeded
Create a snapshot of the Hive warehouse. For example,
                    $ hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /apps/hive/warehouse
                    Output includes the name and location of the
                    snapshot:Created snapshot /apps/hive/warehouse/.snapshot/s20210308-104702.892

Back up Hive Metastore
On the node where the database you use for Hive Metastore resides, back up Hive Metastore
            before upgrading to HDP. For example, in MySQL, dump each database as
            follows:mysqldump -u <hive_db_user> <hive_db_schema_name> > </path/to/dump_file>
If you use another database for the Hive Metastore, use the equivalent command, such as
                pg_dump for Postgres to dump the
            database.
