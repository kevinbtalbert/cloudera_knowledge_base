Backup Kafka
Before you begin the upgrade process, you need to explicitly set the Kafka protocol
        version to match what's being used currently among the brokers and clients. Update
        server.properties on all brokers as follows:

Log in to Ambari.

Choose the Kafka service. 

Select the Configs  page. 

Find the Custom kafka-broker section.

Add the following properties:


inter.broker.protocol.version=current_Kafka_version
log.message.format.version=current_Kafka_version

Replace current_Kafka_version with the version of Apache
                        Kafka currently being used, in case of  HDP 3.1.5 it is
                            2.0.0.


Save your changes. The information is automatically copied to each
                    broker.

                            configurations (the inter.broker.protocol.version
                            and log.message.format.version properties) are set
                            to the new version (or left blank, which means to use the latest
                            version), Kafka rollback is not possible.
