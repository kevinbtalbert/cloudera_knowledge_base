If you have performed Zookeeper and HDFS rollback already, there are no additional
        rollback steps required for HBase.


Start HBase in Ambari UI.
If the HBase master does not start, ZooKeeper data must be cleaned by following
                    these steps:
Log in to the HBase Master host.
Setup Kerberos Credentials in case of secured cluster.
kinit -kt path/to/yarn-ats.hbase-master.keytab
                                        yarn-ats-hbase/hostname@domain
export JVMFLAGS=
                                        "-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/usr/hdp/current/hbase-master/conf/hbase_master_jaas.conf"

Delete the hbase-secure znode in the Zookeeper.
                                zookeeper-client -server ${zk_server_url} rmr
                                /hbase-secure
