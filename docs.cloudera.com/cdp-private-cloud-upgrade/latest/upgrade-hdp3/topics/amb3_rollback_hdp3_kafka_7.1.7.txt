Kafka
To roll back Kafka, perform the following steps. 

Kafka service depends on Zookeeper.  Make sure Zookeeper data is
                    restored.

After rollback, start the Kafka service, and check, if the producers and
                    consumers can connect to the cluster.

Remove the inter broker protocol and log format version settings from the Kafka
                    settings: 


Log in to Ambari.


Choose the Kafka service. 


Select the Configuration page.


Find the Custom kafka-broker section. 


Remove following properties:


inter.broker.protocol.version=current_Kafka_version
log.message.format.version=current_Kafka_version




Restart the Kafka service.


Start Kafka in Ambari UI
