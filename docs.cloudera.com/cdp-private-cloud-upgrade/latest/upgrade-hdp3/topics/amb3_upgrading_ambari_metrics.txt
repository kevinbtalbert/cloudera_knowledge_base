                        then choose Start.

note

Do not start the Ambari Metrics System service. Do not restart
                                    other services. The HDP upgrade process will restart all the
                                    services.
The updated Ambari Metrics Sink jars will be installed on all
                                    hosts. During the upgrade process, after the restart, each
                                    service start uses the latest sink implementations.
