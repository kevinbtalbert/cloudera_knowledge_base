Handling table reference syntax
For ANSI SQL compliance, Hive 3.x rejects `db.table` in SQL queries as described by the
  Hive-16907 bug fix. A dot (.) is not allowed in table names. As a Data Engineer, you need to
  ensure that Hive tables do not contain these references before migrating the tables to CDP, that
  scripts are changed to comply with the SQL standard references, and that users are aware of the
  requirement. 
To change queries that use such `db.table` references thereby preventing Hive from interpreting
    the entire db.table string incorrectly as the table name, you enclose the database name and the
    table name in backticks as follows:
A dot (.) is not allowed in table names. 


Find a table having the problematic table reference.
For example, math.students
     appears in a CREATE TABLE statement.

Enclose the database name and the table name in backticks.
CREATE TABLE `math`.`students` (name VARCHAR(64), age INT, gpa DECIMAL(3,2));


Add Backticks to Table ReferencesCDP includes the Hive-16907 bug fix, which rejects `db.table`         in SQL queries. A dot (.) is not allowed in table names. You need to change queries that use         such references to prevent Hive from interpreting the entire db.table string as the         table name.     Parent topic: Apache Hive Changes in CDP
