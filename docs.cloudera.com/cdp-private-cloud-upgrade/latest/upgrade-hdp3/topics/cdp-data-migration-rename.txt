Renaming tables
To harden the system, Hive data can be stored in HDFS encryption zones. RENAME has been
  changed to prevent moving a table outside the same encryption zone or into a no-encryption
  zone.
Before Upgrade to CDP
In CDH and HDP, renaming a managed table moves its HDFS location.
After Upgrade to CDP
Renaming a managed table moves its location only if the table is created without a
   LOCATION clause and is under its database directory.
