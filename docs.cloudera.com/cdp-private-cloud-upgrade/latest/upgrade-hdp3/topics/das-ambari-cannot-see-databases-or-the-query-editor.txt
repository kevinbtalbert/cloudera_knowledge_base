Verify whether HSI or HS2 services are running by going to Ambari > Hive > Summary.
If you are not running llap, then go to Ambari > Data Analytics Studio > Config > Advanced data_analytics_studio-properties > Data Analytics Studio config file template and set the use.hive.interactive.mode parameter to
     false. 
Verify whether the Hive configuration parameter
     hive.metastore.transactional.event.listeners is set to
     org.apache.hive.hcatalog.listener.DbNotificationListener by going to Ambari > Hive > Configs > Advanced > Advanced hive-site.
DAS event processor runs the repl dump command as a hive service user. The
    hive service user can run the repl dump command if the user has repl admin
    privileges.

Verify whether DAS can read the repl root directory permissions - if das and hive are running
     as different service users.
There may be exceptions in the /var/log/das/event-processor.log file
     with repl dump failures because of read errors.noteIf the das services cannot read the repl
      root directory permissions, then it can cause a number of repl directories to be created, but
      not deleted.
