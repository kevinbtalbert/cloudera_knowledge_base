Set up trusted CA certificates
Set up self-signed certificates

Certificates from a trusted CA are primarily used in production         environments. For a test environment, you can use a self-signed certificate.Set up self-signed certificatesYou can enable SSL for the DAS Engine using a self-signed certificate.
