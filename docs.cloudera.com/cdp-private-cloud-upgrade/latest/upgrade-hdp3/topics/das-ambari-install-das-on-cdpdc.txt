This section applies only if you were on HDP 2.6.5 running Hive LLAP and Druid
  workloads, and using Ambari Views to manage and monitor the performance of your queries. With CDP Private Cloud Base, Data Analytics Studio (DAS) replaces Ambari Views (Hive
  View and Tez View) and offers additional analytical capabilities. 
The tasks listed in this section assume that you have already upgraded Ambari and HDP cluster
   from 2.6.5 to CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.x.
noteDAS requires a backend database for storing query event information, and supports only
   PostgreSQL versions 9.6, 10, and 12.
