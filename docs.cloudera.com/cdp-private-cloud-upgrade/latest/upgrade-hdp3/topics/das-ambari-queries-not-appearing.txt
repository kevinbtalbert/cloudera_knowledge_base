Your queries are not appearing on the Queries page

Check the role that you have been assigned. If you are not an administrator, then you can
      only view the queries that you have run. Only administrators can view queries and data of
      other users.


To enlist yourself as the admin user, go to Ambari > Data Analytics Studio > Config > Advanced data_analytics_studio-security-site, and add your user name in the admin_users field.
          For example, hive,admin1,admin2.
You can also specify * (asterisk) in the
            admin_users field to make all users administrators.
You can also specify an admin group in the admin_groups field.

Check the configuration settings for Hive and Tez in the Ambari UI. See Check cluster configuration for Hive and Tez.

Verify whether the logs are added to the paths specified in the
      hive.hook.proto.base-directory and the
      tez.history.logging.proto-base-dir directory configurations.
Use the following commands to get the paths to the logs for Hive and Tez. If you have not run
     any queries, then the log directories may be empty.
For Hive:
hdfs dfs -ls /warehouse/tablespace/external/hive/sys.db/query_data
For Tez:
hdfs dfs -ls /warehouse/tablespace/external/hive/sys.db/dag_data
hdfs dfs -ls /warehouse/tablespace/external/hive/sys.db/dag_meta
hdfs dfs -ls /warehouse/tablespace/external/hive/sys.db/app_data


Verify whether the following proto directory configurations are present in the
      /etc/das/conf/das-event-processor.json file:
      hive.hook.proto.base-directory and
      tez.history.logging.proto-base-dir. If these configurations are not present
     in the /etc/das/conf/das-event-processor.json file, then do not edit the
      das-event-processor.json file - because they will be overwritten by the
     configurations specified in Ambari.
At this stage, restart the DAS service and recheck. If this doesn't fix the problem, then you
     might be using multiple configuration groups in Hive and Tez.
If you are using different or multiple configuration groups in Hive or Tez, then make sure
     that you specify the same paths in all the configuration groups. Presently, DAS does not
     support multiple configuration groups.

Verify whether you have the required access and permission to directories specified in the
     hive.hook.proto.base-directory and
     tez.history.logging.proto-base-dir directory configurations by checking errors
    from EventProcessorPipeline in the /var/log/das/event-processor.log file.
Make sure that the DAS services are running as the hive service user.

If you have a large number of users running Hive queries simultaneously using DAS, the
          connections from Hive can get exhausted. This sends the query to a queue in Hive which
          takes a long time to start running. This can result in the following:

If query is fired from DAS, it does not return any log or indicate that the query has
            been queued.
The query does not appear on the UI, because no event is received by DAS.

Evaluate your cluster usage. You may need to add more machines to the clusters to resolve
          this issue.
