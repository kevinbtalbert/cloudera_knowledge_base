Setting up the tmp directory
DAS allows you to download logs for secure clusters. To download logs, make sure that
  the DAS service user has write permission to the /tmp directory. Also make sure
  that the /tmp directory has sufficient storage space to hold logs from a query
  for the download logs feature to work.
