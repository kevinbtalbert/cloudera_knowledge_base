Installing DAS on CDP Private Cloud Base using Cloudera Manager
You can install DAS using Cloudera Manager if you have transitioned from an
        Ambari-managed CDP Private Cloud Base cluster to a Cloudera Manager-managed cluster using
        the AM2CM tool, or if you were using Ambari Views on HDP 2.6.5 or DAS on HDP 3.1.5 and have
        upgraded to CDP Private Cloud Base 7.x.

Make sure that you have created a PostgreSQL database version 9.6, 10, or 12 to use
                with DAS. If you have an existing Postgres database that you used with DAS on HDP
                3.1.5, then you can point DAS to the same database during the database setup stage,
                so that you do not lose saved queries and query history.

From the Cloudera Manager homepage, go to the Status
                    tab, click the more options icon on your $Cluster Name

If the connection is successful, a green checkmark and the word Successful
                    appears next to the service name. If there are any problems, an error is
                    reported indicating that the service failed to connect.

                    mode.
Review and make any necessary changes, and then click
                        Continue. The Command Details
                    page is displayed.

The Command Details page shows the status of your
                    operation. After completion, you can view the installation logs under the
                    standard output (stdout).
After the First Run command completes, click
                        Continue to go to the Summary
                    page.

The Summary page reports the success or failure of the
                    setup wizard. Click Finish to complete the wizard. The
                    installation is complete.
