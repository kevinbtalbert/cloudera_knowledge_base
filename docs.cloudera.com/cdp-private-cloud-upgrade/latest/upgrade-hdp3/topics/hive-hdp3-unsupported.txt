Unsupported Interfaces and Features
You need to know the interfaces available in HDP or CDH
    platforms that are no longer supported in CDP. Some features you might have used are also unsupported.
Unsupported Interfaces

Druid
LLAP (available in CDP Public Cloud only)
S3 for storing tables (available in CDP Public Cloud only)


Storage Based Authorization
Storage Based Authorization (SBA) is not longer supported in CDP. Ranger integration with
             Hive metastore provides consistency in Ranger authorization enabled in HiveServer (HS2). SBA
             did not provide authorization support for metadata that does not have a file/directory
             associated with it. Ranger-based authorization has no such limitation.
