Changes to HDP Hive tables
As a Data Scientist, Architect, Analyst, or other Hive user you need to locate and use
    your Apache Hive 3 tables after an upgrade. The upgrade process from HDP 3.1.5 to CDP makes no
    changes in the location of tables.
After the upgrade, the format of a Hive table is the same as before the upgrade. For
     example, native or non-native tables remain native or non-native, respectively.
After the upgrade, the location of managed tables or partitions do not change:
Managed files reside in the Hive warehouse
      /warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive. The upgrade process carries the external
      files over to CDP with no change in location. By default, Hive places any new external tables
      you create in /warehouse/tablespace/external/hive. The upgrade process sets
      the hive.metastore.warehouse.dir property to this location, designating it
      the Hive warehouse location.
Hive 3.x in CDP Private Cloud Base supports transactional and
     non-transactional tables. Transactional tables have atomic, consistent, isolation, and
     durable (ACID) properties. In Hive 3.x, the mature version of ACID is ACID v2, which is the
     default table type in CDP Private Cloud Base.
