Adding Hue service with Cloudera Manager
Hue is a web-based interactive query editor that enables you to interact with databases
  and data warehouses. Data architects, SQL developers, and data engineers can use Hue to create
  data models, clean data to prepare it for analysis, and to build and test SQL scripts for
  applications.
To add the Hue service with Cloudera Manager, complete the following steps:
Install and configure MySQL database
Add the Hue service using Cloudera Manager
Enable Kerberos for authentication
Integrate Hue with Knox
Grant Ranger permissions to new users or groups


Install and configure MySQL databaseHue requires a SQL database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle to store small         amounts of data, including user account information, query history, and permissions. The         instructions in this topic are for installing the MySQL database.Add the Hue service using Cloudera ManagerAfter you have installed and configured the MySQL database for Hue, add the Hue         service using Cloudera Manager.Enable Kerberos for authenticationFor Hue to work properly with a CDP cluster that uses Kerberos for authentication,         the Kerberos Ticket Renewer role must be added to the Hue service. After you have added the         Hue service to your cluster, renew the Kerberos ticket for Hue and enable Kerberos for         authentication.Integrate Hue with KnoxYou can use the Apache Knox Gateway to interact with Hue REST APIs and the Hue user         interface, along with other CDP components and services. To set up Knox Single Sign-on (SSO)         to authenticate users, you must configure the KnoxSpnegoDjangoBackend property using         Cloudera Manager.Grant Ranger permissions to new users or groupsIf you have secured your cluster using Ranger, then you must grant proper permissions         to your users and groups from the Ranger web interface. If your users do not have proper         permissions, then they may not be able to access certain databases or tables from the Hue         editor.Parent topic: Additional Services
