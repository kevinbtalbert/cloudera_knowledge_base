Install and configure MySQL database
Hue requires a SQL database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle to store small
        amounts of data, including user account information, query history, and permissions. The
        instructions in this topic are for installing the MySQL database.
Install MySQL on a host within your cluster. For
            instructions, refer to the MySQL Installation Guide.
To configure Hue to store data in the MySQL
            database:

SSH into the host on which you have installed MySQL.

Create a new database in MySQL as follows:

mysql> create database hue;


Run the following command to grant privileges to a Hue user to manage the
                    database:

mysql> grant all on hue.* to ‘hue’@‘localhost’ identified by ‘secretpassword’;
