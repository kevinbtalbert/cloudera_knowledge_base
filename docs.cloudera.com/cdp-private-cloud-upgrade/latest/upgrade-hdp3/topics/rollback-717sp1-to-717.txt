Procedure to Rollback from CDP 7.1.7 SP1 to CDP 7.1.7
You can rollback from the CDP 7.1.7 SP1 to CDP 7.1.7. To rollback to CDP
        7.1.7:

Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.

Click Parcels from the left menu.

Click Parcel Repositories & Network Settings.

noteIf the 7.1.7 URL is available in the parcel repository, then you can skip
                        to step 8. If not, then proceed with step 4.


In the Remote Parcel Repository URLs section, click the
                        "+" icon and add the 7.1.7 URL for your Parcel
                    repository.

Click Save & Verify Configuration. A message with
                    the status of the verification appears above the Remote Parcel
                        Repository URLs section. If the URL is not valid, check the URL
                    and enter the correct URL.

After the URL is verified, click Close.

Locate the row in the table that contains the new Cloudera Runtime parcel and
                    click the Download button.

After the download of the new Cloudera Runtime parcel is complete, click the
                        Distribute button.
Wait for the parcel to be distributed and unpacked before continuing. Cloudera
                    Manager displays the status of the Cloudera Runtime parcel distribution. Click
                    on the status display to view detailed status for each host.

Click Activate. Runtime parcels are activated on the
                    cluster.

When the parcel is activated, click the Cloudera Manager logo to return to the
                    home page.
The cluster is now rolled back to the CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.7
                    version. 
When the parcel is activated, click the Actions menu next to
          the cluster name and select Post Cloudera Runtime

            Restart.
