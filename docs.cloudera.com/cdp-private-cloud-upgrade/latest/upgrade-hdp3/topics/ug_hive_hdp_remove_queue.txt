Removing the LLAP Queue
Before upgrading from HDP to CDP, if you used LLAP, a YARN interactive query queue
        was created. This queue is carried over to your CDP cluster. You must remove this queue,
        likely named llap, after the upgrade. 
When you set up LLAP in an HDP cluster, Ambari creates a queue named
                llap by default; however, you might have created the LLAP queue
            manually and assigned a different name to the queue. Look for your LLAP and remove it as
            follows:noteLLAP is not supported on CDP Private Cloud Base.

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters > YARN > YARN Queue Manager UI.
A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview tab.

Click the options menu  for the
                    interactive query queue.

Click Delete Queue, and confirm deletion.
