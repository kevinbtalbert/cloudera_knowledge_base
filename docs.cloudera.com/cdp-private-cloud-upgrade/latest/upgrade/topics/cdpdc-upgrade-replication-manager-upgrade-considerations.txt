Replication Manager considerations while using CDH clusters
Before you plan to upgrade your CDH clusters, make sure you are
    aware about the considerations pertaining to the Replication Manager
    service.
In a typical production environment where multiple replication schedules are underway,
            the cluster upgrade process does not interrupt the data movement experience (migration).
            The only exception is when you are running the Hive replication policies or have
            any of them scheduled. 

noteYou cannot perform the cluster upgrade process while your Hive
                replication policies are running or scheduled to commence shortly. Make sure to
                either abort or wait for the submitted Hive replication policies to complete, before
                you commence the cluster upgrade process.
