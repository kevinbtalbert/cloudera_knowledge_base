Using Replication Manager to migrate to CDP Private Cloud Base from CDH
While using Replication Manager service you must follow these
    guidelines when migrating the CDH clusters.


Ensure that the supported source and target clusters and the corresponding
                    Cloudera Manager versions are in sync with respect to the cluster configurations
                    prior to starting the upgrade. 
Upgrade your target cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base first. Upgrading the target
          CDH cluster first ensures that your data on the source cluster is not
          corrupted or rendered invalid.
Upgrade the source cluster to CDP Private Cloud Base after the data is migrated
          to the CDP Private Cloud Base (target). And,
          later verify that both source and target clusters are upgraded to CDP Private Cloud Base.
