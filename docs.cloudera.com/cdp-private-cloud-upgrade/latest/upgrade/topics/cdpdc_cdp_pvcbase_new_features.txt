This is a generic service-level architecture of the components in the CDH stack.
                Components in Cloudera Applications, Operations and Management, and
                    Encryption boxes run outside of the cluster envelope defined in the CDH
                Cluster Services perimeter.


Components marked with a red X are either deprecated and removed or replaced
                with an alternative component in CDP. These changes are noted in the CDP Cluster
                Architecture slide.

The service changes from CDH to CDP are: 
Flume to Cloudera Data Flow
Navigator to Ranger/Atlas
Sentry to Ranger
KeytrusteeKMS to RangerKMS
HSM KMS to Key HSM
Hive-on-Spark/MR to Hive-on-Tez
YARN Fairshare to YARN Capacity 
Spark 1.6 to Spark 2.4
NavOpt to WorkloadXM
Pig to Hive or Spark
