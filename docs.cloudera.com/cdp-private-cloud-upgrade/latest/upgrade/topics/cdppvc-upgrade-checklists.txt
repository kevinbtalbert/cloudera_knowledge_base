Downloadable CDP upgrade checklists
Upgrade checklists include all the upgrade steps in project
    format so you can plan and track your upgrade activities.



Use the following files to assist your CDP upgrade project in any
      way helpful. The file structure has rows reflecting topics from
      CDP upgrade documentation and columns labeling the topics, the
      topic hierarchy, and URLs back to this website. The columns
      particularly target TeamGantt.com. Upload one of the files to that
      site to see a graphical view of your upgrade project with
      expandable/collapsable hierarchical tasks, the ability to assign
      owners, check off completed items, insert dates, click to view
      Cloudera documentation, etc. Using TeamGantt.com, however, is not
      required.
