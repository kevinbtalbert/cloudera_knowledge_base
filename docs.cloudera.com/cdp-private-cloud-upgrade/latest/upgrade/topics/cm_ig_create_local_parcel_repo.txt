Configuring a Local Parcel Repository

You can create a parcel repository for Cloudera Manager either by hosting
      an internal Web repository or by manually copying the repository files to
      the Cloudera Manager Server host for distribution to Cloudera Manager
      Agent hosts.

Using an Internally Hosted Remote Parcel Repository

The following sections describe how to use an
        internal Web server to host a parcel repository:


Setting Up a Web Server

To host an internal repository, you must install or use an existing
          Web server on an internal host that is reachable by the Cloudera
          Manager host, and then download the repository files to the Web server
          host. The examples on this page use Apache HTTP Server as the Web
          server. If you already have a Web server in your organization, you can
          skip to Downloading and Publishing the Parcel Repository.


Install Apache HTTP Server:
RHEL / CentOS

sudo yum install httpd

SLES

sudo zypper install httpd

Ubuntu

sudo apt-get install httpd



warningSkipping this step could result in an error
                message Hash verification failed when trying to download
                the parcel from a local repository, especially in Cloudera
                Manager 6 and higher. Edit the Apache HTTP Server
              configuration file (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf by
              default) to add or edit the following line in the
                <IfModule mime_module> section:    AddType application/x-gzip .gz .tgz .parcel
If the <IfModule mime_module> section does
                not exist, you can add it in its entirety as follows:
noteThis example configuration was modified from the default
                configuration provided after installing Apache HTTP Server on
                RHEL 7.
<IfModule mime_module>
    #
    # TypesConfig points to the file containing the list of mappings from
    # filename extension to MIME-type.
    #
    TypesConfig /etc/mime.types

    #
    # AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration
    # file specified in TypesConfig for specific file types.
    #
    #AddType application/x-gzip .tgz
    #
    # AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers uncompress
    # information on the fly. Note: Not all browsers support this.
    #
    #AddEncoding x-compress .Z
    #AddEncoding x-gzip .gz .tgz
    #
    # If the AddEncoding directives above are commented-out, then you
    # probably should define those extensions to indicate media types:
    #
    AddType application/x-compress .Z
    AddType application/x-gzip .gz .tgz .parcel

    #
    # AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to "handlers":
    # actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server
    # or added with the Action directive (see below)
    #
    # To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories:
    # (You will also need to add "ExecCGI" to the "Options" directive.)
    #
    #AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

    # For type maps (negotiated resources):
    #AddHandler type-map var

    #
    # Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.
    #
    # To parse .shtml files for server-side includes (SSI):
    # (You will also need to add "Includes" to the "Options" directive.)
    #
    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml
</IfModule>
Start Apache HTTP Server:
RHEL 7, 8

sudo systemctl start httpd

SLES 12, Ubuntu 16 or later

sudo systemctl start apache2








Downloading and Publishing the Parcel Repository


Look up the Cloudera Runtime version number for
            your deployment on the Cloudera Runtime Download
              Information page. You will need this version number in the
            next step.
Download manifest.json and the parcel files for
            the product you want to install:To download the files for the
              latest Runtime 7 release, run the following commands on the Web
              server
              host:sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/cloudera-repos
sudo wget --recursive --no-parent --no-host-directories https://[username]:[password]@archive.cloudera.com/p/cdh7/Cloudera Runtime version/parcels/ -P /var/www/html/cloudera-repos

sudo chmod -R ugo+rX /var/www/html/cloudera-repos/cdh7

Visit the Repository URL
                  http://<Web_server>/cloudera-repos/
            in your browser and verify the files you downloaded are present. If
            you do not see anything, your Web server may have been configured to
            not show indexes.




Configuring Cloudera Manager to Use an Internal Remote Parcel
        Repository


Use one of the following methods to open the
            parcel settings page:
Navigation bar
Click the parcel icon in the top navigation bar or click
                      Hosts and click the
                      Parcels tab.
Click the Configuration button.

Menu

Select
                        Administration > Settings.
Select
                        Category > Parcels.


 In the Remote Parcel Repository URLs list, click the addition
            symbol to open an additional row.
Enter the path to the parcel. For example:
                http://<web_server>/cloudera-parcels/cdh7/7.2.16.0.0/
Enter a Reason for change, and then click
              Save Changes to commit the changes.





Using a Local Parcel Repository

To use a local parcel repository, complete the following steps:
Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console and navigate to the
              Parcels page.
Select Configuration and verify that you
            have a Local Parcel Repository path set. By
            default, the directory is
            /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo.
Remove any Remote Parcel Repository URLs
            you are not using, including ones that point to Cloudera
            archives.
Add the parcel you want to use to the local parcel repository
            directory that you specified. For instructions on downloading
            parcels, see Downloading and Publishing the Parcel Repository above.
In the command line, navigate to the local parcel repository
            directory.
Create a SHA1 hash for the parcel you added and save it to a file
            named
              parcel_name.parcel.sha.For
              example, the following command generates a SHA1 hash for the
              parcel
                CDH-6.1.0-1.cdh6.1.0.p0.770702-el7.parcel:
              sha1sum CDH-6.1.0-1.cdh6.1.0.p0.770702-el7.parcel | awk '{ print $1 }' > CDH-6.1.0-1.cdh6.1.0.p0.770702-el7.parcel.sha
Change the ownership of the parcel and hash files to
              cloudera-scm:sudo chown -R cloudera-scm:cloudera-scm /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo/*
In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, navigate to the
              Parcels page.
Click Check for New Parcels and verify that
            the new parcel appears.
Download, distribute, and activate the parcel.
