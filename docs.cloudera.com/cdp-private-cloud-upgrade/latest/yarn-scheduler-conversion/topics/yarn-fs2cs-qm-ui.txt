Using YARN Queue Manager UI to configure scheduler properties
After migrating to CDP, you must configure the Capacity Scheduler properties using
        the output files generated by the fs2cs conversion utility. You can configure
        the properties manually using the YARN Queue Manager UI service.



Use the fs2cs conversion utility to generate the
                        capacity-scheduler.xml and
                        yarn-site.xml output files.


Complete the scheduler migration process.

Identify properties that require manual configuration and can be configured
                    using the Queue Manager UI.
For more information about scheduler properties, see Fair Scheduler
                feature and conversion details.


In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters and select the
                    YARN Queue Manager UI  service.






In the YARN Queue Manager window, click the Scheduler
                    Configuration tab.






In the Scheduler Configuration window, enter the value
                    of the property and click Save.
