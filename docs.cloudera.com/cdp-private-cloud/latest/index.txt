Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Private Cloud Base lays the foundation of 
Clouderaâ€™s modern, on-premises data and analytics platform by offering 
faster analytics, improved hardware utilization, and increased storage 
density. Strengthened platform security and simplified governance for 
regulatory compliance helps organizations manage enterprise readiness.
CDP Private Cloud Base supports a variety of hybrid solutions where 
compute tasks are separated from data storage and where data can be 
accessed from remote clusters, including workloads created using 
CDP Private Cloud Data Services. 
This hybrid approach provides a foundation for containerized applications 
by managing storage, table schema, authentication, authorization and governance.
CDP Private Cloud Base consists of a variety of components from which
you can select any combination of services to create clusters that address 
your business requirements and workloads. Several pre-configured packages 
of services are also available for common workloads.
