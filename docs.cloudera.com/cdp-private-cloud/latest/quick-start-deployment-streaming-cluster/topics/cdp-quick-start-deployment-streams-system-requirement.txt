HTTP Proxy
The Cloudera Manager installer accesses archive.cloudera.com by using
     yum on RHEL systems. If your hosts access the Internet through an HTTP proxy,
    you can configure yum system-wide, to access
     archive.cloudera.com through a proxy. 
To do so, modify the system configuration on the host node as follows: 


OS
File
Property



RHEL-compatible
/etc/yum.conf
proxy=http://server:port/


Ubuntu
/etc/apt/apt.conf
Acquire::http::Proxy
         "http://server:port";



SELinux
If you are using SELinux in enforcing mode, you must disable SELinux for the
    Cloudera Manager installer to work. 
Configure SELINUX=disabled in the /etc/selinux/config file. 
Set: 
setenforce 0



Cluster Host
The hosts you intend to use must satisfy the following requirements:

You must be able to log in to the Cloudera Manager Server host using the
      root user account or an account that has passwordless sudo
     privileges.
The Cloudera Manager Server host must have uniform SSH access on the same port to all hosts. 
All hosts must have access to standard package repositories for the operating system and
     either archive.cloudera.com or a local repository with the required
     installation files.
