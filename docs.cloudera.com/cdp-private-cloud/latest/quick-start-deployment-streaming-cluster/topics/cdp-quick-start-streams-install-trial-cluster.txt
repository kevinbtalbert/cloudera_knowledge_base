Installing a Trial Streaming Cluster
When you install the CDP Private Cloud Base trial software,
  Cloudera Manager automates the installation of the Oracle JDK, Cloudera Manager Server, embedded
  PostgreSQL database, Cloudera Manager Agent, Runtime, and managed service software on cluster
  hosts. Cloudera Manager also configures databases for the Cloudera Manager Server and Hive
  Metastore and optionally for Cloudera Management Service
  roles.

importantThis procedure is intended for trial and proof-of-concept deployments
    only. It is not supported for production deployments because it is not designed to scale.
