Read the Events
Consumers are client applications that subscribe to read and process events. You can
        simulate the subscription process by running the console consumer client to read the events
        you just created.

Events in a topic can be read as often as needed and by as many consumers as
                necessary. Events are not deleted after consumption.



You have a topic with events in it.



Open another terminal session and run the console consumer client to read the
                    events you just created:

$ bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic quickstart-events --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
This is my first event
This is my second event


You can stop the consumer client with Ctrl-C at any
                        time.


Feel free to experiment: for example, switch back to your producer terminal
                    (previous step) to write additional events, and see how the events immediately
                    show up in your consumer terminal.
