Write a few Events into the Topic
After you create a topic, populate the topic with one or more events that you want to
        stream.

A Kafka client communicates with the Kafka brokers via the network for writing or
                reading events. Once received, the brokers will store the events in a durable and
                fault-tolerant manner for as long as you need.



You have created a Kafka topic.



Run the console producer client to write a few events into your topic. By
                    default, each line you enter will result in a separate event being written to
                    the topic.

$ bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
This is my first event
This is my second event

You can stop the producer client with Ctrl-C at any
                    time.

Optionally, write more messages to the topic.
For more Kafka command-line tools, see Kafka Command Line
                    Tools.

Read the events.
