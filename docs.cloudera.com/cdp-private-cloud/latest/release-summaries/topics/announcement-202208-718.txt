Cloudera is pleased to announce the release of Cloudera Data Platform
(CDP) Private Cloud (PvC) Base version 7.1.8 and Cloudera Manager
version 7.7.3. This release introduces several new features focused on
enterprise readiness, improved storage efficiency with Ozone, new
features for Impala, Hive performance improvements, Operations Database
rebase, Governance enhancements with HDFS/Schema Registry lineage,
Ranger RMS improvements and comprehensive enhancements to our streaming
platform.
The full list of new features is as follows:
Platform Support Enhancements


New OS Support

CDP Private Cloud Base now supports RHEL/OEL 8.6 for x86



New DB Support

CDP Private Cloud Base now supports Maria DB 10.6



General Feature Enhancements


Cloudera Manager


Better support for enterprise readiness with active-passive
High Availability


Cloudera Manager now provides the capability for HDFS Less
Clusters


Strong security with support for credential management with
secure Embedded/Vault and the option to enable and disable


Easier install and upgrade as user/group creation is
decoupled from applying permissions on parcels


Improved alerting capability with the ability to send alerts to different users based on severity


Easier operational capability eliminating SMON restarts when
metric filter has been changed




SDX Enhancements


Support for mapping Sentry Privileges to Ranger Policies
from CDH 5.x/6.x to CDP for Solr


Support for coarse URI checking in Hive Ranger Plugin provides significant performance gains for Hive URL locations with
large number of folders and files


New usersync config in Ranger provides a more simple and easier
way to maintain LDAP groups


Ranger Ozone integration plugin now supports recursive ACL check
for subpaths and to provide multi-tenant support


Atlas now supports tracking of HDFS lineage when data moves
from one directory in HDFS to another


Ranger RMS will now fully support grants at the DB level.
Grants provided at the hive db level and hdfs perms are now
propagated to the db dir, and all tables and partitions under
it.




Data Warehouse Enhancements


Impala can now read full ACID tables and can identify
and invalidate the catalog cache when an ACID table gets
compacted. This allows customers to use Hive ACID tables with
Impala provides better support for BI use cases


Impala now supports complex types with multiple UNNEST()s in the select list, arrays in select and view
list. This allows workloads to be transitioned from other
similar systems.


Impala now supports fine grained table refreshing at
partition level events for transactional tables which improves
performance. A new config incremental_refresh_acid is added,
which can switch on/off the fine-grained table refreshing


Impala now support improved self-event detection for
Events Processor thereby providing better consistency and
reliability for processing catalog changes


Impala now extends support for non-ASCII UTF-8 characters, and will return results in string functions such
as length that are consistent with Hive.


Impala will now support Kudu “ignore” operations like
INSERT_IGNORE, UPDATE_IGNORE, and DELETE_IGNORE to handle
cases where users want to ignore primary key errors thereby
providing better user experience.


Hive now provides better operations management with
rolling restart support for HMS during rolling upgrades


Hive now provides ACID improvements that include Hive
ACID compaction observability, Hive3/Acid MERGE INSERT MAPPING
on Hive 3 and additional fixes to improve operations like

Faster CREATE TABLE (no-rename CTAS)
Split update always & skip sorting insert rows
Speed up Drop Table / Drop Partition{}
Reduce HMS workload for ACID with improved read locks-
Faster Sequence numbers
Internal Table naming convention (TBL_ID or name)
Cleaner operations that eliminate single transaction locks



Kudu will now fully support transparent data encryption with integration with Ranger KMS


Kudu now allows the number of hash buckets per range
partition to be changed, both at table creation and alteration
time thereby increasing write throughput and performance




Self Service Analytics


Hue now supports Spark SQL and combined with the
autocomplete feature this now provides an easy interface for
executing Spark SQL


Hue provides a SQL interface to Phoenix making it easy to
query for operational insights


Hue now provides a native Query Processor that can index
and read Hive query history, this provide DAS features in Hue




Operational Database


HBase is rebased to 2.4.6 with support for replication of Meta region replicas, enhanced regions normalizers and
storefile tracking.


HBase now supports MCC (multi cluster client support)
which allows the switch between single HBase clusters and
Multi-HBase Client with limited code changes




Platform Enhancements


Platform now now supports Oracle 19c RAC for backend HA


Ozone now support balancer that easily allows the data to be equally distributed across all nodes


Ozone now supports atomic operations that allows easy
handling of nested directories and subdirectories thereby
greatly increasing the performance of deletes, moves and
renames.


Ozone now supports erasure coding provide better TCO and
at a minimum 1.3x storage space reduction


HDFS now adds support for running multiple standby NameNodes, which provides additional fault-tolerance


Ozone now integrates with CDP Replication Manager thereby providing replication and backup of data between Ozone -
Ozone clusters.


Ozone now supports S3 Multi-tenancy that allows
isolation of buckets and volumes for S3 use cases


Replication Manager now supports Hive ACID table replication capability for disaster recovery.


YARN compatibility enhancements

Dynamic Queue Scheduling feature enables customers to
dynamically change queue resource allocations





Streaming Enhancements


Kafka

Kafka upgraded to 3.X
Authentication against Kafka Brokers can now be done using
OAuth workflows that support backends such as OpenID Connect
Kafka rolling restarts can be done in multiple ways
designed to provide options to ensure continued cluster
operations by checking the health of the Broker after
restarting it: Forceful restart, Serving Requests, Min-ISR
meet, All Partitions Healthy



Streams Messaging Manager (SMM)

Consumer Group Offsets can be be changed in the SMM UI without need to go to the CLI
Multiple Replication Targets can now be seen in SMM
Replications tab
The amount of data returned in the Data Explorer has been
optimized to improve performance with large messages
Improved UI performance by optimizing partition
information and not auto loading metrics it all cases



Streams Replication Manager (SRM)

SRM can now collect metrics from multiple targets such
as bi-directional replications to b e displayed on the SMM
Replications Tab
SRM can perform a remote query to collect replication metrics from disjoint clusters which can be displayed on
the SMM Replications tab
Additional Metrics have been added to the SRM REST API



Schema Registry

JSON based Schemes are now available
Native Import/Export capabilities over REST API have been
added allowing for backup/restore actions and for Schema
Registries to be sync between environments utilizing
different backends
The ability to change the Schema Registry default compatibility to another option then Backwards is now
possible
Authentication to the Schema Registry can now be done using
OAuth workflows that support authentication backends
such as OpenID Connect
Topic Schemas can now be viewed directly in Atlas



Cruise Control

Cruise Control upgraded to version 2.5



KConnect

Stateless NiFi KConnector allowing for NiFi flows to be
run in KConnect
KConnect Enterprise Security enhancements for
Authorization, Authentication, Secure Secrets Storage, and
Ranger integration
New KConnectors
CDC Debezium KConnectors for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server,
DB2, and Oracle
