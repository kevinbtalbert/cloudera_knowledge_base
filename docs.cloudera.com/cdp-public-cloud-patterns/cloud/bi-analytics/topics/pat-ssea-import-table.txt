Importing the passenger data
Use Hue to import data which is not present in your data warehouse, but is available
        on your computer or cloud storage such as Amazon S3.

In this exercise, the passenger data is not already available in Hue or in CDP but
                instead is available on your computer in a CSV file. Import the passenger data into
                Hue from your computer as follows:


Go to Importer and click .. at
                    the end of the Path field.





A pop-up window is dispalyed where you can choose a file.


Type s3a:// in the address text box and press
                    enter.
The S3 buckets associated with the CDW environment are displayed. You can
                    narrow down the list of results using the search option.






Navigate to the bucket in which you want to upload the file and click
                        Upload a file.

Select the CSV file that you want to import into Hue.
Hue displays the preview of the table along with the format.
Hue automatically detects the field separator, record separator, and the quote
                    character from the CSV file. If you want to override a specific setting, select
                    a different value from the drop-down list.






Click Next.
On this page under DESTINATION, enter
                        airline_ontime_orc.unique_tickets in the
                        Name field.
The unique_tickets table is created in the
                        airline_ontime_orc database.

Select Format as Text.

Expand Extras and select the Store in Default
                        location option.






Change all the “bigint” column types to “int”
                    under FIELDS and click
                    Submit.
The CREATE TABLE query is triggered.





Hue displays the logs and opens the Table Browser from
                    which you can view the newly created table when the operation completes
                    successfully.






Run the following query to find passengers with international connecting
                    flights:

-- Query to explore passenger manifest data:  do we have international connecting flights?
SELECT 
*
FROM 
   `airline_ontime_orc`.unique_tickets a, 
   `airline_ontime_orc`.flights o, 
   `airline_ontime_orc`.flights d,
   `airline_ontime_orc`.airports oa, 
   `airline_ontime_orc`.airports da  
WHERE
   a.leg1flightnum = o.flightnum
   AND a.leg1uniquecarrier = o.uniquecarrier 
   AND a.leg1origin = o.origin 
   AND a.leg1dest = o.dest 
   AND a.leg1month = o.month 
   AND a.leg1dayofmonth = o.dayofmonth
   AND a.leg1dayofweek = o.`dayofweek` 
   AND a.leg2flightnum = d.flightnum
   AND a.leg2uniquecarrier = d.uniquecarrier 
   AND a.leg2origin = d.origin 
   AND a.leg2dest = d.dest 
   AND a.leg2month = d.month 
   AND a.leg2dayofmonth = d.dayofmonth
   AND a.leg2dayofweek = d.`dayofweek` 
   AND d.origin = oa.iata 
   AND d.dest = da.iata 
   AND oa.country <> da.country 
;
