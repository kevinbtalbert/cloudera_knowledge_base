Adding a ReadyFlow to the Catalog
ReadyFlows are out-of-the-box flow definitions designed to help you get started with
        Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) quickly and easyily. For the Business Intelligence at Scale pattern,
        select the "Kafka to S3 Avro" ReadyFlow definition.

To get started with the data ingest portion of your Business Intelligence at Scale
                pattern, start by adding the necessary data flows to your CDF Catalog. You must add
                a custom NiFi data flow (in JSON format) which is available in your pattern
                artifacts downloads package, and the Kafka to S3 Avro
                ReadyFlow to your CDF Catalog. The custom NiFi data flow moves data from your
                streaming data source into the Kafka topics that you have created. The
                    Kafka to S3 Avro ReadyFlow moves data from Kafka into an
                AWS S3 bucket so that it can be consumed by Cloudera Data Engineering.
