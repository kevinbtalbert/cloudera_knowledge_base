Adding schemas to the Schema Registry
Learn how to add new schemas to Schema Registry so that you ensure data consistency
        across your data pipeline.

Schema Registry provides a shared repository for your schemas to ensure
                that your data is accessible across the data pipeline. For the Business Intelligence
                at Scale Pattern, you must create the following two schemas using the Schema
                Regisrty files that you downloaded as part of the pattern artifacts:

WeatherCurrent
WeatherForecast



importantYou must have the EnvironmentAdmin role to
                perform this task.
noteEnsure that you understand compatibility policies. Once selected,
                you cannot change the compatibility policy for a schema.


Log in to the CDP web interface.

Go to Management Console > Data Hub Clusters and select the CMM cluster that you created earlier.

Click Schema Registry under the
                        Services section.

                            Business Intelligence at Scale pattern.

                                provider if you are trying the Business Intelligence at
                            Scale pattern.

To allow schema to evolve over time by creating multiple versions, select the
                        Evolve option.

                        only have one version of the schema.

                    the pattern artifacts by clicking Browse in the
                        SCHEMA TEXT area.
