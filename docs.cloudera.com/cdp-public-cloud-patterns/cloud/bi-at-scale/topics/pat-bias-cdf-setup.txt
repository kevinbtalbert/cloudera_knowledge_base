Setting up the Cloudera DataFlow service
In the Business Intelligence at Scale pattern, Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) provides basic
  flow development and streaming data flow organization and management capabilities.
To set up a CDF cluster, a user with the
        PowerUser
      role must first grant you the DFAdmin role. You can then enable the CDF
      service in your CDP environment.
noteEnabling CDF can take upto one hour.
For the Business Intelligence at Scale pattern, you will be using the "Kafka to Avro S3"
      ReadyFlow flow definition.
For more information about the CDF service, see the Cloudera DataFlow
    documentation.
