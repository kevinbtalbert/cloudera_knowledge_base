Giving access to Data Warehouse users
A "PowerUser" must grant "DWAdmin" and "DWUser" roles to users and groups so that
        they can activate the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service, create Database Catalogs and
        Virtual Warehouses, and manage Hue and other applications within CDW.

importantYou must have a PowerUser role to perform this
                task.


Log in to the CDP web interface.

Go to Management Console > Environments and select your CDP environment.

Go to Actions > Manage Access.
The Environment Access page is displayed.

Find the user or group using Search and click
                        Update Roles.

Select the DWAdmin and DWUser
                    options and click Update Roles.

noteWhen you grant access to groups, you must grant the
                        DWAdmin resource role to the group instead of the
                        DWUser role.


Go to the Environments page.

Click Actions > Synchronize Users to FreeIPA.
Depending on how many users have access to the environment, this
                    synchronization process can take a few seconds or a few minutes.
