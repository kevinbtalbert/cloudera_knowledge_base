Giving access to Data Engineering users
Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) restricts access to importing and running Spark jobs.
        An "EnvironmentAdmin" must grant both "DEUser" and "EnvironmentUser" roles to users so that
        they can run Spark jobs in CDE and access the Data Hub clusters for data
        engineering.

importantYou must have an EnvironmentAdmin role to
                perform this task.


Log in to the CDP web interface.

Go to Management Console > Environments.

Select the environment in which you want a user or group to import and run
                    Spark jobs.

Go to Actions > Manage Access.
The Environment Access page is displayed.

Find the user or group using Search and click
                        Update Roles.

Select the DEUser and
                        EnvironmentUser options and click Update
                        Roles.

Go to the Environments page.

Click Actions > Synchronize Users to FreeIPA.
Depending on how many users have access to the environment, this
                    synchronization process can take a few seconds or a few minutes.
