Creating a virtual cluster
In Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE), a virtual cluster is an individual auto-scaling
        cluster with defined CPU and memory ranges. Jobs are associated with virtual clusters, and
        virtual clusters are associated with an environment. You can create as many virtual clusters
        as you need.

importantYou must have the DEAdmin role to perform this
                task.


From the CDE Overview page, select the CDE service that
                    you created earlier.

In the Virtual Clusters column, click  to create a new virtual cluster.
If the environment has no virtual clusters associated with it, the page
                    displays a Create DE Cluster option that launches the
                    same wizard.

On the Create a Cluster page, enter a Cluster
                        Name.
Cluster names must:
begin with a letter
be between 3 and 30 characters (inclusive)
contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens


Select the CDE Service that you created earlier from the
                        CDE Service drop-down menu.
The CDE service you selected before launching the wizard is selected by
                    default, but you can use the wizard to create a virtual cluster in a different
                    CDE service.

Accept the default settings for the Autoscale Max
                        Capacity.

Select Spark 2.4.7 as the Spark
                        Version to use in the virtual cluster.
You cannot use Spark 2 and Spark 3 in the same virtual cluster, but you can
                    have separate Spark 2 and Spark 3 virtual clusters within the same CDE
                    service.

Click Create.

On the CDE Overview page, select the
            environment to view the virtual cluster initialization status. You can also click  for the virtual cluster to view the logs.
