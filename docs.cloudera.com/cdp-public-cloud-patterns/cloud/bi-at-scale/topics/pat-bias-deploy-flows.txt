Deploying the NiFi flowsCloudera Docs
Deploying the NiFi flows
Learn about the steps to deploy flows (custom flow definitions or ReadyFlows) so that
        you can start running your NiFi flows with Cloudera DataFlow. 

importantYou must have the DFFlowAdmin role to perform
                this task.


Now that you have imported the custom NiFi flow definition and added the ReadyFlow to
                the catalog you may proceed by deploying your Business Intelligence at Scale data
                flows. You must deploy the following three flows:

weather_forecast_to_kafka: This flow gets both current and
                    forecast weather data and sends it to the corresponding Kafka topics.
Current_Weather_Data_To_S3: This deployment moves current
                    weather data from the Kafka topic into an S3 bucket.
Forecast_Weather_Data_To_S3: This deployment moves forecast
                    weather data from the Kafka topic into an S3 bucket.



Log in to the CDP web interface.

To create the custom flow deployment "weather_forecast_to_kafka", perform the
                    following steps:


Go to DataFlow > Catalog and click the "Kafka to S3 Avro" ReadyFlow definition
                            that you added earlier.
The version information about the flow is displayed.


Click Deploy →.

                                Continue.


Provide a unique name to your deployment on the
                                Overview page.
For the Business Intelligence at Scale pattern, specify
                                weather_forecast_to_kafka.

Optional: 
In KPIs, identify key performance indicators,
                            the metrics to track those KPIs, and when and how to receive alerts
                            about the KPI metrics tracking.

tipYou can reorder the KPIs by dragging them up or down
                                the list. The order you configure here is reflected in the detailed
                                monitoring view of the resulting deployment.

                            pattern.

For production use cases, you can specify your initial flow deployment
                            size, whether to enable auto-scaling, and up to how many nodes you want
                            in your cluster.

noteFlow deployments scale horizontally by adding or removing NiFi
                                nodes to a deployment. Deployments do not scale vertically, and the
                                node size cannot be changed.

weather_forecast_to_kafka
