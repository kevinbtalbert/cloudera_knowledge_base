Giving access to DataFlow users
Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) restricts who can import flow definitions and deploy them. A
        "PowerUser" must grant "DFAdmin", "DFFlowAdmin", and "DFCatalogAdmin" roles to users so that
        they can enable CDF for an environment, import, add, and deploy flow definitions in CDF. 


The DFAdmin role is required to enable CDF for an
                    environment.
The DFFlowAdmin role is required deploy flow definitions in
                    CDF.
The DFCatalogAdmin role is required to import flow definitions
                    to the CDF Catalog.



importantYou must have a PowerUser role to perform this
                task.
Cloudera recommends that you create a dedicated machine user as a CDP Workload User
                for CDF. Make sure to set the Workload Password. You need the
                workload username and password for deploying NiFi flows.
noteWhen you create a machine user, then a prefix, "srv", is automatically added to
                the machine user name. For example, if you create a machine user as
                "machine-user-1", then the Workload User Name reads
                "srv_machine-user-1".
You must also assign the EnvironmentUser role to this machine user
                within your environment.

Select the environment to which you want a user or group to deploy flow
                            definitions. 


Go to Actions > Manage Access.
The Environment Access page is displayed.


Find the user or group and click Update
                            Roles.


Select DFFlowAdmin and click Update
                                Roles.



To give a user the permission to import flow definitions:


Go to Management Console > User Management.
