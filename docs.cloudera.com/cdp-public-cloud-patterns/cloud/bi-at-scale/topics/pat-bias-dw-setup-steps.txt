Setting up Cloudera Data Warehouse
In the Business Intelligence at Scale pattern, Data Warehouse provides ad-hoc data
  analytics capabilities and the Data Visualization integration provides visual reporting and
  dashboarding capabilities. To set up the CDW service, you must activate an environment and create
  an Impala Virtual Warehouse with the Unified Analytics and Data Visualization options enabled. You
  can use the default Database Catalog that is created when you activate an environment.
For more information about the Cloudera Data Warehouse service, see the Data Warehouse
    Overview.
