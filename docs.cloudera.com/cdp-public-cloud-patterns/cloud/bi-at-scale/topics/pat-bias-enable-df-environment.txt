Enabling DataFlow for an environment
To deploy flow definitions, you must enable Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) for a CDP Public
        Cloud environment. Enabling CDF for an environment means that you are preparing an active
        and healthy CDP environment for use with CDF.

importantYou must have the DFAdmin role to perform this
                task.


Log in to the CDP web interface and click on the
                        DataFlow service.

Go to Environments and click
                        Enable against the environment you want to enable. 

On the Enable Environment page:


Specify the minimum and maximum number of the Kubernetes nodes you want
                            to deploy in the DataFlow Capacity section.
Under the Networking section, select the subnet
                            from the Available Subnets that CDF can use for
                            worker node and load balancer placement.If you want to access CDF
                                components from the internet, select the Enable public
                                    endpoint option. importantTo
                                specify a public endpoint, you must have at least one public subnet
                                in your environment.
