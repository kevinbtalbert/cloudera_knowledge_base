  Scale
The Business Intelligence (BI) at Scale pattern helps you to build and implement a
  sustainable BI solution using the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) and various data services using
  which you can ingest, stream, explore, optimize, and analyze real-time and enterprise data, and
  then visualize the results to drive business insights.
  
noteThe Business Intelligence at Scale pattern is in Technical Preview and is not recommended
   for production use. Cloudera recommends that you try this pattern in your development or test
   environments.
The Business Intelligence at Scale pattern provides prescriptive steps to help you use the
   Cloudera data pipeline to stream data from a Streams Messaging cluster in CDP Public Cloud to AWS
   buckets. You can use Cloudera Data Engineering to organize and convert your data, and make the
   data available to Cloudera Data Warehouse for queries and analysis. Finally, you can use Cloudera
   Data Visualization tools to create consumable visualizations and dashboards.
