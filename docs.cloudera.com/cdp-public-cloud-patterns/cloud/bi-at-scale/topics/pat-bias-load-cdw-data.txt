About adding data to Data Warehouse
To run queries and understand the correlation between the historical sales and
        historical weather data, you must make this data available in Cloudera Data Warehouse
        tables.
In a real-world scenario, the historical sales data and weather data could be available
            in your CDP Data Lake. For the Business Intelligence at Scale pattern, you can download
            the sample historical sales and weather data set provided by Cloudera from your Business
            Intelligence at Scale download package on your computer and then upload it into your S3
            bucket in individual folders. These two packages contain historical data in Parquet
            format.
You will fetch this data in Hue directly by specifying the complete path of the S3
            directory in the LOCATION clause of a query.
importantYou must have access to the S3 bucket to perform this task.
