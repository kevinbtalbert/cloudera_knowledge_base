Creating and assiging Ranger policies
Apart from assigning resource roles to users, you need to set up Ranger policies to
        authorize users (service, machine, or workload users) to perform specific operations and
        rights to certain resources. Learn which Ranger policies you need for the Business
        Intelligence at Scale pattern and how to create them.

importantYou must have the EnvironmentUser role to
                perform this task.Ensure that you have a list of machine users and workload users
                    you want to add to the specific Ranger policies.

The following table lists the CDP components for which you
            need to set up resource-based Ranger policies:

CDP component
Resource-based Ranger policy
Purpose



Kafka (Streams Messaging)
Kafka
Allow the machine user to publish, configure, and consume Kafka
                                topics.


Kafka
Allow the machine user to consume the Consumer Group IDs.


Schema Registry (Streams Messaging)
Schema-Registry
Allow the machine user to read schema groups from the Schema
                                Registry.


Hue (Cloudera Data Warehouse)
Hadoop SQL
Allow the workload user to perform all database, table, and
                                column operations such as select, update, alter, create, drop,
                                insert, read, and write.

noteA set of default policies are automatically created for your deployment.
                You must create a new policy within your main deployment policy.

Log in to the CDP web interface.

Go to Management Console > Environmentsand click on Ranger.
