Setting up the streaming data source
For the Business Intelligence at Scale pattern, you need to stream weather data from
        an external data provider into CDP. To obtain data from OpenWeather, you must sign up for an
        account with them and generate API keys.

Go to https://openweathermap.org/api and create your account.

Go to your profile and click My API keys.

Specify an API key name and click Generate.
A new API key is created. You will need this while deploying flows in CDF.
