Creating a Streams Messaging cluster
Learn how to create a Streams Messaging cluster for the Business Intelligence at
        Scale pattern. A Data Hub cluster with the Streams Messaging cluster definition hosts the
        Kafka topics into which you capture real-time streaming data. For this example, you are
        importing the weather data.

importantYou must have an EnvironmentAdmin role to
                perform this task.

For the Business Intelligence at Scale pattern proof of
            concept, use the Streams Messaging Light Duty template for AWS. When you are ready to
            move your data pipeline to production, you can use either a Light or Heavy duty
            template, depending on your use case. For this pattern, use the default cluster
            definition.
