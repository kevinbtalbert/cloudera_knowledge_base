Adding a ReadyFlow to the CatalogReadyFlows are out-of-the-box flow definitions designed to help you get started with         Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) quickly and easyily. For the Business Intelligence at Scale pattern,         select the "Kafka to S3 Avro" ReadyFlow definition.Importing the custom NiFi flow definitionBefore you can deploy a flow, you must import a flow definition that contains the         data flow logic you want to deploy to a Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) environment.Collecting configuration information for ReadyFlowLearn how to collect the information you need to configure the "Kafka to S3 Avro"   ReadyFlow.Deploying the NiFi flowsLearn about the steps to deploy flows (custom flow definitions or ReadyFlows) so that         you can start running your NiFi flows with Cloudera DataFlow.
