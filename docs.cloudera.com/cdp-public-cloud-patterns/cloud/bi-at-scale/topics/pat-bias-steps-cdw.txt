Analyzing data and visualizing results using Cloudera Data Warehouse
To run queries and draw insights, you must add data to the Data Warehouse, create
  materialized view, create tables to generate reports and dashboards in Cloudera Data
  Visualization, and render and share dashboards from Cloudera Data Visualization with your
  stakeholders.
About adding data to Data WarehouseTo run queries and understand the correlation between the historical sales and         historical weather data, you must make this data available in Cloudera Data Warehouse         tables.Creating tables and inserting dataAfter making the sales and weather data available in S3, you first create external         tables, insert data into them, and then create managed tables using the external         tables.Creating a materialized viewAfter creating managed tables and inserting the data, you can join the tables using a         materialized view. You run the query, and the optimizer takes advantage of the         precomputation performed by the materialized view for a faster response time.Creating a Data Visualization dashboard by importing visual artifactsTo visualize the correlation and share the insights with your stakeholders, you can         manually create a dashboard in Cloudera Data Visualization (CDV) or use a visual artifact in         the form of a JSON file and import it in CDV.Parent topic: Business Intelligence at Scale steps
