  case
Learn how the Business Intelligence at Scale pattern empowers Ingest developers, Data
  engineers, Data Analysts, and Business stakeholders by using various Cloudera data services such
  as Streams Messaging Manager, DataFlow, Data Engineering, Data Warehouse, and Data
  Visualisation.
Business Intelligence at Scale is a common design pattern that you can implement in situations
   where business groups need insight from both enterprise and streaming data to make timely
   decisions. A traditional analytics solution would struggle with ingesting streaming data due to
   the technical challenges or experience needed in setting up a streaming ingest. This pattern
   guides Ingest Engineers to easily ingest streaming data, Data Engineers to model and curate data,
   and Business Analysts or Data Scientists to analyze, visualize, and share insights through an
   integrated self-service experience.
The objective is to allow business stake holders to quickly analyze all the data by using the
   integrated data lifecycle tools built into CDP. This service offers a smooth user experience for
   line of business decision makers to get answers to common questions through ready to use reports
   and dashboards, and an enhanced exploratory experience to line of business data analysts and
   power users to scrutinize data by building pipelines and querying the data sets.
Key problem this pattern solves
Customers can be more agile and better informed when making business decisions or creating
    ad-hoc reports based on new data as it arrives and becomes available.

Cloudera data lifecycle components
Business Intelligence at Scale pattern uses:
Cloudera's Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) to ingest external (non-enterprise) data by
      creating Kafka topics
Cloudera DataFlow Experience to convert and upload data to Amazon S3 (or any Cloud object
      store) in Avro format
Cloudera Data Engineering service to transform data into ORC or Parquet format using Spark
      jobs
Cloudera Data Warehouse service to create tables and materialized views from the datasets,
      run queries, and ad-hoc exploratory analysis
Cloudera Data Visualization to create reports and dashboards




Using these Cloudera services:
Ingest developers can quickly develop data flows for real-time data and merge incoming data
      with existing data sets
Data engineers can transform, organize, and enrich data
Data Analysts and Data Scientists can query the data sets using Hue
Business stakeholders can derive insights using visualizations and dashboards
