Giving access to users and groups
To access and use the CDP Data Services, you must have the required roles and
  permissions. Learn about the various roles that users need to perform specific tasks within the
  Business Intelligence at Scale pattern.
The following graphic shows the roles required to set up and access various CDP services with
   this pattern and who must grant those roles:


tipIf more than one user needs a certain role or permission to work with a CDP
   service, Cloudera recommends that you add those users into a group and grant a role or permission
   to that group.
