Exploratory Data Science
The Exploratory Data Science pattern shows you how a data scientist or other data
  practitioners can kickstart a data science project. In this pattern, you discover the data
  available in your CDP environment, explore that data using SQL queries, and then set up some data
  visualizations to better understand the data â€” all of this from within the Cloudera Machine
  Learning (CML) interface.



We will show you how easy it is to find and explore data in CML.
