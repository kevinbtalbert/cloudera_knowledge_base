AWS quickstart
If you've reached the CDP landing page for the first time, you've come to the right
    place! In this quickstart, we'll show you step-by-step how to connect CDP to your AWS account,
    so that you can begin to provision clusters and workloads.

To complete this quickstart, you'll need access to two things:
The CDP console pictured above
The AWS console

noteThis AWS onboarding quickstart is intended for simple CDP evaluation deployments only. It
      may not work for scenarios where AWS resources such as VPC, security group, storage accounts,
      and so on, are pre-created or AWS accounts have restrictions in place.
The steps that we will perform are:
Step 0: Verify the AWS prerequisites
Step 1: Create a provisioning credential 
Step 2: Register an AWS environment in CDP 


Verify AWS cloud platform prerequisites
Before getting started with the AWS onboarding quickstart, review and acknowledge the
        following:

This AWS onboarding quickstart is intended for simple CDP evaluation deployments
                only. It may not work for scenarios where AWS resources such as VPC, security group,
                storage accounts, and so on, are pre-created or AWS accounts have restrictions in
                place.
Users running the AWS onboarding quickstart should have:
AWS Administrator permissions on the AWS account that you would like to use
                        for CDP.
Rights to create AWS resources required by CDP. See list of AWS resources used by CDP.
CDP Admin role or Power User role in CDP subscription.

This AWS onboarding quickstart uses a CloudFormation template that automatically
                creates the required resources such as buckets, IAM roles and policies, and so
                on.
CDP Public Cloud relies on several AWS services that should be available and
     enabled in your region of choice. Verify if you have enough quota for each AWS service to set
     up CDP in your AWS account. See list of AWS resources used by CDP.

If you have more complex requirements than those listed here, contact Cloudera Sales
   Team to help you with the CDP onboarding.


Create a CDP credential
In the CDP console, the first step is to create a CDP credential. The CDP credential is
    the mechanism that allows CDP to create resources inside of your cloud account.

Log in to the CDP web interface.

From the CDP home screen, click the Management Console
          icon.

In the Management Console, select Shared Resources > Credentials from the
          navigation pane. 

Click Create Credential.
Click the Copy icon to the right of the Create
        Cross-account Access Policy text box.In a second browser tab, open the AWS Console and navigate to
              Identity and Access
              Management > Policies. Click
            Create Policy.


Click on the JSON tab and paste the access policy in the text box.
You may get a warning related to using wildcards. You may ignore it and proceed to the
          next step.

Click Next: Tags.
Click Review Policy.Give the policy a unique name and a description. Click Create Policy.Next, you create the
          required cross-account role.In the AWS console, navigate back to Identity and Access
            Management.Click Roles > Create
            Role.Under Select type of trusted entity, select Another
            AWS account.Return to the CDP Management Console and copy the contents of the
            Service Manager Account ID field on the
            Credentials page.In the AWS console, paste the Service Manager Account ID into the
            Account ID field.Return to the CDP Management Console and copy the contents of the
            External ID field on the Credentials
          page.
In the AWS console, check the "Require external ID" options box, and then paste the
          External ID copied from CDP into the External ID field.

Click Next: Permissions.

Under Permissions, select the checkbox next to the name of the
            policy that you created in Step 8.
Click Next: Tags.Click Next: Review.Give the role a unique name and description, then click Create
            Role.Still in the role page of the AWS console, search for the role you just created,
          and click on it.Copy the Role ARN at the top of the
            Summary page.

Return to the Credentials page in the CDP Management
          Console.Give the CDP credential a name and description. The name can be any valid
          name.Paste the Role ARN that you copied from the AWS console into the
            Cross-account Role ARN field, then click Create.

Now that you've created a cross-account role, proceed to creating a CDP
          environment.


Register a CDP environment
Before you register an environment, you'll want to create specific IAM roles and
        policies so that CDP can operate in a secure manner. 
For background information, a description of what we're
            building and why can found here. For this quickstart, we'll use
            CloudFormation to set all of this up for you.

Download the CloudFormation provided template here.

In the AWS console, deploy the CloudFormation template:


In AWS Services, search for
                                CloudFormation.


Click Create Stack and select With
                                    new resources (standard).


Select Template is ready and then
                                Upload a template file.







Click Choose file and select the CloudFormation
                            template that you downloaded.


Click Next.


Under Stack name, enter a stack name. The name can be any valid
                            name.


Under Parameters, complete the following
                            fields:



BackupLocationBase: Choose an unused bucket name and
                                        path for the FreeIPA backups. CDP will be creating the
                                        bucket for you. The same bucket can be used for
                                        BackupLocationBase, LogsLocationBase, and
                                        StorageLocationBase. By default this is set to
                                            my-bucket/my-backups.
CrossAccountARN: Do not change the default value.
                                        This parameter is only required when encryption is enabled,
                                        but since in this quickstart we do not enable encryption,
                                        you should leave this value as is.
LogsLocationBase: Choose an unused bucket name and
                                        path for the logs. CDP will be creating the bucket for you.
                                        The same bucket can be used for BackupLocationBase,
                                        LogsLocationBase, and StorageLocationBase. By default this
                                        is set to my-bucket/my-logs.
StorageLocationBase: Choose an unused bucket name and
                                        path for the data. CDP will be creating the bucket for you.
                                        The same bucket can be used for BackupLocationBase,
                                        LogsLocationBase, and StorageLocationBase. By default this
                                        is set to my-bucket/my-data.
Prefix: A short prefix of your
                                        choosing, which will be added to the names of the IAM
                                        resources CDP will be creating. We chose  "cloudera" as an
                                        example.
s3KmsEncryption: Encryption will be disabled for the
                                        created bucket. You don't need to change this value.


For example:





Make a note of the BackupLocationBase, LogsLocationBase,
                                StorageLocationBase, and Prefix that you define. You will need them
                                later.



Click Next.


At the Configure Stack Options page, click
                                Next.


At the bottom of the Review page, under
                            Capabilities, click the checkbox next to I acknowledge that
                                AWS Cloudformation might create IAM resources with custom
                                names, as that is exactly what we will be doing.







Click Submit.


Still in the AWS console, create an SSH key in the region of your choice. If there
          is already an SSH key in your preferred region that you'd like to use, you can skip these
          steps.
In AWS Services, search for
              EC2.
In the top right corner, verify that you are in your preferred
            region.
On the left hand navigation bar, choose Key
              Pairs.
On the top right of the screen, select Create Key
                Pair.

                                StorageLocationBase from the cloud formation template.
For Data Access Role, choose
                                prefix-datalake-admin-role. 
For Ranger Audit Role, choose
                                prefix-ranger-audit-role, where "prefix" is
                            the prefix you defined in the Parameters section of
                            the stack details in AWS. 

For example: 





For Data Lake Scale, choose Light
                        Duty. 

Click Next.

Under Select Region, choose your desired region. This should be the same
                    region you created an SSH key in previously.

Under Select Network, choose Create New
                        Network.
Create private subnets should be enabled by default. If it isn't, enable
                    it. 

note
By enabling private subnets you will not have SSH access to cluster nodes
                            unless you have access to the VPC. 



Click the toggle button to enable Enable Public Endpoint Access
