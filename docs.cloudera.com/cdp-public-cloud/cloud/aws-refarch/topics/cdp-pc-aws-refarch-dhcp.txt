DHCP option set
This topic covers recommended DHCP Option Set configurations for CDP Public Cloud for
  AWS.


Ensure the DHCP Option Set has the DNS Server set to AmazonProvidedDNS. This is
     required for EFS (see Mounting on Amazon EC2 with a DNS name) and EKS (see
      Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access control). 
Customers may choose to use their own DNS servers from their corporate network in
     the DHCP option set. However, the DNS servers need to be configured to conditionally forward
     DNS queries for the Amazon subdomains to Amazon Provided DNS resolver in the VPC. This also
     helps ensure the CDP connectivity to AWS services. If the CDP data services do not allow
     activation with the custom DNS servers, please contact Cloudera support to get the relevant
     entitlements added.
Ensure the DHCP Option Set associated with the VPC has only one domain and it is
     recommended that it remains default.
