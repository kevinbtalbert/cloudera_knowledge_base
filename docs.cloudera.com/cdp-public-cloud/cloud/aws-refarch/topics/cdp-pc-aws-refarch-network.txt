Network architecture
Cloudera recommends that customers configure their cloud networks as fully private
   networks, as described in this chapter. This will help on-boarding CDP Data Lakes, Data Hubs,
  and data services smoothly. 

noteThis network architecture only covers the fully private networks and assumes
    unrestricted outbound access.

The cdpctl tool, which is released along with this document can be used to
   automatically set up a model of this reference architecture, which can then be reviewed for
   security and compliance purposes.

Architecture diagramsThis topic includes diagrams illustrating the various elements of the network   architecture in the customerâ€™s cloud account into which CDP environments with Data Lakes, Data   Hubs, and data services will be launched.
