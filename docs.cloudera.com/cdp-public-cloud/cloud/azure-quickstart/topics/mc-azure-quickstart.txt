Azure quickstart
If you've reached the CDP landing page for the first time, you've come to the right
    place! In this quickstart, we'll show you step-by-step how to connect CDP to your Azure
    subscription, so that you can begin to provision clusters and workloads.

To complete this quickstart, you'll need access to three things:
The CDP console pictured above
The Azure console
Azure Cloud shell

noteThis Azure onboarding quickstart is intended for simple CDP evaluation deployments only.
      It may not work for scenarios where Azure resources such as VNet, security group, storage
      accounts, and so on, are pre-created or Azure accounts have restrictions in place.
In addition to this documentation, you can refer to the following video:
        


The steps that we will perform are:
Step 0: Verify the Azure prerequisites
Step 1: Create an Azure AD app
Step 2: Deploy the Azure quickstart template 
Step 3: Assign roles
Step 4: Create or locate an SSH key 
Step 5: Create a CDP credential
Step 6: Register a CDP environment 


Verify Azure cloud platform prerequisites
Before getting started with the Azure onboarding quickstart, review and acknowledge the
  following:

This Azure onboarding quickstart is intended for simple CDP evaluation deployments
    only. It may not work for scenarios where Azure resources such as VNet, security group, storage
    accounts, and so on, are pre-created or Azure accounts have restrictions in place.
User running the Azure onboarding quickstart should have:
Owner permissions on the Azure subscription that you would like to use for CDP. 
Rights to create Azure resources required by CDP. See list of Azure resources used by CDP.
Rights to create an Azure AD application (service principal) and assign Contributor role at
      subscription level.
CDP Admin role or Power User role in CDP subscription.

This Azure onboarding quickstart uses an Azure ARM template that automatically
    creates the required resources such as storage accounts, containers, managed identities,
    resource groups, and so on.
CDP Public Cloud relies on several Azure services that should be available
    and enabled in your region of choice. Verify if you have enough quota for each Azure
    service to set up CDP in your Azure account. See list of  Azure resources used by CDP.

If you have more complex requirements than those listed here, contact Cloudera Sales
   Team to help you with CDP onboarding.


Create an Azure AD app
In the Azure portal, create an application in your Azure Active Directory tenant. This
    steps allows you to use the native Cloud Shell terminal and not have to set up Azure
    CLI.

Log in to the Azure portal and launch Cloud Shell.


When prompted, select Bash to use Bash shell. 
Run the following command to return the subscription ID and tenant ID:
az account list|jq '.[]|{"name": .name, "subscriptionId": .id, "tenantId": .tenantId, "state": .state}'
The output of this command is shown below:

Make a note of the subscriptionId and
              tenantId values. You will need them later.

noteIn case you have more than one subscription, make sure to only make a note of the
              subscription that you would like to use for CDP.

Run the command below to create an app in Azure AD and assign the "Contributor"
          role at the subscription.
noteReplace {subscriptionId} in the command with the subscription
            ID value from the previous step.
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name http://cloudbreak-app --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}
The output of this command is shown below:




Deploy the Azure quickstart template
The Azure quickstart template is a customized ARM template that deploys essential
        Azure resources for the CDP environment.

Click Deploy to Azure to begin ARM template
                    deployment of CDP prerequisites in your Azure subscription.
Log in to Azure to create the resources in your subscription that are required
                    for CDP deployment. These resources include VNet, ADLS Gen2, and 4 user managed
                    identities.

On the Custom deployment screen, click Create
                        new under the Resource group field and then
                    give the resource group a name (it should only contain letters, numbers, and
                    hyphens).

Under Settings, provide an Environment Name in the
                    corresponding field. 





Accept the terms and conditions, and click
          Purchase.An ARM script begins to run in the background,
          creating the resources required for a CDP environment. This may take around 10
          minutes.When your resource group is up, navigate to the Overview page
          of the resource group.Copy and paste the following values into a note, as you will need them in the next
          task: 

Subscription ID: Your subscription ID is found at the top of the resource
                            group Overview page.
Resource group: The name of the resource group that you created.





Assign roles
Azure Resource Manager templates do not support role assignments at a scope other
    than resource groups. Perform the following role assignments through UI or CLI.
Make sure that you have your note from the previous step, where you copied values
      for the Subscription ID and resource group name.

Once you have values for the subscription ID, resource group name, storage account,
          environment name, and all four managed identities, click here to download a script.
Create a new file in Cloud Shell with the same name, and copy the content of the script
        there.
Replace the following values in the script with the values you have collected thus
          far:






For example, your script should look similar to this:
#!/bin/sh

export SUBSCRIPTIONID="jfs85ls8-sik8-8329-fq0m-jqo7v06dk6sy"
export RESOURCEGROUPNAME="myCDPresourcegroup"
export STORAGEACCOUNTNAME=$(az storage account list -g $RESOURCEGROUPNAME --subscription $SUBSCRIPTIONID|jq '.[]|.name'| tr -d '"')
export ASSUMER_OBJECTID=$(az identity list -g $RESOURCEGROUPNAME --subscription $SUBSCRIPTIONID|jq '.[]|{"name":.name,"principalId":.principalId}|select(.name | test("AssumerIdentity"))|.principalId'| tr -d '"')

export LOGGER_OBJECTID=$(az identity list -g $RESOURCEGROUPNAME --subscription $SUBSCRIPTIONID|jq '.[]|{"name":.name,"principalId":.principalId}|select(.name | test("LoggerIdentity"))|.principalId'| tr -d '"')
export RANGER_OBJECTID=$(az identity list -g $RESOURCEGROUPNAME --subscription $SUBSCRIPTIONID|jq '.[]|{"name":.name,"principalId":.principalId}|select(.name | test("RangerIdentity"))|.principalId'| tr -d '"')

Run the Cloud Shell script: sh
        azure_msi_role_assign.sh


Create or locate an SSH Key
CDP requires that you provide a public SSH key for admin access to VM
    instances.
You can find more information on SSH key requirement in the topic SSH key. If you need to create one, you can do
            so by running ssh-keygen -t rsa.
When you complete this step, you have created all of the Azure resources required for this
         quickstart.


Create a CDP credential
In the CDP Console, the first step is to create a CDP credential. The CDP credential
    is the mechanism that allows CDP to create resources inside of your cloud account.

Log in to the CDP web interface.
From the CDP home screen, click the Management Console
          icon.
In the Management Console, select Shared Resources > Credentials from
                    the navigation pane. 
Select the Azure tab, name your credential, and enter the values you previously
          collected for subscription ID, app ID, and password.




Register a CDP environment
When you register an environment, you set properties related to data lake scaling,
    networking, security, and storage. You will need your Azure environment name, resource group
    name, storage account name, and virtual network name from your resource group.

In the CDP Management Console, navigate to Environments and
          click Register Environment.
Provide an Environment Name and description. The name can be any valid
                    name.

Choose Azure as the cloud provider.
Under Microsoft Azure Credential, choose the credential you
          created in the previous task.

Click Next.Under Data Lake Settings, give your new data lake a name. The
          name can be any valid name. Choose the latest data lake version.
Under Data Access and Audit, choose the following:


Assumer Identity:
                                <resourcegroup-name>-<envName>-AssumerIdentity
Storage Location Base:
                                data@<storageaccount-name>
Data Access Identity:
                                <resourcegroup-name>-<envName>-DataAccessIdentity
Ranger Audit Role:
                                <resourcegroup-name>-<envName>-RangerIdentity

warningEnsure that you have entered the correct location base. If
                        the name entered does not match the actual location base created by the
                        quickstart script, environment registration will fail.
For example:







For Data Lake Scale, choose Light
                        Duty.





Click Next.
Under Select Region, choose your desired region. This should be the same
                    region you created an SSH key in previously.

Under Select Resource Group, choose your resource group
                        <resourcegroup-name>.
For the Select Network field, select the name of the "Virtual
          Network" resource that was created when you deployed the ARM template to create the
          resource group. The name of the Virtual Network should be the same as your environment
          name, but you can verify this in the Azure portal on the Overview
          page of your resource group.Under Security Access Settings, select Create New
            Security Groups for the Security Access Type.

Under SSH Settings, paste the public SSH key that you created
          earlier.
Optionally, under Add Tags, provide any tags that you'd
                    like the resources to be tagged with in your Azure account.

Click Next.

Under Logs, choose the following:


Logger Identity:
                                <resourcegroup-name>-<envName>-LoggerIdentity
Logs Location Base:
                                logs@<storageaccount-name>
Backup Location Base: backups@<storageaccount-name>

warningEnsure that you have entered the correct location base. If
                        the name entered does not match the actual location base created by the
                        quickstart script, environment registration will fail.
For example:






Click Register Environment.
