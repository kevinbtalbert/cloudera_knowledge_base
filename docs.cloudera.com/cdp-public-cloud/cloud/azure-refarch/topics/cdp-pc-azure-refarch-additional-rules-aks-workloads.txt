Additional rules for AKS-based workloads
At the time of enabling a CDP data service, the CDP admin can specify a list of CIDR
  ranges that will be used in allowing the incoming traffic to the workload Load Balancer. 
This list of CIDR ranges should correspond to the address ranges from which the CDP
   data service workloads will be accessed. In a VPN peered VNet, this would also include address
   ranges from customerâ€™s on-prem network. In a fully private network setup, 0.0.0.0/0
   implies access only within the VNet and the peered VPN network which is still restrictive.
CDW data service currently supports fully private AKS clusters, which means the
   Kubernetes API server will have a private IP address. CML uses a public endpoint by default for
   all AKS cluster control planes. It is highly recommended to provide a list of outbound public
   CIDR ranges at the time of provisioning a data service to restrict access to the AKS clusters. In
   addition, the data service adds CDP public CIDR range to allow access between workloads and CDP
   Control Plane. An example configuration section for a data service looks like below:



Specific guidelines for restricting access to Kubernetes API server and workloads are
   detailed in Restricting access for CDP services that create their own security groups on
    Azure by each data service.
Within the AKS cluster, security groups are defined to facilitate AKS control
   plane-pod communication, inter-pod and inter-worker node communication as well as workload
   communication through Load Balancers.
