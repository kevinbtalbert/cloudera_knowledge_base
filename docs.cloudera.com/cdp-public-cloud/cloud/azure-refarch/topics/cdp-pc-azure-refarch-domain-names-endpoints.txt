Domain names for the endpoints
The previous sections dealt with how connectivity is established to the workload
  infrastructure. This section deals with “addressability”. 
The workloads launched by CDP contain a few services that need to be accessed by the
   CDP admins and data consumers. These include services such as Cloudera Manager; metadata services
   such as the Hive Metastore, Atlas, or Ranger; and data processing or consumption services such as
   Oozie server, Hue, and so on. Given the nature of the cloud infrastructure, the IP addresses for
   the nodes running these services may change (for example if the infrastructure is restarted or
   repaired). However, these should have statically addressable DNS names so that users can access
   them with the same names.
In order to help with this, CDP assigns DNS names to these nodes. These naming
   schemes have the following properties:

The DNS name is of the following format for each Data Lake node and the Data Lake
    cluster endpoint:
    <CLUSTER_NAME>-{<HOST_GROUP><i>}.<ENVIRONMENT-IDENTIFIER>.<CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIER>.cloudera.siteAn
    example could
     be:my-dataeng-master0.my-envir.aaaa-1234.cloudera.siteThis name has
     the following components:
The base domain is cloudera.site. This is a publicly registered DNS
       suffix. It is also a registered Route53 hosted zone in a Cloudera owned AWS account.
The <CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIER> is unique to a customer account on
      CDP made of alphanumeric characters and a “-” (dash).
The <ENVIRONMENT_IDENTIFIER> is generated based on the
      environment name and is truncated to 8 characters.
The <CLUSTER_NAME> is the cluster name given to the Data Lake
      or Data Hub. It is appended with a <HOST_GROUP> name such as “gateway”,
      “master”, “worker”, and so on, depending on the role that the node plays in the cluster. If
      there are more than one of these nodes playing the same role, they are appended with a serial
      number <i>.

The DNS name of the endpoints of the CDP data services is of the following
     format:
For a Virtual Warehouse in CDW, it is:
       <VIRTUAL_WAREHOUSE_NAME>.dw-<CDW_ENVIRONMENT_IDENTIFIER>.<CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIER>.cloudera.site
<VIRTUAL_WAREHOUSE_NAME> is the name of the Virtual
        Warehouse created. There could be multiple virtual warehouses for a given CDP
        environment.
<CDW_ENVIRONMENT_IDENTIFIER> is the identifier for
        the CDP environment.

For a Session Terminal in CML workspace, it
       is:<TTY_SESSION_ID>.<CML_WORKSPACE_ID>.<ENVIRONMENT_IDENTIFIER>.<CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIER>.cloudera.site
<TTY_SESSION_ID> is the ID of the CML Terminal Session
        ID.
<CML_WORKSPACE_ID> is the ID of the CML workspace
        created.
The <ENVIRONMENT_IDENTIFIER> is generated based on the
        environment name and is truncated to 8 characters. If the 8th character is a “-” (dash),
        then it is truncated to 7 characters instead.

For all the CDP data services listed above, the common portions of the DNS
       include:
The base domain is cloudera.site. This is a publicly registered DNS
         Suffix. It is also a registered Route53 hosted zone in a Cloudera owned AWS
        account.
The <CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIER> is unique to a customer account
        on CDP made of alphanumeric characters and a “-” (dash).

The length of the DNS name is restricted to 64 characters due to some limitations
      with Hue workloads.
These names are stored as A records in the Route53 hosted zone in the Cloudera
      managed CDP Control Plane AWS account. Hence, you can resolve these names from any location
      outside of the VPC. However, note that they would still resolve to private IP addresses and
      hence are constrained by the connectivity setup described in preceding sections.
Within a CDP environment, the DNS resolution happens differently. Every CDP
      environment has a DNS server that is played by a component called FreeIPA. This server is
      seeded with the hostnames of the nodes of all workload clusters in the environment. Every node
      in a Data Lake, Data Hub and data service is configured to look up the FreeIPA DNS service for
      name resolution within the cluster.
FreeIPA nodes are internal to the CDP environment both for resolving and use.
      They don't have public DNS records.
