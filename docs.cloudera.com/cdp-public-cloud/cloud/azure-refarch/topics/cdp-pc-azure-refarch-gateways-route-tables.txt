Gateways and route tables
This topic covers recommended gateway and route table configurations for CDP Public
  Cloud for Azure.
Connectivity from Control Plane to CDP workloads


As described in the Subnets section above, each CDP data service workload
      requires its own subnet and a non-shared route table associated with it (see Bring your own
       subnet and route table with kubenet).
As described in the Taxonomy of network architectures, nodes in the CDP
      workloads need to connect to the CDP Control Plane over the internet to establish a “tunnel”
      over which the CDP Control Plane can send instructions to the workloads.
Private AKS cluster is a feature that lets CDP access a Kubernetes workload
      cluster over a private IP address (see Enabling a private CDW environment in Azure
       Kubernetes Service). When it is enabled for a CDW workload, CDW requires the user to have
      already set up internet connectivity for the subnet (see Outbound type of
       userDefinedRouting).
CDP data services such as Datalake and CML create a public load balancer for
      internet connectivity. 
If a firewall is configured, the destinations described in Azure outbound
       network access destinations need to be allowed for the CDP workloads to work. 



Connectivity from customer on-prem to CDP workloads


As described in the Use cases section (see CDP Public Cloud reference
       network architecture for Azure>Use Cases), data consumers need to access data
      processing or consumption services in the CDP workloads. 
Given that these are created with private IP addresses in private subnets, the
      customers need to arrange for access to these addresses from their on-prem or corporate
      networks in specific ways. 
There are several possible solutions for achieving this, but one that is depicted
      in the architectural diagram, uses Azure VPN Gateway.
Each workload provides an option to connect to the workload endpoint over a
      public or a private IP. It's recommended that the public IPs are disabled and that users rely
      on the corporate network connectivity for accessing the workloads with private IPs.
