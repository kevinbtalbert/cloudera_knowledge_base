Network architecture
Cloudera recommends that customers configure their cloud networks as fully private
  networks, as described in this chapter. This will help on-boarding CDP Data Lakes, Data Hubs, and
  data services smoothly.
note
This network architecture only covers the fully private networks and assumes
    unrestricted outbound access.

The cloudera-deploy tool, which is released along with this document can be used to
   automatically set up a model of this reference architecture, which can then be reviewed for
   security and compliance purposes.

Architecture diagramsThis topic includes diagrams illustrating the various elements of the network   architecture in the customerâ€™s cloud account into which CDP environments with Data Lakes, Data   Hubs, and data services will be launched. Component descriptionThis section includes an overview of the VNet, subnets, gateways and route tables, and   security groups required for CDP Public Cloud for Azure.
