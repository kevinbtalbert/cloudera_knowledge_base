Private endpoints
CDP workloads can be configured to access the Azure resources over a private IP (which
  is called a private endpoint) or over a public IP (which is called a service
   endpoint). 
The private endpoint setup requires a private DNS zone which the VNet is linked to
   and resolves the Azure resources to private IP addresses. CDP supports a private endpoint
   configuration for Azure postgres only. CDP admin can choose to either create the private DNS zone
   and link it to the VNet as described in Bringing your own private DNS, or let the CDP
   create them when provided with necessary configuration described in Using CDP-managed private
    DNS.
CDP supports only service endpoint configuration for other Azure resources(such as
   Microsoft Storage). The subnets need to be enabled to support the service endpoints. See
    Service endpoint for Azure Postgres for detailed steps.
