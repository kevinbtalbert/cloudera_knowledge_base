Security groups for Data Lakes
During the specification of a VNet to CDP, the CDP admin can either let CDP create the
  required security groups, taking a list of IP address CIDRs as input; or create them in Azure and
  then provide them to CDP.
When getting started with CDP, the CDP admin can let CDP create security groups,
   taking a list of IP address CIDRs as input. These will be used in allowing the incoming traffic
   to the hosts. The list of CIDR ranges should correspond to the address ranges from which the CDP
   workloads will be accessed. In a VPN-peered VNet, this would also include address ranges from
   customer’s on-prem network. This model is useful for initial testing given the ease of set
   up.
Alternatively, the CDP admin can create security groups on their own and select them
   during the setup of the VNet and other network configuration. This model is better for production
   workloads, as it allows for greater control in the hands of the CDP admin. However, note that the
   CDP admin must ensure that the rules meet the requirements described below.
For a fully private network, network security groups should be configured
   according to the types of access requirements needed by the different services in the workloads.
   The Network security groups section includes all the details of the necessary rules that
   need to be configured.
Note that for a fully private network, even specifying an open access here
   (such as 0.0.0.0/0) is restrictive because these services are deployed in a private subnet
   without a public IP address and hence do not have an incoming route from the Internet. However,
   the list of CIDR ranges may be useful to restrict which private subnets of the customer’s on-prem
   network can access the services. 
Rules for AKS based workloads are described separately in the following section.
