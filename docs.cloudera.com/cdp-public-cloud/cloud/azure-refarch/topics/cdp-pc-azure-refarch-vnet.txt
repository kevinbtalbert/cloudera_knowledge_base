VNet
An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is needed for deploying CDP workloads into the
  customerâ€™s cloud account. VNet is similar to a traditional network that you would operate in your
  own data center, but brings with it additional benefits of Azure's infrastructure such as scale,
  availability, and isolation.
Cloudera recommends that the VNet used for CDP is configured with the properties specified
    below:
The CIDR block for the VNet should be sufficiently large for supporting all the
     Data Hubs and data services that you intend to run. Refer to VNet and subnet planning to
     understand how to compute the CIDR block range.
In addition, you may want to ensure that the CIDR ranges assigned to the VNet do
     not overlap with any of your on-premise network CIDR ranges, as this may be a requirement for
     setting up connectivity from your on-premise network to the subnets.
