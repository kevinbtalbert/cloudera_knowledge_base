Apache Iceberg in Cloudera Data Platform
 Apache Iceberg is a cloud-native, high-performance open table format for organizing
    petabyte-scale analytic datasets on a file system or object store. Combined with Cloudera Data
    Platform (CDP), users can build an open data lakehouse architecture for multi-function analytics
    and to deploy large scale end-to-end pipelines.
Open data lakehouse on CDP simplifies advanced analytics on all data with a unified platform
      for structured and unstructured data and integrated data services to enable any analytics use
      case from ML, BI to stream analytics and real-time analytics. Apache Iceberg is the secret
      sauce of the open lakehouse.
