Preparing for an upgrade
Upgrading CDP Public Cloud consists of two major steps: upgrading the Data Lake within
    an environment and then potentially upgrading the attached Data Hubs. If applicable, you can
    upgrade any data services after the Data Lake upgrade. 
FreeIPA upgrades
You should periodically upgrade the environment (FreeIPA cluster) to ensure that you are
        running the latest OS-level security patches, but this is not required at the same time as
        upgrading the Data Lake and Data Hubs. While FreeIPA upgrade can be performed without a
        downtime, Cloudera recommends to perform this separately from other operations, preferably
        before upgrading the Data Lake and Data Hubs. See  upgrade the FreeIPA cluster.

Data Lake upgrade workflow



Pre-upgrade tasks

Review the Data Lake upgrade requirements and limitations.
Carefully review the differences between the types of upgrades and what they
          entail.
Check the Data Lake support matrix for upgrade to verify which
          Runtime versions you can upgrade to and from.
If you have not configured your Data Lake for backup and restore, you will need to do so.
          The backup and restore process is integrated into the upgrade flow automatically, but
          successful upgrade requires that the correct IAM policies exist on the DATALAKE_ADMIN_ROLE
          and RANGER_AUDIT_ROLE (for backup), and the DATALAKE_ADMIN_ROLE,
          RANGER_AUDIT_ROLE, and LOG_ROLE (for restore). If your roles are
            not configured correctly, CDP will not be able to write the backup to the
            BACKUP_LOCATION_BASE path of your cloud storage.
If you are performing the backup manually (as opposed to the integrated backup available
          during the upgrade process), you can launch the Data Lake backup from the UI or
          CLI. When using the CLI, you can specify to skip certain backup actions (skip HMS, Atlas
          metadata or Ranger audit log index backup). You can monitor the backup process using the
          CLI.
From the Data Lake UI, run the Validate and Prepare option to check for any
          configuration issues and begin the Cloudera Runtime parcel download and distribution.
          Using the validate and prepare option does not require downtime and makes the maintenance
          window for an upgrade shorter. Validate and prepare also does not make any changes to your
          cluster and can be run independently of the upgrade itself. Although you can begin the
          upgrade without first running the validate and prepare option, using it will make the
          process smoother and the downtime shorter. (The parcels that are downloaded and
          distributed by the validate and prepare option are specific to the Runtime version that
          you have selected, so if you use validate and prepare and then decide to upgrade to a
          different Runtime version instead, you will need to re-run validate and prepare. Be aware
          that if you use validate and prepare for multiple major/minor Runtime versions, the
          parcels for different versions are not cleaned up and may saturate the disk. These parcels
          are cleaned up only once the upgrade is complete.)

Data Lake upgrade tasks
Perform the upgrade, either through the UI or CLI. The type of upgrade that you perform
            will depend on whether a major/minor or service pack version of Runtime is available. A
            new OS image may also be available to upgrade to. 
If the upgrade fails, check the logs for manual troubleshooting info. You can also
              recover from failed upgrades.
When the upgrade succeeds, proceed to upgrading the attached Data Hubs if
            required.


Data Services upgrades
Any data services in use should be upgraded after the Data Lake upgrade. Some data services
        have their own compatibility matrix with different versions of the Data Lake. Other data
        services contain features that may not be compatible with every Data Lake (Runtime) version.
        Refer to the data services documentation for information on Data Lake compatibility and
        upgrading these services.

Data Hub upgrade workflow



Pre-upgrade tasks

Carefully review the differences between the types of upgrades and what they
          entail.
Check the Data Hub upgrade support matrix to verify that the
          Runtime versions you want to upgrade to and from are supported for your clusters.
From the Data Hub UI, run the Validate and Prepare option to check for any
          configuration issues and begin the Cloudera Runtime parcel download and distribution.
          Using the validate and prepare option does not require downtime and makes the maintenance
          window for an upgrade shorter. Validate and prepare also does not make any changes to your
          cluster and can be run independently of the upgrade itself. Although you can begin the
          upgrade without first running the validate and prepare option, using it will make the
          process smoother and the downtime shorter.  (The parcels that are downloaded and
          distributed by the validate and prepare option are specific to the Runtime version that
          you have selected, so if you use validate and prepare and then decide to upgrade to a
          different Runtime version instead, you will need to re-run validate and prepare. Be aware
          that if you use validate and prepare for multiple major/minor Runtime versions, the
          parcels for different versions are not cleaned up and may saturate the disk. These parcels
          are cleaned up only once the upgrade is complete.)

Major/minor Runtime version upgrade tasks

Backup the cluster data and CM
          configurations.
Perform the upgrade, either through the UI or CLI. (Operational database clusters have
            a different process.)
Complete any post-upgrade tasks for the type of cluster
          that you upgraded.
For DE clusters, use the CM UI to add any configs that were not added during
          the upgrade.
If the upgrade fails, check the Event log and the troubleshooting section.
Complete any post-upgrade tasks for the type of cluster
          that you upgraded.
For DE clusters, use the CM UI to add any configs that were not added during
          the upgrade.
If the upgrade fails, check the Event log and the troubleshooting section.

Service pack upgrade tasks

Backup the cluster data and CM
          configurations.
Perform the upgrade, either through the UI or CLI.
If the upgrade fails, check the Event log and the troubleshooting section.

OS upgrade tasks

Review the Before you begin section to verify that
          there is no data belonging to NiFi or NiFi Registry on the root disk of the VM. Note that
          during an OS upgrade, any data on the root volume (parcels, service logs, custom software)
          will be lost.
Unlike the Data Lake upgrade, OS upgrades are not integrated in the larger upgrade flow
          and must be performed separately, either through the UI or CLI.
