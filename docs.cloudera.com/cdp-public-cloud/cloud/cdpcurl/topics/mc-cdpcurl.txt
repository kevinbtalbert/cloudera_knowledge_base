This documentation provides information about cdpcurl.



Building cdpcurl
You can access cdpcurl and review the license here.
Download cdpcurl:
wget https://github.com/cloudera/cdpcurl/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd cdpcurl-master


If desired, create a virtual environment:
For a typical virtual environment:

$ virtualenv cdpcurlenv
$ . cdpcurlenv/bin/activate
For a python virtual environment:

$ pyenv virtualenv cdpcurlenv
$ pyenv activate cdpcurlenv

In this directory, run the following command:$ pip install
            .


Generating an API access key
A CDP user account (a user or a machine user) must have API access credentials to
    access CDP services through the CDP CLI or API. 
When you use this method to generate an access key and then manually configure the access key
      in the ~/.cdp/credentials, the access credentials are permanent until
      they are removed from the ~/.cdp/credentials file. A login command is not
      required if access credentials are stored in the ~/.cdp/credentials file. If
      you prefer that the API access key is shorter-lived, refer to the topic Logging into the
        CDP CLI/SDK, which describes a method of logging into the CLI/SDK through any
      SAML-compliant identity provider. 
Required roles
Users who have the IAMUser role can generate an access key from their own account
      page. As a CDP administrator or PowerUser, you can generate an access key for a user
      account that does not have the IAMUser role.
Generate your own access key
Steps


Sign in to the CDP console.

Click on your user name in the bottom left corner and then select Profile. 
On the user profile page that appears, click Generate Access Key. 

CDP creates the key and displays the information on the screen. 
          Copy the access key and private key to a text file and send it to the CDP user
            who requires it. The private key is a very long string of characters. Make sure that you
            copy the full string. You can optionally download the credentials file containing the
            access key information.
        

Click OK to exit the access key window.
note
The CDP console displays the API access key immediately after you create it. You
                must copy or download the access key ID and private key information when it is
                displayed. Do not exit the console without copying the private key. After you exit
                the console, there is no other way to view or copy the private key.



Once you've generated the access key, you can configure CDP CLI, SDK, or other utilities
        that require it.

Generate an access key for another user or machine user (admin only)
Steps


Sign in to the CDP console.


          From the CDP home page, click Management
            Console.
        

          On the side navigation panel, click Users.
        

          On the Users page, click the name of the user or machine
            user account for which you want to generate an access key.
        

          On the user account page, go to the Access Keys section
            and click Generate Access Key.
        

 CDP creates the key and displays the information on the screen. 
          Copy the access key and private key to a text file and send it to the CDP user
            who requires it. The private key is a very long string of characters. Make sure that you
            copy the full string. You can optionally download the credentials file containing the
            access key information.
        

Click OK to exit the access key window.
note
The CDP console displays the API access key immediately after you create it. You
                must copy or download the access key ID and private key information when it is
                displayed. Do not exit the console without copying the private key. After you exit
                the console, there is no other way to view or copy the private key.



Once you've generated the access key, you can configure CDP CLI, SDK, or other utilities
        that require it.



Passing the API access keys to cdpcurl
After you generate the API access key and private key, you must pass the keys to
      cdpcurl.
You have two options for passing the API access key and private key to
      cdpcurl:


Recommended method: Create a profile in $HOME/.cdp/credentials that contains the
          keys, and then use the --profile option in cdpcurl
          calls. For
          example:[myuserprofile]
cdp_access_key_id = 6744f22e-c46a-406d-ad28-987584f45351
cdp_private_key = abcdefgh...................................=
Alternatively, when you make the API call, pass the keys to cdpcurl
          using the --access-key and --private-key options.




Making API calls with cdpcurl
To use cdpcurl to make API calls, first form the correct URI using the
    API reference documentation, and then construct the request.
To form the required URI, start by determining the hostname based on the service being
      called:

iam: 
iamapi.us-west-1.altus.cloudera.com if your CDP account runs in
            Control Plane region us-west-1
api.<control-plane-region>.cdp.cloudera.com if your CDP account
            runs in any other Control Plane region

All other services: api.<control-plane-region>.cdp.cloudera.com

Then form the URI. The correct URI is an HTTPS URL at the chosen host, with a path indicated
      for your desired endpoint in the API
        documentation. For example, the URI for a listEnvironments call would look something
      like
      this:https://api.us-west-1.cdp.cloudera.com/api/v1/environments2/listEnvironments
Most CDP API calls are POST requests, so be sure to use the [-X REQUEST] and
        [-d DATA] arguments in the command. These are briefly documented in the
        awscurl documentation, but [-X REQUEST] specifies
      the type of request (most often POST in CDP) and [-d DATA] specifies the
      request content (in the POST example below, an empty JSON request). If the -d
      option value begins with "@", then the remainder of the value is the path to a file containing
      the content; otherwise, the value is the content itself.
You can then run the request. For
      example:$ cdpcurl --profile sandbox -X POST -d '{}' https://api.us-west-1.cdp.cloudera.com/api/v1/environments2/listEnvironments
For a complete list of cdpcurl options, run cdpcurl
      --help.
noteThe CDP CLI has a --debug option that prints out details that might be
      helpful when using cdpcurl. For example, it returns the hostname that it
      calls to, which may help if you're unsure whether to use api.us-west-1.cdp.cloudera.com or something else. It also reports on the path
        (/api/v1/...) that it calls.


cdpcurl example
After you install cdpcurl and generate the API access key, you are ready to make an API call.
If you have not created a profile in $HOME/.cdp/credentials that
      contains the API access key ID and private key pair, make sure that you have the API access
      key ID and private key that you generated.
The example below walks you through the steps required to make
      an API call that lists all environments in the CDP Control Plane.

In the CDP Control Plane Public API Documentation, find the endpoint for the list environments request and form the correct
          URI.
The correct URI is an HTTPS URL that contains the hostname for the desired service and
            the path to the desired endpoint. In this "list environments" example, the correct URI
            for a CDP account running in the us-west-1 Control Plane region would be:
            https://api.us-west-1.cdp.cloudera.com/api/v1/environments2/listEnvironments

Form the cdpcurl command.
The CDP API uses the HTTPS protocol to make API calls, and most CDP API calls are POST
            requests, so be sure to use the [-X REQUEST] and [-d
              DATA] arguments in the command. For more details, refer to the awscurl documentation and the topic Making API calls
              with cdpcurl. The --profile argument below points to the
            profile you likely created in $HOME/.cdp/credentials, that contains
            the API access key and private key pair. If you did not create this profile, you will
            have to pass the --access_key and --private_key
            arguments as well. 
 In this example, the command would be:
$ cdpcurl --profile sandbox -X POST -d '{}' https://api.us-west-1.cdp.cloudera.com/api/v1/environments2/listEnvironments

Run this command in a terminal window to make the API call, and then receive the
            response. If the call is successful, the response
          is the EnvironmentSummary array.
