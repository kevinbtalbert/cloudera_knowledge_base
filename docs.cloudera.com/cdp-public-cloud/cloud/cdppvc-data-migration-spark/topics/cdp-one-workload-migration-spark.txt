Migrating Spark workloads to CDP
Migrating Spark workloads from CDH or HDP to CDP involves learning the Spark semantic
    changes in your source cluster and the CDP target cluster. You get details about how to handle
    these changes. 
Spark 1.6 to Spark 2.4 RefactoringBecause Spark 1.6 is not supported on CDP, you need to refactor Spark workloads from         Spark 1.6 on CDH or HDP to Spark 2.4 on CDP. Spark 2.3 to Spark 2.4 RefactoringBecause Spark 2.3 is not supported on CDP, you need to refactor Spark workloads from         Spark 2.3 on CDH or HDP to Spark 2.4 on CDP.
