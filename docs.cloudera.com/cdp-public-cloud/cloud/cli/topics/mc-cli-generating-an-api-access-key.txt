Generating an API access keyCloudera Docs
Generating an API access key
A CDP user account (a user or a machine user) must have API access credentials to
    access CDP services through the CDP CLI or API. 
When you use this method to generate an access key and then manually configure the access key
      in the ~/.cdp/credentials, the access credentials are permanent until
      they are removed from the ~/.cdp/credentials file. A login command is not
      required if access credentials are stored in the ~/.cdp/credentials file. If
      you prefer that the API access key is shorter-lived, refer to the topic Logging into the
        CDP CLI/SDK, which describes a method of logging into the CLI/SDK through any
      SAML-compliant identity provider. 
Required roles
Users who have the IAMUser role can generate an access key from their own account
      page. As a CDP administrator or PowerUser, you can generate an access key for a user
      account that does not have the IAMUser role.
Generate your own access key
Steps


Sign in to the CDP console.

Click on your user name in the bottom left corner and then select Profile. 
On the user profile page that appears, click Generate Access Key. 

CDP creates the key and displays the information on the screen. 
          Copy the access key and private key to a text file and send it to the CDP user
            who requires it. The private key is a very long string of characters. Make sure that you
            copy the full string. You can optionally download the credentials file containing the
            access key information.
        

Click OK to exit the access key window.
note
The CDP console displays the API access key immediately after you create it. You
                must copy or download the access key ID and private key information when it is
                displayed. Do not exit the console without copying the private key. After you exit
                the console, there is no other way to view or copy the private key.



Once you've generated the access key, you can configure CDP CLI, SDK, or other utilities
        that require it.
