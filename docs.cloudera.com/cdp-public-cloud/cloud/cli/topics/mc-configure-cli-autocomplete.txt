Configuring CLI autocomplete
To configure CLI autocompletion, you must have two pieces of information: the name of
    the shell you're using and the location of the cdp_completer
    script.
The CDP CLI includes a command-completion feature that enables
      you to use the Tab key to complete a partially entered command. This feature isn't
      automatically installed, so you need to configure it manually. When you partially enter a
      command, parameter, or option, the command-completion feature either automatically completes
      your command or displays a suggested list of commands. To prompt command completion, you
      partially enter a command and press Tab.

Locate the CLI completer.
which cdp_completer

Add the completer's folder to your path:


Find your shell's profile script in your user folder.
For example:
~/.bash_profile


Add the following command to your bash_profiler, replacing
                /usr/local/bin/cdp_completer with the actual location discovered in
              the previous sub-step:
complete -C /usr/local/bin/cdp_completer cdp


Reload the profile into the current session to put the changes into effect. Replace
                .bash_profile with the name of the shell script you discovered in
              the first sub-step:

$ source ~/.bash_profile




Enter cdp <TAB> to display the available options for
          autocomplete.
