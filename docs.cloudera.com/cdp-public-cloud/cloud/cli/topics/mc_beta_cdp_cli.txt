Installing Beta CDP CLICloudera Docs
Installing Beta CDP CLI
Refer to this documentation if you need to install Beta CDP CLI.
You may need to install Beta CDP CLI if you would like to access one or more preview features
    included in CDP. In most other cases, you should use the standard CDP CLI. Do not install both
    the standard and beta CLIs in the same Python environment, as they use the same entry points and
    will therefore conflict. Either use a separate virtual environment or uninstall the cdpcli first
    before installing cdpcli-beta.


Install Python if needed, as described in CDP CLI documentation for your platform. Do not
     install CDP CLI. Instead, proceed to step 2.

Run the following to install Beta CDP CLI:pip3 install cdpcli-beta

Configure access keys as described in Generating an API access key. 
If you have previously installed Beta CDP CLI, you can update it to the latest version
    using:pip3 install cdpcli-beta --upgrade --user
