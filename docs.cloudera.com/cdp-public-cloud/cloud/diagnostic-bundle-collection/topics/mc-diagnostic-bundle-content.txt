Diagnostic bundle content
This topic summarizes the content of a diagnostic bundle.
The following information is included in a diagnostic bundle: 

Cluster details required to identify the bundle (account ID, cluster CRN, cluster
    type, and so on)
Redacted service and system logs
Web server configuration from the salt master node (nginx)
An HTML report including:
The result of running a number of system-level commands on each host
Network endpoint accessibility for outbound network traffic requirements
Health details about the required infra services

When triggering diagnostic bundle collection via CDP CLI, you may specify additional logs
    that are not part of the default log collection to be collected in the diagnostic bundle. 

The information is collected from all running nodes of your cluster (Data Lake,
   FreeIPA, or Data Hub). It is not collected from nodes that are not running, such as nodes that
   are currently being provisioned or stopped or deleted nodes. 
noteThe logs collected by default in the on-demand diagnostic bundle are the same as when you
    enable cluster log collection. Whether or not you
   enabled the log collection feature on tenant or environment level, the on-demand diagnostic
   bundle can be generated independently when needed. 
noteThe Cloudera Manager service logs can also be gathered via Cloudera Manager, as described in
    Collecting Data Lake diagnostics via CM. However,
   if Cloudera Manager is down or cannot be started, generating a diagnostic bundle may help
   troubleshoot CM issues.
