CDP CLI commands for generating a diagnostic bundle
CDP includes a set of CLI commands that allow you to generate an on-demand diagnostic
    bundle that gathers logs and command output from your Data Lake, FreeIPA, or Data Hub cluster
    VMs. The bundle can also be used for support case troubleshooting if the logs captured via the
    equivalent UI option are not sufficient. 
For each resource type (freeipa, datalake, or
        datahub), there are two commands that you can use:

get-<resource-type>-log-descriptors - Allows you to obtain a
    list of logs that get collected for diagnostics. 
collect-<resource-type>-diagnostics - Triggers diagnostics
        collection. You need to provide a CRN of a resource (Data Lake, FreeIPA, or Data Hub
        cluster), a description, and a destination for the bundle. 
list-<resource-type>-diagnostics - Lists the running or
        finished diagnostic operations.
cancel-<resource-type>-diagnostics - Stops the ongoing diagnostics
    operations.

Required role: You need the EnvironmentAdmin or Owner role for the
      environment for which you would like to create a bundle.
Prerequisites


FreeIPA deployment time must be September 2020 or later.
The VMs from which diagnostic data is to be collected must be running. 
Salt minions must be started properly on the CM nodes.

get-<resource-type>-log-descriptors
The get-<resource-type>-log-descriptors commands allow you to
    obtain a list of logs that get collected. These commands can also be used to obtain available
    log label/path pairs that can be provided in the
     collect-<resource-type>-diagnostics command via the
     --labels parameter in order to limit the command output. 
The output is printed in the Event History tab on the UI in Data Lake or Data Hub
    details. Since there is no FreeIPA Event History on the UI, in case of FreeIPA the output is
    saved to /var/log/salt/minion, which can be accessed from your logs location in cloud storage. 
Commands
To gather available log label/path pairs, use one of the following commands:
cdp environments get-freeipa-log-descriptors 
cdp datalake get-datalake-log-descriptors 
cdp datahub get-datahub-log-descriptors 

collect-<resource-type>-diagnostics

The collect-<resource-type>-diagnostics commands trigger
            log collection. You need to provide a CRN of a resource (Data Lake, FreeIPA, or Data Hub
            cluster), a description, and a destination for the bundle. The generated bundle can be
            saved to cloud storage or to a local file. The command progress (including the location
            where the bundle is generated) is printed in the Event History tab on the UI. 
noteThis feature only works out of the box with environments created or upgraded in
              October 2020 or later. If your environment is older and your nodes have internet
              access, you can use the --update-package option to download the
              newest library that is needed for the collection.
Prerequisites
If you would like to use cloud storage as a destination, ensure that the
              Logger and IDBroker instance profiles (on AWS) or managed identities (on Azure) are
              able to write to the specified cloud storage location.
If you would like to use Cloudera support as a destination, your network must be
              able to reach the following destinations:
                https://dbusapi.us-west-1.altus.cloudera.com if your CDP account
              runs in Control Plane region us-west-1, or
                https://api.<control-plane-region>.cdp.cloudera.com if your CDP
              account runs in any other Control Plane region (only required if your cloud provider
              is AWS) and https://cloudera-dbus-prod.s3.amazonaws.com (required
              even if your cloud provider is not AWS).
Example commandsTo run collection with salt
            script included and update cdp-telemetry package on the nodes, use one of the following

            commands, Replace <DESCRIPTION> with an actual description and the
              <NAME-OR-CRN>, <DATALAKE-CRN>, and
              <DATAHUBCRN> with an actual CRN.To send the diagnostics
            bundle to cloud storage, use:
cdp environments collect-freeipa-diagnostics --environment-name <NAME-OR-CRN> \
--description <DESCRIPTION> \
--destination CLOUD_STORAGE \
--include-salt-logs

cdp datalake collect-datalake-diagnostics --crn <DATALAKE-CRN> \
--description <DESCRIPTION> \
--destination CLOUD_STORAGE \
--include-salt-logs

cdp datahub collect-datahub-diagnostics --crn <DATAHUB-CRN> \
--description <DESCRIPTION> \
--destination CLOUD_STORAGE \
--include-salt-logs
To send the diagnostic bundle directly to Cloudera support,
            use:cdp datahub collect-datahub-diagnostics --crn <DATAHUB-CRN> \
--description <DESCRIPTION> \
--case-number <SUPPORT_CASE_NUMBER>
--destination SUPPORT \
--update-package \
--include-salt-logsTo collect only specific custom logs (such as /var/log/audit/audit.log used in
            this example), use: 
cdp environments collect-freeipa-diagnostics --environment-name <name> \
--description <DESCRIPTION> 
--destination CLOUD_STORAGE \
--additional-logs path=/var/log/audit/audit.log,label=audit \
--labels audit
If you run this command:
Logs specified under --additional-logs will be
              collected
Due to the specified label, all other logs will be filtered out and no
              other logs will be included in the bundle. 
Required parameters--environment-name
            (for Data Lake or Data Hub) or --crn (for Data
            Hub)Provide a CRN of your Data Lake, FreeIPA, or Data Hub cluster. You can
            obtain it by running a list or describe command on your resource. --description Provide a description for the diagnostics
            bundle.--destination Specify a destination of the
            diagnostics collection: SUPORT, CLOUD_STORAGE, or LOCAL:
SUPPORT: Sends diagnostic bundles directly to Cloudera support.
CLOUD_STORAGE: Saves collected diagnostics into a tar.gzfile file and
              uploads it to your logs cloud storage location specified during environment
              registration, to a PATH that looks like
              this: cluster-logs/<CLUSTER-TYPE>/<CLUSTER-NAME>_<UUID PART-OF-CLUSTER-CRN>/diagnostics.     The
              “cluster logs” directory is only created if your cloud storage location is a bucket.
              If your cloud storage location includes a directory within a bucket, then the “cluster
              logs” directory is not created.noteThe value of <CLUSTER_NAME> for FreeIPA is
                  <ENVIRONMENT-NAME>-freeipa. For example, if your environment
                is called "test", the <CLUSTER_NAME> for FreeIPA is "test-freeipa".
LOCAL: Diagnostics will be collected to a compressed file, and saved to
                /var/lib/filecollector on every cluster node. 
Optional parameters--labels You
            can use this to pass a list of labels that can be used to filter collected logs. This is
            useful if instead of including all logs, you would only include certain specific logs in
            the bundle. This list can be obtained from the get-<cluster-type>-log-descriptors
            response. --additional-logs One or more additional VM
            log objects that will be included in the diagnostics bundle. A VM log object is a
            path/label pair. Cloudera support may ask you to provide specific values
              here.--hosts Run diagnostics only the specified hosts (both IP
            addresses or fqdns are valid).--host-groups Run diagnostics only
            on the those hosts that are included in the specified host
              groups.--exclude-hosts Same as the --hosts
            filter but for exclusion.--skip-unresponsive-hosts Skip unhealthy
          hosts from the diagnostics collection (where "unhealthy" means that salt minion is
          unresponsive). If this is not used, the diagnostics will fail if there is an unresponsive
          host during diagnostics. --include-salt-logs If this is set,
            salt minion/master logs will be included in the diagnostic bundle. --case-number Allows you to provide a support case number. --update-package If this is set, during diagnostics
            collection, the required third party applications will be downloaded and updated on the
            VM nodes. This requires internet access.--storage-validation You can use this if using CLOUD_STORAGE as a
            destination. If this is set, cloud storage write validation check will happen during an
            initial phase of the diagnostics collection. For more information about the command
          and its options, use the --help CLI option. 


list-<resource-type>-diagnostics

Examples:cdp environments list-freeipa-diagnostics --environment-name <NAME-OR-CRN>
cdp datalake list-datalake-diagnostics --crn <DATALAKE-CRN> 
cdp datahub list-datahub-diagnostics --crn <DATAHUB-CRN>

cancel-<resource-type>-diagnostics
Stops the ongoing diagnostics operations.
Examples:cdp environments cancel-freeipa-diagnostics --environment-name <NAME-OR-CRN>
cdp datalake cancel-datalake-diagnostics --crn <DATALAKE-CRN> 
cdp datahub cancel-datahub-diagnostics --crn <DATAHUB-CRN>
