Getting started as a user
Refer to this section if you are a non-admin CDP user who is trying to get started in
  CDP.

Accessing CDP for the first time 
Access the CDP web interface at https://console.cdp.cloudera.com and log in by using your corporate credentials or
        other credentials that you received from your CDP administrator.

Setting workload password
If you are planning to access certain resources such as:
Access clusters via SSH
Connect to clusters via JDBC or ODBC
Access Data Analytics Studio (DAS) 
Access Machine Learning workspaces

you must access these by using your workload password. Initially, you must set your
        workload password, and then you need to reset it each time a new environment is shared with
        you. For more information about when and how to set and reset your  workload password, refer
        to Accessing non-SSO interfaces using IPA
        credentials.

Checking your workload user name
If you are planning to access certain resources such as:
Access clusters via SSH
Connect to clusters via JDBC or ODBC
Access Data Analytics Studio (DAS) 
Access Machine Learning workspaces

you must access these by using your workload user name. To check your workload user name,
        navigate to the Management Console > User Management > Users, find your user and
        check your Workload User Name.

Uploading SSH key
As an alternative for using workload password for SSHing to workload clusters, you can also
        upload your SSH public key to CDP and use the matching SSH private key for access. For more
        information, refer to Managing SSH keys.

Accessing resources 
Your CDP administrator decided which CDP resources are available to you. You can
    access these resources from the CDP web interface. For more information, refer to the following
    documentation:

Data Engineering
DataFlow
