Prerequisites
You need to set up your environment and meet Data Lake prerequisites for querying
        Iceberg tables in CDP. You learn which query editors are supported and which roles are
        required. 
The following list covers prerequisites for using Iceberg.
You are using the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW).
You must have access to a CDP environment that was activated from your
                    environment UI. Your DATALAKE type must be SDX as shown below:


Data Lake version 7.2.12.1 or higher is required. 
One of the following query editors are required to query Iceberg tables: 
 Hue  (recommended)
 A JDBC client 
 The Impala shell for remote users 

You must have the required role: DWUser.
You must obtain permission to run SQL queries from the Env Admin, who must add
                    you to a Hadoop SQL policy. 
You must use the HadoopFileIO. S3FileIO is not supported. URLs in metadata
                    starting with s3://... cause query failure.
