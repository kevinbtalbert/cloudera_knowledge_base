Migration to CDP Private Cloud Base
If you are a Spark user migrating from HDP to CDP and accessing Hive workloads through
  the Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC), consider migrating to CDP Private Cloud Base and based on your use cases,
  use the various HWC read modes to access Hive managed tables from Spark.
Use HWC JDBC Cluster mode
If the user does not have access to the file systems (restricted access), you can
    use HWC to submit HiveSQL from Spark with benefits of fine-grained access control (FGAC), row
    filtering and column masking, to securely access Hive tables from Spark. 
However, if the size of your database query returns are less than 1 GB of data, it
    is recommended that you use HWC JDBC Cluster mode in which Spark executors connect to Hive
    through JDBC, and execute the query. Larger workloads are not recommended for JDBC reads in
    production due to slow performance.

Use HWC Secure access mode
If the user does not have access to the file systems (restricted access) and if the size of
    database query returns are greater than 1 GB of data, it is recommended to use HWC Secure access
    mode that offers fine-grained access control (FGAC), row filtering and column masking to access
    Hive table data from Spark. 
Secure access mode enables you to set up an HDFS staging location to temporarily store Hive
    files that users need to read from Spark and secure the data using Ranger FGAC.

Use HWC Direct reader mode
If the user has access to the file systems (ETL jobs do not require authorization and run as
    super user) and if you are accessing Hive managed tables, you can use the HWC Direct reader mode
    to allow Spark to read directly from the managed table location.importantThis workload must be run with ‘hive’ user permissions.
If you are querying Hive external tables, use Spark native readers to read the external tables
    from Spark.
