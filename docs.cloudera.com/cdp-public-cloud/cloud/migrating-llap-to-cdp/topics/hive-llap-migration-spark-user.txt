Migration paths for Spark users
If you are on HDP and executing Spark workloads in Hive LLAP mode, and you want to
  upgrade to CDP, you can follow the migration path that matches your security needs. It is
  recommended that you upgrade to CDP Private Cloud Base and choose either Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC) or native Spark readers to query Hive
  from Spark.
As a replacement for the HWC LLAP execution mode in HDP, you can use the HWC Secure Access Mode
   in CDP Private Cloud Base that offers
   fine-grained access control (FGAC) column masking and row filtering to secure managed (ACID), or
   even external, Hive table data that you read from Spark.
The following migration paths are recommended based on certain factors:
Migrate to CDP Private Cloud Base
Use HWC JDBC Cluster mode — If the user does not have access to data in the file system and
     if the database query returns are less than 1 GB of data. 
Use HWC Secure access mode — If the user does not have access to data in the file system and
     if the database query returns are more than 1 GB of data.
Use HWC Direct reader mode — If the user has access to data in the file system and if you
     are querying Hive managed tables.
Use native Spark reader — If the user has access to data in the file system and if you are
     querying Hive external tables.

The following diagram shows these recommended paths:




Migration to CDP Private Cloud BaseIf you are a Spark user migrating from HDP to CDP and accessing Hive workloads through   the Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC), consider migrating to CDP Private Cloud Base and based on your use cases,   use the various HWC read modes to access Hive managed tables from Spark.HWC changes from HDP to CDPYou need to understand the Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC) changes from HDP to CDP.     Extensive HWC documentation can prepare you to update your HWC code to run on CDP. In CDP,     methods and the configuration of the HWC connections differ from HDP.Parent topic: Migration paths from HDP 3 to CDP for LLAP users
