Cloudera Replication Plugin
You can migrate your HBase data from CDH or HDP to COD CDP Public Cloud. First you have

  migrate your data.
Before starting the migration you have to understand and perform all the necessary data
   migration preparation tasks. Then, in the absence of Replication Manager support, you must
   perform certain tasks on both your source cluster (CDP or HDP) and your destination CDP cluster
   to ensure a successful migration.
