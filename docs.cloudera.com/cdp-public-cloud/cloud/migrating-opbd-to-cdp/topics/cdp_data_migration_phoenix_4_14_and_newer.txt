Replicating Phoenix 4.14 and newer versions including 5.x
Phoenix 4.14 and 5.x have options which may or may not use column encoding, whereas
        the older versions did not have this feature. You must determine if your existing Phoenix
        table uses column encoding. Following are the various ways to check this. 
You can also create an HBase replication policy using
            Replication Manager to replicate Phoenix 4.14 and 5.x versions into COD. For more
            information, refer to the second row of the Replication methods table in
                HBase Migration through Replication Manager.

Follow the same steps as described for Phoenix older than 4.14, steps 1 -
                    4, and modify step 5 according to the following instructions.

Scan the raw data in HBase, and inspect if there are human-readable column
                    names in the column qualifier. If you see human-readable names, you must set
                        COLUMN_ENCODED_BYTES = 0. If you encounter a binary data
                    (‘\x00’), assume that COLUMN_ENCODED_BYTES must be
                    set.

Inspect the create-table command from the legacy product. If you explicitly set
                        COLUMN_ENCODED_BYTES in an earlier version, you must
                    use the same value when re-creating the Phoenix table in COD.


noteConsult the SchemaTool output if you are on a
                            sufficiently new version of Phoenix.



Validate the query using phoenix-sqlline. This must return the expected data
                    from your Phoenix table.
