Phoenix Replication to Cloudera Operational Database
Cloudera Operational Database (COD) provides both HBase and Phoenix. You might request a
  backported SchemaTool utility for HDP 2.6, HDP3, and Phoenix parcel for CDH6 from Cloudera support
  to reconstruct the original DDL.
Cloudera also provides the Cloudera Operational Database Replication plugin, which
   enables HBase replication from a number of products which also include HBase and Phoenix to COD,
   such as CDH 5, CDH 6, HDP 2.6, and HDP 3.1. You can replicate Phoenix tables to COD using the
   Replication plugin. 
Currently, COD includes Apache Phoenix 5.1.1 while other products include a range of versions
   of Phoenix from 4.7.0 to 5.0.0.

Replicating Phoenix Data TablesWhen you want to configure replication of Phoenix tables from all versions, you need to   know the schema of the data to be replicated. However, all on-prem products which include Phoenix   today do not have the ability to print the equivalent CREATE TABLE command for   a table in Phoenix.Replicating Phoenix Index TablesThe secondary indexing implementation in Phoenix changed drastically between versions   lower than Phoenix 4.14 and higher. The manner in which HBase replication sends Phoenix data is   fundamentally incompatible with the new style of Phoenix secondary index maintenance.   Architecturally, it is most desirable that we replicate only Phoenix data tables, and let the   “local” HBase cluster maintain any secondary indexes for you. However, currently no   “Phoenix-aware” replication strategy exists which is capable of automatically maintaining the   Phoenix secondary indexes for replicated Phoenix data tables.
