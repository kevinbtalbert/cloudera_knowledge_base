Replicating Phoenix Data Tables
When you want to configure replication of Phoenix tables from all versions, you need to
  know the schema of the data to be replicated. However, all on-prem products which include Phoenix
  today do not have the ability to print the equivalent CREATE TABLE command for
  a table in Phoenix.
Cloudera has built some functionality to recreate the CREATE TABLE command
   for previously released versions of Phoenix as a standalone tool. Please contact your Cloudera
   representative to evaluate the ability to use this utility against your version of Phoenix.

Replicating Phoenix tables for versions lower than 4.14For Phoenix versions lower than 4.14, you must treat both the Phoenix data tables and         Phoenix index tables similar to any other HBase table.Replicating Phoenix 4.14 and newer versions including 5.xPhoenix 4.14 and 5.x have options which may or may not use column encoding, whereas         the older versions did not have this feature. You must determine if your existing Phoenix         table uses column encoding. Following are the various ways to check this. Parent topic: Phoenix Replication to Cloudera Operational Database
