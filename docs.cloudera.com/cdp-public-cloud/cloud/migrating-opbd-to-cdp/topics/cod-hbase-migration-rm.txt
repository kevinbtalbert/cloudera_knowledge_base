Replication Manager
Cloudera Replication Manager is a key CDP service to migrate data between CDP
  environments, on-prem clusters, and clusters on cloud infrastructure services. Replication Manager
  provides a simple, easy-to-use, and feature-rich data movement capability to deliver data and
  metadata where it is needed and provides secure data backup with disaster recovery
  functionality.
Replication Manager provides HBase replication policies to replicate HBase data from source
   classic clusters to COD.
The following table lists the minimum versions that HBase replication policies support to
   replicate HBase data.
