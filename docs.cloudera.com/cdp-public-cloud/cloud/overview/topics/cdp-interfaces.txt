CDP Public Cloud interfaces
There are three basic ways to access and use CDP Public Cloud: web interface, CLI
  client, and SDK.
Web interface 
The CDP Public Cloud web interface provides a web-based, graphical user interface. As an admin
    user, you can use the web interface to register environments, manage users, and provision CDP
    service resources for end users. As an end user, you can use the web console to access CDP
    service web interfaces to perform data engineering or data analytics tasks. 



CLI
If you prefer to work in a terminal window, you can download and configure the CDP client that
    gives you access to the CDP CLI tool. The CDP CLI allows you to perform the same actions as can
    be performed from the web console. Furthermore, it allows you to automate routine tasks such as
    cluster creation.

SDK
You can use the CDP SDK for Java to integrate CDP services with your applications. Use the CDP
    SDK to connect to CDP services, create and manage clusters, and run jobs from your Java
    application or other data integration tools that you may use in your organization.
