CDP Public Cloud services
CDP Public Cloud consists of a number of cloud services designed to address specific
  enterprise data cloud use cases. 
This includes Data Hub powered by Cloudera Runtime, data services (Data Warehouse,
   Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and DataFlow), the administrative layer (Management Console),
   and SDX services (Data Lake, Data Catalog, Replication Manager, and Cloudera Observability).



Administrative layer
Management Console is a general service used by CDP administrators to manage, monitor,
    and orchestrate all of the CDP services from a single pane of glass across all environments. If
    you have deployments in your data center as well as in multiple public clouds, you can manage
    them all in one place - creating, monitoring, provisioning, and destroying services.

Workload clusters
Data Hub is a service for launching and managing workload clusters powered by
    Cloudera Runtime (Cloudera’s new unified open source distribution including the best of CDH and
    HDP). This includes a set of cloud optimized built-in templates for common workload types as
    well as a set of options allowing for extensive customization based on your enterprise’s
    needs.
Data Hub provides complete workload isolation and full elasticity so that every
    workload, every application, or every department can have their own cluster with a different
    version of the software, different configuration, and running on different infrastructure. This
    enables a more agile development process. 
Since Data Hub clusters are easy to launch and their lifecycle can be automated, you
    can create them on demand and when you don’t need them, you can return the resources to the
    cloud.

Data services
Data Engineering is an all-inclusive data engineering toolset building on
    Apache Spark that enables orchestration automation with Apache Airflow, advanced pipeline
    monitoring, visual troubleshooting, and comprehensive management tools to streamline ETL
    processes across enterprise analytics teams.
DataFlow is a cloud-native universal data distribution service powered by
    Apache NiFi that lets developers connect to any data source anywhere with any structure, process
    it, and deliver to any destination. It offers a flow-based low-code development paradigm that
    aligns best with how developers design, develop, and test data distribution pipelines.
Data Warehouse is a service for creating and managing self-service data
    warehouses for teams of data analysts. This service makes it easy for an enterprise to provision
    a new data warehouse and share a subset of the data with a specific team or department. The
    service is ephemeral, allowing you to quickly create data warehouses and terminate them once the
    task at hand is done. 
Machine Learning is a service for creating and managing self-service Machine
    Learning workspaces. This enables teams of data scientists to develop, test, train, and
    ultimately deploy machine learning models for building predictive applications all on the data
    under management within the enterprise data cloud.
Operational Database is a service for self-service creation of an operational database.
    Operational Database is a scale-out, autonomous database powered by Apache HBase and Apache
    Phoenix. You can use it for your low-latency and high-throughput use cases with the same storage
    and access layers that you are familiar with using in CDH and HDP.

Security and governance  
Shared Data Experience (SDX) is a suite of technologies that make it possible
    for enterprises to pull all their data into one place to be able to share it with many different
    teams and services in a secure and governed manner. There are four discrete services within SDX
    technologies: Data Lake, Data Catalog, Replication Manager, and Cloudera Observability.
Data Lake is a set of functionality for creating safe, secure, and governed
    data lakes which provides a protective ring around the data wherever that’s stored, be that in
    cloud object storage or HDFS. Data Lake functionality is subsumed by the Management Console
    service and related Cloudera Runtime functionality (Ranger, Atlas, Hive MetaStore).
Data Catalog is a service for searching, organizing, securing, and governing
    data within the enterprise data cloud. Data Catalog is used by data stewards to browse, search,
    and tag the content of a data lake, create and manage authorization policies (by file, table,
    column, row, and so on), identify what data a user has accessed, and access the lineage of a
    particular data set.
Replication Manager is a service for copying, migrating, snapshotting, and
    restoring data between environments within the enterprise data cloud. This service is used by
    administrators and data stewards to move, copy, backup, replicate, and restore data in or
    between data lakes. This can be done for backup, disaster recovery, or migration purposes, or to
    facilitate dev/test in another virtual environment. 
Cloudera Observability is a service for analyzing and optimizing workloads within
    the enterprise data cloud. This service is used by database and workload administrators to
    troubleshoot, analyze, and optimize workloads in order to improve performance and/or cost.
