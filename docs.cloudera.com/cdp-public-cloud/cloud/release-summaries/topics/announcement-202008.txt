Cloudera Data Warehouse


Simplified Virtual Warehouse deployment for Azure with Network
Overlay option

Network overlays make it easier to deploy a Virtual Warehouse by
reducing the number of IPs required. This capability was
previously released for AWS, and is now available for Azure.

Ability to do more advanced configuration options of HUE via
this introduced safety valve feature in the admin view


Improved load balancer health visibility




Cloudera Machine Learning


Kubernetes 1.16 Support

New ML Workspaces will be provisioned using K8s 1.16; this will
keep CML ahead of Azure’s current deprecation plan of K8s 1.15



Retry of ML Workspace Upgrades

If the upgrade of an ML Workspace fails due to an issue that has
since been resolved in a newer version, you can now retry the
upgrade from the UI to the latest version. This will help
eliminate issues and enable more frictionless upgrades.

template which is intended for small workloads as well as

to assets and columns as well as the creation of new tags from
the Data Catalog interface's asset 360 or search interfaces,
all without having to go switch to Atlas.
