Enabling overlay networks in Azure environments




Cloudera Data Warehouse


Storage account consolidation for Azure environments

CDW service no longer creates storage separate from Data Lake
storage and thereby reduces both storage footprint and
deployment complexity



CDW suspend

This optimization will help reduce operational costs

Machine Learning


CDP Data Visualization (DV) enables data engineers, business
analysts, and data scientists to quickly and easily explore data,
collaborate, and communicate explainable insights across the data
lifecycle


DV is integrated with Data Warehouse and Machine Learning to data
modeling and dashboarding out of the box; this simplifies and
speeds up the process of getting value directly into the hands of
the line of business

Cloudera Data Engineering


Cloudera Data Engineering is now Generally Available on AWS


CDE is a new curated experience for data engineers focused on
data pipeline curation, automation, and management using Spark


CDE is cloud native, leveraging Kubernetes where platform admins
can quickly provision virtual compute clusters with strong
isolation, capacity auto-scaling and quotas for cost
management


This release includes significant enhancements over the Tech
Preview




Spot instance support

Users now have an additional knob to control cost, by being able
to choose between running on Spot or On-Demand instances,
providing up to 90% discount in AWS resources



Local (native) SSD

For memory and shuffle heavy workloads, CDE now allows using
instances with local(native) SSD for intermediate results
boosting performance



Resource tags

Allows administrators to define tags during CDE service creation
to track and audit cloud provider resources



IP Whitelisting

Administrators can lock down access to the EKS control plane
components via a CIDR range



Stability & Security

New CDE service deployment will now use Kubernetes 1.15 and Helm
3; this improves the stability and security of the service
moving forward



Cloudera Data Hub


Data Discovery and Exploration Template (Tech Preview) now
includes a spark connector


Provides support for indexing of RDDs and for Spark Streaming


Facilitates speedier data ingestion pipelines to Solr, while
allowing all the power and flexibility of Spark to transform
and process data on its way to be served




The “7.2.0 - Operational Database” DataHub template includes HUE
for HBase DML/DDL

This greatly simplifies the process of data exploration and query



SDX


[Tech Preview] SDX Backup/Restore on AWS

Reduced risk and simplified management to CDP continuity and
recovery through a convenient
process
to backup and restore SDX configurations



Management Console & Control Plane


Billing and Metering in MyCloudera Portal

Currency Charges are now available for all customers with active
prepay or pay-as-you go subscriptions
