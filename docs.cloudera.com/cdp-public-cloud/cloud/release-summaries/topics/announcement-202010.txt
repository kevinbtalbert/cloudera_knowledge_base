New Or Updated Capabilities
Documentation


Management Console


Renew host certificates on Data Lake and Data Hub
clusters


Prerequisites for adding classic clusters with a
non-transparent
proxy


Creating a machine user in
CDP

environment


Register an Azure
environment




Data Warehouse

Add external S3 buckets to CDW



Cloudera Data Warehouse


The CDP cli now supports CDW

This will allow administrators to automate administrative tasks
such as activation, catalog/warehouse provisioning, pause,
resume, etc



CDP Data Visualization


CDP Data Visualization is now Generally Available


Data Visualization enables data engineers, data scientists,
business analysts, and business users to quickly and easily
explore data, collaborate, act on, and communicate explainable
insights across the data lifecycle.


Fully integrated with CDW and CML, Data Visualization enables
self-service, drag-and-drop visualizations from both
enterprise data and predictive models natively in CDP,
enabling:

Fast, intelligent reporting – Rapid, out-of-the-box
dashboarding and application building with built-in visual
recommendations
Intuitive workflows, secured by SDX – Easy-to-use visual UI
for fast data exploration and instant sharing anywhere
without moving data or creating silos
Integrated data lifecycle collaboration – Accelerate
insight sharing with a consistent, integrated data
visualization experience across all data and business teams





Cloudera Machine Learning


Public / Unauthenticated Access To Applications


For Applications served by CML that do not contain sensitive
data nor require tight controls on who can access them, users
can now deploy Applications that do not require authentication
into CML


Note that Administrators can entirely disable this functionality
for an ML Workspace if needed




Pass User Information To Applications

Via the REMOTE_USER header, deployed Applications can be
developed to customize the content being presented
specifically to the logged in user



Updated Sessions Page

A new table design has been applied to the Sessions page, making
it easier to take actions such as filtering down to running
sessions and performing bulk deletion of old Sessions



Scale to 0 Workers in AWS

CML Worker Nodes in AWS deployments are now able to fully scale
down to 0, where previously the S2I builder (used in building
images for Experiments, Models, etc) was preventing this from
occurring



Kubernetes Upgrades via Management Console

Workspace Upgrades executed from the Management Console now
include the ability to upgrade the K8s version of the ML
Workspace; this is done as required by the ML Workspace
version and does not require any additional steps from the
Administrator



Integration with RAZ for ADLS-Gen2

With the introduction of RAZ in CDP-7.2.1, access to ADLS-Gen2
from CML can be authorized using Ranger policies



Subnet Details on ML Workspace Details Page

After creation of an ML Workspace, Administrators can now view
the subnets in use by the workspace on the ML Workspace
Details Page



Cloudera Data Hub


Streaming Analytics for Data Hub GA


Users can now launch fully secured streaming analytics clusters
to run Apache Flink jobs on Public Cloud


Run Streaming SQL queries against data from Streams Messaging
(Kafka) clusters in Data Hub.




Consistent Hostnames for Data Hub clusters

All hostnames are deterministic and consistent when Data Hub
clusters of the same name are deleted and recreated, providing
stable endpoints for applications



[Tech Preview] DataHub Autoscaling is now available on Azure

Data Hub clusters running YARN can autoscale compute resources
based on schedules or load. This feature is now available
under entitlement for both AWS and Azure



SDX


[Tech Preview] Improvements on Fine-grained Access Control for
ADLS cloud storage via the Ranger Authorization Service (RAZ)


RAZ for ADLS is now available for tech preview in all Azure
regions. The Microsoft Azure team has deployed a prerequisite
service to all regions across the globe. Previously tech
previews were limited to Azure environments hosted in the East
US, West US, Canada Central, Canada East, Hong Kong and
Singapore regions.


RAZ for ALDS environments can now be created via the UX for the
Registration wizard. Users no longer need to use the CLI and
use custom image catalogs.




[Tech Preview] External interoperation simplified by RAZ for
ADLS's integration with Azure Active Directory's Identities


Simplified security for enabling CDP to consume and publish data
to services outside of CDP.


Customers using Azure Active Directory as their IdP can enable
this to have CDP automatically respect ADLS file ownership and
confer ownership to files that are respected by Azure services
outside of CDP. For example, if a user writes a file to ADLS
outside of CDP, that user could automatically access the file
within CDP. Similarly a file written to ADLS in CDP can be
consumed by the corresponding user outside of CDP. Without
this feature enabled, all CDP files are owned by a single
superuser like identity and would require extra group mapping
or ownership changes to enable access.




[Tech Preview] Fine-grained Access control for S3 cloud storage
via RAZ.


Reduce security risk, improve compliance and eliminate
unintended data deletion with the addition of the Ranger
Authentication Service (RAZ) for AWS S3. CDP on AWS users gain
fine-grained access control policy and auditing capabilities
on their file system accesses. Rather than handling access
controls to cloud storage at the group level, individual users
now can have individual home directories that are protected
from other users. This unlocks a host of benefits:

Spark users can now work against files in their own
directories
Classification tags on file system directories can be
propagated through data lineage
More complete migration for legacy HDP users with HDFS
Ranger policies directly ported to CDP in AWS.
Legacy CDH users now have the comparable file access audit
capabilities to those Cloudera Navigator provided.



This Tech Preview is only available for Data Hub clusters




[Tech Preview] On Azure, the external postgres database can be
accessed via a Private Link Endpoint

Reduce risk, simplify the network architecture and eliminate
data exposure to the public internet.



[Tech Preview] Data Lake upgrades are now available

Environment upgrades from Cloudera Runtime 7.1 to 7.2 are now
supported, as well as patch upgrades of both Cloudera Runtime
and Cloudera manager, and OS-only upgrades



Cloudera Data Catalog


Streamlined cross-environment search.


When users perform a search in the context of a specific
environment, the # of results for the corresponding search in
other environments is now presented.


This enables users to find data in other environments and easily
navigate to them without having to change environment and
re-perform the search.




Management Console & Control Plane


CLI/API updates now include a changelog

A new version of the Management Console API & cdpcli is
released, all changes are captured in the changelog



[Tech Preview] Expanded Set of Control Plane Roles for Improved
Authorization


A number of new roles have been introduced to provide finer
grained authorization over management console resources such
as DataHub clusters, cloud credentials, cluster templates,
cluster definitions, image catalogs and recipes


This will reduce the dependency on PowerUser role with the
introduction of:

Account role EnvironmentCreator permits creation of
environments and shared resources (cloud credentials,
cluster definitions, recipes, image catalog and cluster
templates)
Environment role DataHubCreator to allow creation of data
hub clusters



Authorization at an individual data hub level is possible with
DataHubAdmin and DataHubUser roles


An individual or group can be assigned as Owner of a CDP
resource
