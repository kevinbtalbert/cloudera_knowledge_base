Customer managed encryption keys
By default, Data Lake and FreeIPA's Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes and
  Relational Database Service (RDS) are encrypted using a default key from Amazon’s KMS, but you can
  optionally configure encryption using Customer Managed Keys (CMK). Data Hubs inherit environment's
  encryption key by default but you have an option to specify a different CMK during Data Hub
  creation.
Amazon offers the option to encrypt EBS volumes and RDS instances using a default key
   from Amazon's Key Management System (KMS) or using an external customer-managed KMS. By default,
   Data Lake and FreeIPA are encrypted using the default key from Amazon’s KMS present in the region
   where the environment is running, but you can provide a customer-managed KMS key instead of the
   default key.  Encryption is configured for block devices and root devices. When encryption is
   configured for a given cluster, it is automatically applied to all the disk devices of any new VM
   instances added as a result of cluster scaling or repair.

Environment and Data Hub encryption options 
By default, Data Hubs use the same default key from Amazon’s KMS or CMK as the
    parent environment but you have an option to pass a different CMK during Data Hub creation. 
All possible scenarios are summarized in the following table:

EBS and RDS encryption for Data Lake, FreeIPA, and Data Hubs is with the
            default regional encryption key.





Present
Absent


EBS and RDS encryption for Data Lake, FreeIPA, and all Data Hubs is with the CMK
           provided during environment registration.




Present
Present



EBS and RDS encryption for Data Lake and FreeIPA is with the CMK provided
            during environment registration. 


If a CMK is provided for a Data Hub, then EBS encryption for the Data Hub is
            with the CMK provided per host group during the Data Hub creation.





Absent
Present



No EBS and RDS encryption is configured for Data Lake and FreeIPA.


EBS encryption for the specific Data Hub is with the default or CMK provided
            per host group during Data Hub creation.







Permissions for using encryption
If you are planning to use encryption, ensure that the cross-account IAM role used for the provisioning
    credential includes the following permissions:
EC2 permissions

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "ec2:CopyImage",
      "ec2:CreateSnapshot",
      "ec2:DeleteSnapshot",
      "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
      "ec2:CreateVolume",
      "ec2:DeleteVolume",
      "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
      "ec2:DeregisterImage",
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
  }
}

KMS
    permissions{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "kms:DescribeKey",
      "kms:ListKeys",
      "kms:ListAliases"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
  }
}
If planning to use encryption, ensure that your existing encryption key can be used or create
    a new encryption key.

Ensuring that an existing encryption key can be used
If you already have an existing encryption key, make sure that the key fulfills the
    following requirements.
If you have an existing encryption key that you would like to use with Data Hub,
    make sure that:


The following are attached as key user:


The AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling built-in role.


Your IAM role or IAM user used for the cloud credential.




To check that these are attached, in the AWS Management Console, navigate to the
      KMS console > Customer managed keys, select your encryption key, and scroll to Key Users.


The encryption key is located in the same region where you would like to create
      clusters with encrypted volumes.



Creating a new encryption key on AWS
If you don't have an existing encryption key, use the following instructions to
    create one.


In the AWS Management Console, navigate to KMS console.


Select Customer managed keys.


From the Region dropdown, select the region in which you would like to create and
      use the encryption key.


Click Create key.


In Step 1: Configure Key:


Under Key type, choose Symmetric.


Expand Advanced Options and under Key Material Origin, select “KMS” or
        “External”.




In Step 2: Create Alias and Description:


Enter an alias for your key.


Defining tags is optional.




In Step 3: Define Key Administrative Permissions, select the following:


Choose your own IAM user/role used for logging into the AWS Management Console.
        Do not set AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling or the cross-account IAM role as the key
        admin.




In Step 4: Define Key Usage Permissions:


Select the AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling built-in role.


Select the cross-account IAM role.




In Step 5: Review and edit key policy, you may optionally tweak the key policy as
      desired, or simply leave it as generated by AWS.


Navigate to the last page of the wizard and then click
       Finish to create an encryption key.
