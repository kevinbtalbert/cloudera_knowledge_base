Cross-account access IAM roleCloudera Docs
Cross-account access IAM role
To allow CDP to create resources in your AWS account, you create a cross-account access
  IAM role in your AWS account and grant CDP access to the role as a trusted principal by specifying
  a specific AWS account and an external ID. 
The policy for the cross-account access IAM role must have the permissions enumerated in the
      documentation linked below. In addition, the IAM role must reference the specific AWS account
      ID and external ID provided in the Management Console.

IAM policy definitions
When creating an IAM policy for the provisioning credential, use the following IAM
      policy definitions.
You have two options:


Option
Description
Policies



Default policy
This policy is appropriate for registering a CDP environment and
                     provisioning all CDP services. This is the same IAM policy as the
                        Default policy provided in the Management Console web
                     interface. 


Default policy





Reduced access policies
Instead of the extensive default policy, you can use minimal reduced access
                     policies. Note that the first policy is required for provisioning a CDP
                     environment. The remaining policies are optional and are only needed if you
                     would like to use the specific CDP services.


Minimal policy for CDP environment, Data
                              Hub, and Operational Database (COD)
Minimal policy for Cloudera Data
                           Engineering (CDE)

Minimal policy for Cloudera Data

Create a cross-account IAM role
In order to use role-based authentication, you must create an IAM role on
        AWS.
Prior to creating a cross-account IAM role on AWS, log in to
            the CDP web interface and obtain the parameters that need to provide for the IAM
                role:
In the Management Console, navigate to Environments > Shared Resources >
                    Credentials > Create Credential:
Note or copy the Cross-account Access Policy, Account ID, and
                    External ID listed here:note
The external ID is tied to the CDP user who obtained it. Therefore, only
                            the user who obtained the external ID is able to complete the credential
                            creation flow in CDP with a given external ID. If a CDP user tries using
                            an IAM role with an external ID obtained by another CDP user, CDP will
                            return an error message.
You will need them to complete the following steps.

Log in to the AWS Management Console.

Navigate to the IAM console > Roles and click Create
                        Role:





In the “Create Role” wizard, select Another AWS account role type. Next, provide
        the following:
In the Account ID field, copy and paste your Account ID provided in CDP.
Under Options, check Require external ID and under External ID,
                            copy and paste the External ID from CDP.


When done, click Next: Permissions to navigate to the next page in the
        wizard.Click Create policy and the create policy wizard will open in a new browser tab:


Select the JSON view, and copy and paste the policy definition. You can
                    either copy it from the Management Console web interface or from
                    documentation:







When done, navigate to Review policy. 
On the Review policy page, in the Name field, enter a name for
                    your policy:



When done, click Create Policy.Return to the previous browser tab where you started creating a new role (since the create
        policy wizard was opened in a new browser tab).
Click Refresh. 

Find the policy that you just created and select it by checking the box:





When done, click Next: Review.
In the Roles name field, enter role name.





When done, click Create role to finish the role creation process.
Obtain the IAM Role ARN. You will need it to create a role-based
                    credential:



Once you are done creating the IAM role on AWS, create a role-based credential in CDP.

Reduced access policy definition
The following reduced policy definition can optionally be used to register a CDP
  environment and create Data Hubs and Operational Databases in it. 
noteThis policy is only sufficient for registering a CDP environment and creating Data Hubs and
   Operational Databases in it. In order to use other CDP services, you must add additional
   service-specific permissions to your cross-account role.


The IAM role used for the provisioning credential can use the reduced access policy instead of the default
     policy. 
You should:


Copy this policy.


Update it as described below.

Once done, you can create the cross-account role using this policy.



Customize the scope of iam:PassRole
CDP utilizes the iam:PassRole as part of the cloud identity federation setup process
    via IDBroker on AWS. The default policy uses “*” as the resource scope for this action:
    {
     "Effect": "Allow
      "Action": [
        "iam:PassRole"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
}
However the scope can be reduced to just a few roles. To do this, you need to edit
    the following block and replace the “*” with the ARNs of the following roles used for the
    environment:

IDBROKER_ROLE
LOG_ROLE
RANGER_AUDIT_ROLE
DATALAKE_ADMIN_ROLE

You choose the name for these roles when you set up CDP as part of the Minimal Setup for Cloud Storage. 
After updating according to the minimal setup for cloud storage, the iam:PassRole
    policy excerpt should like similar to the following: 
{
      "Effect": "Allow
      "Action": [
        "iam:PassRole"
      ],
      "Resource": [
               "arn:aws:iam::$ACCOUNTID:role/IDBROKER_ROLE",
               "arn:aws:iam::$ACCOUNTID:role/LOG_ROLE",
               “arn:aws:iam::$ACCOUNTID:role/RANGER_AUDIT_ROLE",
               "arn:aws:iam::$ACCOUNTID:role/DATALAKE_ADMIN_ROLE"
           ]
}
If you have already created these roles and you don’t know the name of these roles, you can
    obtain them using the following steps:
IDBROKER_ROLE

Log in to CDP web interface and navigate to the Management Console service
     > Data Lakes.
Scroll down to where you see Event History and select the Hardware
     tab. 
Locate the EC2 instance for the idbroker node (if you are running Medium
     Duty Data Lake, you will see two IDBroker nodes, you can use either):


Click on the instance id. You will be redirected to the EC2 console.
In the Instance Details section for this node, you can see the name of the IAM role
     being used by this instance. Click on this role to get to the details.
Copy the ARN of the instance profile. It follows the following naming convention:
      arn:aws:iam::<12-digit-AWS-account-id>:instance-profile/<name-of-idbroker-role>

LOG_ROLE

Navigate to Environments .
Click on the existing environment 
Click on the Summary tab.
Scroll to Logs Storage and Audits and you will see the Instance Profile
     entry. 
Copy the ARN of the Instance Profile:



RANGER_AUDIT_ROLE and DATALAKE_ADMIN_ROLE

Navigate to Environments.
Click on the existing environment. 
From the Actions menu, select Manage Access.
Click on the IDBroker Mappings tab.
Under Current Mappings you will see the mappings for the Data Access Role and
      Ranger Audit Role.
Copy the ARNs of the Data Access Role and Ranger Audit Role: 




Further permissions reduction (Optional)


You can reduce these policies even further by pre-creating some resources:

If you set up your own VPC and subnets, then the following actions can be removed from the
       policy:ec2:CreateVpc
ec2:CreateNatGateway
ec2:CreateRouteTable
ec2:CreateSubnet
ec2:CreateVpcEndpoint
ec2:CreateInternetGateway
ec2:DeleteSubnet
ec2:DeleteInternetGateway
ec2:AttachInternetGateway

If you use your own security groups, then the following actions can be removed from the
       policy:ec2:CreateSecurityGroup
ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress
ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupEgress
ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress
If you use private IPs or set up CCM to communicate with the CDP Control Plane, then the
       following actions can be removed from the
       policy:ec2:CreateSecurityGroup
ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress
ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupEgress
ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress
If you use private IPs or set up CCM to communicate with the CDP Control Plane, then the
       following actions can be removed from the
       policy:ec2:AllocateAddress
ec2:ReleaseAddress
If you create your own DynamoDB table for S3Guard, then the following actions can be
       removed from the policy: dynamodb:DeleteTable
