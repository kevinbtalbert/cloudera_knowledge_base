EC2 instances
CDP provisions EC2 instances as part of environment creation process (for Data Lake and
  FreeIPA) and for compute clusters.
Therefore, you should verify the limits on the number and type of EC2 instances in your AWS
   account to ensure that you are able to provision an environment and create clusters in CDP.
CDP supports Amazon EC2 reserved instances; That is, If you have purchased reserved instances,
   CDP uses them automatically according to AWS policy.
On AWS, you can access EC2 instance metadata from a running instance using IMDSv1 or IMDSv2.
   CDP supports IMDSv1 but does not support IMDSv2, so you should not enable IMDSv2 alone for any
   EC2 instances used by CDP. For information about configuring IMDS, refer to Configuring the instance metadata service.
For a list of supported EC2 instance types, refer to Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud service
   rates.

Custom images
By default CDP provides a set of default images that are used for all provisioned VMs,
  but you can optionally use custom images for Data Lake, FreeIPA, and Data Hub.
You might require a custom image for compliance or security reasons (a “hardened” image), or to
   have your own packages pre-installed on the image, for example monitoring tools or software. 
If you would like to use custom images instead of the default images, refer to Custom images and image catalogs.
