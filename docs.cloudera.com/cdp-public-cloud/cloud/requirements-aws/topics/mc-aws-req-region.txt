AWS region
Prior to registering an environment, you should decide which AWS region you would like
  to use. 
A single AWS environment registered in CDP corresponds to a single VPC located in a
   specific region, and all the resources deployed by CDP on AWS are deployed into that VPC. 
Typically, you may want to deploy clusters into the same region that contains the S3
   buckets that you want to access for input and output data. Therefore, when selecting the region
   to use, you should consider where your data is located. Furthermore, CDP requires that the S3
   storage location provided during environment registration is in the same region as the region
   selected for the environment. 
If you need to use multiple regions, you need to register multiple environments, one
   per region.
