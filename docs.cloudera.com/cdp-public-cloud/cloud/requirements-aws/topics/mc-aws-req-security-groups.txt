Security groups
Security groups determine the inbound and outbound traffic to and from your CDP
  environment. That is, you should use security group settings to allow users from your organization
  access to CDP resources.
You have two options:

Use your existing security groups (recommended for production)
Have CDP create new security groups

You should verify the security group limits in your AWS account to ensure that you can create
   security groups for CDP. 
Existing security groups
If you would like to create your own security groups, two security groups must be created: the
    first security group will be used for all gateway nodes and the second security group will be
    used for all other nodes. The gateway nodes accept incoming requests for the cluster services
    and so require an additional port. These security groups will be applied when creating a data
    lake and FreeIPA during environment creation and when you create Data Hub clusters. 
Review the following guidelines prior to adding security groups rules. This describes all the
    inbound ports that need to be open and provides guidelines for what to enter as a source
    range:


noteThe communication via TCP/UDP 0-65535 and ICMP is essential for healthy operation of
          CDP environments, Data Hubs, and data services running within the VPC, so ensure that you open these ports as
          described below. While some services only need well-known fixed ports, a majority of them
          depend on ephemeral (i.e. dynamically or randomly allocated) ports; This is why the
          wildcard 0-65535 TCP/UDP port range is used in the absence of a detailed breakdown of
          individual ports. Since overall access to the VPC is typically secured by other means, the use of the wildcard
          rules does not pose a higher risk against external attacks.

Gateway security group
This is used for gateway nodes:

Description



TCP
22
Your CIDR
This is an optional port for end user SSH access to cluster hosts.
                  You should open it to your organization’s CIDR. 


TCP
443
Your CIDR and CDP
                  CIDR
This port is used to access the Data Lake and Data Hub cluster UIs
                  via Knox gateway. You must open this port to your organization’s CIDR in order to
                  access cluster UIs. When CCM is enabled, you only need to set this to your
                      CIDR.


TCP
9443
CDP CIDR
This port is used by CDP to maintain management control of clusters and data
                  lakes. By default, when CDP creates the security groups
                    automatically, it opens this port to the correct IP.This port is not
                      needed when CCM is enabled.


TCP, UDP
0-65535
Your internal VPC CIDR (for example 10.10.0.0/16).
This is required for internal communication within the VPC.


ICMP
N/A
Your internal VPC CIDR
                  (for example 10.10.0.0/16).
This is required for internal communication within the VPC.


Example rules provided in the VPC console on AWS:

This is an optional port for end user SSH access to the hosts. You
                  should open it to your organization’s CIDR. 


TCP
443
Your CIDR
This port is only required if you are planning to spin up Machine Learning
                  workspaces since HTTPS access to ML workspaces is available over port 443. If you
                  are not planning to use the Machine Learning service, you do not need to open this
                  port.
                  


TCP
9443
CDP CIDR
This port is used by CDP to maintain management control of clusters and data
                  lakes. By default, when CDP creates the security groups
                    automatically, it opens this port to the correct IP.This port is not
                      needed when CCM is enabled.

Your VPC CIDR
                  (for example 10.10.0.0/16).
This is required for internal communication within the VPC. TCP port 5432 is used by
                  the Data Lake for communication with its attached database. 


ICMP
N/A
Your internal VPC CIDR
                  (for example 10.10.0.0/16).
This is required for internal communication within the VPC.


Example rules provided in the VPC console on AWS:



On AWS, you can create security groups and edit their rules from the VPC console >
     Security Groups.To create a security group, click on Create security group and
     provide the following:






You need to create two security groups: Knox and Default (You will see this
     terminology in the Management Console UI and CLI, so if you decide to choose different names,
     make sure that you are able to distinguish between the two security groups). 
Use the guidelines and examples provided above when editing rules.
To edit security group rules, select the security group and click on Inbound Rules > Edit
      rules:






note
There is a known issue where even if you create and specify your own security groups, the
      Data Warehouse and Machine Learning services create their own security groups. For
      instructions on how to restrict access on the security groups created by the Data Warehouse
      service, refer to  Restricting access to endpoints in AWS
      environments.


New security groups 
If you would like CDP to create the security groups for you, you need to provide a CIDR range
    for inbound traffic to EC2 instances from your organization. CDP creates multiple security
    groups: one for each Data Lake host group, one for each FreeIPA host group, and one per host
    group when DataFlow, Data Hub, Data Warehouse, and Machine Learning clusters are created. On
    these security groups, CDP opens ports as described in Default security group settings documentation.
