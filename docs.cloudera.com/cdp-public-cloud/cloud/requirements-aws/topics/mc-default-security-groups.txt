Default security group settings on AWSCloudera Docs
Default security group settings on AWS
Depending on what you chose during environment creation, CDP can create security groups
  for your environment automatically or you can provide your own security groups. 

note
Even if you create and specify your own security groups, the Data Engineering, Data
     Warehouse, and Machine Learning services create their own security groups. Refer to Restricting access for CDP services that create their own
       security groups on AWS for instructions on how to restrict access. 



noteThe communication via TCP/UDP 0-65535 and ICMP is essential for healthy operation of
          CDP environments, Data Hubs, and data services running within the VPC, so ensure that you open these ports as
          described below. While some services only need well-known fixed ports, a majority of them
          depend on ephemeral (i.e. dynamically or randomly allocated) ports; This is why the
          wildcard 0-65535 TCP/UDP port range is used in the absence of a detailed breakdown of
          individual ports. Since overall access to the VPC is typically secured by other means, the use of the wildcard
          rules does not pose a higher risk against external attacks.

Environment security groups
Depending on what you chose during environment creation, CDP can create security
    groups for your environment automatically or you can provide your own security groups. 

If you choose to use your own security groups, you are asked to create Knox
     and Default security groups as described in the Security groups documentation. 
If you choose for CDP to create all security groups required for an environment,
     the following security groups are created:

Data Lake: master
AWS naming convention:
     ${environment-name}-${random-id}-ClusterNodeSecurityGroupmaster-${random-id}

Description



TCP
22
Your CIDR
This is an optional port for end user SSH access to cluster hosts. You
        should open it to your organization’s CIDR.


TCP
443
Your CIDR and CDP CIDR
This port is used to access the Data Lake and Data Hub cluster UIs via Knox
        gateway. You should open it to your organization’s CIDR in order to access cluster
         UIs.This port is also required if you are planning to spin up Machine Learning

         workspaces since HTTPS access to ML workspaces is available over port 443. If you are not
         planning to use the Machine Learning service, you do not need to open this port.
         When
          CCM is enabled, you only need to set this to your CIDR.


TCP
9443
CDP CIDR

This port is used by CDP to maintain management control of clusters and data

        lakes. This port is not used when CCM is enabled.


TCP, UDP
0-65535
Your VPC’s CIDR (for
         example 10.10.0.0/16) and your subnet’s CIDR (for example 10.0.2.0/24).
This is required for internal communication within the VPC.


ICMP
N/A
Your internal VPC CIDR (for
         example 10.10.0.0/16).
This is required for internal communication within the VPC.

Data Hub security groups
Depending on what you chose during environment creation, CDP can create security
    groups for your Data Hub clusters automatically or it can use your pre-created security
    groups:

If during environment creation, you provided your own security groups, CDP uses
     these security groups when deploying clusters. 
If during environment creation you chose for CDP to create new security groups,
     new security groups are created for each Data Hub cluster as follows:

Data Hub: master
