IAM policy definitions for the minimal cloud storage setup
Use the following IAM policy definitions when defining IAM policies for the minimal
    cloud storage setup described in the parent topic. 


Note that:

The policy definitions refer to roles by using the convention presented in the
            table in the parent topic. If the IAM roles that you created use different names, you
            should update these names in the policy definitions below. 
The policy definitions refer to the example S3 subdirectories presented in the
            parent topic. If the S3 bucket sub-directories that you created use different names, you
            should update these names in the policy definitions below. 

While creating these IAM policies, make sure to replace the following with actual
     values:

${ARN_PARTITION} - Replace this with "aws". Or, if you are using one
            of China regions, replace it with "aws-cn". See Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).
            
${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID} - Replace this with your our AWS account
            ID.
${DATALAKE_BUCKET} - Replace this with the name of your S3
            bucket. For example my-bucket.
${STORAGE_LOCATION_BASE} - Replace this with the path to your
            Data Lake directory in the S3 bucket specified as
            ${DATALAKE_BUCKET}/SOME_PATH. For example my-bucket/my-dl.
${LOGS_BUCKET} - Replace this with the name of your S3 bucket for logs.
            For example my-bucket.
${LOGS_LOCATION_BASE} - Replace this with the path to your S3
            location for logs. For example my-bucket/my-dl.
${BACKUP_BUCKET} - Replace this with the name of your S3 bucket for
            backups. For example my-bucket.
${BACKUP_LOCATION_BASE} - Replace this with the path to your S3
            location for backups. This location is used for both FreeIPA and Data Lake backups. For
            example my-bucket/my-dl.



aws-cdp-idbroker-assume-role-policy

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}


note
The * in the aws-cdp-idbroker-assume-role-policy means that the IDBroker
      role will be able to assume any role that also has a trust with the IDBroker role. If
      preferred, the resource can be a list of role ARNs, but this policy would need to be updated
      each time a new role is mapped. Both a trust from the target role to the IDBroker role and an
      AssumeRole policy are necessary for roles to be assumed.



aws-cdp-log-policy
Refer to aws-cdp-log-policy.json.
        

aws-cdp-backup-policy
Refer to aws-cdp-backup-policy.json.
        
noteThe aws-cdp-backup-policy policy is only required if your Backup
        Location Base is in a separate bucket.

aws-cdp-ranger-audit-s3-policy
Refer to aws-cdp-ranger-audit-s3-policy.json.
        

aws-cdp-datalake-admin-s3-policy
Refer to aws-cdp-datalake-admin-s3-policy.json.

aws-cdp-bucket-access-policy
Refer to aws-cdp-bucket-access-policy.json.

note
If using multiple buckets for Storage Location Base, Logs Location Base,
            and Backup Location Base, the aws-cdp-bucket-access-policy needs
            to have all the buckets specified. 



note
The action "s3:ListAllMyBuckets" is optional and allows Hue to display
            a list of buckets in the S3 browser. Without "s3:ListAllMyBuckets", a
            user must explicitly enter which S3 bucket they want to browse in Hue.



aws-datalake-backup-policy
Refer to aws-datalake-backup-policy.json.
        

aws-datalake-restore-policy
Refer to aws-datalake-restore-policy.json.
