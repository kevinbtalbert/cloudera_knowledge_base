IAM policy definitions for cloud storage location users
Use the following IAM policy definitions when defining IAM policies for cloud storage
        location users, such as data scientists and data engineers. 
Note that:


The policy definitions refer to roles by using the convention presented in the
                    table in the parent topic. If the IAM roles that you created use different
                    names, you should update these names in the policy definitions below. 


The policy definitions refer to the example S3 subdirectories presented in the
                    parent topic. If the S3 bucket sub-directories that you created use different
                    names, you should update these names in the policy definitions below. 


While creating these IAM policies, make sure to replace the following with actual
    values:


${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID} - Your AWS account ID. 


${DATALAKE_PATH} - Path to your Data Lake directory under the
       Storage Location Base. For example my-bucket/my-dl. This does not have to be
      under the Storage Location Base, but for simplicity this example assumes it is a
      subdirectory of the Storage Location Base.
