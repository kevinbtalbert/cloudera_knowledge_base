ADLS Gen2 and managed identities for logs, backups, and data storage
CDP requires that you create and provide an Azure Data Lake Store Gen 2 (ADLS Gen2)
    storage account and create a container within it for storing workload data and logs.
    Furthermore, in order for CDP to be able to access this container, you must create and assign
    managed identities. 
You must provide the following:
Create an ADLS Gen2 storage account with hierarchical namespace enabled. The storage
          account must be in the same region as the environment.
You must create and provide multiple user-assigned managed identities that allow access to the ADLS
          Gen2 location.

 CDP supports both standard and premium ADLS Gen2 storage accounts. 
For more information about the ADLS Gen2 container and managed identities setup, refer to the
      followingÂ documentation:

Minimal setup for Azure cloud storageThis minimal secure setup uses one ADLS Gen2 storage account with multiple containers     in it, and multiple managed identities where each managed identity has at least one role     assigned. Onboarding CDP users and groups for Azure cloud storage (RAZ environments)If your Azure environment has Fine-grained access control enabled, you should onboard   your users using Ranger instead of using IDBroker. Onboarding CDP users and groups for Azure cloud storage (No RAZ)The minimal setup defined earlier spins up a CDP environment and Data Lake with no end     user access to cloud storage. Adding users and groups to a CDP environment involves ensuring     that they are properly mapped to managed identities to access cloud storage.Using ADLS Gen2 encryptionBy default ADLS Gen2 uses TLS. If you use the       fs.azure.always.use.https property to turn off this behavior, you must     specify abfss as the prefix in the URI to use TLS. Otherwise, you can use abfs.Parent topic: Azure resources and services
