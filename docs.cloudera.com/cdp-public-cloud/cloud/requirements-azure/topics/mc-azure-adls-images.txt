ADLS Gen2 account for storing operating system images
CDP uses an ADLS Gen2 storage account for storing operating system images used for VMs.
  By default, CDP creates this account during environment registration, but you can optionally
  pre-create it. If needed, you can also copy the VHD files and create image resources manually. 
CDP uses an ADLS Gen2 for storing operating system images used for VMs. These images
   are used for:

Data Lake and Data Hub clusters (A single image is used for both)
FreeIPA (A separate image is used)

For each of these, there is one image for each Runtime version and for each Azure
   region.
Preparing images for VMs on Azure is a three-step process, involving the following
   steps:

Creating a new storage account in your subscription. The storage account is
    reachable from all networks so that CDP can access it (although the storage container is
    private).
Copying one or more virtual hard disks (VHDs) from Cloudera’s regional storage
    account to your storage account created earlier.
Creating an image resource from each copied VHD.

By default, these steps are performed automatically by CDP during the “Setting up CDP
   image” and the “Creating infrastructure” steps of launching a stack. However, if due to your
   organization’s security policies, you do not want CDP to create your storage account or you do
   not want the storage account to be publicly available, you have two alternatives:


Scenario
Solution
Steps



You do not want CDP to create a storage account in your Azure subscription or
       CDP is not granted the permission to create new storage accounts in your Azure subscription,
       but you are willing to provide CDP access to the storage account once it exists.
Manually pre-create a storage account that is available from all networks,
       and once it exists, CDP can copy VHD files and create the image resources. 
Refer to Creating the storage account for images
        manually.


Image copying by CDP is not possible because the storage account should not
       be publicly available. 
You should perform all three steps manually.
See all three steps linked in this section.



note
The storage account and the VHDs themselves are not deleted upon deleting the environment to
     save time when creating future environments.


If you would like to perform these manual steps, refer to the following instructions.

Creating a storage account for operating system images manually
In some cases where your organization’s security policies require it, you may want to
    manually pre-create the storage account that CDP uses for storing operating system
    images.
Steps

Create a resource group on Azure with the name “cloudbreak-images”.
Create a storage account on Azure. 
The name is the concatenation of the following elements. It is different
            depending on whether or not you would like to use your existing resource group for CDP:
                Table 1. 


Naming convention



Single existing resource group
Enter a name that is a simple concatenation of the following four
                        elements:
“cbimg”
Region identifier: The starting letters of the region where
                          the SA is. For example, “eu” for East US, or “eu2” for
                            East US 2
The adler32 checksum without leading zeroes of the
                          Subscription ID, without hyphens ('-') and all lowercase. For example
                          a9d4456e-349f-46f5-bc73-54a8d523e504 => a9d4456e349f46f5bc7354a8d523e504
                          => 8e63086f
The adler32 checksum without leading zeroes of the resource
                          group name. For example rg-my-cool-single-rg => 4e23077c
When you put these together, if the storage account is in
                        East US 2 region in a resource group called “rg-my-cool-single-rg” and with
                        a Subscription ID of a9d4456e-349f-46f5-bc73-54a8d523e504, the storage
                        account name would be cbimgeu28e63086f4e23077cFor the adler32
                      calculation, you can use the Online ADLER32 Hash Calculator. 
noteMake sure to remove all leading zeroes from the calculator's output.
                          For example, if your resource group name is "cdppoc", convert it as
                          follows: cdppoc => 089d027a => 89d027a



Multiple resource groups created by CDP
 Enter a name that is the concatenation of the following three
                        elements:
“cbimg”
Region identifier: The starting letters of the region where
                          the SA is. For example, “eu” for East US, or “eu2” for
                            East US 2
Subscription ID, without hyphens ('-') and all lowercase. For
                          example, if your subscription ID is a9d4456e-349f-46f5-bc73-54a8d523e504,
                          you should convert it to a9d4456e349f46f5bc7354a8d523e504
When you put these together, if the storage account is in East US 2
                      region in subscription a9d4456e-349f-46f5-bc73-54a8d523e504, the storage
                      account name would be cbimgeu2a9d4456e349f46f5bc7354a8d523e504



Disable hierarchical namespace. Make sure not to omit this setting as it cannot be changed
      after the storage account is created.




Copying an image manually
In some cases where your organization’s security policies require it, you must manually
  copy images to the storage account designated for image storage.
caution
Cloudera creates new images for CDP frequently for all new Runtime versions and occasional OS
    bug fixes. Whenever a new image is available, it is not possible to launch new clusters until
    the image is copied. Furthermore, many features may not work correctly unless new images are
    copied to your storage account. For example, OS upgrade requires new images being present in
    your storage account. 
The presence of new images can be monitored in the CDP image catalog at https://cloudbreak-imagecatalog.s3.amazonaws.com/v3-prod-cb-image-catalog.json or in
     CDP web interface > Management Console > Shared Resources > Image Catalogs >
    cdp-default.

When copying the images, follow these high-level steps:

Create a container named “images” and copy all images to that container. Make sure
    to create a page blob. 
Note the URL of the created container. You will need it to perform the copying
      process. 

Identify the FreeIPA image that needs to be copied. You should use the latest image from
        the FreIPA image catalog available at https://cloudbreak-imagecatalog.s3.amazonaws.com/v3-prod-freeipa-image-catalog.json. 

Identify the Data Lake and Data Hub image(s) that need to be copied and note the VHD
          URLs. Both Data Lake and Data Hub use the same image, so there is one image used for both
          for each Runtime version. There are two ways to find these images in the CDP image
          catalog:

In CDP web interface > Management Console > Shared Resources > Image Catalogs
              > cdp-default >  search for your Runtime version > Click on UUID of your selected
            entry (For each Runtime version, there should be only one entry for Azure cloud
            platform) > You will see VHD URLs, one per region. 

At https://cloudbreak-imagecatalog.s3.amazonaws.com/v3-prod-cb-image-catalog.json.




Use azcopy tool to copy the images. When copying the images via the azcopy tool,
     you have two options for authentication and authorization:


Azcopy login: Perform azcopy login with a service principal that has the
       permission to copy into images container.


SAS token: Create a SAS token for the images container.




Option 1: Azcopy login
Issue the following command and it will perform an interactive login:
azcopy login
If you want to set up an automatic script then you can use:

azcopy login --service-principal \
 --application-id <YOUR_APPLICATION_ID> \ 
 --tenant-id <YOUR_TENANT_ID>

note
On some distributions (such as Ubuntu Linux) login executes fine, but logout fails (and so
     would any further authorization). For troubleshooting steps, refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-azcopy/issues/452.

To run azcopy, use:

azcopy copy \
 'https://<SOURCE_BLOB_URL>' \
 'https://<DESTINATION_BLUB_URL>

As mentioned earlier, the https://<SOURCE_BLOB_URL> can be found in the
    image catalog.

Option 2: SAS-token
Go to the Azure portal and generate a SAS-token. Then, you can issue azcopy:

azcopy copy \
 'https://<SOURCE_BLOB_URL>' \
 'https://<DESTINATION_BLUB_URL>?<YOUR_SAS_TOKEN>'

As mentioned earlier, the https://<SOURCE_BLOB_URL> can be found in the
    image catalog.
For more information about Azure copy syntax and examples, refer to Get started with AzCopy in Azure docs. 



Creating an image resource
After the copying process is complete, create an image resource from each copied
  VHD.
In Azure Portal you can do that as follows:

Navigate to Images and click on Add.
Provide the following information:


Once done, click Create.
