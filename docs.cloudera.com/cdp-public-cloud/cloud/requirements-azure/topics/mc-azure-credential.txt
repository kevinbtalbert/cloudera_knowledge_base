Prerequisites for the provisioning credential
To allow CDP to create resources on your Azure account, you must create the app-based
    credential. The credential allows CDP to access and provision a set of resources in your Azure
    account.
CDP uses an app-based credential to authenticate your Azure account and obtain authorization
      to create resources on your behalf. The app-based credential requires that you to manually
      configure the service principal created within your Azure Active Directory. The app-based
      method requires Owner role to be able to create a service principal, which must be given
      Contributor role or its equivalent. 
To meet Azure prerequisites for CDP:
Review the provided policies.
Obtain the subscription and tenant ID.
Create an app registration on Azure


Parent topic: Azure resources and services
Azure permissions
Your Azure administrator must create a custom role in the Azure subscription. 




The administrator must create a custom role containing one of the following sets of
              permissions sufficient for registering an environment and creating Data
                Hubs and Operational Databases:
Option 1: Use the Role definition 1: Allows CDP to access and use only a single existing resource group and create service endpoints if you would
                  like CDP to only access and create resources within your existing resource
                    group and if you would like to use service endpoints. 
Option 2: Use the Role definition 2: Allows CDP to access and use only a single existing resource group and create private endpoints if you would
                  like CDP to only access and create resources within your existing resource
                    group and if you would like to use private endpoints. 
Option 3: Use the Role definition 3: Allows CDP to create multiple resource groups within your subscription if you would
                  like CDP to create multiple resource groups within your subscription.

Additionally, if you would like to provision other CDP services (Data
                Engineering, Data Warehouse, or Machine Learning), you should assign the
              built-in Contributor Azure role either at the resource
              group level (if you are providing your own resource group) or at the Azure
              subscription level (if CDP is creating resource groups).
If you need Data Warehouse only and CDP is creating resource groups, you can use
                  the minimal policy documented in CDW documentation.
If you need DataFlow only and CDP is creating resource groups, you can use the
                  minimal policy documented in CDF documentation.
If you need Machine Learning only and CDP is creating resource groups, you can
                  use the minimal policy documented in CML documentation.

 When creating the role definition, make sure to:


Replace the {SUBSCRIPTION-ID} with your actual
                subscription ID.







Obtain subscription and tenant ID 
Obtain subscription and tenant ID. You need them in order to create a provisioning
  credential for Azure.
These steps should be performed by someone who has the Owner built-in Azure role and the Application Developer role in Azure Active Directory.
You can obtain both the Subscription ID and Tenant ID from Azure CLI by using
     the following Azure CLI
     command:az account list|jq '.[]|{"subscriptionId": .id, "tenantId": .tenantId, "state": .state}'

You can obtain your Azure Subscription ID from your Azure Portal >
      Subscriptions:




You can obtain your Azure Tenant ID from your Azure Portal > Azure Active
      Directory > Properties: 







Create an app registration and assign a role to it 
Create an app registration and assign a role to it. You need it in order to create a
  provisioning credential for Azure.



On Azure Portal, navigate to the Azure Active Directory > App Registrations and click
      on + New Registration:







Register a new application as follows and then click Register:







Once your app registration is created, you will be redirected to the app registration's
      overview page. Copy and save the Application ID before closing this page. You will need
      to provide it to CDP later:





Next, navigate to Certificates & secrets and generate a new secret by clicking
       + New client secret, providing a description and expiration time, and clicking
       Add:





Copy and save the Client secret value. You will need to provide it to CDP later.


Next, you need to assign a role to your application. To do that, browse to
       Subscriptions, click on your subscription, and choose Access control (IAM).


Click Add > Add role assignment and then assign the Contributor role or the custom role to your newly
      created application by:

Under Role, selecting Contributor or the custom role.
Typing your app name under Select and then selecting it:








Once done, click Save.



What to do next
Once you have this setup ready, you can Create a provisioning credential for Azure in CDP.
