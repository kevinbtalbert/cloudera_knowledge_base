Azure quota limits
When you create your Azure Portal subscription, Azure Portal sets limits to the
  resources available to you. The limits can vary by region.
To register an Azure environment in CDP, you may need to increase some of these limits for the
   region(s) that you are planning to use. CDP creates resources such as VMs in your Azure
   subscription. For example: 
If you are planning to use the Machine Learning service, review Limitations on Azure in ML docs.
Depending on the number of clusters that CDP creates in your Azure subscription, you might
     need to raise the limits for certain resources such as VMs and vCPUs in your Azure
     subscription. For a complete list of Azure resources used by CDP refer to Azure resources used by CDP. 

If you require more resources than the limit set by Azure, you can create a support request on
   your Azure Portal. For information on Azure quotas, refer to Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and
    constraints.
