Network security groups
Network security groups (NSGs) determine the inbound and outbound traffic to and from your CDP environment. That is, you should use security group settings to allow users from your organization access to CDP resources.
You have two options:

Use your existing security groups (recommended for production)
Have CDP create new security groups

You should verify the security group limits in your Azure account to ensure that you can create security groups for CDP.
Existing security groups
If you would like to create your own security groups, two security groups need to be
        created: the first security group will be used for all gateway nodes and the second security
        groups will be used for all other nodes. The gateway nodes communicate with the Management
        Console and therefore require additional ports. These security groups will be applied when
        creating a data lake and FreeIPA during environment creation and when you create Data Hub
        clusters. 
Review the following guidelines prior to adding security groups rules. This describes all
        the inbound ports that need to be open and provides guidelines for what to enter as a source
        range:


noteThe communication via TCP/UDP 0-65535 and ICMP is essential for healthy operation of
          CDP environments, Data Hubs, and data services running within the VNet, so ensure that you open these ports as
          described below. While some services only need well-known fixed ports, a majority of them
          depend on ephemeral (i.e. dynamically or randomly allocated) ports; This is why the
          wildcard 0-65535 TCP/UDP port range is used in the absence of a detailed breakdown of
          individual ports. Since overall access to the VNet is typically secured by other means, the use of the wildcard
          rules does not pose a higher risk against external attacks.

“Knox” security group
This is used for gateway nodes:

Description



TCP
22
Your CIDR
This is an optional port for end user SSH access to cluster hosts.
                  You should open it to your organization’s CIDR. 


TCP
443
Your CIDR and CDP
                  CIDR
This port is used to access the Data Lake and Data Hub cluster UIs
                  via Knox gateway. You must open this port to your organization’s CIDR in order to
                  access cluster UIs. When CCM is enabled, you only need to set this to your
                      CIDR.


TCP
9443
CDP CIDR
This port is used by CDP to maintain management control of clusters and data
                  lakes. By default, when CDP creates the security groups
                    automatically, it opens this port to the correct IP.This port is not
                      needed when CCM is enabled.


TCP, UDP
0-65535
Your internal VNet CIDR (for example 10.10.0.0/16).
This is required for internal communication within the VNet.


ICMP
N/A
Your internal VNet CIDR
                  (for example 10.10.0.0/16).
This is required for internal communication within the VNet.


"Default" security group
This  is used for all nodes except Knox gateway nodes:

Description



TCP

Your CIDR
This is an optional port for end user SSH access to the hosts. You
                  should open it to your organization’s CIDR. 


TCP
443
Your CIDR
This port is only required if you are planning to spin up Machine Learning
                  workspaces since HTTPS access to ML workspaces is available over port 443. If you
                  are not planning to use the Machine Learning service, you do not need to open this
                  port.
                  


TCP
9443
CDP CIDR
This port is used by CDP to maintain management control of clusters and data
                  lakes. By default, when CDP creates the security groups
                    automatically, it opens this port to the correct IP.This port is not
                      needed when CCM is enabled.


TCP, UDP
0-65535
Your VNet CIDR
                  (for example 10.10.0.0/16).
This is required for internal communication within the VNet. TCP port 5432 is used by
                  the Data Lake for communication with its attached database. 


ICMP
N/A
Your internal VNet CIDR
                  (for example 10.10.0.0/16).
This is required for internal communication within the VNet.


Security groups can be created and managed from the Azure Portal > Network Security
        Groups. For detailed instructions on how to create new security groups on Azure, refer
        to Filter network traffic with a network security group using
          the Azure portal. 
On the Network Interface page > Settings, click Network security group. 



On the Network Security Groups page, click Inbound Security Rules to view the list
        of rules.



In the Inbound security rules tab, click Add. 



You need to create two security groups: Knox and Default (You will see this
        terminology in the Management Console UI and CLI, so if you decide to choose different
        names, make sure that you are able to distinguish between the two security groups).

note
There is a known issue where even if you create and specify your own security groups
            the Data Warehouse and Machine Learning services create their own security groups. For
            instructions on how to restrict access on the security groups created by the Data
            Warehouse service, refer to  Restricting access to endpoints in AWS
              environments.



New security groups
If you would like CDP to create the security groups for you, you need to provide a CIDR
        range for inbound traffic to Azure instances from your organization. CDP creates multiple
        security groups: one for each Data Lake host group, one for each FreeIPA host group, and one
        per host group when Data Hub, Data Warehouse, and Machine Learning clusters are created. On
        these security groups, CDP opens ports as described in Default security group settings documentation.

note
There is a known issue where even if you create and specify your own security groups
            the Data Warehouse and Machine Learning services create their own security groups. For
            instructions on how to restrict access on the security groups created by the Data
            Warehouse service, refer to  Restricting access to endpoints in AWS
              environments.
