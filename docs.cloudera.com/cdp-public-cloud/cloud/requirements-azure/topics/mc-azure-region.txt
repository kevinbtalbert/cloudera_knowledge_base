Azure region
Prior to registering an environment, you should decide which Azure region you would
    like to use.
A single Azure environment registered in CDP corresponds to a single VNet located in a
      specific region, and all the resources deployed by CDP on Azure are deployed into that VNet. 
Typically, to speed up data access, you may want to deploy clusters into the region
      containing the ADLS Gen2 containers that you want to access for input and output data.
      Therefore, when selecting the region to use, you should consider where your data is located. 
CDP requires that the ADLS Gen2 storage location provided during environment registration is
      in the same region as the region selected for the environment. 
If you need to use multiple regions, you need to register multiple environments, one per
      region.

Supported Azure regions
CDP supports the following Azure regions.

noteSome Azure regions (such as Switzerland West, France South, Norway West, and so on) are
    disaster recovery regions and therefore cannot be supported by CDP. For more information, see
     Support matrix for Azure VM disaster recovery between Azure
     regions.
noteThis list may not immediately include newly added Azure regions unless they are supported
    by CDP.

The regions marked with a check mark ("✔")︎ are supported.
Note the following when reviewing regions supported for Data Warehouse: 
AZ means that a region supports availability zones.
Note the following when reviewing regions supported for Machine Learning:

Regions marked with a "✔" and without any other annotation fulfill both ANF and GPU
     requirements.
No ANF means that a region does not support Azure NetApp Files. Azure NetApp Files is
      required for the Machine Learning service. If you select a region that does not include
      support for Azure NetApp Files, you must set up your own NFS service. 
Partial GPU means that a region supports VM types other than NCsv2. If you would like
     to utilize GPUs for faster computation, additional configuration will be necessary to use
     them.
No GPU means that a region does not support VMs with GPUs.
