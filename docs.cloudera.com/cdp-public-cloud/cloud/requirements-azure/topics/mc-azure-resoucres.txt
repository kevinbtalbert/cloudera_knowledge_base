Overview of Azure resources used by CDP
The following Azure resources are used by CDP and CDP services.
Azure resources created for a CDP environment


When a CDP environment is created, a FreeIPA cluster and a Data Lake cluster are
    created.
The following Azure resources are created for FreeIPA (one per environment): 


Resource
Description
Naming convention



Virtual Private Network (VNet)
If during environment creation you select to have a new VNet and subnets created, then
        a new VNet and subnets are created on your Azure account. Alternatively, you can provide
        your own existing VNet and subnets. In both cases (new and existing VPC), all
         compute resources that CDP provisions for the environment and CDP services are provisioned
         into the VNet specified during environment creation.
Specified by customer


Resource group for FreeIPA resources
If you chose for CDP to create multiple resource groups, a resource group is created
        to group all the resources created for FreeIPA. This resource group is not created if you
        chose to use a single existing resource group.
<env-name>-freeipa-<numeric-id>


Virtual Machines (VMs)
During environment creation, two or three Standard_DS3_v2 VMs are
        provisioned for the FreeIPA HA server by default. The number of VMs depends on the selected
        Data Lake type.
<env-name>-freeipa-<numeric-id>m0


OS disk 
An OS disk is provisioned for the FreeIPA VM.
<env-name>-freeipa-<numeric-id>m0


Network interface 
One network interface card (NIC) is provisioned for the FreeIPA VM.
<env-name>-freeipa-<numeric-id>m0


Public IP address
If you choose to use public IPs, your VM is assigned a public IP
        address.
<env-name>-freeipa-<numeric-id>m0


Network security group
Network security groups define inbound and outbound access to the
        instances.If during environment creation you choose to have new security groups created,
        then they are created on your Azure account. Alternatively, you can provide your own
        existing security groups. 
master0-<env-name>freeipa<numeric-id>sg


ADLS Gen2 storage account for storing operating system images 
By default, CDP creates an ADLS Gen2 storage account that is used solely for storing
        operating system images. If required, you can optionally pre-create this
         account and copy the required images.
The name is the concatenation of the following three elements:
“cbimg”
Region identifier: The starting letters of the region where the SA is. For
          example, “eu” for East US, or “eu2” for East US 2.
Subscription ID, without hyphens ('-') and all lowercase. For example, if
          your subscription ID is a9d4456e-349f-46f5-bc73-54a8d523e504,you should convert it to
          a9d4456e349f46f5bc7354a8d523e504.
For example, the name of a storage account in East US 2 region in
         subscription a9d4456e-349f-46f5-bc73-54a8d523e504 would be
         cbimgeu2a9d4456e349f46f5bc7354a8d523e504.


Resource group for the ADLS account used for storing operating system
        images
If you chose for CDP to create multiple resource groups, a separate resource
        group is created for the ADLS Gen2 account mentioned above.note
To speed up future environment deployment, this resource group are its content are not
          deleted during environment deletion.
This resource group is not created if you chose to use a single existing resource
        group.

In addition, the following resources are created for each Data Lake (one per
    environment):

Resource group
If you chose for CDP to create multiple resource groups, two resource groups
        are created: One new resource group is created to group all the resources created for the
        Data Lake and another resource group is created for the database used by the Data Lake.
        These resource groups are not created if you coose to use a single existing resource
        group.
