Virtual machines
CDP provisions Virtual machines (VMs) as part of the environment creation process (for
    Data Lake and FreeIPA) and for compute clusters.
Therefore, you should verify the limits on the number and type of VM instances in your Azure account to ensure that you are able to provision an environment and create clusters in CDP.
CDP supports Azure reserved VM instances; That is, If you have purchased reserved instances,
      CDP uses them automatically according to Azure policy.
CDP provides default Virtual Hard Drives (VHDs) and provisions managed images based on these VHDs. These managed images are used for Data Lake, FreeIPA, and compute cluster instances. 
For a list of supported VM types, refer to Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud service
        rates.

Custom images
By default CDP provides a set of default images that are used for all provisioned VMs,
  but you can optionally use custom images for Data Lake, FreeIPA, and Data Hub.
You might require a custom image for compliance or security reasons (a “hardened” image), or to
   have your own packages pre-installed on the image, for example monitoring tools or software. 
If you would like to use custom images instead of the default images, refer to Custom images and image catalogs.
