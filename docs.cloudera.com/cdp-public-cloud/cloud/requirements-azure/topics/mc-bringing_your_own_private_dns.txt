Bringing your own private DNS
Review this documentation if you are planning to use a private endpoint for Azure
  Postgres with your own private DNS.


Parent topic: Private endpoint for Azure Postgres
Requirements and limitations
The following limitations apply when using your own private DNS:



Only Azure’s private DNS zone is supported. Using an on-prem DNS is not
      supported.


Private endpoints can only be used with a single customer-provided resource group.
      They cannot be used with CDP-created multiple resource groups. When creating an environment
      from the UI, the “Create Private Endpoints” option is disabled if you select the option for
      CDP to create multiple resource groups. If using CDP CLI, a validation error appears if this
      option is used with CDP creating multiple resource groups.


You can only use private endpoints with your own private DNS zone if you specify
      an existing VNet for the environment. If you chose CDP to create your network and enable
      private endpoints, then CDP is going to manage the private DNS zone for you.


The private DNS zone provided to CDP must have the name
       “privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com“. Furthermore, it must be in a subscription
      that is accessible to the service principal used by the CDP app-based credential; That is, the
      subscription where the private DNS zone is created must be in the same tenant where the
      service principal is located.





Prerequisites
When bringing your own private DNS, you should meet the following
  prerequisites:
Disable private endpoint network policies
Only subnets that have private endpoint network policies turned off are eligible for
    private endpoint creation, because network security groups (NSG) are not supported for private
    endpoints.
You can use the following Azure CLI command to disable private endpoint network
    policies for a certain subnet:

az network vnet subnet update \
  --name <subnet-name> \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --vnet-name <vnet-name> \
  --disable-private-endpoint-network-policies true

For example: 
az network vnet subnet update \
  --name default-2 \
  --resource-group my-cdp-rg \
  --vnet-name my-azure-vnet \
  --disable-private-endpoint-network-policies true

Create a private DNS zone and link it to your VNet
If you choose to provide your own Azure private DNS zone then you should: 


Create a private DNS zone with the name
       “privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com“ in any subscription accessible to the
      service principal used by the CDP app-based credential; That is, the subscription where the
      private DNS zone is created must be in the same tenant where the service principal is
      located.
To create a private DNS zone, you can use the following Azure CLI command:
            az network private-dns zone create \    
    --name privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com \
    --resource-group <YOUR_DNS_RESOURCE_GROUP> \
    --subscription <YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_FOR_DNS>


Link it to the VNet that you are planning to use for the CDP environment.
You can do this using the following Azure CLI
            command:az network private-dns link vnet create \
    --name <DESIRED_LINK_NAME> \
    --resource-group <YOUR_VNET_RESOURCE_GROUP> \
    --zone-name privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com \
    --virtual-network <YOUR_VNET_RESOURCE_ID> \
    --subscription <YOUR_VNET_SUBSCRIPTION> 



Ensure that CDP has adequate permissions
Ensure that the role that you are using for the Azure credential has the permissions
    mentioned in Role definition 2: Allows CDP to access and use only a single
      existing resource group and create private endpoints.
Additionally, if your DNS zone is outside of the single resource group that you are
    planning to provide to CDP, the following additional permissions are required for the service
    principal to be able to discover, validate, and use the DNS zone (add and remove A records).
    These additional permissions need to be included in a separate role definition and assigned
    separately. 
The placeholders in bold must be replaced with actual values:


{SUBSCRIPTION-ID} - The ID of the subscription where the DNS zone is located.


{RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME} - The name of the resource group where the DNS zone is
      located.
