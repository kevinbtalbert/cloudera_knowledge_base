VNet and subnet planning
Whether you decide to use your own VNet for CDP or have CDP create one for you, you
  should carefully plan your network, calculating and verifying the limits of the VNet and subnets
  available in your Azure subscription to ensure that you have enough networking resources to create
  clusters in CDP.  
When registering an Azure environment in CDP, you are asked to select a VNet and one
   or more subnets. You have two options:

CDP will create a new VNet and subnets 
Select a VNet and subnets that you previously created 

In both cases, use this guide to calculate and verify the limits of the VNet and
   subnets available in your Azure subscription to ensure that you have enough networking resources
   to create clusters in CDP.
Option 1: CDP creates the VNet and subnets
If you would like CDP to create a new VNet, you will need to specify a valid CIDR in
    IPv4 range that will be used to define the range of private IPs for VM instances provisioned
    into these subnets. This must be a /16 CIDR, but you can customize the IP Range. The default is
    10.10.0.0/16. 
You cannot use the following reserved CIDR blocks for your VNet: 

10.0.0.0/16 
10.244.0.0/16
172.17.0.1/16
10.20.0.0/16
10.244.0.0/16

CDP will divide this address range as follows:

32 x /24 subnets - Recommended for Machine Learning workspaces and Data
     Engineering Services 
3 x /19 subnets - Recommended for Data Warehouse service 
3 x /19 subnets - Recommended for Data Lake and Data Hub 
3 x /24 subnets - Reserved for future use 


note
Not all subnets are used upon creation. Many of the above start getting used once you enable
      certain features and create more workloads in CDP. 


If you would like to have a minimal virtual network instead, you can use the guide
    outlined in the next option. 

Option 2: Existing VNet and subnets
If you would like to use an existing VNet, the subnet requirements vary based on the
    services used. Below is a guide for calculating network requirements per service. 
In addition, make sure you follow the following guidelines: 

You cannot use the following reserved CIDR blocks for your VNet: 
10.0.0.0/16 
10.244.0.0/16
172.17.0.1/16
10.20.0.0/16
10.244.0.0/16

The Microsoft.Storage and Microsoft.SQL Service endpoints should be registered for all
     subnets that will be used by CDP. 

Subnets for Data Lake and Data Hub
Both Data Lake and DataHub share the same subnet, so only one subnet is required.
Cloudera recommends a minimum of a /24 CIDR. If you would like to use a smaller
    subnet, use the following guidelines:


One IP address is used for each VM
One Light Duty Data Lake cluster uses three VMs 
A typical Data Hub cluster uses a minimum of four VMs as a starting point, but
      this number can be dynamically scaled up or down
Make sure you allocate enough IPs to handle each cluster running at peak
      capacity


Subnets for Data Warehouse

The Data Warehouse service needs one subnet. You can choose the specific subnet used by DW
    when you activate Data Warehouse for an environment. This subnet should not be shared with any
    of the other CDP applications. 
Cloudera recommends a /20 or larger subnet as it can be difficult to accurately predict the
    size of each VW due to autoscaling. 
If you would like to size the subnets to a smaller CIDR, the following guidelines assume that
    you are activating your DW environment with the default settings (no overlay networks):


VM Purpose
# VMs
# pods per VM
IPs per VM (1 for the instance + 1 per pod)

Total IP addresses required 


DW Shared Services - (Shared among all VWs in an
         environment)
3

93


Per Database Catalog(One catalog is created by default, you can
           create additional catalogs)

62


Per Virtual Warehouse (XS) - without autoscaling*

Per Virtual Warehouse (S) - without autoscaling*

20

220


Per Virtual Warehouse (L) - without autoscaling*
40

11
440

If you would like to use a smaller subnet, you can enable the Overlay Networks feature
    for DW, which will provision your AKS cluster with the kubenet network plugin instead of Azure
    CNI. When you use kubnet, you may need to manage the Azure Route Table (UDR) manually in
    accordance with AKS documentation. In this case, use the following table as your
     guideline:

VM Purpose
# VMs
Total IP addresses required 


CDW Shared Services(shared among all VWs in an
         environment)

Per Database Catalog(One catalog is created by default, you can
           create additional catalogs)

* Each autoscaling activity can be treated as deploying a new Virtual Warehouse.
    For example, when a XS Virtual Warehouse is scaled once, it uses four VMs instead of two.
Subnets for Machine Learning
Azure Files NFS v4.1 is a managed, POSIX compliant NFS service on Azure. The file share is
    used to store files for the CML infrastructure and ML workspaces. This is the recommended NFS
    service for use with CML. You need one separate subnet delegated to the Azure Files NFS service
    (all workspaces in a region will share this service). Cloudera recommends a /28 subnet for this
    purpose. 
You also need one subnet per each workspace that you plan to run. ML uses the Kubenet plugin
    to AKS and the subnet used for a workspace cannot be shared with another workspace or another
    service. You can choose which subnet is used by a workspace at the time of provisioning.
    Cloudera recommends a /25 CIDR for these subnet, but if you would like to provide a custom
    range, the formula to calculate IP Addresses per workspace is as follows:
Each workspace can grow up to 30 CPU worker nodes and 30 GPU workers; each node
      consumes one IP address. 
In addition, you need to allocate up to 11 IP address (6 infrastructure nodes and
      5 for auxiliary networking usage). 

For more information, see Network Planning for Cloudera Machine Learning on
    Azure.
Subnets for Data Engineering
Cloudera Data Engineering runs in the VNet registered in CDP as part of your Azure
    environment. 
Each CDE service requires its own subnet. CDE on AKS uses the Kubenet CNI plugin provided by
    Azure. In order to use Kubenet CNI, we need to create multiple smaller subnets when creating an
    Azure environment. It is recommended to partition the vnet with subnets that is just the right
    size to fit the expected max nodes in the cluster.
Cloudera recommends a /24 CIDR for these subnet, but if you would like to provide a custom
    range, the formula to calculate IP Addresses per CDE service is as follows:
Each CDE service can scale up to 100 compute nodes; each node consumes one IP
      address. 
In addition, you need to allocate 3 IPs for the base infra nodes and 2 IP address
      per virtual cluster for the virtual cluster service nodes.
