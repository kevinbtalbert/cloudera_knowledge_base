Azure Database for PostgreSQLCloudera Docs
Azure Database for PostgreSQL
CDP provisions a PostgreSQL database as part of the environment creation process (for
  Data Lake). Prior to creating an Azure environment in CDP, the Azure Database for PostgreSQL must
  be enabled in the regions that you want to use with CDP. 
Furthermore, Data Warehouse service provisions PostgreSQL databases for its data warehouses. 
Enabling Azure Database for PostgreSQL
The Azure Database for PostgreSQL service is often not enabled by default in every region, and
    your Azure administrator may need to contact Azure Support to have it enabled. For information
    on submitting this request, refer to Azure region access request process documentation. When
    making this request, do the following:
Specify "Azure Database for PostgreSQL" in the Subscription field in Step 1. 
Specify "Azure Database for PostgreSQL" in the Region to Enable field in Step 4. 
Finally, in Step 4, specify 100 in the Planned Compute Usage in Cores field. This
      limits the pool of VCores per region to 100 VCores, limiting the total number of PostgreSQL
      servers that CDP can provision.


Cluster deployments with Azure Policies for PostgreSQL
Cluster deployments with Azure Policies for PostgreSQL are not supported. Ensure that none of
    the Azure Policy built-in definitions for Azure Database for
     PostgreSQL are turned on or enforced. This is necessary because some policies (such as
    log_duration) could cause such performance degradation, making your clusters practically
    unusable.
