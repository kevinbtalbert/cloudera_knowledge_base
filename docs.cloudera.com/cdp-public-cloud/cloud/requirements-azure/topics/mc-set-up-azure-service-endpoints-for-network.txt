Service endpoint for Azure Postgres
On Azure, the external PostgreSQL database can reach the network via a service endpoint
    or a private endpoint. If you would like to use a service endpoint, before you can set up an
    external database for a given network, you must enable service endpoints for all subnets where
    the database should be reachable. 
noteService endpoints are firewall rules that allow traffic only from those subnets where you
      explicitly granted permission. Therefore, when using service endpoints for Azure Postgres, the
      external database still needs to have public access enabled. 
Set up a service endpoint via Azure Portal


From the Azure portal, go to the VNet for which you want to add service
            endpoints.
From the menu in the left pane, select Service endpoints. 
In the Service endpoints window, click the + Add button.
In the pop up window, select:
Service:
Microsoft.Sql
Microsoft Storage (optional: only needed if you are using Data Warehouse)

Subnets: Select all subnets for which you want to apply the service
                endpoint 

Click Add.



Set up a service endpoint via ARM template
If you are using ARM templates to create your infrastructure, you can add the
        serviceEndpoints section to your template:
For example:
"subnets": [
        {
            "name": "<YOUR-SUBNET-NAME>",
            "properties": {
                "addressPrefix": "<YOUR-SUBNET-PREFIX>",
                "serviceEndpoints": [
                    {
                        "service": "Microsoft.Sql"
                    },
                    {
                        "service": "Microsoft.Storage"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
