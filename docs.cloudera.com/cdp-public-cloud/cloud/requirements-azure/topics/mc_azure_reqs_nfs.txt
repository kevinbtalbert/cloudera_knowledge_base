Azure Files NFS for Machine Learning
If you would like to use the Machine Learning data service, Azure Files NFS is the
  recommended NFS service.
If you would like to use Machine Learning, you should create an Azure Files storage account and
   file share to store files for the ML infrastructure and ML workspaces, as described in Create Azure Files Storage Account and File Share.
noteAs an alternative to Azure Files NFS, you can configure an NFS server that is external to
   the CML cluster. This is not the recommended approach. See Other NFS Options.
