Access to workload UIs
If you have restricted DNS or networking setup, make sure that
   *.cloudera.site is resolvable from your network so that members of your
  organization can access workload UIs.
CDP workloads (including Data Lake) use subdomains under cloudera.site to host various UI
   endpoints (Cloudera Manager, Ranger, Knox, Hue and so on). CDP automatically provisions these
   endpoints whenever a Data Lake, Data Hub or another type of workload (for example, Virtual
   Warehouse in CDW) is created, and routing is set up so that you can access these endpoints from
   your network. 
The subdomains are assigned under cloudera.site using the following convention:
      <endpoint-name>.<env-truncated-name>.<customer-workload-subdomain>.<regional-subdomain>.cloudera.site
