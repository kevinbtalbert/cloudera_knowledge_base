GCP permissions
As an administrator, you must be able to create and manage the resources in the Google
  Cloud project where CDP environments and clusters run. You must be able to perform all
  administrative tasks and have administrative rights to all resources.
Cloudera recommends that the administrator has the role of Owner in the project used for
   CDP in your GCP account.
