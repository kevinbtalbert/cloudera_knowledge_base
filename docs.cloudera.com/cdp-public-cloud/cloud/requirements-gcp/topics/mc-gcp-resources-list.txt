Overview of GCP resources used by CDP
The following Google Cloud resources are used by CDP and CDP services.
GCP resources created for a CDP environment
When a CDP environment is created, a FreeIPA cluster and a Data Lake cluster are created.
The following Google Cloud resources are created for FreeIPA (one per environment): 


Resource
Description



Service account for credential
To allow CDP to access and provision resources in your Google Cloud
         project, you must create a service account in your Google Cloud project, assign required
         roles, and generate a JSON access key that can later be provided to CDP.


VPC network and subnets
During environment creation you provide your own existing VPC network and subnets.All compute resources that CDP provisions for the environment and CDP services
          are provisioned into the VPC network specified during environment creation.


Firewall rules
Firewall rules define inbound and outbound access to the instances. If
         during environment creation you choose to have new firewall rules created, then they are
         created on your GCP account. Alternatively, you can provide your own existing firewall
         rules.


VM instances
During environment creation, two or three e2-standard-2 VM
        instances are provisioned for the FreeIPA HA server. The number of VMs depends on the
        selected Data Lake type.


OS disk
An OS disk is provisioned for the FreeIPA VM.


Attached disk
An attached disk (pd-standard) is provisioned for each VM.


Public IP address (if required)
If you choose to use public IPs, your VM is assigned a public IP
         address.


GCS bucket for storing operating system images
By default, CDP creates a storage bucket that is used solely for storing operating
         system images.If required, you can optionally pre-create this account and copy
          the required images.


In addition, the following resources are created for each Data Lake (one per environment):


Resource
Description



VM instances
VM instances are provisioned for the Data Lake nodes. 
Light duty: Two VM instances are provisioned: One
            e2-standard-2 VM instance (for IDBroker) and one e2-standard-8
           VM instance (for master) are created. 
Medium duty: Ten VM instances are provisioned: Two
           e2-standard-2 (IDBroker), three e2-standard-4 (two Data
          Lake Master nodes and one Auxiliary node), and five e2-standard-8 (three
          DataLake Core nodes and two Gateway nodes).



Attached disk
An attached disk (pd-standard) is provisioned for each
         VM.


OS disk
An OS disk is provisioned for each VM.


PostgreSQL database
A custom PostgreSQL database instance (100GB SSD, 2vCPU, 13 GB RAM) is
         provisioned for the Data Lake. This databse instance is used for Cloudera Manager, Ranger,
         and Hive MetaStore.


Firewall rules
Firewall rules define inbound and outbound access to VM instances. If
         during environment creation you choose to have new firewall rules created, then they are
         created on your GCP project.


Google storage buckets
The existing Google Storage bucket that you provide during environment
         creation for the Data Lake is used for Data Lake log storage and workload data
         storage.


Service accounts
Prior to registering your environment in CDP, during Google storage setup,
         you should create service accounts and assign roles to them as instructed in CDP
         documentation.


Public IP address (if required)
If you choose to use public IPs, your VM is assigned a public IP
         address.



GCP resources created for Data Hub
The following Google Cloud resources are created for each Data Hub cluster:


Resource
Description



VM instances and attached storage
A VM is created for each cluster node. The VM type varies depending on what
         you selected during Data Hub cluster creation. For a list of supported VM types, refer to
          Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud service
          rates.


Firewall rules
Firewall rules define inbound and outbound access to VM instances. If
         during environment creation you choose to have new firewall rules created, then they are
         created on your GCP project.


OS disk
An OS disk is provisioned for each VM.


Attached disk
An attached disk (pd-standard) is provisioned for each VM, as specified
         during Data Hub cluster creation. The disk size is selected during cluster
         creation.


Public IP address (if required)
If you choose to use public IPs, each of the VMs is assigned a public IP
         address.
