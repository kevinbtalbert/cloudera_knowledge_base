Service account for the provisioning credentialCloudera Docs
Service account for the provisioning credential
The provisioning credential for Google Cloud relies on a service account that can be
  assumed by CDP.
The following flow describes how the Google Cloud provisioning credential works:


Your GCP account administrator creates a service account and assigns the minimum permissions
     allowing CDP to create and manage resources in your Google Cloud account. Next, the
     administrator generates a service account access key pair for the service account. 
The service account is registered as a credential in CDP and its access key is uploaded to
     CDP.
The credential is then used for registering your Google Cloud environment in CDP.
Once this is done, CDP uses the credential for provisioning environment-related resources,
     workload clusters, and resources for other CDP services that you run in CDP.


Review the following to learn about the permissions required for the credential and how to
   create the service account.

Permissions for the provisioning credential's service account
To allow CDP to access and provision resources in your Google Cloud project, you should
  create a service account in your Google Cloud project, assign the following roles or granular
  permissions. Next, you generate a JSON access key that can later be provided to CDP. CDP will
  assume this service account via the service account access key provided during credential creation
  for provisioning resources for your environment.


The service account must fulfill one of the following requirements (choose one of
          the options):

Option 1: Assign the following IAM roles at the project level. This is a
      simpler option.
Option 2: Alternatively, you can create custom IAM roles with the
      following granular IAM permissions assigned and then assign the role to the service account at
      the project level. This allows you to minimize the number of permissions granted to CDP. 



Option 1: IAM roles



IAM role
Scope
Description



iam.serviceAccounts.list IAM permission 
Project
This is required in order for CDP to be able to list service account names that you
                created in your GCP project.You need to create a custom role in order
                  to assign this permission.


Compute Instance Admin (v1) 
roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1
Project
This is required for provisioning of Compute Engine instances, disks, and
        images in your VPC.


Storage Admin
roles/storage.admin
Project
This is required for the creation of a storage bucket to store the
        Cloudbreak image objects. Delete permissions are not required.


Compute Network Viewer
roles/compute.networkViewer
Project
This is required for read-only access to all networking resources.


Compute Load Balancer Adminroles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin
Project
This role is required for load balancing between HA components of the Data
                Lake.


Cloud SQL Admin
roles/cloudsql.admin
Project
This is required in order for CDP to have the permission for creating and
        deleting a Data Lake and and heavy duty flow management Data Hub clusters cleanly.


Compute Network User
roles/compute.networkUser
Project
Required for shared VPC onlyIf you would like to use a shared VPC,
                  you need this additional role in the scope of the host project of the
                VPC.


Compute Public IP Admin
roles/compute.publicIpAdmin
Project
Required only when not using CCM
This additional role is only required if you are planning to disable CCM for your
                  environment.




noteAdditionally, once you create the Logger and IDBroker service accounts discussed in the
        minimum setup for cloud storage, you need to update each of these two service accounts to
        grant the provisioning service account the Service Account User (iam.serviceAccountUser) role. See instructions
        provided as part of Minimum setup for cloud storage.

Option 2: Granular permissions
You should create a custom IAM role to assign these permissions.

Granular IAM permissions
Scope
Description



iam.serviceAccounts.list
Project
This is required in order for CDP to be able to access service
                accounts that you created.

Project
Required for creating, stopping, starting, and deleting an external
                database for the Data Lake and Data Hub clusters.

Project
Required for load balancing between HA components of the Data Lake.


compute.addresses.createcompute.addresses.deletecompute.addresses.getcompute.addresses.use
Project
(Optional) Only required if public IPs are used. You do not
                  need these permissions if you would like to use private IPs only.


storage.buckets.createstorage.buckets.getstorage.buckets.getIamPolicystorage.objects.createstorage.objects.deletestorage.objects.getstorage.objects.getIamPolicy
Project
(Optional) This is not required if you are planning to
                pre-create the GCS bucket for storing OS images for VMs. By default, CDP creates
                this bucket, but you can optionally pre-create it. See Storage bucket for OS images.


noteAdditionally, once you create the Logger and IDBroker service accounts discussed in the
        minimum setup for cloud storage you need to update each of these two service accounts to
        grant the provisioning service account the Service Account User (iam.serviceAccountUser) role. See instructions
        provided as part of Minimum setup for cloud storage.For
      instructions on how to create the service account, refer to the following documentation:

Create a service account and generate a JSON access key.
Before you begin
Review the above permissions to learn what IAM permissions and IAM roles you need to assign to
      the service account that you will create.
Steps


Log in to your Google Cloud account.


Navigate to the project used for CDP.

Navigate to the IAM & Admin.
To create a custom role:
Navigate to the Roles page.
Click +Create Role. 
Specify a Title.
Specify an ID.
Click +Add Permissions.
Add the required granular permission(s) as shown in the following screenshots:




Use the same steps to add all the required permissions. noteIf you are using the
                Option 1: IAM roles, you only need to assign the
                iam.serviceAccounts.list permission. If you are using the Option
                2: Granular permissions, you need to assign all the permissions listed in the
              table listing the permissions. 
Click Create.

To create a service account: 
Navigate to the Service accounts page. 
Click Create service account. 
Enter a service account name. 
Click Create.
Under Grant this service account access to project, choose the IAM roles to grant to
            the service account on the project. You need to assign all of the roles listed in the
            table.
When you are done adding all the required roles, click Done to finish creating the
            service account.

To generate an access key: 
Once your account has been created, find the row of the service account that you want to
      create a key for. In that row, click the  (context menu) button, and then click Create key.
Under Key type, select JSON and click Create.
Clicking Create downloads the service account key file. You will use the JSON access
            key to register the service account as a credential in CDP.warningAfter
              you download the key file, you cannot download it again.

Additionally, once you create the Logger and IDBroker service accounts, you need to update
        each of these two service accounts to grant the provisioning service account the Service
        Account User (iam.serviceAccountUser) role. The instructions are
        provided as part of Minimum setup for cloud storage.

What to do next
Once you have this setup ready, you can Register a GCP credential in CDP.
