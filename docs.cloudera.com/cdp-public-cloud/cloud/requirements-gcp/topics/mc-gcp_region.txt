GCP region
When registering a GCP environment in CDP, you must specify the same GCP region as the
  one where your VPC and subnets are located. Cloudera recommends that the buckets used for storage
  and logs are also located in the same region as the VPC. 
When registering a GCP environment in CDP, you should also select a specific availability zone
   within the selected region.
