Internet connectivity
Depending on your network deployment scenario, CDP on GCP requires outbound internet
  connectivity and may additionally require inbound connectivity with public IP assignment. 
The following is required, depending on whether or not you choose to use CCM:

With Cluster Connectivity Manager (CCM): Works with private IP address assignment and
          requires a NAT gateway to be provisioned. Note that NAT gateway creation will require a
          cloud router creation, as shown in the following screenshot:


Without CCM: Works with public IP address assignment and requires specific firewall rule
          configuration (as described in Firewall rules).

If you are planning to use CCM, review the following GCP documentation for your
   reference:
