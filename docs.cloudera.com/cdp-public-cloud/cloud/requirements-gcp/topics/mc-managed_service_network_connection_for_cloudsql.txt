Managed service network connection for CloudSQL
A CloudSQL database is created for the Data Lake cluster for external storage. 
In order to use CloudSQL database with a private IP, your VPC needs to have private services
   access for CloudSQL. Private services access is implemented as a VPC peering connection between
   your VPC network and the underlying Google services VPC network where your CloudSQL instance
   resides. For more information about the setup and how to steps refer to Configuring private services access in Google
   documentation.
