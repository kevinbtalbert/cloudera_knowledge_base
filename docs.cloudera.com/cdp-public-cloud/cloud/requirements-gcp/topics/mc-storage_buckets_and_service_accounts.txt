Storage buckets and service accounts for logs, backups, and data storageCloudera Docs
Storage buckets and service accounts for logs, backups, and data storage
CDP requires that you pre-create and provide buckets for logs and data storage and
  create service accounts controlling access to them.
You should create two Google storage buckets:

One for data storage 
One for logs 
Optionally, you can also create a third bucket for storing FreeIPA and Data Lake backups

noteIt is possible to use a single bucket. If you choose to do so, you must adjust service
   account permissions accordingly. This scenario is not covered in this documentation.
The buckets should fulfill the following requirements:

For best performance, create the buckets in the same region as the VPC. 
If you would like to use encryption, use a Google-managed key.

In addition to the two Google storage buckets, you should create multiple service accounts and
   assign roles as described in the following documentation:

Minimum setup for GCP cloud storageThe minimal setup recommended for production includes two GCS buckets (one for     storing workload data and another for storing logs) and four service accounts.     Additionally, you can create a third bucket for storing FreeIPA and Data Lake backup data     separately. If the third bucket is not provided, FreeIPA and Data Lake backup data is stored in     the Logs bucket.Onboarding CDP users and groups for GCP cloud storageThe minimal setup defined earlier spins up a CDP environment and Data Lake with no end   user access to cloud storage. Adding users and groups to a CDP environment involves ensuring they   are properly mapped to service accounts to access cloud storage.Parent topic: GCP resources and services
