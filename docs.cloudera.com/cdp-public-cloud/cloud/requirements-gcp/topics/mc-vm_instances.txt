VM instances
CDP provisions VM instances as part of environment creation process (for Data Lake and
  FreeIPA) and for compute clusters. Therefore, you should verify the limits on the number and type of VM instances in your GCP
   account to ensure that you are able to provision an environment and create clusters in CDP.

Custom images
By default CDP provides a set of default images that are used for all provisioned VMs,
  but you can optionally use custom images for Data Lake, FreeIPA, and Data Hub.
You might require a custom image for compliance or security reasons (a “hardened” image), or to
   have your own packages pre-installed on the image, for example monitoring tools or software. 
If you would like to use custom images instead of the default images, refer to Custom images and image catalogs.
