Handling of sensitive data in CDP 
CDP uses Vault to encrypt sensitive data (such as tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption
  keys) .

Classic cluster credentials
During HDP, CDH, or CDP PvC Base "classic cluster" registration in the Management Console, CDP
    asks you to enter cluster credentials. This is required for authenticating requests on the
    cluster side. CDP uses these credentials to access cluster APIs during and after cluster
    registration. During registration CDP stores these credentials securely in the vault and later
    whenever CDP makes an API call to the cluster,CDP reads these credentials from the vault and
    inject them inside the request.
