Access from CDP to customer resources
CDP creates clusters and runs jobs in your cloud provider account on your behalf. 
CDP requires your permission to be able to use the resources required by the clusters and jobs
   in your cloud provider account. To allow CDP to create clusters or run jobs in your cloud
   provider account:


Your AWS administrator must create a cross-account access IAM role and grant CDP access to
     the role as a trusted principal. The policy defined for the cross-account access IAM role must
     include permissions to allow CDP to create and manage resources and to perform the tasks and
     access the resources required for the CDP clusters and jobs. 
Your Azure account administrator must create an app registration and assign a role to it
     with permissions allowing CDP to create and manage resources and to perform the tasks and
     access the resources required for the CDP clusters and jobs.
Your GCP account administrator must create a service account and assign permissions allowing
     CDP to create and manage resources and to perform the tasks and access the resources required
     for the CDP clusters and jobs.
