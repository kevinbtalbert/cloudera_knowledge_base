Authentication with Apache Knox
Apache Knox handles proxy for web UIs and APIs, and Trusted Proxy propagates the
  authenticated end user to the backend service.
Knox Gateway
Apache Knox Gateway is a reverse proxy that authenticates and provides a single access point
    for REST and HTTP interactions with the CDP Data Hub clusters.

Trusted proxy
Knox Trusted Proxy is useful in cloud deployments when you need the seamless and uniform
    authentication benefits of both proxy and SSO. Trusted Proxy is automatically configured by
    Cloudera Manager in CDP deployments.
Knox Trusted Proxy propagates the authenticated end user to the backend service. The request
    is "trusted" in that the given backend/service is able to validate that the request came from a
    certain place and was allowed to make the request. A backend in this case is any service that
    Knox is acting as a proxy for (e.g., Cloudera Manager, Hive JDBC, Ranger UI, etc). Each of these
    services have a mechanism to ensure that the 1) request IP address and 2) request user matches
    what it expects. If the request matches those two things, then the service will not have to
    authenticate again and can trust that Knox sent the request. 
When making requests to the cluster, Knox first authenticates the end user, and then
    adds that user as a query parameter to the request (?doAs=USERNAME) to the
    backend. The backend then checks that the request is trusted (request IP and request user) and
    extracts the end user (USERNAME) from the query parameter. The backend service
    then does whatever is necessary as that backend user. Knox and the proxied services authenticate
    to each other via Kerberos.


SSO via Knox
Knox SSO is configured automatically.
