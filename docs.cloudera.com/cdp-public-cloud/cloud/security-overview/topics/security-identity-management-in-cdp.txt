CDP Identity Management includes the CDP user management system and Knox authentication. 
CDP user management systemCDP Management Console includes a user management system that allows you to integrate         your identity provider and manage user access to CDP resources. FreeIPA identity managementFederating identity management with users/groups maintained in FreeIPA and passwords     authenticated via SSO to an SAML-compliant identity provider (IDP) provides the necessary     backbone infrastructure needed for CDP services, without requiring you to expose your on-prem     identity management system over the network. Cloud identity federationWhen accessing cloud storage in CDP, credentials are provided by Knox IDBroker, an   identity federation solution that exchanges cluster authentication for temporary cloud   credentials. Authentication with Apache KnoxApache Knox handles proxy for web UIs and APIs, and Trusted Proxy propagates the   authenticated end user to the backend service.
