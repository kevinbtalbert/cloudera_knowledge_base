Identifying Resource-Hungry Workloads
This task compares a workload with all other workloads in your cluster for identifying
  workloads that are using an excessive amount of resources.
Workload Manager and Workload XM enables you to compare the resource consumption of a
   particular workload or user against all other workloads or users in the cluster. importantThis task assumes that you have created workload views.
    For more information on how to create a Workload View, see Related
     Information.
For example, you can compare the resource consumption of a specific workload against all the
   workloads in the cluster with the Resource Consumption chart widget, as
   shown in the following image: 


When you compare the two chart metrics, the chart on the left shows that of a single workload
   that is consuming half the memory; 1.9 TiB verses 3.7 TiB. 
You can delve deeper by creating a Workload View whose user criteria value is the user whose
   jobs are consuming an inordinate amount of memory and then create a Workload View whose user
   criteria value comprises all the users except the user that is of interest. 


When you compare the two chart metrics over the same time frame, the chart on the left shows
   the memory consumption as 84 GiB and the CPU core hours as 6.1K compared to 3.7 TiB and 20K.
You could migrate this user to CDP and relieve some resources from your on-premises system.
