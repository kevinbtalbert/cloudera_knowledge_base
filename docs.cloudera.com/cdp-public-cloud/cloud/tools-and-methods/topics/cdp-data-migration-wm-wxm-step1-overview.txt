Step 1 Identify Current and Potential Issues
Describes the tasks that help you discover which workloads to migrate and which
  workloads and users are currently containing issues and impacting costs, such as those resources
  that are consuming large amounts of CPU and memory.
Performing an in-depth analysis of your workloads helps you understand the level of effort
   required and helps you schedule and prioritize the order in which your workloads are migrated.
   Workload Manager and Workload XM identify existing and potential problems and their prescriptive
   guidance and recommendations enable you to quickly address and optimize those problems before or
   after migration. 
The following tasks help you identify and analyze the state of your current workloads.  

Identifying Workload Problems and Health IssuesThis task identifies what workloads are running on your CDH and HDP clusters and if         there are any health issues that exist or were encountered and not addressed. Identifying Resource ContentionThis task identifies the resource usage and consumption of your         workloads.Identifying Rogue Users from a Workload ViewThis task identifies rogue users, which are users that consume excessive amounts of         resources that can impact your costs.Identifying Resource-Hungry WorkloadsThis task compares a workload with all other workloads in your cluster for identifying   workloads that are using an excessive amount of resources.Parent topic: Accelerate Your Migration to CDP with Workload Manager or Workload XM
