Considerations for Amazon S3
Cloud bucket requirements for setting up S3 cloud account.



You need a cloud bucket with user credentials that you can enter in
                        Replication Manager, so Replication Manager can access the bucket.


The bucket has to have enough space for the replicated data, and
                        write permissions to copy the data.


The bucket needs to support cloud storage encryption types
                        supported by Replication Manager (SSE-S3 & SSE-KMS).
