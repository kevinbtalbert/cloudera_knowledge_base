Hive cloud replication
Replication Manager supports replication of the Hive database from a cluster with
    underlying HDFS to another cluster with cloud storage. It uses push-based replication, with the
    replication job running on the cluster with HDFS. 
Hive stores its metadata in Hive Metastore, but the underlying data is stored in HDFS or
      cloud storage. In a Hadoop cluster with Hive service, the Hive warehouse directory can be
      configured with either HDFS or cloud
      storage.
You can perform the following tasks with Hive replication:

You can rename the dataset in the policy that is replicated.
You can create a pull-based policy on the source cluster to move data from the target back
        into the source cluster Hive database.

Hive replication from an HDFS-based cluster to a cloud storage-based cluster requires the
      following components:

Source cluster - The cluster with a Hive warehouse directory on local HDFS. This can be an
        on-premises cluster or an IaaS cluster with data on local HDFS. The required services are
        HDFS, YARN, Hive, Ranger, Knox, and DLM Engine.
Destination cluster - The cluster with data on cloud storage. The cluster minimally
        requires Hive Metastore, Ranger, Knox, and DLM Engine.

Replication Manager does not manage Ranger policies and any Personally Identifiable
      Information (PII) or any other secure data that gets replicated from on-premises to Amazon S3.
      You must manage these items outside of Replication Manager.
