Configuring SSL/TLS certificate exchange between two Cloudera Manager instances
The Replication Manager configures replication peers between two clusters before
        running the replication job. You can manually set up an SSL/TLS certificate exchange between
        two Cloudera Manager instances that manage source and target cluster respectively.
        Replication Manager uses this information to set up the peers for secure data
        replication.

important
The following sample commands use the
                        open-jdk-11 java version. Use the java version that
                    you use in CDP clusters in these commands.



List the contents of the keystore file located in the source cluster Cloudera
                    Manager.

/usr/lib/jvm/java-openjdk-11/bin/keytool -list -keystore /var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks -storepass [***password***]
tipThe global truststore password is
                        available in the /etc/hadoop/conf/ssl-client.xml
                        file.


Export the certificate contents to the cert.txt
                    file.

/usr/java/default/bin/keytool -exportcert -keystore /var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks -alias cmrootca-0 -file ./cert.txt -storepass [***truststore_pass***]



Copy the cert.txt file to all the hosts of the target
                    cluster Cloudera Manager securely.

$ mv cert.txt othercert.txt
$ scp -i [***PEM file***] othercert.txt root@[***host_ip***]:/home/


Import the certificate into the keystore file on all the hosts of the target
                    cluster Cloudera Manager.

/usr/java/default/bin/keytool -importcert -noprompt -v -trustcacerts -keystore /var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks -alias cmrootca-1 -file ./othercert.txt --storepass [***truststore_password***]


Run steps 1 and 2 in the target cluster Cloudera Manager, and then copy the
                        cert.txt file to all the hosts in the source cluster
                    Cloudera Manager securely, and import the certificate into the keystore file on
                    all the hosts of the source cluster Cloudera Manager (steps 3 and 4).
