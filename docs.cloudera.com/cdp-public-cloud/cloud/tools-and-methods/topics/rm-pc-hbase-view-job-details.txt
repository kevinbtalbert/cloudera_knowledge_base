Monitor HBase replication policy job details
When you click a replication policy on the "Replication Policies" page, the "Job
    History" tab appears. On this tab, you can view the previous replication jobs, current running
    job, and one future scheduled job for the replication policy. 
Replication policy job details
The following columns appear for each replication policy:
Type of job. Click the job to view the completed and
            in-progress steps that Replication Manager takes to complete the job. Here, you can
            verify whether the first-time setup configuration between the source and destination
            clusters was successful.tipYou can also view the
              progress and results of the first-time setup on the Cloudera Manager  > Running Commands page for the source and destination clusters.

Timestamp when the job Started.


Timestamp when the job Ended.


Duration taken to complete the job.


Progress of the job run.



Actions menu
On the Actions menu, you can perform the following tasks on the HBase
        replication policy:


Option 
Description



Edit*
Enables you to edit the replication policy name or delete one or more tables

                for the HBase replication policy.You can also edit Source to
                  delete the tables in the HBase replication policy. 



Delete 
Removes the HBase replication policy permanently.You can Force
                    Delete an HBase replication policy after Replication Manager fails
                  to delete the replication policy.


Suspend
Pauses an active HBase replication policy. This option appears for target
                clusters using Cloudera Manager 7.9.0 (Cloudera Manager API** version 51) and
                  higher.warningWhen you suspend an HBase
                  replication policy, Replication Manager suspends all the HBase replication
                  policies between the same source and destination cluster. You can suspend
                only the specified replication policy for target clusters using Cloudera Manager
                with API version lower than 45. However, the Suspend option
                is not available for clusters using Cloudera Manager with API versions 45 through
                50. 


Activate
Resumes a suspended HBase replication policy. warningWhen you activate a suspended HBase replication policy, Replication
                  Manager activates all the suspended HBase replication policies between the same
                  source and destination cluster. You can activate only the specified
                suspended policy for target clusters using Cloudera Manager with API** version lower
                than 51.


View command details
Opens the latest HBase replication policy job page. The steps and substeps
                appear in a tree view. The failed steps are expanded by default, showing the last 15
                lines of the log. You can also view the command details for a Hive replication
                  policy on the Overview > Issues & Updates panel.To view the complete log for all the jobs, go to the target cluster Cloudera Manager >  Running Commands page.


Retry First Time Setup
Runs the first-time setup configuration between the source and destination
                clusters if the first-time setup has failed. This option is available only if the
                first-time setup configuration fails.After you click Retry
                    Create, you can choose:
to set an Set HBase Replication Machine
                        User and Sync Replication User to run the
                      first-time setup.
to opt for Rolling HBase Service Restart on
                        Source and Rolling HBase Service Restart On
                        Destination after the first-time setup is complete.
For more information about these options, see Creating HBase
                    replication policy.


Retry Failed Snapshots
Reruns the failed initial snapshots (and only the failed ones) in the
                replication policy if the Replication Manager failed to replicate the existing data
                of some tables.This option appears if you selected Select Source > Perform Initial Snapshot during policy creation and Replication Manager failed to replicate
                  the existing data. In this scenario, the policy status shows
                    Active with a Snapshot Failure warning message
                  on the Replication Policies page for the HBase replication
                  policy.


*To view and use the replication policies with an empty name
      in Replication Manager, you must understand the following implementation:
If the Cloudera Manager API version is lower than 51, an existing replication
          policy with an empty name can be used and updated. However, if you edit the replication
          policy and provide a name for the replication policy in versions higher or equal to 51,
          you must ensure that the name conforms to the validation rules.
If the Cloudera Manager API version is higher or equal to 51, it is mandatory
          that you provide a unique name to the replication policy to continue using it. This is
          because API version 51 and higher enforces the validation rules on all the replication
          policies.
To pass the replication policy name validation, you must ensure that the replication
      policy name is unique. The name can contain letters, numbers, and the _
/
- characters. You must also ensure that it does not contain the
      characters % . ; \ nor any character that is not ASCII printable, which includes the ASCII
      characters less than 32 and the ASCII characters that are greater than or equal to 127.**The endpoint
          http://[***cm_host***]:[***cm_port***]/api/version
      shows the API version of the Cloudera Manager.
