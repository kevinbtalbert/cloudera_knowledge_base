Support matrix for CDP Public Cloud Replication Manager
You can use Replication Manager or other alternate replication methods to replicate
        HDFS, Hive external tables, and HBase data between on-premises clusters (CDH clusters, CDP
        Private Cloud Base clusters, HDP clusters) and CDP Public Cloud (Amazon S3 and Microsoft
        Azure ADLS Gen2 (ABFS)) clusters. Replication Manager from HDP clusters to CDP Public Cloud
        Azure is a beta feature and is not available for general use.
noteBefore you create replication policies, you must verify whether
            the on-premises cluster versions are supported by Replication Manager, register the
            on-premises clusters as classic clusters in the Management Console, register the cloud
            account credentials in the Replication Manager service, verify cluster access, and
            configure minimum ports for replication.
See the other sections in this topic for the supported cluster and runtime
            versions.
Replication Manager provides the following functionalities that you can use to
            accomplish your data replication goals:
HDFS replication policies replicate HDFS data and metadata from:
on-premises clusters (CDH, CDP Private Cloud Base, and HDP) to
                            cloud storage. 
cloud storage to classic clusters (CDH or CDP Private Cloud
                            Base clusters). 
You can choose the frequency during policy creation to
                        replicate the data.
Hive replication policies support table-level replication and can replicate Hive
                    external tables from on-premises clusters (CDH and CDP Private Cloud Base) to
                    cloud storage and to Data Hubs. They also can:
replicate data stored in Hive tables, Hive metadata, data in
                            Hive metastore, and Impala metadata (catalog server metadata) associated
                            with Impala tables registered in the Hive metastore, andnoteHive2 managed tables are converted to external
                                tables after replication.
migrate Sentry permissions to Ranger.noteTo perform the Sentry policy replication, you
                                must be running the Sentry service on CDH 5.12 or higher, or any CDH
                                6.x version.You can choose the frequency during
                                policy creation to replicate the data.

HBase replication policies replicate HBase data from a source classic cluster
                    (CDH or CDP Private Cloud Base cluster), COD, or Data Hub to a target Data Hub
                    or COD cluster. You can also copy or replicate HBase data between different
                    environments within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using these policies. Table 1. Supported cluster and runtime versions for HBase replication

                                        source classic clusters in an HBase replication policy.important

You can replicate HBase data in SFT-enabled
                                                  clusters for target clusters with version CDP
                                                  7.2.16 or higher using HBase replication
                                                  policies.
You can replicate Phoenix tables from CDH 5.16.2
                                                  and higher using Cloudera Manager 7.4.4 and higher
                                                  to COD using HBase replication
                                                  policies.
You cannot create HBase replication policies if
                                                  the target CDP version is 7.2.16 or any 7.2.16
                                                  service packs and the source Cloudera Manager
                                                  version is 7.7.3 or lower, and the source Cloudera
                                                  Manager API version is v50 or higher.tipThe endpoint

HBase replication policies replicate all the data from the specified
                        tables and then continue to replicate the changed data automatically without
                        user intervention.

noteAlternate replication methods:
Use the replication plugin for HBase data. For more information, see
                        COD replication in a Nutshell, Cloudera replication plugin, and HBase data replication.
