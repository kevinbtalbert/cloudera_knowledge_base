Table-level replication
To enable table-level replication, you must specify the list of tables to be
        replicated in a given replication policy. Table-level replication enables you to replicate
        just the critical tables. It also helps you to speed-up the replication process and also
        reduces network bandwidth utilization.
noteWhile using on-premises source clusters, multiple databases and tables can
            be specified in a single replication policy.
You can define table-level replication policy using regular expressions, for
            example, db.marketing_*. You can dynamically add or remove tables to the list by
            manually changing the replication policy during run time. Hive also automatically
            validates the rename table operation to check if the new table name is included or
            excluded as per the defined replication policy and act accordingly.
Hive supports database level replication policy of the format
                <db_name>.*. In the real-time world, the policy format is
            similar to <db_name>.(t1, t3, â€¦). The tables list can be specified
            using Java supported regular expressions in the replication policy of format:
                <db_name>.<include_regex>.<exclude_regex>. 
The replication policy has three parts separated with a dot
                (.). First part is the database name, the second part is
            single regular expression (regex) to represent the included tables list, and the third
            part is single regex to represent the tables that needs to be excluded from the list
            even if it matches the include_regex format.
The following examples illustrate the different ways to specify the tables list
            in the policy:


<db_name> -- Full DB replication which is currently
                    supported.
<db_name>.'.*?' -- Full DB replication.
<db_name>.'t1|t3' -- DB replication with static list of
                    tables t1 and t3 included.
<db_name>.'(t1*)|t2'.'t100' -- DB replication with all
                    tables having prefix t1 and also include table t2 which does not have prefix t1
                    and exclude t100 which has the prefix t1.


Limitations using table-level replication

If any table is dynamically added for replication due to changes in regular
                expression or added to the include list, the tables data may
                not be point-in-time consistent with other tables which are already replicated
                incrementally. However, this inconsistency is seen for a very small duration of
                completing next incremental replication after tables are added in the bootstrapped
                manner.
Hive does not support overlapping replication policies such as db.,,
                    db.[t1], and *. to same target database but works fine if the target
                database is different.
