When you click Replication Manager on the CDP Public Cloud web interface, the
        Overview page appears. The page provides a snapshot of the Replication Manager service. It
        provides insights into issues and updates related to various entities and resources through
        dashboards like classic clusters, replication policies, and so on.
The following panels appear on the Overview page:
Classic Clusters - Tracks the total number of clusters
                    enabled for Replication Manager, the number of clusters that are in an error
                    state, the number of clusters that are active, and the number of clusters for
                    which a warning is issued.
Policies - Tracks the number of replication policies that
                    are in use and their status.
Jobs - Tracks the total number of running and failed jobs
                    and their status in Replication Manager.
Issues & Updates - Lists the replication policies
                    that have running jobs with at least one job in Failed status in the most recent
                    ten jobs. If you do not see any policy, it indicates that the last ten jobs of
                    all the replication policies were successful.
