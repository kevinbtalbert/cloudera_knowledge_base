Cloudera Manager
Cloudera Manager is an application you use to manage, configure, and monitor CDP Private
  Cloud Base clusters and Cloudera Runtime services. Cloudera recommends that you install Cloudera
  Runtime services using Cloudera Manager.
You can install the Runtime services using parcels or native packages. A parcel is a binary
   distribution format. Parcels offer a number of benefits including consistency, flexible
   installation location, installation without sudo, reduced upgrade downtime, rolling upgrades, and
   easy downgrades. Cloudera recommends using parcels, though using packages is supported.
