Database guidelines
Review the best practices and Cloudera's recommendations for databases for your clusters
  during your planning phase.
Cloudera Manager and runtime services come packaged with an embedded PostgreSQL database for
   use in non-production environments. The embedded PostgreSQL database is not supported in
   production environments. For production environments, you must configure your cluster to use
   dedicated external databases. For more information on compatibility and special considerations,
   see Database Requirements.
Use UTF8 encoding for all custom databases.
noteCloudera recommends that for most purposes you use the default
   versions of databases that correspond to the operating system of your cluster nodes. See the
   operating system's documentation to verify support if you choose to use a database other than the
   default. Enabling database backup for these databases should be addressed by the your IT
   department.
