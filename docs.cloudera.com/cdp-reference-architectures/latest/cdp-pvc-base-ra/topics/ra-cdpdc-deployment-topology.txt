Deployment topology
Learn about the recommended deployment topology for your CDP Private Cloud Base cluster
  that allows each host to maximize throughput and minimize latency, while encouraging
  scalability.
The following graphic shows a cluster deployed across several racks (Rack 1, Rack 2, â€¦ Rack n).
   Each host is connected to two top-of-rack (TOR) switches which are in turn connected to a
   collection of spine switches which are then connected to the enterprise network. This deployment
   model allows each host to maximize throughput and minimize latency, while encouraging
   scalability. The specifics of the network topology are described in the subsequent sections. The
   nomenclature represents the rack number, the role of a node in the cluster, and its ordinality in
   the rack. For example: r1mn1 would represent Rack1, Master Node 1, and so on. Every rack need not
   have a master node. It is a good practice to spread all master nodes of a cluster across
   different racks to avoid single point of failure. Gateway and utility nodes also reside within
   these racks (not annotated in the diagram).
