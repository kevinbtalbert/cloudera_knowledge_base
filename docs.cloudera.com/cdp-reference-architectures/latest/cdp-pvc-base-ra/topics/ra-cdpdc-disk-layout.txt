Disk layout
Review the recommended layout for master and worker nodes.
The following layout is recommended for master nodes:

2 x Disks (capacity at least 500 GB) in RAID 1 (software or hardware) for operating
    system (OS) and logs.
4 x Disks (>= 1 TB each) in RAID 10 for Database data (see Note).
2 x Disks (capacity at least 1 TB) in RAID 1 (software or hardware) for NameNode
    metadata.
1 x Disk JBOD/RAID 0 for ZooKeeper (>= 1TB) (see Note).
1 x Disk JBOD/RAID 0 for Quorum JournalNode (>= 1 TB).

importantIdeally, databases should be run on an external host
   rather than running on the master node.
noteIf a customer has experienced fsync delays and other I/O related
   issues with ZooKeeper, ZooKeeper’s dataDir and dataLogDir can be configured to use separate
   disks. It is hard to determine ahead of time whether this will be necessary; even a small cluster
   can result in heavy ZooKeeper activity.
The following layout is recommended for worker nodes:

2x Disks (capacity at least 500 GB) in RAID 1 (software or hardware) for OS and
    logs.
12-24 SATA Disks JBOD mode (or as multiple single-drive RAID 0 volumes if using a
    RAID controller incapable of doing JBOD passthrough) no larger than 4 TB in capacity. If the
    RAID controller has cache, use it for write caching (preferably with battery backup) and disable
    read caching. Follow your hardware vendor’s best practices where available.
For a higher performance profile, use 10K RPM SATA or faster SAS drives. These
    often have lower capacity, but capacity considerations can be offset by adding more data
    nodes.

RAID controllers should be configured to disable any optimization settings for the
   RAID 0 volumes.
importantDo not create multi-disk RAID 0 volumes.
