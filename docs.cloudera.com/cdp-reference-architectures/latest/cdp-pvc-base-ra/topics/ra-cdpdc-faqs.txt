FAQs
Review the information about some of the common questions related to having multiple
  data centers, operating systems, storage options, and RDBMS.
Operating systems
Review the list of supported operating systems for Cloudera Runtime and
    Cloudera Manager.

Storage options and configuration
The HDFS data directories should use local storage, which provides all the benefits
    of keeping compute resources close to the storage and not reading remotely over the network.
The root device size for CDP Private Cloud Base clusters should be at least 500 GB
    to allow parcels and logs to be stored.
To guard against data center failures, you can set up a scheduled distcp operation
    to persist data to a supported cloud object storage platform. For examples, see Using DistCp to copy files. You can also leverage
    Cloudera Managerâ€™s Replication Manager feature to backup data to another
    running cluster.

Relational databases
CDP Private Cloud Base deployments require relational databases for Cloudera
    Manager, Hive Metastore, Hue, Ranger, Atlas, Oozie, and so on. The database credentials are
    required during CDP Private Cloud Base installation. See Required Databases for more information.
noteThe embedded PostgreSQL database is not supported for use in
    production environments.
