By default, major compactions happen every 7 days. The next major compaction happens 7
  days after the last one has finished. This means that the actual time that major compaction
  happens can impact production processes, which is not ideal if it is desired to run compactions at
  a specific known off-peak hour, such as at 3 AM.
Cloudera recommends that you disable automatic major compaction by setting the interval to zero
   in Cloudera Manager (hbase.hregion.majorcompaction = 0). Major compactions
   should then be run using cron jobs by calling the HBase admin tool.
