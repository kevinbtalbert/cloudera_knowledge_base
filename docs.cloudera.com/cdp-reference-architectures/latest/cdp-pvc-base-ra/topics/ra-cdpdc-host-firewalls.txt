Host-based firewalls
Cloudera recommends disabling host-based firewalls on the cluster, until the cluster is
  up and running. Many problems that are difficult to diagnose result from incorrect or conflicting
  host-based firewall entries that interfere with normal cluster communication. 
Run the following commands to disable host-based firewalls for both IPv4 and IPv6 on RHEL and
   CentOS operating
   systems:systemctl stop firewalld.service
systemctl disable firewalld.service
For those who must restrict access using host-based firewalls, see the list of
   ports
   used by Cloudera Manager, Cloudera Runtime components, managed services, and third-party
   components.
