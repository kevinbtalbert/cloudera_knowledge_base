Hostname naming convention
Cloudera recommends using a hostname convention that allows for easy recognition of
  roles and/or physical connectivity. This is especially important for configuring rack awareness
  within Cloudera Manager.
Using a project name identifier, followed by the rack ID, the machine class, and a machine ID
   is an easy way to encode useful information about the cluster. For example,
    acme-test-r01m01.
This hostname represents the ACME customerâ€™s test project, rack #1, and master node #1.
