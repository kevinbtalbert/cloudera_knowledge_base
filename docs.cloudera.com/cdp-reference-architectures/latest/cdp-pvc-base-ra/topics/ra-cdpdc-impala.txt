Impala
The Impala service is a distributed, MPP database engine for interactive performance
  of SQL
  queries over large data sets. Impala performs best when it can operate on data in memory.
  Therefore, Impala is often configured with a very large heap size.
Impala daemon processes must be colocated with HDFS data nodes to use HDFS local
   reads, which also improve performance.
Impala does not provide any built-in load balancing, so a production Impala
   deployment should be deployed behind a load balancer for performance and high availability. For
   more information on configuring Impala with a load balancer, see Configuring Load Balancer for
   Impala.
Before deploying Impala in a production environment, review the Impala performance best
   practices.
