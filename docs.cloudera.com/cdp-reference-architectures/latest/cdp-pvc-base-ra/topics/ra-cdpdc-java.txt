Java guidelines
Review the best practices and Cloudera's recommendations on JDKs for your clusters
  during your planning phase.
Only 64 bit JDKs are supported on the CDP clusters.
Unless specifically excluded, Cloudera supports later updates to a major JDK release from the
   release that support was introduced. Cloudera excludes or removes support for select Java updates
   when security is jeopardized.
Running Cloudera runtime hosts within the same cluster on different JDK releases is not
   supported. All cluster hosts must use the same JDK update level. See Java Requirements for the
   latest information in terms of compatibility and special considerations.
