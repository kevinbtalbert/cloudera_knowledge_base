Kafka
Kafkaâ€™s default configuration with Cloudera Manager is suited to start development
  quickly. Several default settings should be changed before deploying a Cloudera Kafka cluster in
  production. 
The default ZooKeeper Kafka root is /. However, Cloudera recommends
   changing this to /kafka. This is the location within ZooKeeper where the znodes
   for the Kafka cluster are stored. As long as a single Kafka cluster is using the ZooKeeper
   service, using /kafka is recommended. If multiple Kafka clusters, for example,
   the development, test, and QA teams are sharing a ZooKeeper service, then each Kafka instance
   should have a unique ZooKeeper root. For example, /kafka-dev,
    /kafka-test, /kafka-qa.
Cloudera Manager enables automatic creation of Kafka topics by default. If some data
   is written to a Kafka topic, then this operation creates that topic, if that topic does not exist
   already. While this may be convenient in prototyping and development, auto-creation of Kafka
   topics should not be used in production environments. Auto-creation can lead to creation of
   arbitrary topics and data can be written to the wrong topic, in case the application is
   configured incorrectly.
Cloudera Manager sets the default minimum number of in-sync replicas (ISR) to 1. This
   should generally be increased to a minimum of 2 in a production cluster to prevent data loss.
The Kafka Maximum Process File Descriptors setting may need to be increased in
   certain production deployments. This value can be monitored in Cloudera Manager and increased if
   usage requires a larger value than the default 64 k limit.
The default data retention time for Kafka is acceptable for production deployments,
   but it should be reviewed based on the use case.
