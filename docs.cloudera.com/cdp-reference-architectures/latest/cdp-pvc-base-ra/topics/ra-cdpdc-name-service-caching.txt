Name service caching
Cloudera recommends that you enable name service caching, particularly for clusters that
  use non-local Hadoop functional accounts, such as the hdfs and yarn users. This becomes critical
  in the case where the latter is combined with using Kerberos. Many difficult-to-diagnose problems
  can arise when name service lookups time out or fail during heavy cluster utilization.
Enable the Name Service Cache Daemon (nscd) by running the following commands on RHEL and
   CentOS 7 operating systems:systemctl start nscd.service
systemctl enable nscd.service
If you are running Red Hat SSSD, then you must modify the nscd configuration to not cache the
        passwd, group, or netgroup
      information.
