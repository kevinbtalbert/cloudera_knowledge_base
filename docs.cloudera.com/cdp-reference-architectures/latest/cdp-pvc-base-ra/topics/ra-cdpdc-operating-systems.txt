Operating system guidelines
Review the best practices and Cloudera's recommendations for installing operating
  systems (OS) on your clusters during your planning phase.
You must be aware of the following guidelines related to the operating system (OS) versions:
All runtime hosts in a logical cluster must run on the same major OS release.
Cloudera supports a temporarily mixed OS configuration during an OS upgrade
     project.
Cloudera Manager must run on the same OS release as one of the clusters it
     manages.

Cloudera recommends running the same minor release on all cluster nodes. However, the
   risk caused by running different minor OS releases is considered lower than the risk of running
   different major OS releases.
You must be aware of the following guidelines related to the supported platforms:
Cloudera does not support runtime cluster deployments in Docker containers.
CDP Private Cloud Base is supported on platforms with Security-Enhanced Linux
     (SELinux) enabled and in an enforcing mode. Typical best practice is to implement SELinux in a
     permissive mode in order to benefit from regular security and feature improvements. Cloudera is
     not responsible for policy support or policy enforcement. If you experience issues with
     SELinux, contact your OS provider.

See CDP Private Cloud Base operating systems requirements for the latest information on
   compatibility and special considerations. See Cloudera Security Reference Architecture for
   cluster security best practices.
