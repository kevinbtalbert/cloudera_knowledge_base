Physical component list
Review the minimum configuration of physical components recommended for deploying a CDP
  Private Cloud Base cluster.

Configuration
Description
Quantity



Physical servers
Two-socket, 8-16 cores per socket, > 2 GHz; minimum 128 GB RAM.
Hosts the various cluster components.
Based on cluster design.


NICs
10 Gbps Ethernet NICs (minimum required).
Provides the data network services for the cluster.
At least one per server, although two NICs can be bonded for additional
        throughput.importantCloudera does not support
        multi-homing. Multiple network adapters can be used, but they must be aggregated to provide
        a single host IP per node.


Internal HDDs
500 GB HDD or SSD/NVMe recommended for operating system and logs; HDD for
       data disks (size varies with data volume requirements). SSD/NVMe can be used for YARN local
       directories.
Ensures continuity of service on server resets and
       contains
       the cluster data.
10-24 disks per physical server. The largest storage density currently
       supported is 100 TB per DataNode.


Ethernet ToR/leaf switches
Minimum 10 Gbps switches with sufficient port density to accommodate the
       cluster. These require enough ports to create a realistic spine-leaf topology providing ISL
       bandwidth above a 1:4 oversubscription ratio (preferably 1:1). 
Although most enterprises have mature data network practices, consider
       building a dedicated data network for the Hadoop cluster.
At least two per rack.


Ethernet spine switches
Minimum 40 Gbps switches with sufficient port density to accommodate incoming
       ISL links and ensure required throughput over the spine (for inter-rack traffic).
Same considerations as for ToR switches.
Depends on the number of racks.
