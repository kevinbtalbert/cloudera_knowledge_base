Power supplies
Hadoop software is designed around the expectation that nodes can fail. Redundant
  hot-swap power supplies are not necessary for worker nodes, but should be used for master,
  utility, and edge nodes. 
If you are using a single power supply on worker nodes, confer with your data center
   team to alternate the power feeds for each rack. For example, Rack 1 goes on Feed A, Rack 2 goes
   on Feed B, Rack 3 goes on Feed C, and continuing the pattern.
