Right-size server configuration guidelines
Cloudera recommends deploying up to four machine types into your production environment:
  master nodes, worker nodes, utility nodes, and edge nodes.

Master nodes
Runs the Hadoop master daemons such as NameNode, Standby NameNode, YARN Resource Manager and
     History Server, the HBase Master daemon, Ranger server, Atlas server, and the Impala StateStore
     server and Catalog server. Master nodes are also the location where Zookeeper and JournalNodes
     are installed. The daemons can share a single pool of servers. Depending on the cluster size,
     the roles can be run on a dedicated server. Kudu Master servers should also be deployed on
     master nodes.
Worker nodes
Runs the HDFS DataNode, YARN NodeManager, HBase RegionServer, Impala impalad, Search worker
     daemons and Kudu Tablet Servers on the worker nodes.
Utility nodes
Runs Cloudera Manager and the Cloudera Management Services. It can also host a MariaDB or
     another supported database instance, which is used by Cloudera Manager, Hive, Ranger, and other
     Hadoop-related projects.
Edge nodes
Contains all client-facing configurations and services, including gateway configurations for
     HDFS, YARN, Impala, Hive, and HBase. The edge node is also a good place for Hue, Oozie,
     HiveServer2, and Impala HAProxy. HiveServer2 and Impala HAProxy serve as a gateway to external
     applications such as the business intelligence (BI) tools. Edge nodes are also known as Gateway
     nodes.

noteThe edge and utility nodes can be combined in smaller clusters.

   Assignments.
