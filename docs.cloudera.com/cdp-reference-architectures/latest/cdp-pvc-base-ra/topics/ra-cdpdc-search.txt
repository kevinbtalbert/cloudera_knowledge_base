Search
Cloudera Search is a service based on Apache Solr. It provides a distributed search
  engine service. Search engines are often expected to provide fast, interactive performance so it
  is important to allocate sufficient RAM to the Search service
If other resource intensive applications, such as Impala, are deployed on the same cluster,
   then use the resource management facilities available in Cloudera Manager for Search. In some
   cases, it may also be preferable to avoid colocating the Search service with other services.
