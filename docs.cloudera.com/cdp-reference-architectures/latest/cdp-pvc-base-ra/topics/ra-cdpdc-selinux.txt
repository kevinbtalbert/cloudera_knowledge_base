SELinux
CDP Private Cloud Base is supported on platforms with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)
  enabled in permissive mode. However Cloudera recommends SELinux be disabled on all machines in the
  Hadoop cluster until the cluster is up and running.
The Linux command getenforce returns the status of SELinux.
SELinux can be disabled on RHEL or CentOS by editing /etc/selinux/config
   and setting SELINUX=disabled. This change must be done
   as root (or with proper sudo access), and requires a reboot.
note
Cloudera does not provide SELinux policies to enable enforcing mode. This is beyond
    the scope of what Cloudera tests and validates.
Customers requiring this must carefully evaluate the audit details from permissive
    mode and create customer-specific policies accordingly. If issues arise in the platform due to
    SELinux enforcing policies, you may be requested to disable them by Cloudera Support when
    opening support cases.
