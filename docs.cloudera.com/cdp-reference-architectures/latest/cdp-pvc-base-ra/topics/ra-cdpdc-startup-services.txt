Startup services
As with any production server, unused services that have been enabled by default during
    startup should be removed or disabled.
Some example services that are enabled by default and not needed by the CDP Private Cloud Base
    are:
bluetooth
cups
iptables
ip6tables
postfixnoteWhile not needed by CDP Private Cloud Base,
            postfix (or other MTA) may be required by other services to deliver generated
            notices/alerts from the system.

This list is not exhaustive. To view the list of services that are configured to start during
   system startup, run the following command on RHEL and CentOS operating
   systems:systemctl list-unit-files --type service | grep enabled
