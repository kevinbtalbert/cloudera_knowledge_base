Time and date
All machines in the cluster need to have the same time and date settings, including time
    zones. Use of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) is recommended. Many cluster services are
    sensitive to time (For example HBase, Kudu, and ZooKeeper) and troubleshooting is easier if time
    is consistent across all hosts.
You can enable the NTP daemon by running the following commands on RHEL and CentOS 7 operating
      systems:systemctl start ntpd.service
systemctl enable ntpd.service
noteChrony may be preferred on newer operating systems.
