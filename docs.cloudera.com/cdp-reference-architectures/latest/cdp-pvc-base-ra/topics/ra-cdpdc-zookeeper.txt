ZooKeeper
Learn why it is recommended to install ZooKeeper on a node where it can have
  unobstructed access to the disk.
ZooKeeper is sensitive to disk latency. While it only uses a modest amount of resources, having
   ZooKeeper swap out or wait for a disk operation can result in that ZooKeeper node being
   considered ‘dead’ by its quorum peers. For this reason, Cloudera recommends against deploying
   ZooKeeper on worker nodes where loads are unpredictable and are prone to spikes. It is acceptable
   to deploy Zookeeper on master nodes where load is more uniform and predictable (or on any node
   where it can have unobstructed access to disk).
