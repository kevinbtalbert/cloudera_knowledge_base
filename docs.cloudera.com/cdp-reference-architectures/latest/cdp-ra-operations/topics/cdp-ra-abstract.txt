Abstract
This document brings together a series of recommendations, best-practices and links to
  resources that help in the planning and understanding of disaster recovery solutions for Cloudera
  Data Platform (CDP).
It is written for practitioners involved in the planning and implementation of business
   continuity, disaster recovery and backup procedures. It outlines a set of definitions and
   recommendations aligned with open industry standards, provides high-level recommendations and a
   checklist of resources and documents that can be used for informed decision-making. The document
   does not make specific recommendations with respect to measures or controls because these vary on
   a case by case basis.
