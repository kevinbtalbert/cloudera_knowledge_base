Prerequisites
This document assumes that you have undertaken a series of reviews aligned with industry
  best practice in contingency planning, backup, and disaster recovery. We have included the section
  above to help align with the NIST guidance.
This document assumes that technically you have created a resilient, highly available
   cluster design that implements appropriate high availability and load balancing choices for the
   workloads associated with that cluster.
This document assumes that clusters are managed equivalently, minimizing
   configuration drift between the two environments that may make failover operations risky or prone
   to failure.
