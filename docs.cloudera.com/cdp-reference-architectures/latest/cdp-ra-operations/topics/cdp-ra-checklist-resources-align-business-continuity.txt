Aligning with business continuity standards
ISO 27031:2011 provides guidance for business continuity and recovery. This standard
  outlines the policies and procedures that apply during a disaster. The core areas of the standard
  help define the Plan, Do, Check, and Act stages of the processes and procedures. This has been
  expanded to include some preliminary discovery and broader areas of consideration.
NIST 800-34 provides guidance on contingency planning for federal organizations and outlines
   the seven stages to contingency planning with associated samples. For more information, see https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-34r1.pdf.
