Auditing
Ranger auditing is managed on a per-cluster basis. Ranger plugins log the audit details
  to both HDFS for long-term storage and to the infrastructure Solr instance for supporting audit
  search in the Ranger Admin UI. In the event that a Ranger plugin cannot write an audit log to
  either service, the plugin locally caches the audit event and attempts to replay it at a later
  time.
When you enable Ranger high availability (HA), you must also enable high availability
   on the HDFS and infrastructure Solr  dependencies. 
CDP makes no attempt to synchronize audit details across clusters in a disaster
   recovery setup. If unified audits are required, consider exporting the audit details to an
   external mechanism, such as a security information and event management (SIEM) framework.
