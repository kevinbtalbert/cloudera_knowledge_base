Authentication
CDP Private Cloud Base clusters in a disaster recovery pair utilize Kerberos to mutually
  authenticate each other for data replication and service access purposes. The clusters must exist
  in a common Kerberos realm, or two realms with some form of trust. One-way or cross-realm Kerberos
  trusts are acceptable. Refer to your operating system manuals for details on implementing Kerberos
  trusts.
