Data
Data is maintained on a file system or object store service such as HDFS or Ozone. Data
    may also exist in higher level abstractions maintained by a service such as HBase or Solr, which
    create their own file formats on HDFS. In other cases, for services such as Kudu or Kafka, the
    data is placed and maintained directly on a local disk.
File systemsCDP has multiple deployment methodologies in both public cloud and on-premises. These     form factors have multiple, interrelated mechanisms for storing data at various organizational     levels within the cluster. Each layer has specific requirements related to how and whether data     should be replicated. These layers include local file storage on individual nodes, HDFS, and     Ozone. Data StoresSeparate data stores might exist on top of HDFS and Ozone or at the local file system     level. These data stores might have their own replication or backup and restore mechanisms used     in conjunction with traditional Hadoop replication strategies. Services might have additional     availability capabilities and configurations to help establish intra-cluster high availability.     This creates a robust and fault tolerant environment when paired with cross-cluster     replication.Hive and Impala dataHive and Impala data generally reside on HDFS. Hive and Impala replication enables you   to copy your Hive metastore and data from one cluster to another. You can synchronize the Hive   metastore and data on the destination cluster with the source, based on a specified replication   policy.Parent topic: Disaster recovery checklist and resources
