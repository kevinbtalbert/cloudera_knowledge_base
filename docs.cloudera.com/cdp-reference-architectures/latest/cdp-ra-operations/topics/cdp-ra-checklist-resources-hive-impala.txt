Hive and Impala data
Hive and Impala data generally reside on HDFS. Hive and Impala replication enables you
  to copy your Hive metastore and data from one cluster to another. You can synchronize the Hive
  metastore and data on the destination cluster with the source, based on a specified replication
  policy.
There are two mechanisms to replicate Hive data on HDFS. The mechanism you choose
   depends on whether your tables are defined as managed or external.
The following table lists the table type and the replication method you can use to replicate
   data:


Table Type
Replication Style



Hive 3 Managed Transactional 
Hive built-in Replication


Hive 3 External
Replication Manager Hive replication policies


noteReplication Manager currently copies the Hive schema and data details.
   It does not copy the surrounding metadata and authorization policy in Apache Ranger and Apache
   Atlas. If you require to synchronize this information, you must do this manually. Both Apache
   Ranger and Apache Atlas provide import and export APIs to facilitate this. Refer to their
   respective sections below for more information.In cases where Hive and Impala
    utilize non-HDFS storage backends to manage data, such as Kudu or Phoenix on HBase, you must
    utilize the underlying storage mechanism to manage replication directly. If the underlying
    storage mechanism has no-native replication capability, such as Kudu, then dual-ingest solutions
    can be used to keep disaster recovery environments in sync.For information
    about using Replication Manager to create Hive replication policies, see Replicating Hive and Impala.
