Security and governance
CDP implements security and governance using Kerberos for authentication, Apache Ranger
  for policy enforcement and auditing, and Apache Atlas for metadata tagging and
  lineage.
AuthenticationCDP Private Cloud Base clusters in a disaster recovery pair utilize Kerberos to mutually   authenticate each other for data replication and service access purposes. The clusters must exist   in a common Kerberos realm, or two realms with some form of trust. One-way or cross-realm Kerberos   trusts are acceptable. Refer to your operating system manuals for details on implementing Kerberos   trusts.AuthorizationCDP utilizes Apache Ranger to implement a common authorization policy framework across     services and tracks user activity within those services. Services across a cluster interface     with Ranger using a plugin framework. When a service uses Ranger policies, the service loads a     plugin module that manages the authorization decisions, local service auditing, and syncing     policy updates from the Ranger Admin interface.AuditingRanger auditing is managed on a per-cluster basis. Ranger plugins log the audit details   to both HDFS for long-term storage and to the infrastructure Solr instance for supporting audit   search in the Ranger Admin UI. In the event that a Ranger plugin cannot write an audit log to   either service, the plugin locally caches the audit event and attempts to replay it at a later   time.Parent topic: Disaster recovery checklist and resources
