Workload
A workload or application consists of the services, data, schema and business metadata,
  security and governance policy, and supporting workload scripts and workflows that allow a
  business application to run correctly. 
When planning the disaster recovery architecture, you must account for each direct or indirect
   dependency within a workload to ensure it works correctly after a failure event.
