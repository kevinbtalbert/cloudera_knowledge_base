Encryption at rest
The company has a policy of having all Commercially Sensitive data, encrypted at rest,
  and therefore according to the data classification, the Climate Accounting data will be stored in
  the Finance encryption zone on the cluster. For the purposes of regulatory reporting the
  provenance of the data must be assured to the highest corporate standards. Therefore, encryption
  at rest is mandatory due to regulatory requirements.

Encryption Zones and Keys


Commands
In our example we use finance as the <keyname> and create a specific encryption
    zone for the needs of the finance department on our shared corporate clusters on hdfs at
     /warehouse/finance/:

Create zone /warehouse/finance/

Create an encryption key for your zone as keyadmin for the user/group
        (regardless of the application that will be using the encryption
        zone):sudo -u hbase hadoop key create <key_name>


Create a new empty directory and make it an encryption zone using the key created
      above:sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -mkdir /warehouse/finance/
sudo -u hdfs hdfs crypto -createZone -keyName finance -path /warehouse/finance/
You can verify creation of the new encryption zone by running the -listZones command. You
      should see the encryption zone along with its key listed as
      follows:sudo -u hdfs hdfs crypto -listZones
/warehouse/finance/ finance

In this case we create a general encryption zone for all financially sensitive
    information that will be stored on the cluster. Other encryption zones exist for other data
    classifications.
