Enabling browsing Ozone from Hue on CDW Private Cloud
Hue can read and write files on the Ozone filesystem, similar to S3 or ADLS. To
        access Ozone from Hue, you must add the necessary configurations in the hue-safety-valve
        within the Virtual Warehouse configurations.
You must perform this task on all Hive or Impala Virtual
            Warehouses in which you want to enable the Ozone File Browser.


You must have an Ozone parcel containing the HttpFS service. For installation,
                    see Ozone 718.2.0 installation
                        documentation.
Ensure that the Ozone HttpFS Gateway role is running in a healthy state.
Go to Cloudera Manager > Ozone > Configuration and add the following entries in the HttpFS Advanced
                        Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for httpfs-site.xml
                        field:
Field name
Value

Name
httpfs.proxyuser.[***PRINCIPAL-NAME***].hosts

Value
*

Name
httpfs.proxyuser.[***PRINCIPAL-NAME***].groups

Value
*
Replace the [***PRINCIPAL-NAME***] with the
                        actual kerberos principal name. For example, hive. You can
                        obtain the Kerberos principal name from the Hive service
                    configuration.
Obtain the following values from the Ozone service. You need it to construct the
                    fs_defaultfs and webhdfs_url URLs:
HttpFS Gateway host name
Ozone HttpFS Gateway TTP Web UI Port
                                (ozone.httpfs.http-port)9778 is the default.
Ozone Service ID (ozone.service.id). The Ozone service ID must
                            be specified when Ozone is configured in HA mode.




Log in to the Data Warehouse service as DWAdmin.

Go to Virtual Warehouse >  > Edit > CONFIGURATIONS > Hue and select hue-safety-valve from the
                        Configuration files drop-down menu.

Add the following lines:

[desktop]
[[ozone]]
[[[default]]]
fs_defaultfs=ofs://[***SERVICE-ID***] \\ozone1 by default
webhdfs_url=http://[***OZONE-HTTPFS-HOST***]:[***OZONE-HTTPFS-PORT***]/webhdfs/v1 \\https for secure cluster
ssl_cert_ca_verify=true
security_enabled=true

Specify https in the webhdfs_url
                    property if SSL is enabled on your cluster. If Ozone is not configured in HA
                    mode, then specify the URL for the Ozone manager. 

Click Apply Changes.

After configuring the Hue safety valve and restarting the
            Virtual Wrerhouse, you may see that Ozone file browser may take 10 - 15 minutes to
            display on the Hue web interface.
