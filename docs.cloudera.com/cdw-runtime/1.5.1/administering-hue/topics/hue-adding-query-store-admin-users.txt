Adding Query Processor Administrator users and groups in Cloudera Data Warehouse
The Query Processor Administrators have special privileges that enable them to view
        and monitor queries from all users, including the ones that were submitted from query
        interfaces, such as Beeline, Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC), Tableau, Impala-shell, Impyla,
        and other JDBC/ODBC clients.

Make sure that the Virtual Warehouse to which you want to add the Hue Query Processor
                Administrators users is in the stopped state.


Log in to the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) web interface as a DWAdmin.

Click  > Edit on the Database Catalog for which you want to add Hue Query
                    Processor Administrators users.

On the Database Catalog details page, click CONFIGURATIONS > Hue query processor and select hue-query-processor.json from
                    the Configuration files drop-down menu, as shown in the
                    following image:






In the “authConfig” section, add the list of users to the
                        “adminUsers” key.
For example: "adminUsers": "hive, [***USER-1***],
                        [***USER-2***]"
You can also add a list of admin groups as
                    follows:"adminGroups": "admin-group, [***GROUP-1***], [***GROUP-2***]"

Click Apply.
The Hue service will be unavailable for approximately 5 minutes to make the
                    update.
