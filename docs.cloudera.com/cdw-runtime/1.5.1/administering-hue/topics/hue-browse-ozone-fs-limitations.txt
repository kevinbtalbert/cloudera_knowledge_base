Limitations in browsing Ozone from Hue
While Hue fully supports browsing the Ozone filesystem, there are some known
  limitations. Review these limitations and learn about the workarounds.
File-size limit for uploads
The maximum supported file size that you can upload using the Hue File Browser to the Ozone
    filesystem is 2 GB. The default file size is 64MB. You can change the permissible upload limit
    by setting the value of the upload_chunk_size parameter as follows in the Hue
    Advanced Configuration Snippet (Hue safety
    valve):[hadoop]
upload_chunk_size=2000000000

File-size limitations for copy operations
There is a limit on the size of files you can copy from the source path to the destination
    using the Hue File Browser present on the Ozone filesystem. Hue automatically skips copying the
    files larger than the chunk size value (default is 64MB) and copies rest of the files
    recursively. You can change the upload chunk size by setting the value of the
     upload_chunk_size parameter in bytes as follows in the Hue Advanced
    Configuration Snippet (Hue safety valve):[hadoop]
upload_chunk_size=[***SIZE-IN-BYTES***]
The following sample configuration sets the upload chunk size to 120
    MB:[hadoop]
upload_chunk_size=125829120 \\or 120*1024*1024

User home directory
All users default to the ofs:// path when they access the Ozone
    filesystem from Hue.

Volume and bucket limitations
You can only create default volume and buckets in Ozone using Hue. Operations other than
    create are not supported.
You cannot create Erasure Coding (EC)-enabled buckets from Hue, unless they are set by default
    in Ozone. However, you can create the EC-enabled buckets using the Ozone CLI and then browse it
    normally from Hue. If EC-enabled buckets are already present on Ozone, then you can browse them
    from Hue.
Hue can also display the content of the encrypted buckets present on Ozone.
