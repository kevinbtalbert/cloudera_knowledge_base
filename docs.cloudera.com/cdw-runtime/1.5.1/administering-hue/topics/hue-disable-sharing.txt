Disabling the share option in Hue
Hue allows you to share documents, queries, and workflows with other users, either
        for viewing only or viewing and modifying in any Hue instances across all
            Virtual Warehouses within a Database Catalog. Sharing is enabled by default in the
        Hue UI. For added privacy and control, you can disable sharing by setting the
            enable_sharing property to false in the hue-safety-valve. 
The sharing option is always available to the admin users. To
            disable the share option:

Log in to the Data Warehouse service as an administrator.

Go to the Virtual Warehouses > Edit > CONFIGURATIONS > Hue and select hue-safety-valve from the
                        Configuration files drop-down list.

Add the following lines in the hue-safety-valve:

[desktop]
enable_sharing=false


Click APPLY.

Restart the Virtual Warehouse.
