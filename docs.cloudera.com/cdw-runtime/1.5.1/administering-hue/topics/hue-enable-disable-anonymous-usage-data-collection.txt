Enabling or disabling anonymous usage date collection
Hue tracks anonymized pages and application versions to gather
    information about application usage levels. The data collected does
    not include hostnames or IDs. For example, the data collected has the format
    /2.3.0/pig or /2.5.0/beeswax/execute.

To enable or disable anonymous usage data collection:


In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, select Clusters > Hue > Configuration to navigate to the configuration page for Hue.

In the Search text box, type usage to locate the
            Enable Usage Data Collection check box:


To enable anonymous data collection, check the box, which is the default
                  setting.
To disable anonymous data collection, clear the check box.



Enter a Reason for change..., and then click Save
            Changes at the bottom of the page to save the configuration change.

Refresh the browser page and click the restart icon  at the top of the page so the new
              configuration changes can be read by the server and the new data collection setting takes
              effect.
