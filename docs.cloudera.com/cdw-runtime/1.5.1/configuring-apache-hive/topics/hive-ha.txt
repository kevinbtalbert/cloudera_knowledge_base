Configuring HiveServer high availability using ZooKeeper
You need to know how to configure your Hive-on-Tez to use ZooKeeper for HiveServer
      high availability.
When you add one or more additional HiveServer (HS2) role instances to the Hive-on-Tez
         service, the multiple role instances can register themselves with ZooKeeper. The JDBC
         client (client driver) can find a HiveServer through ZooKeeper. Using Beeline, you connect
         to Hive, and the ZooKeeper discovery mechnism locates and connects to one of the running
         HiveServer instances. 
If more than one HiveServer instance is registered with ZooKeeper, and all instances fail
         except one, ZooKeeper passes the link to the instance that is running and the client can
         connect successfully. Failed instances must be restarted manually.
Automatic failover does not occur. If an HS2 instance failed while a client is connected,
         the session is lost. Since this situation needs to be handed at the client, there is no
         automatic failover; the client needs to reconnect using ZooKeeper.
Using binary transport mode in HiveServer (HS2), Knox, and Dynamic Discovery, possibly
         supported on your platform before upgrading to CDP, are not supported on CDP. Use alternate
         solutions, such as HAProxy.
