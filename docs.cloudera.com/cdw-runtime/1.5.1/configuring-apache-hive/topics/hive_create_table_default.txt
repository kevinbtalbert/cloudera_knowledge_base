Configuring legacy CREATE TABLE behavior
After you upgrade to CDP Private Cloud Base and migrate old
        tables, the legacy CREATE TABLE behavior of Hive is no longer available by default and you
        might want to switch to the legacy behavior. Legacy behavior might solve compatibility
        problems with your scripts during data migration, for example, when running ETL.
In CDP, running a CREATE TABLE statement by default
            creates a full ACID table for ORC file format and insert-only ACID table for other file
            formats. You can change the default behavior to use the legacy CREATE TABLE behavior.
            When you configure legacy behavior, CREATE TABLE creates external tables with the purge
            functionality enabled (external.table.purge = 'true'). Therefore, when
            the table is dropped, data is also deleted from the file system.You can configure
                legacy CREATE TABLE behavior at the site level by configuring properties in Cloudera
                Manager. When configured at the site level, the behavior persists from session to
                session.

In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters and select the
                        Hive on Tez service.

From the Hive on Tez service, go to the
                        Configuration tab and search for
                        hive.create.






If the following properties are selected, clear the selection to enable legacy
                    CREATE TABLE behavior.


Default Table Format - Create Tables as ACID Insert Only
                                (hive.create.as.insert.only)
Default Table Format - Create Tables as Full ACID
                                (hive.create.as.acid)



Legacy behavior is enabled and the CREATE TABLE statement
            now creates external tables with the external.table.purge table
            property set to true.
