Configuring the Hive Delegation Token Store
You need to enable Hive Delegation Token Store implementation as the first step in
        configuring HiveServer high availability using a load balancer. You also need to understand
        the interaction between Oozie and HS2 with regard to the delegation token.
Oozie needs this implementation for secure HiveServer high availability (HA).
            Otherwise, the Oozie server can get a delegation token from one HS2 server, but the
            actual query might run against another HS2 server, which does not recognize the HS2
            delegation token.

In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > Hive  > Configuration.

Take one of the following actions:

If you have a cluster secured by Kerberos, search for Hive Delegation Token
                Store, which specifies storage for the Kerberos token as described below. 
If you have an unsecured cluster, skip the next step.


Select org.apache.hadoop.hive.thrift.DBTokenStore, and save the
            change.





Storage for the Kerberos delegation token is defined by the
                        hive.cluster.delegation.token.store.class property. The available
                    choices are Zookeeper, the Metastore, and memory. Cloudera recommends using the
                    database by setting the
                        org.apache.hadoop.hive.thrift.DBTokenStore property. Do not
                    use the MemoryTokenStore. This can cause failures because one HS2 does not
                    recognize the delegation token issued by another.

Add HiveServer (HS2) roles as described in the next topic.
