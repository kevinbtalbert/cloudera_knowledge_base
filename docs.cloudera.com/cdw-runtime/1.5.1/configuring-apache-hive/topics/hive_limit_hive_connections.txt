Limiting concurrent connections
To prevent a rogue application from repeatedly connecting to and monopolizing
        HiveServer, you can limit concurrent connections to HiveServer. 

As administrator, you can limit concurrent connections using the Cloudera Manager
                Safety Valve to add one or more of the following properties to the
                    hive-site.xml configuration file:

hive.server2.limit.connections.per.user
Maximum number of HiveServer concurrent connections per user


hive.server2.limit.connections.per.ipaddress
Maximum number of HiveServer concurrent connections per IP address


hive.server2.limit.connections.per.user.ipaddress
Maximum number of HiveServer concurrent connections per user and IP address
                        combination

The default of each parameter is 0. You can change the value of each parameter to any
                number. You must configure concurrent connections on the server side; therefore, a
                    hive --hiveconf command does not work.
In this task, limit the number of connections per user to 25.



The following components are running: 
HiveServer
Hive Metastore 
Hive client

Minimum Required Role: Configurator (also provided by Cluster Administrator, Full Administrator)


In Cloudera Manager > Clusters select the Hive service. Click
                        Configuration, and search for
                    hive-site.xml.


In HiveServer2 Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hive-site.xml, click + and 
                    add the hive.server2.limit.connections.per.user property.

Enter a value representing the maximum number of concurrent connections: for
                    example 25.


Click Save.

Click Actions > Deploy Client Configuration.

Restart HIVE.
