Adding a HiveServer role
You can add a HiveServer (HS2) role to the Hive-on-Tez service, not to the Hive
        service.
 You configured the Hive Delegation Token Store.

In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > Hive on Tez.
Do not click Clusters > Hive by mistake. Only the Hive on Tez service supports the
                        HiveServer2 role.

Click Actions > Add Role Instances.




Click in the HiveServer2 box to select hosts.


In the Host name column, select a host for the HiveServer2 role, and click
                        OK.
The selected host name you assigned the HiveServer2 role appears
                        under HiveServer2. 

Click Continue.
The new HiveServer2 role state is stopped.

Select the new HiveServer2 role.


In Actions for Selected, select Start, and then click Start to
                        confirm.
You see that the service successfully started.
