Configuring metastore location and HTTP mode
In addition to the database properties you need to set in CDP Private Cloud Base, you must configure the metastore URI property.
        This property defines one or more metastore locations. 
        
    


The following components are running: 
HiveServer
Hive Metastore 
A database for the metastore, such as the default MySQL Server
Hive clients

Minimum Required Role: Configurator (also provided by Cluster Administrator,
                    Full Administrator)



In Clusters > Hive Metastore > Configuration, search for
hive-site.xml.


In the Hive Metastore Server Advanced Configuration Safety Valve, which you use
                    to change properties in hive-site.xml, click + and add the
                        hive.metastore.uris property using the following syntax:
                        thrift://<n.n.n.n>:9083

Substitute for <n.n.n.n> an IP address or fully qualified
                    domain name (FQDN) of the metastore host.


Only the Hive Metastore Server Default Group in hive-site.xml should
                    define this property.
