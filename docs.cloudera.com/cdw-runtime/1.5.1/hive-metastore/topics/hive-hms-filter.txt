Filter HMS results
After you write an API to filter data from Hive, you need to know how to set up the
        API, enable it, and disable it. You need to add few Hive metastore (HMS) properties
            hive-site.xml using the Cloudera Manager Safety Valve.

HMS can perform server-side filtering of data returned by a read operation. Filtering
                is enabled by default, which shows the results of statements, such as SHOW TABLES or
                SHOW DATABASES, based on who the user is. You can disable filtering by setting a
                boolean flag and hook. The hook identifies the class name that implements the
                filtering. You add the following properties and values in
                    hive-site.xml for HMS API-Ranger integration: 
metastore.server.filter.enabled
Value: true (to do filtering) or false (no filtering)

metastore.filter.hook
Value:
                            org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.plugin.metastore.HiveMetaStoreAuthorizer

Add properties as described in the previous section.
