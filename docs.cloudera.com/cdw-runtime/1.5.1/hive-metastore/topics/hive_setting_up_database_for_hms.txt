Setting up the backend Hive metastore database
In
   CDP Private Cloud Base you need to install, start, and configure a backend
  database for Hive metastore.
 In this procedure, you install a database on a different node/cluster from the
   HiveServer for sharing the Hive metastore (HMS) with Hive, Impala, Spark, and other components.
   Do not put HiveServer and the database on the same node. You can have one or more HMS instances
   in your cluster that can take over in the event of a problem.

Install a supported database.

MariaDB/MySQL
PostgreSQL
Oracle
