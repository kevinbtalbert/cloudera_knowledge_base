Apache Tez and Hive LLAP
Cloudera Data Warehouse supports low-latency analytical processing (LLAP) of Hive
  queries. 
Hive uses Apache Tez to execute queries internally. Apache Tez provides the following
    execution modes:
Container mode Every time you run a Hive query, Tez requests a container from
     YARN.
LLAP mode Every time you run a Hive query, Tez asks the LLAP daemon for a free thread,
      and starts running a fragment.

Apache Tez provides the framework to run a job that creates a graph with vertexes and
    tasks. SQL semantics for deciding the query physical plan, which identifies how to execute the
    query in a distributed fashion, is based on Apache Tez. The entire execution plan is created
    under this framework. SQL syntax in Hive is the same irrespective of execution engine (mode)
    used in Hive.
  
Apache Tez does not have to start from the ground up, requesting a container and waiting for a
   JVM, to run a fragment in LLAP mode. LLAP mode provides dedicated capacity. Caching is automated.
   The primary difference between LLAP mode and container mode, is that in LLAP mode the LLAP
   executors are used to run query fragments.
In Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), the Hive execution mode is LLAP. In Cloudera Data Hub on CDP
   Public Cloud and CDP Private Cloud Base, the Hive execution mode is container, and LLAP mode is
   not supported. When Apache Tez runs Hive in container mode, it has traditionally been called Hive
   on Tez.
