About Hue Query Processor
The Hue Query Processor service indexes Hive and Impala query history and provides APIs
  to access them. Enabling the processor allows you to view Hive query history and query details on
  the Queries tab on the Hue Job Browser page.
The Hue Query Processor reads query event data from a Hadoop Compatible File
   System (HCFS), such as S3, and writes them into a relational database, such as PostgreSQL. The
   Query Processor pod is started when you create a Database Catalog AND IT runs at the Database
   Catalog level. Therefore, you can view query history from all Virtual Warehoues linked to a
   Database Catalog based on the dialect or the Virtual Warehouse type (Hive or Impala).
