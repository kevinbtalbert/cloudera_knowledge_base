Create table … like feature
You learn by example how to create an empty table based on another table.
From Hive or Impala, you can create an Iceberg table schema based on another table. The table
   contains no data. The table properties of the original table are carried over to the new table
   definition. The following examples show how to use this feature:
Hive example
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE target LIKE source STORED BY ICEBERG;

Impala example
CREATE TABLE target LIKE source STORED BY ICEBERG;
