Creating an Iceberg table
A step-by-step procedure describes how to create an Apache Iceberg table from a Hive
        or Impala Virtual Warehouse. You see how to access and use the recommended query editor Hue
        to create an Iceberg table. 
In this task, you create an Iceberg table in Cloudera Data Warehouse. In a Virtual
            Warehouse, you open Hue, and use Hive or Impala to create a table. 


You must meet the prerequisites to query Iceberg tables from a Virtual Warehouse
                    mentioned earlier, including obtaining Ranger access permissions.



Create a new Virtual Warehouse, or select an existing one.

In Cloudera Data Warehouse Overview, select a Virtual
                        Warehouse, and click Hue.






Select a database.

Enter a query to create a simple Iceberg table in the default Parquet
                    format.
Hive example:
                    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ice_t1 (i int, s string, ts timestamp, d date)
STORED BY ICEBERG;Impala
                    example:CREATE TABLE ice_t2 (i int, s string, ts timestamp, d date)
STORED BY ICEBERG;
In CDP, CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE, and just CREATE TABLE, are valid from Hive. You
                    use the EXTERNAL keyword from Hive to create the Iceberg table to purge the data
                    when you drop the table. In CDP, from Impala, you must use CREATE TABLE to
                    initialize the Iceberg table.

Click  to run the query.
