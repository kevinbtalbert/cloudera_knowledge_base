Running time travel queries
You query historical snapshots of data using the FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '<timestamp>' FOR SYSTEM_VERSION AS OF <snapshot_id> clauses  in a select  statement. You see how to use AS OF to specify a snapshot of your Iceberg data at a certain time.

You can inspect the history of an Iceberg table to see the snapshots. You can query
                the metadata of the Iceberg table using a SELECT ... AS OF statement to run time
                travel queries. You use history information from a query of the database to identify
                and validate snapshots, and then query a specific snapshot AS OF a certain Timestamp
                value.



You must be aware of the table history. However, this can include commits that have been rolled back.
You must have access to valid snapshots. 
You must meet the prerequisites to query Iceberg tables mentioned earlier.



View the table history.

SELECT * FROM db.table.history;


Check the valid snapshots of the table.
SELECT * FROM db.table.snapshots;

Query a specific snapshot by providing the timestamp and snapshot_id.
SELECT * FROM T 
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF <TIMESTAMP>;

SELECT * FROM t 
FOR SYSTEM_VERSION AS OF <SNAPSHOT_ID>;
