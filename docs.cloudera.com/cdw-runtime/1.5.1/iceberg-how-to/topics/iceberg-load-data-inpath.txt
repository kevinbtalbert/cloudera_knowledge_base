Load data inpath feature
From Impala, you can load Parquet or ORC data from a file in a directory on your file
  system or object store into an Iceberg table. You might need to set the mem_limit or pool
  configuration (max-query-mem-limit, min-query-mem-limit) to accommodate the load. 
Impala syntax
LOAD DATA INPATH ‘<path to file>’ INTO table t;

Impala example
In this example, you create a table using the LIKE clause to point to a table stored as
    Parquet. This is required for Iceberg to infer the schema. You also load data stored as ORC.
CREATE TABLE test_iceberg LIKE my_parquet_table STORED AS ICEBERG;
SET MEM_LIMIT=1MB;

LOAD DATA INPATH '/tmp/some_db/parquet_files/'
INTO TABLE iceberg_tbl;

LOAD DATA INPATH '/tmp/some_db/orc_files/'
INTO TABLE iceberg2_tbl; 
CREATE TABLE test_iceberg LIKE my_parquet_table STORED AS ICEBERG;
SET MEM_LIMIT=1MB;

LOAD DATA INPATH '/tmp/some_db/parquet_files/' INTO TABLE iceberg_tbl;
    
LOAD DATA INPATH '/tmp/some_db/orc_files/' INTO TABLE iceberg2_tbl;
