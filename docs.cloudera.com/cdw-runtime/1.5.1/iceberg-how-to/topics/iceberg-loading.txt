Inserting data into a table
 You can append data to an Iceberg table by inserting values or by selecting the data
        from another table. You can update data, replacing the old data.
You use the INSERT command in one of the following ways to populate an Iceberg table
                from Hive:

INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, ‘asf’, true);
INSERT INTO t SELECT * FROM s;
INSERT OVERWRITE t SELECT * FROM s;

Examples
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, ‘asf’, true);
INSERT INTO t SELECT * FROM s;
INSERT OVERWRITE t SELECT * FROM s;
