Truncate table feature
Truncating an Iceberg table removes all rows from the table. A new snapshot is created.
  Truncation works for partitioned and unpartitioned tables.
Although the table data and the table and column stats are cleared, the old snapshots and their data files continue to exist to support time travel in the future.
