Iceberg overview
Apache Iceberg is a table format for huge analytics datasets on the storage systems such
  as HDFS. You can efficiently query large Iceberg tables on object stores. Iceberg supports
  concurrent reads and writes on all storage media.
noteCloudera supports Iceberg V1 and V2 on Red Hat OpenShift and Embedded
   Container Service (ECS) platforms in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) on HDFS and Ozone. This
   feature is in technical preview and is not recommended for production deployment. Cloudera
   recommends that you try this feature in test or development environments.Iceberg tables cannot
    be accessed from Hive, Impala, Spark, and Flink on the base cluster. You need to be on CDW.
    Therefore, only selected tables should be migrated to Iceberg according to the available compute
    resources in the private cloud environment.
You create Iceberg tables and run queries from Hive or Impala in CDP. The Hive metastore stores
   Iceberg metadata, including the location of the table.
Hive metastore plays a lightweight role in the Catalog operations. Iceberg relieves Hive
   metastore (HMS) pressure by storing partition information in metadata files on the file
   system/object store instead of within the HMS. This architecture supports rapid scaling without
   performance hits.
By default, Hive and Impala use the Iceberg HiveCatalog. Cloudera recommends the default
   HiveCatalog to create an Iceberg table.
   
You can use Iceberg when a single table contains tens of petabytes of data, and you can read
   these tables without compromising performance. From Apache Hive and Apache Impala, you can query
   Iceberg tables. The following features are included:
Listing table snapshot and history
Expiring snapshots from Hive and Impala
Migrating external tables to iceberg in Hive
Iceberg table rollback from Hive
Creating an Iceberg table from Hive with a metadata location
Expiring and removing old snapshots
Performance and scalability enhancements

Apache Iceberg integrates Apache Ranger for security. You can use Ranger integration with Hive
   and Impala to apply fine-grained access control to sensitive data in Iceberg tables. Iceberg is
   also integrated with Data Visualization for creating dashboards and other graphics of your
   Iceberg data.
