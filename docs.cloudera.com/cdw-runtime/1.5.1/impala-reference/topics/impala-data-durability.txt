Data Durability Considerations
When you store the data in Ozone, this release provides an Erasure Coding (EC) feature.
  EC can be considered as an alternative to replication.
Erasure Coding OverviewThe Ozone EC feature provides data durability and fault-tolerance along with reduced storage space   and ensures data durability similar to the Ratis THREE replication approach.Verify the Related Query OptionImpala already supports the basic functionalities of erasure-coding. Before this         release, EC was turned off by default because Impala lacked metrics, observability and DDL         commands related to erasure coding.Enable EC ReplicationYou can enable EC replication configuration cluster wide or at the bucket level or at   file levels. The details of which can be found here.Verify the EC PoliciesYou can verify the EC policies you set up on the File / Table / Partition level using   the Impala commands.Understanding Query PerformanceQuerying an erasure coded data might have an impact on the performance. If you notice   performance degradation, you can troubleshoot it by running the PROFILE command. The    PROFILE statement gives you an outline of the logical steps that a query will perform. It will include   erasure coding related information in the profile.
