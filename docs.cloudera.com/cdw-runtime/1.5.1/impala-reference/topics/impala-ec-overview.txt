Erasure Coding Overview
The Ozone EC feature provides data durability and fault-tolerance along with reduced storage space
  and ensures data durability similar to the Ratis THREE replication approach.
Supported Engines
EC supports the following data processing engines: Impala, Hive and so on.
Before you begin
When you use EC as the data durability scheme, recovery happens in the background and requires
   no direct input from a user. But you must be aware of the following highlights to use EC.

Note the limitations for EC.
Verify that the clusters run CDP 7.1.8 or higher.
Determine which EC policy you want to use: See Understanding Erasure Coding Policies for more information.
Determine if you want to use EC for existing data or new data. If you want to use EC for
    existing data, you need to replicate that data with distcp.
Verify that your cluster setup meets the rack and node requirements described in Best Practices for Rack and Node Setup for
    EC.

Limitations



Certain operations are not supported on erasure coded files due to substantial
      technical challenges.


Querying an erasure coded data might have an impact on the performance. If you
      notice performance degradation you can troubleshoot it by running the Query profile command.
      It will include erasure coding related information in the profile. This will help you to
      quickly identify the cause.
