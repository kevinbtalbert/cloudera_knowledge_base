Impala already supports the basic functionalities of erasure-coding. Before this
        release, EC was turned off by default because Impala lacked metrics, observability and DDL
        commands related to erasure coding.

For this release, the query option ALLOW_ERASURE_CODED_FILES
                    is enabled by default. 

You may use the ALLOW_ERASURE_CODED_FILES query option to
                    disable the support of erasure coded files in Impala. When the
                        ALLOW_ERASURE_CODED_FILES query option is set to FALSE,
                    Impala returns an error when a query requires scanning an erasure coded file.
