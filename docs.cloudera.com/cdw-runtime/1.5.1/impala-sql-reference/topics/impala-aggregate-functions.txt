Aggregate
    functions are a special category with different rules. These functions calculate a return value
    across all the items in a result set, so they require a FROM clause in the
    query.select count(product_id) from product_catalog;
select max(height), avg(height) from census_data where age > 20;

        Aggregate functions also ignore NULL values rather than returning a NULL
        result. For example, if some rows have NULL for a particular column, those rows are
        ignored when computing the AVG() for that column. Likewise, specifying
        COUNT(col_name) in a query counts only those rows where
        col_name contains a non-NULL value.
