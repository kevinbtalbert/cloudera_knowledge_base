Customizing time zones
Impala 3.1 onward, you can customize the time zone definitions used in
    Impala.


 By default, Impala uses the OS’s time zone database located in
                /usr/share/zoneinfo. This directory contains the IANA timezone
              database in a compiled binary format. The contents of the zoneinfo
              directory is controlled by the OS’s package manager. 


 Use the following start-up flags managed as impalad safety valves
              in Cloudera Manager. 


‑‑hdfs_zone_info_zip: This flag allows Impala
                administrators to specify a custom timezone database. The flag should be set to a
                shared (not necessarily HDFS) path that points to a zip archive of a custom IANA
                timezone database. The timezone database is expected to be in a compiled binary
                format. If the startup flag is set, Impala will use the specified timezone database
                instead of the default /usr/share/zoneinfo database. The timezone
                db upgrade process is described in detail below. 


‑‑hdfs_zone_alias_conf: This flag allows Impala
                  administrators to specify definitions for custom timezone aliases. The flag should
                  be set to a shared (not necessarily HDFS) path that specifies a config file
                  containing custom timezone alias definitions. This config file can be used as a
                  workaround for users who want to keep using their legacy timezone names.
                  Configuring custom aliases is described in detail below. 





Upgrading custom IANA time zone database:


          Download latest IANA time zone database distribution:
git clone https://github.com/eggert/tz

            Alternatively, download a specific tzdb version from:
 https://www.iana.org/time-zones/repository



          Build timezone tools:
cd tz
make TOPDIR=tzdata install


          Generate the compiled binary time zone database:
./zic -d ./tzdata/etc/zoneinfo africa antarctica asia australasia backward backzone etcetera europe factory northamerica pacificnew southamerica systemv


          Create zip archive:
pushd ./tzdata/etc
zip -r zoneinfo.zip zoneinfo
popd


          Copy the time zone database to HDFS:
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /tzdb/latest
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal ./tzdata/etc/zoneinfo.zip /tzdb/latest


          Set the ‑‑hdfs_zone_info_zip startup flag to
          /tzdb/latest/zoneinfo.zip as an impalad safety
          valve.
        

          Perform a full restart of Impala service.
        


Configuring custom time zone aliases:



          Create a tzalias.conf config file that contains time zone alias
          definitions formatted as ALIAS =
          DEFINITION. For example:
#
# Define aliases for existing timezone names:
#
Universal Coordinated Time = UTC
Mideast/Riyadh89 = Asia/Riyadh
PDT = America/Los_Angeles
#
# Define aliases as UTC offsets in seconds:
#
GMT-01:00 = 3600
GMT+01:00 = -3600


          Copy the config file to HDFS:
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /tzdb
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal tzalias.conf /tzdb


          Set the ‑‑hdfs_zone_alias_conf startup flag to
          /tzdb/tzalias.conf as an impalad safety valve.
        

          Perform a full restart of Impala service.
