DROP ROLE statementCloudera Docs
DROP ROLE statement
 The DROP ROLE statement removes a role from the metastore database.
    Once dropped, the role is revoked for all groups it was previously assigned. Queries that are
    already executing are not affected. Impala verifies the role information approximately every 60
    seconds, so the effects of DROP ROLE might not take effect for new Impala
    queries for a brief period.
Syntax:
DROP ROLE role_name

noteBefore dropping a role in Ranger, you must remove all the privileges granted to the role in advance.

Required privileges:
 Only administrative users can use this statement. 
Compatibility:

      Impala makes use of any roles and privileges specified by the GRANT and
      REVOKE statements in Hive, and Hive makes use of any roles and privileges specified by the
      GRANT and REVOKE statements in Impala. The Impala GRANT
      and REVOKE statements for privileges do not require the ROLE keyword to be
      repeated before each role name, unlike the equivalent Hive statements.
    
Cancellation: Cannot be cancelled.
      
HDFS permissions: This statement does not touch any HDFS files or directories,
        therefore no HDFS permissions are required.
