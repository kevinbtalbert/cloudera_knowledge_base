REFRESH FUNCTIONS statement
In Impala 2.9 and higher, you can run the REFRESH FUNCTIONS statement
    to refresh the user-defined functions (UDFs) created outside of Impala. For example, you can add
    Java-based UDFs to the metastore database through the Hive CREATE FUNCTION
    statements and make those UDFs visible to Impala at the database level by subsequently running
      REFRESH FUNCTIONS. The REFRESH FUNCTIONS statement is only required if you create or modify UDFs
        from outside of Impala. Updated metadata, as a result of running REFRESH
          FUNCTIONS, is broadcast to all Impala coordinators. 
      Once issued, the REFRESH FUNCTIONS statement cannot be cancelled.
