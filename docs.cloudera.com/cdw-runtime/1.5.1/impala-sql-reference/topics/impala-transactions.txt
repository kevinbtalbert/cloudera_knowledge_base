SQL transactions in Impala
A transaction is a single logical operation on the data. Impala
    supports transactions that satisfy a level of consistency that improves the
    integrity and reliability of the data before and after a
    transaction.

 Specifically, Impala provides atomicity and isolation of insert
        operations on transactional tables. A single table insert is either
        committed in full or not committed, and the results of the insert
        operation are not visible to other query operations until the operation
        is committed. 
 For single table, the inserts are ordered, so if Impala doesn't see a
        committed insert, it won't see any insert committed after it. 
 For insert-only transactional tables, you can perform the following
        statements: CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE,
          TRUNCATE, INSERT,
          SELECT

 All transactions in Impala automatically commit at the end of the
        statement. Currently, Impala does not support multi-statement
        transactions. 
 Insert-only tables must be the managed and file-format based tables,
        such as Parquet, Avro, and text. 
note

Impala does not support changing transactional properties of tables. For example, you
            cannot alter a transactional table to a non-transactional table. 
Currently, ALTER TABLE statement is not supported on both insert-only and full acid
            transactional tables.
