Configuring Client Access to Impala
Application developers have a number of options to interface with
    Impala.

      The core development language with Impala is SQL. You can also use Java or other languages
      to interact with Impala through the standard JDBC and ODBC interfaces used by many
      business intelligence tools. For specialized kinds of analysis, you can supplement the
      Impala built-in functions by writing user-defined functions in C++ or Java.
    

      You can connect and submit requests to the Impala through:
    


        The impala-shell interactive command interpreter
      

        The Hue web-based user interface
      

        JDBC
      

        ODBC

 Impala clients can connect to any Coordinator Impala Daemon
        (impalad) via HiveServer2 over HTTP or over the TCP binary. You can control
      client connections to Impala using the Impala coordinator role available under the
      Configurations tab for a selected Virtual Warehouse.
