Impala Shell Tool
You can use the Impala shell tool (impala-shell)
    to set up databases and tables, insert data, and issue queries. 

      For ad-hoc queries and exploration, you can submit SQL statements in an interactive
      session. To automate your work, you can specify command-line options to process a single
      statement or a script file. The impala-shell accepts all the same SQL
      statements, plus some shell-only commands that you can use for tuning performance and
      diagnosing problems.
    
 You can install the Impala shell on a local computer and use it as a client to
      connect with an Impala Virtual Warehouse instance. For more information on installing Impala
      shell, see the link provided under Related Information.
