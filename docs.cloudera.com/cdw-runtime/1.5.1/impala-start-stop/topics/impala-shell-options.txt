Impala Shell Configuration Options
 You can specify the following options when starting impala-shell to
    control how shell commands are executed. You can specify options on the command line or in the
      impala-shell configuration file.


 Command-Line Option 
 Configuration File Setting 
 Explanation 




 -B or 
--delimited 


 write_delimited=true 


 Causes all query results to be printed in plain format as a delimited text file.
                Useful for producing data files to be used with other Hadoop components. Also useful
                for avoiding the performance overhead of pretty-printing all output, especially when
                running benchmark tests using queries returning large result sets. Specify the
                delimiter character with the --output_delimiter option. Store all
                query results in a file rather than printing to the screen with the
                  -B option.




 -E or 
--vertical 


 vertical=true 


 Causes all query results to print in vertical format. In this mode, impala-shell
                will print each row in the following style.

The first line will contain the line number followed by the row's columns in
                  separate lines. Each column line will have a prefix with its name and a
                  colon.

To enable this mode, use the shell option '-E' or '--vertical', or 'set VERTICAL=
                true' in the interactive mode. To disable it in interactive mode, 'set
                VERTICAL=false'. NOTE: This vertical option will be disabled if the '-B' option or
                'set WRITE_DELIMITED=true' is specified.



--connect_max_tries
--connect_max_tries=4
Sets the maximum number of attempts to connect to a coordinator. Currently, the
              maximum number of attempts to connect to a coordinator is hard coded to 4 in hs2-HTTP
              mode. From this release, you can configure the maximum number of attempts impala-shell
              can make using this option --connect_max_tries. The default value of this option is 4.
              After the number of attempts specified through this option, impala-shell returns with
              error "Not connected to Impala"


--hs2_fp_format
hs2_fp_format=<a Python-based format specification expression which will
                get parsed and applied to floating-pointcolumn values>

Sets the printing format specification for floating point values when using HS2
                protocol. The default behaviour makes the values handled by Python's str() built-in
                method. Use '16G' to match Beeswax protocol's floating-point output format.



--live_progress
live_progress=true
Prints a progress bar showing roughly the percentage complete for each
              query. Information is updated interactively as the query progresses.


--disable_live_progress
live_progress=false
Disables live_progress in the interactive mode.



 --print_header 


 print_header=true 







 -o filename or 
--output_file filename



 output_file=filename



 Stores all query results in the specified file. Typically used to store the
                results of a single query issued from the command line with the -q
                option. Also works for interactive sessions; you see the messages such as number of
                rows fetched, but not the actual result set. To suppress these incidental messages
                when combining the -q and -o options, redirect
                  stderr to /dev/null.




 --output_delimiter=
character



 output_delimiter=character



 Specifies the character to use as a delimiter between fields when query results
                are printed in plain format by the -B option. Defaults to tab
                  ('\t'). If an output value contains the delimiter character, that
                field is quoted, escaped by doubling quotation marks, or both.




 -p or 
--show_profiles 


 show_profiles=true 


 Displays the query execution plan (same output as the EXPLAIN
                statement) and a more detailed low-level breakdown of execution steps, for every
                query executed by the shell. 



--profile_format=text | json | prettyjson
N/A
json and prettyjson output the JSON
              representation of each profile in a dense single-line form and in a human-readable
              multi-line form respectively.



 -h or 
--help 


 N/A 


 Displays help information. 




 N/A 


 history_max=1000 


 Sets the maximum number of queries to store in the history file. 




 -i hostname or 
--impalad=hostname[:portnum] 


 impalad=hostname[:portnum] 


 Connects to the impalad daemon on the specified host. The default
                port of 21050 is assumed unless you provide another value. You can connect to any
                host in your cluster that is running impalad. If you connect to an
                instance of impalad that was started with an alternate port
                specified by the --fe_port flag, provide that alternative port.
              




 -q query or 
--query=query



 query=query



 Passes a query or other impala-shell command from the command
                line. The impala-shell interpreter immediately exits after
                processing the statement. It is limited to a single statement, which could be a
                  SELECT, CREATE TABLE, SHOW
                  TABLES, or any other statement recognized in
                  impala-shell. Because you cannot pass a USE
                statement and another query, fully qualify the names for any tables outside the
                  default database. (Or use the -f option to pass
                a file with a USE statement followed by other queries.) 




 -f query_file or 
--query_file=query_file



 query_file=path_to_query_file



 Passes a SQL query from a file. Multiple statements must be semicolon (;)
                delimited. 




 --query_option=
"option=value
-Q 
"option=value" 


 Header line [impala.query_options], followed on subsequent lines
                by option=value, one option per line. 


 Sets default query options for an invocation of the
                  impala-shell command. To set multiple query options at once,
                use more than one instance of this command-line option. The query option names are
                not case-sensitive. 




 -V or --verbose 


 verbose=true 


 Enables verbose output. 




 --quiet 


 verbose=false 


 Disables verbose output. 




 -v or --version 


 version=true 


 Displays version information. 




 -c 


 ignore_query_failure=true 


 Continues on query failure. 




 -d default_db or 
--database=default_db



 default_db=default_db



 Specifies the database to be used on startup. Same as running the
                  USE statement after connecting. If not specified, a database
                named DEFAULT is used. 



 --ssl 
 ssl=true 
 Enables TLS/SSL for impala-shell. 



--http_socket_timeout_s


http_socket_timeout_s=HTTP_SOCKET_TIMEOUT_S
 Sets the timeout in seconds after which the socket will time out if the
              associated operation cannot be completed. Set to None to disable any timeout. This
              configurable option is only supported for hs2-http mode and the
                DEFAULT is NONE. 


path_to_certificate
 ca_cert=path_to_certificate

 The local pathname pointing to the third-party CA certificate, or to a copy of
              the server certificate for self-signed server certificates. If
                --ca_cert is not set, impala-shell enables
              TLS/SSL, but does not validate the server certificate. This is useful for connecting
              to a known-good Impala that is only running over TLS/SSL, when a copy of the
              certificate is not available (such as when debugging customer installations). 


 -l 
 use_ldap=true 
 Enables LDAP authentication. 


 -u 
 user=user_name

 Supplies the username, when LDAP authentication is enabled by the
                -l option. (Specify the short username, not the full LDAP
              distinguished name.) The shell then prompts interactively for the password. 


 --ldap_password_cmd=command

 N/A 
 Specifies a command to run to retrieve the LDAP password, when LDAP
              authentication is enabled by the -l option. If the command includes
              space-separated arguments, enclose the command and its arguments in quotation marks.
            


 --config_file=path_to_config_file

 N/A 
Specifies the path of the file containing impala-shell
              configuration settings. The default is /etc/impalarc. This
              setting can only be specified on the command line. 


--live_progress
N/A
Prints a progress bar showing roughly the percentage complete for each query. The
              information is updated interactively as the query progresses.


--live_summary
N/A
Prints a detailed report, similar to the SUMMARY command,
              showing progress details for each phase of query execution. The information is updated
              interactively as the query progresses. 


--var=variable_name=value
N/A
 Defines a substitution variable that can be used within the
                impala-shell session. The variable can be substituted into
              statements processed by the -q or -f options, or in
              an interactive shell session. Within a SQL statement, you substitute the value by
              using the notation ${var:variable_name}. 


--auth_creds_ok_in_clear
N/A
 Allows LDAP authentication to be used with an insecure connection to the shell.
              WARNING: This will allow authentication credentials to be sent unencrypted, and hence
              may be vulnerable to an attack. 


--protocol=protocol
N/A
Protocol to use for the connection to Impala. Valid
                  protocol values are:
'hs2-http': Impala-shell uses HTTP transport to speak to the
                    Impala Daemon via the HiveServer2 protocol.
