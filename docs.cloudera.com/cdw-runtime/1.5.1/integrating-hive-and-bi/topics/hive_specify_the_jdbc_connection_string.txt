Specify the JDBC connection
      string
You construct a JDBC URL to connect Hive to a BI tool.
In CDP Private Cloud Base, if HiveServer runs within the Hive client (embedded mode), not as
         a separate process, the URL in the connection string does not need a host or port number to
         make the JDBC connection. If HiveServer does not run within your Hive client, the URL must
         include a host and port number because HiveServer runs as a separate process on the host
         and port you specify. The JDBC client and HiveServer interact using remote procedure calls
         using the Thrift protocol. If HiveServer is configured in remote mode, the JDBC client and
         HiveServer can use either HTTP or TCP-based transport to exchange RPC messages. 

Create a minimal JDBC connection string for connecting Hive to a BI tool.

Embedded mode: Create the JDBC connection string for connecting to Hive in
                  embedded mode.
Remote mode: Create a JDBC connection string for making an unauthenticated
                  connection to the Hive default database on the localhost port 10000.

Embedded mode: "jdbc:hive://"
Remote mode: "jdbc:hive://myserver:10000/default", "",
               "");

Modify the connection string to change the transport mode from TCP (the default) to
               HTTP using the transportMode and
                  httpPath session configuration
               variables.

                  jdbc:hive2://myserver:10000/default;transportMode=http;httpPath=myendpoint.com;

You need to specify httpPath when using the HTTP transport mode. 
               <http_endpoint> has a corresponding HTTP endpoint configured in
                  hive-site.xml.

Add parameters to the connection string for Kerberos authentication.

jdbc:hive2://myserver:10000/default;principal=prin.dom.com@APRINCIPAL.DOM.COM
