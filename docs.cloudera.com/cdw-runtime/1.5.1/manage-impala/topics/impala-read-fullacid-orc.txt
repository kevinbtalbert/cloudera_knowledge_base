READ Support for FULL ACID ORC Tables
FULL ACID v2 transactional tables are readable in Impala without modifying any
  configurations. 
  
  
  You must have connection to Hive Metastore server in order
   to READ from FULL ACID tables.

There are two types of transactional tables available with Hive ACID.

INSERT-ONLY
FULL ACID

Until this release, Impala in CDP supported INSERT-ONLY transactional tables allowing both READ
   and WRITE operations. The latest version of Impala in CDP now also supports READ of FULL ACID ORC
   tables.
By default tables created in Impala are INSERT-ONLY managed tables whereas the default tables
   in Hive are managed tables that are FULL-ACID and INSERT-ONLY.
Limitations


Impala cannot CREATE or WRITE to FULL ACID transactional tables yet. You can CREATE and
      WRITE FULL ACID transactional tables with transaction scope at the row level via HIVE and use
      Impala to READ these tables.
Impala does not support ACID v1.




Concepts Used in FULL ACID v2 TablesBefore beginning to use FULL ACID v2 tables you must be aware of these new concepts like   transactions, WriteIds, rowIDs, delta delete directories, locks, etc. that are added to FULL ACID   tables to achieve ACID semantics.Key Differences between INSERT-ONLY and FULL ACID TablesBefore beginning to use FULL ACID v2 tables you must be aware of the key differences   between the INSERT-ONLY and FULL-ACID tables.Compaction of Data in FULL ACID Transactional TableAs administrator, you need to manage compaction of delta files that accumulate during data ingestion. Compaction is a process that performs critical cleanup of files.
