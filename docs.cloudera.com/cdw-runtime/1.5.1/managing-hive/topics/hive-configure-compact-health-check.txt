Configuring compaction health monitoring
As an administrator, you can use Cloudera Manager to enable or disable compaction
        health tests for the Hive Metastore (HMS) and HiveServer (HS2) services, configure how those
        health tests factor into the overall health of the service, and modify thresholds for the
        status of certain health tests.
You can configure HMS and HS2 compaction properties that are exposed in Cloudera
            Manager by searching for the property. Occasionally, you might add a property to
                hive-site.xml or core-site.xml using the
            Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve).

In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > Hive > Configuration to navigate to the configuration page for HMS.

Search for Hive Compaction Health Test, enable the
                    property, and save the changes.

Enable the Hive Compaction Health Test property for the
                    HS2 service by going to Clusters > Hive on Tez > Configuration.

To configure the Health Check thresholds, go to Clusters > Hive > Configuration.

Select the Category > Monitoring filter.

Modify the warning and critical (error) threshold values for the required
                    compaction-related thresholds and save the changes.

The Health Tests panel of HMS and HS2 service displays the
            compaction health test results, typically with specific metrics that the test
                returned.noteFor the HS2 service, if there is no delta
                metric data (metric values are too low to be collected), then the health check
                displays a "Disabled" status.
