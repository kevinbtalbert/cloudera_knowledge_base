Enabling
      vectorization
Query vectorization is disabled by default. As Administrator, you can enable the
      possibility of query vectorization using Cloudera Manager. 
After you issue a query, Hive examines the query and the data to determine whether vectorization can occur. If not, Hive executes the query with vectorization disabled.

In Cloudera Manager > Clusters select the Hive service. Click Configuration,
               and search for hive.vectorized.execution.enabled.


Accept the default (enabled), or check HiveServer2 Default
                  Group to enable the property.

Click Save.

Click Actions > Deploy Client Configuration.

Restart Hive.
