Query vectorizationCloudera Docs
Query vectorization
You can use vectorization to improve instruction pipelines for certain data and
      queries and to optimize how Hive uses the cache. Vectorization  processes batches of primitive
      types on the entire column rather than one row at a time.
Unsupported functionality on vectorized data
            
Some functionality is not supported on vectorized data:

DDL queries
DML queries other than single table, read-only queries
Formats other than Optimized Row Columnar (ORC)


Supported functionality on vectorized data
The following functionality is supported on vectorized data:

Single table, read-only queriesSelecting, filtering, and grouping data is
                  supported. 
Partitioned tables
The following expressions:

                     Comparison: >, >=, <, <=, =, !=
                  

                     Arithmetic plus, minus, multiply, divide, and modulo
                  

                     Logical AND and OR
                  

                     Aggregates
                        sum, avg, count, min, and max
                  



Supported data types
You can query data of the following types using vectorized queries:


               tinyint
            

               smallint

               varchar
            

               binary
            



Enabling vectorizationQuery vectorization is disabled by default. As Administrator, you can enable the       possibility of query vectorization using Cloudera Manager. Query vectorization propertiesYou can manage query vectorization by setting properties in Cloudera Manager. The names     of each property and its description helps set up vectorization.Checking query executionYou can determine if query vectorization occurred during execution by running the       EXPLAIN VECTORIZATION query statement.
