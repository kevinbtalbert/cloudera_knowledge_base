Impala lineage
You can use the Atlas lineage graph to understand the source and impact of data and
    changes to data over time and across all your data.
 Atlas collects metadata from Impala to represent the lineage among data assets. The Atlas
      lineage graph shows the input and output processes that the current entity participated in.
      Entities are included if they were inputs to processes that lead to the current entity or they
      are output from processes for which the current entity was an input. Impala processes follow
      this pattern.
Note that lineage is not updated between a table and views that the table is a part of when an 
      Impala ALTER TABLE operation runs on the table.
