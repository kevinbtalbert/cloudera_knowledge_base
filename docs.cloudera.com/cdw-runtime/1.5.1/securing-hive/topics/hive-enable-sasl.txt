Enabling SASL in HiveServer
You can provide a Quality of Protection (QOP)  that is higher than the
        cluster-wide default using SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer). 

HiveServer2 by default uses hadoop.rpc.protection for its QOP value.
                Setting hadoop.rpc.protection to a higher level than HiveServer
                (HS2) does not usually make sense. HiveServer ignores
                    hadoop.rpc.protection in favor of
                    hive.server2.thrift.sasl.qop. 
You can determine the value of hadoop.rpc.protection: In Cloudera
                Manager, click Clusters > HDFS > Configuration > Hadoop, and search for hadoop.rpc.protection.
If you want to provide a higher QOP than the default, set one of the SASL Quality of
                Protection (QOP) levels as shown in the following table: 

auth
Default. Authentication only. 


auth-int
Authentication with integrity protection. Signed message digests (checksums)
                            verify the integrity of messages sent between client and server.


auth-conf
Authentication with confidentiality (transport-layer encryption) and
                                integrity. Applicable only if HiveServer is configured to use
                                Kerberos authentication.




In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Clusters > Hive > Configuration.

In HiveServer2 Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        hive-site click + to add a property and value.

Specify the QOP auth-conf setting for the SASL QOP
                    property.
For example,
                        Name:hive.server2.thrift.sasl.qopValue: 
                            auth-conf


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hive service. 

Construct a connection string for encrypting communications using SASL.

jdbc:hive2://fqdn.example.com:10000/default;principal=hive/_HOST@EXAMPLE.COM;saslqop=auth-conf

 The _HOST is a wildcard placeholder that gets automatically replaced with the
                    fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the server running the HiveServer daemon
                    process.
