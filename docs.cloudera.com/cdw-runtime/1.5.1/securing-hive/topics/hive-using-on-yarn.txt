Configuring access to Hive on YARNCloudera Docs
Configuring access to Hive on YARN
 By default, access to Hive and YARN by unauthorized users is not allowed. You also
        cannot run unauthorized workloads on YARN. You need to know how to give end users and
        workloads the access rules necessary for querying Hive workloads in YARN queues.
 You must configure the following access to query Hive workloads on YARN:
Allow the end user to access Hive
Allow the Hive workload on YARN
Allow the end user to access YARN
Follow the steps in this topic to configure Hive and YARN for end users to
                access Hive on YARN. 

In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > Hive on Tez > Configuration and search for hive.server2.enable.doAs. 






Set the value of doas to false. Uncheck Hive (Service-Wide) to
                    disable impersonation.
For more information about configuring doas, see "Enabling or
                    disabling impersonation".
Save changes.

Search for the Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                        Valve) for hive-site.xml setting.






In the Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                        for hive-site.xml setting, click .

Add
                    the properties and values to allow the Hive workload on YARN.

Name: hive.server2.tez.initialize.default.sessions Value: false
Name: hive.server2.tez.queue.access.check Value: true
Name: hive.server2.tez.sessions.custom.queue.allowed Value: true

For more information about allowing the Hive workload on YARN, see
                    "Configuring HiveServer for ETL using YARN queues".
Save changes.

In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > YARN > Configuration, and search for ResourceManager Advanced Configuration
                        Snippet (Safety Valve) for yarn-site.xml.






In the ResourceManager Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                        for yarn-site.xml setting, click .

Add the properties and values to allow the end user to access YARN using
                    placement rules.

Name: yarn.resourcemanager.application-tag-based-placement.enable Value: true 
Name: yarn.resourcemanager.application-tag-based-placement.username.whitelist Value: < Comma separated list of users who can use the application tag based placement.>

For more information about allowing end user access to YARN, see "Configure
                    queue mapping to use the user name from the application tag using Cloudera
                    Manager".
Save changes.

Restart the YARN ResourceManager service for the changes to apply.
End users you specified can now query Hive workloads in YARN
                    queues.
