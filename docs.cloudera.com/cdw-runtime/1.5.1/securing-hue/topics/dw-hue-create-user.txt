Creating a Hue user in Cloudera Data Warehouse
You can create new Hue users and superusers from the Hue web UI and assign them to
        groups so that they can view and access Hue as per the permissions granted to
        them.

Log in to Hue as a superuser.

From the left assist panel, point your cursor to the user profile icon and
                    click Administer Users.

On the User Admin page, click Add
                        user.

On the Step 1. Credentials (required) tab on the
                        Create user page, specify the username and password and
                    select the Create home directory option if you want to
                    create a separate Hue home directory for this user.

Go to the Step 2. Profile and Groups tab.

Enter the first and last name of the user, their email address, and add them to
                    the required groups.
A user can be a part of more than one group.

Go to the Step 3. Advanced tab.

Ensure that the user is active by selecting the Active
                    option.
Optional: 
If you want to make this user a superuser, then select the Superuser
                        status option.

Click Add user.
The new user is displayed on the Users
                    page.
