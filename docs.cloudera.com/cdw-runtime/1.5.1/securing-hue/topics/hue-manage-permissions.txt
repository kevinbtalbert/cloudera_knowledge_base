Managing Hue permissions
Permissions for Hue applications are granted to groups, with users gaining
        permissions based on their group membership. Group permissions define the Hue applications
        visible to group members when they log in to Hue and the application features available to
        them. There is a fixed set of Hue permissions. You cannot add or modify permissions.
        However, you can apply permission to group(s).

Sign in to the Hue UI as a superuser.

From the left assist panel, point your cursor to the user profile icon and
                    click Administer Users.
The User Admin page is displayed.

From the User Admin page, go to the
                        Permissions tab.
The Permissions page displays the list of all the
                    available permissions.

Click a permission that you want to assign to a group(s).
The Edit [permission name] page is displayed.

Select the group(s) on which you want to apply the permission and click
                        Update permission.
The “Permission information updated successfully” message is displayed.
