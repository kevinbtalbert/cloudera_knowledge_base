Authenticating Hue users with SAML
Hue supports SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for Single Sign-on
    (SSO) authentication.
The SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO profile has three components: 
User Agent - Browser that represents you, the user, seeking resources.
Service Provider (SP) - Service (Hue) that sends authentication requests to SAML. 
Identity Provider (IdP) - SAML service that authenticates users. 
When a user requests access to an application, the Service Provider (Hue) sends an
      authentication request from the User Agent (browser) to the identity provider. The identity
      provider authenticates the user, sends a response, and redirects the browser back to Hue as
      shown in the following diagram:

The Service Provider (Hue) and the identity provider use a metadata
     file to confirm each other's identity. Hue stores metadata from the SAML
     server, and the identity provider stores metadata from the Hue server.
In Cloudera Data Warehouse, SSO with SAML is automatically configured. You need
      not configure anything manually.
