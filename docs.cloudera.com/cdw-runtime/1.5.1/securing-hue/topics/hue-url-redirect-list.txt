Specifying domains or pages to which Hue can redirect users
You can restrict the domains or pages to which Hue can redirect users.
Use the redirect_whitelist property under the
        [desktop] section in Cloudera Data Warehouse Virtual Warehouses > Edit > CONFIGURATIONS > Hue > Configuration files > hue-safety-valve property:
[desktop]
redirect_whitelist=[***REDIRECT-URL***]
Specify the redirect_whitelist value with a
       comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the redirect URL. For example, to
       restrict redirects to your local domain and fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), use the
       following value:
redirect_whitelist=^\/.*$,^http:\/\/www.mydomain.com\/.*$
