Recommended Hive configurations when using Ozone
It is recommended that you configure certain Hive properties if you are querying Hive
    tables in Ozone.
Configurations
The following configurations can be specified through Beeline during runtime using the SET
        command. For example, SET key=value;. The configuration persists only for
        the particular session or query. If you want to set it permanently, then specify the
        properties in hive-site.xml using the Cloudera Manager Safety
          Valve:Table 1. 

Configuration
Value



hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition
true


hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition.threshold
0


hive.query.results.cache.enabled
false


hive.acid.direct.insert.enabled
true


hive.orc.splits.include.fileid 
false

importantIf you notice that some queries are
            taking a longer time to complete or failing entirely (usually noticed in large clusters),
            you can choose to revert the value of
            hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition.threshold to "-1". The performance
            issue is related to HIVE-26283.
