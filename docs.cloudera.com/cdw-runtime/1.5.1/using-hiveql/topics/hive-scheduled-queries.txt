Enabling scheduled queries
You need to know how to enable and disable scheduled queries and understand how the
    default state can prevent you from running a query unintentionally.

Scheduled queries are created in disabled mode by default in CDP. This default helps
        prevent you from running new scheduled queries inadvertantly. You must explicitly enable new
        scheduled queries. A scheduled query can keep the cluster awake at the wrong time. To enable
        a particular schedule, for example schedule1, you run the ALTER SCHEDULED QUERY
        statement:
ALTER SCHEDULED QUERY schedule1 ENABLE;   
To disable this schedule: ALTER SCHEDULED QUERY schedule1 DISABLE;
