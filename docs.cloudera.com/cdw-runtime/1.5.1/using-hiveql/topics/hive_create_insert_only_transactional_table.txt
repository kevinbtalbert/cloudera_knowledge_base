Creating an insert-only transactional table
You can create a transactional table using any storage format if you do not require
        update and delete capability. This type of table has ACID properties, is a managed table,
        and accepts insert operations only. The storage format of an insert-only table is not
        restricted to ORC. 

In this task, you create an insert-only transactional table for storing text.  In the
                CREATE TABLE statement, specifying a storage type other than ORC, such as text, CSV,
                AVRO, or JSON, results in an insert-only ACID table. You can explicitly specify
                insert-only in the table properties clause.


Start Hive.

Enter your user name and password.
The Hive 3 connection message, followed by the Hive prompt for entering
                    SQL queries on the command line, appears. 

Create a insert-only transactional table named T2 having two integer columns, a
                    and b:

CREATE TABLE T2(a int, b int) 
  STORED AS ORC
  TBLPROPERTIES ('transactional'='true',
  'transactional_properties'='insert_only');

The 'transactional_properties'='insert_only' is required;
                    otherwise, a CRUD table results. The STORED AS ORC clause is optional (default =
                    ORC).

Create an insert-only transactional table for text data.
CREATE TABLE T3(a int, b int) 
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
The 'transactional_properties'='insert_only' is not required
                    because the storage format is other than ORC.
