Creating a default directory for managed tables
You can specify a top-level directory for managed tables when creating a Hive
        database.
Create a default directory for managed tables only after limiting CREATE
                DATABASE and ALTER DATABASE statements to users having the Admin role, which has
                    hive service user permissions. Permissions to the managed
                directory must be limited to the hive service user. In addition to
                restricting permissions to the hive user, you can further secure
                managed tables using Ranger fine-grained permissions, such as row-level filtering
                and column masking.As Admin, you specify a managed location within the default
            location specified by the hive.metastore.warehouse.dir configuration
            property to give managed tables a common location for governance policies. The managed
            location designates a single root directory for all tenant tables, managed and external.
Use the following syntax to
                create a database that specifies a location for managed tables:
                CREATE (DATABASE|SCHEMA) [IF NOT EXISTS] database_name
    [COMMENT database_comment]
    [LOCATION external_table_path]
    [MANAGEDLOCATION managed_table_directory_path]
    [WITH DBPROPERTIES (property_name=property_value, ...)];
                Do not set LOCATION and MANAGEDLOCATION to the same file system
                path.Use the following syntax to set or change a location for managed
                tables.ALTER (DATABASE|SCHEMA) database_name SET MANAGEDLOCATION [managed_table_directory_path];


Create a database mydatabase that specifies a top level directory named sales
                    for managed tables. 

CREATE DATABASE mydatabase MANAGEDLOCATION '/warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive/sales';


Change the abc_sales database location to the same location as mydatabase.
ALTER DATABASE abc_sales SET MANAGEDLOCATION '/warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive/sales';
