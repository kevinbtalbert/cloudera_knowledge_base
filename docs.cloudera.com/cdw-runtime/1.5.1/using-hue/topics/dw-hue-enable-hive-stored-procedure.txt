Enabling stored procedures for Hive in Cloudera Data Warehouse
To create, edit, and drop procedures and functions that are written in Hive Hybrid
        Procedural SQL (HPL/SQL) using the Hue query editor in CDW, you must enable the hplsql
        option in the hue-safety-valve field.

importantHue enables you to switch between Hive and HPL/SQL interpreters.
                By default, the regular Hive interpreter is enabled when you create a Hive Virtual
                Warehouse. To enable the HPL/SQL interpreter, you must update the configuration in
                the hue-safety-valve field in your Hive Virtual Warehouse.
                However, updating the hue-safety-valve overrides the default configuration.
                Therefore, to use both Hive and HPL/SQL interpreters, you must enable both by
                updating the configuration in the hue-safety-valve
                field.


Log in to the Data Warehouse service as an administrator.

Go to Virtual Warehouse > Edit > CONFIGURATIONS > Hue and select hue-safety-valve from the
                        Configuration files drop-down list.

Add the following lines in the hue-safety-valve:

[notebook]
  [[interpreters]]
    [[[hive]]]
      name=Hive
      interface=hiveserver2
    [[[hplsql]]]
      name=Hplsql
      interface=hiveserver2


Click APPLY.

Restart the Virtual Warehouse.
