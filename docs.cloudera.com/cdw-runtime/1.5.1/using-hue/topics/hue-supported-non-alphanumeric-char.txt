Supported non-ASCII and special characters in Hue
Auto-generated files may often introduce non-alphanumeric characters in the file and
  directory names that Hue does not support. This might cause the files or directories to not appear
  on the Hue File Browser. Review the list of non-alphanumeric, non-ASCII, diacritics (accents)
  characters supported in Hue for the following operations: upload, create, list in folder, view,
  and rename.
