Viewing Impala query history
The Impala Queries tab on the Job Browser page in Hue displays all
        the queries that were run on all Impala Virtual Warehouses within a
            Database Catalog from various query interfaces, such as Impala-shell, Impyla, Hue,
        and other JDBC BI clients and tools.

Only Query Processor Administrators can view historical queries of all users to
                monitor resource utilization and control costs from the Hue Job Browser. Non-admin
                users can view only their queries.
Queries are retained in the backend database for 30 days by default,
                after which they are cleaned up. You can change the clean-up interval from the
                Database Catalog configurations.


Go to the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) web interface and open Hue from your
                    Virtual Warehouse.

Click Jobs from the left assist panel.
The Job Browser page is displayed.

Click Queries.
The Hive queries that were run for the past seven days are displayed. You can
                    select the time period for which you want to view the historical data.
You can also search using the query ID, sort queries by various parameters
                    such as duration, peak memory, and so on, and filter queries by their status.
