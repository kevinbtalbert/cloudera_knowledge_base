Configuring idle session timeout for Hue
By configuring idle session timeout, you can prevent unauthorized access to your data
        by automatically logging out users when they are not actively using the Hue web interface.
        Hue warns the users and then logs them out after a set period of inactivity that you specify
        in the Hue configuration.

By default, the value of the idle_session_timeout property is set to
                    “-1”, which means that the users are not logged out until they
                manually log out of Hue.


Log in to the Data Warehouse service as an administrator.

Go to the Virtual Warehouse in which Hue is running and click
                        Edit.

Go to CONFIGURATIONS > Hue and select hue-safety-valve from the
                        Configuration files drop-down list and add the
                    following lines:

[desktop]
[[auth]]
idle_session_timeout=[***TIME-IN-SECONDS***]


Click APPLY.
The Virtual Warehouse restarts to update the configuration.
