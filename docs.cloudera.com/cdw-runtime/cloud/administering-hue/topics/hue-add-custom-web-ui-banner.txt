Adding a custom banner
You can add a custom banner to the Hue web interface by adding your custom HTML to the
      hue-safety-valve configuration for your Virtual Warehouse.

Log in to the Data Warehouse service as DWAdmin.

Go to your Virtual Warehouse tile and click  > Edit.

Go to CONFIGURATIONS > Hue, select hue-safety-valve from the
            Configuration files drop-down menu and add the following
          lines:

[desktop]
[[custom]]
banner_top_html=<H1>Your company's custom Hue Web UI banner</H1>


Click Apply Changes.
The Virtual Warehouse goes into an "Updating" state. Wait for the update to complete,
          and then open or refresh Hue.
