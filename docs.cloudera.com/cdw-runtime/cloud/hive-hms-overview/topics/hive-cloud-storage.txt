Apache Hive storage in public clouds
Knowing the storage locations of Apache Hive data and metadata helps you troubleshoot
  problems and replicate data.
On public clouds, the Hive warehouse that stores Hive data is located in an object store, such
   as S3, by default. In the cloud, Hive uses HDFS merely for storing temporary files. The Hive
   Metastore (HMS) stores the schema for Hive tables. HMS uses a pre-installed MySQL database. You
   perform little, or no, configuration of HMS in the cloud.
