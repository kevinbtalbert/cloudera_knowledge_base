HMS table storage
You need to understand how the Hive metastore (HMS) stores Hive tables when you run a
    CREATE TABLE statement or migrate a table to Cloudera Data Platform. The success or failure of
    the statement, the resulting table type, and the table location depends on a number of
    factors.
HMS table transformations
The HMS includes the following Hive metadata about tables that you create:
A table definition
Column names
Data types
Comments in a central schema repository
When you use the EXTERNAL keyword in the CREATE TABLE statement, HMS stores the table
        as an external table. When you omit the EXTERNAL keyword and create a managed table, or
        ingest a managed table, HMS might translate the table into an external table or the table
        creation can fail, depending on the table properties. An important table property that
        affects table transformations is the ACID or Non-ACID table type: 
Non-ACID
Table properties do not contain any ACID related properties set to true. For
              example, the table does not contain such properties transactional=true or
              insert_only=true.


ACID
Table properties do contain one or more ACID properties set to true.


Full ACID
Table properties contain transactional=true but not  insert_only=true


Insert-only ACID
Table properties contain insert_only=true.
 The following matrix shows the table type and whether or not the location property is
        supported.

HMS detects type of client for interacting with HMS, for example Hive or Spark, and compares
        the capabilities of the client with the table requirement. HMS performs the following
        actions, depending on the results of the comparison:

Table requirement
Client meets requirements
Managed Table
ACID table type
Action



Client can write to any type of ACID table
No
Yes
Yes
CREATE TABLE fails


Client can write to full ACID table
No
Yes
insert_only=true
CREATE TABLE fails


Client can write to insert-only ACID table
No
Yes
insert_only=true
CREATE TABLE fails

If, for example, a Spark client does not have the capabilities required, the
        following type of error message appears:
        Spark has no access to table `mytable`. Clients can access this table only if
they have the following capabilities: CONNECTORREAD,HIVEFULLACIDREAD, HIVEFULLACIDWRITE,
HIVEMANAGESTATS, HIVECACHEINVALIDATE, . . .
