Test driving Iceberg from Hive
 You learn how to access the Hive demo data, which you can use to get hands-on
        experience running Iceberg queries.
 A DWAdmin can optionally load demo data in Hue when you create a new Database
            Catalog. 

The Admin enables Load Demo Data when creating the Database
            Catalog. Users can then query sample airline demo data in Hue. 


You must meet the prerequisites to query Iceberg tables from a Virtual Warehouse
                    mentioned earlier.
You have access to a Hive Virtual Warehouse, having a Database Catalog in which
                    demo data has been loaded.
You obtained the required role for querying the Virtual Warehouse: DWUser



In Cloudera Data Warehouse Overview, select a Hive Virtual
                        Warehouse, and click Hue.






In Hue, expand the default database and verify that the airline demo data is
                    available in your Virtual Warehouse.
You see the following list of demo databases:



Select airline_ontime_iceberg to use the airline_ontime_iceberg database.

Take a look at the tables in the airline_ontime_iceberg database.
 


Flights is the fact table. It has 100M rows and three dirmensions, ariline,
                    airports, and planes. This records flights for more than 10 years in the US, and
                    includes the following details: 
origin 
destination 
delay 
air time


 Become familiar with the Iceberg airline queries to set up this database. See the next topic.

Query the demo data from Hive.
For example, find the flights that departed each year, by IATA code,
                    airport, city, state, and country. Find the average departure
                    delay.SELECT f.month, a.iata, a.airport, a.city, a.state, a.country
FROM flights f,
airports a
WHERE f.origin = a.iata
GROUP BY 
f.month,
a.iata,
a.airport,
a.city,
a.state,
a.country
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10000
ORDER BY AVG(f.DepDelay) DESC
LIMIT 10;                        Output
