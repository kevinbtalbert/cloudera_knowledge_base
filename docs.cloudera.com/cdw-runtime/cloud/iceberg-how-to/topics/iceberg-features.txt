Apache Iceberg features

  You can quickly build on your past experience with SQL to analyze Iceberg
  tables.
Iceberg features include security and governance, and other Cloudera Data Platform benefits,
   described in Apache Iceberg in CDP. After meeting prerequisites, you follow step-by-step instructions to use
   Iceberg in CDP.

Impala queries are table-format agnostic. For example, Impala options are supported in queries
   of Iceberg tables from Impala. You can run nested, correlated, analytic queries on all supported
   table types. 
Most Hive queries are table-format agnostic. This documentation does not attempt to show every
   possible query supported from Hive and Impala. For example, creating a view is not covered, but
   you can create a view of any table from Hive or Impala using SQL syntax. The following topics
   show many examples of how to run queries on Iceberg tables from Hive and Impala. 

Alter table featureIn Hive or Impala, you can use ALTER TABLE to set table properties. From Impala, you can     use ALTER TABLE to rename a table, to change the table owner, or to change the role of the table     owner. From Hive, you can alter the metadata location of the table if the new metadata does not     belong to another table; otherwise, an exception occurs.Create table featureYou use CREATE TABLE from Impala or CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE from Hive to create an   external table in Iceberg. You learn the subtle differences in these features for creating Iceberg   tables from Hive and Impala. You also learn about partitioning.Create table as select featureYou can create an Iceberg table based on an existing Hive or Impala table. Create partitioned table as select featureYou can create a partitioned Iceberg table by selecting another table. You see an   example of how to use PARTITIONED BY and TBLPROPERTIES to declare the partition spec and table   properties for the new table. Create table â€¦ like featureFrom Hive, you can create an Iceberg table schema based on another table. The table   contains no data. The table properties of the original table are carried over to the new table   definition.Delete data featureYou can delete data in a V2 Iceberg table. Describe table metadata featureYou can use certain Hive and Impala show and describe commands to get information about   table metadata. You can also query metadata tables.Drop table featureThe syntax you use to create the table determines the default behavior when you drop the   Iceberg table from Hive or Impala.Expire snapshots featureYou can expire snapshots that Iceberg generates when you create or modify a table.   During the lifetime of a table the number of snapshots of the table accumulate. You learn how to   remove snapshots you no longer need.Insert table data featureFrom Hive and Impala, you can insert data into Iceberg tables using the standard INSERT   INTO a single table.Load data inpath featureFrom Impala, you can load Parquet or ORC data from a file in a directory on your file   system or object store into an Iceberg table. You might need to set the mem_limit or pool   configuration (max-query-mem-limit, min-query-mem-limit) to accommodate the load. Load or replace partition data featureThere is no difference in the way you insert data into a partitioned or   unpartitioned Iceberg table.Materialized view featureUsing a materialized view can accelerate query execution. Creating a materialized         view on top of Iceberg tables in CDP can further accelerate the performance. You can create         a materialized view of an Iceberg V1 or V2 table based on an existing Hive or Iceberg table. Materialized view rebuild featureUpdates to materialized view contents when new data is added to the underlying table are   critical; otherwise, queries can return stale data. Merge featureYou can perform actions on an Iceberg table based on the results of a join with a v2   Iceberg table.Migrate Hive table to Iceberg featureCDP supports Hive table migration from Hive and Impala to Iceberg tables using ALTER TABLE to set   the table properties. Migrate Hive table to Iceberg using ImpalaCDP supports Hive table migration from Impala to Iceberg tables using ALTER TABLE. Partition evolution featureEvolving a partition means changing it without rewriting data files. To evolve an   Iceberg partition from Hive or Impala, you learn to use ALTER to change identity partitions. By   setting a partition spec for an identity transformation partition, you alter the   table.Partition transform featureFrom Hive or Impala, you can create a table using identity partitioning in which every   value is a single partition, or the partition is calculated from values using transformations. You   learn supported transformations and see examples of how to partition a table.Query metadata tables featureFrom Hive, you can query Iceberg metadata tables as you would query a Hive table. For   example, you can use projections, joins, filters, and so on.Rollback table featureIn the event of a problem with your table, you can reset a table to a good state as long   as the snapshot of the good table is available. From Hive, roll back the table data to the state   at an older table snapshot, or to a timestamp. From Impala, this feature is not   supported.Select Iceberg data featureYou can read Iceberg tables from Impala as you would any table. Joins, aggregations, and     analytical queries, for example, are supported.   Schema evolution featureYou learn that the Hive or Impala schema changes when the associated Iceberg table   changes. You see examples of changing the schema.Schema inference featureFrom Hive or Impala, you can base a new Iceberg table on a schema in a Parquet file.         You see a difference in the Hive and Impala syntax and examples. Snapshot managementIn addition to time travel queries, expiring a snapshot, and using a snapshot to   rollback to a version of a table, you can also set any snapshot to be the current snapshot from   Hive.Time travel featureFrom Hive or Impala, you can run point in time queries for auditing and regulatory   workflows on Iceberg tables. Time travel queries can be time-based or based on a snapshot ID. Truncate table featureTruncating an Iceberg table removes all rows from the table. A new snapshot is created.   Truncation works for partitioned and unpartitioned tables.Update and delete data featuresYou can update and delete data in a V2 Iceberg table. Update data featureYou can update data from a V2 Iceberg table.
