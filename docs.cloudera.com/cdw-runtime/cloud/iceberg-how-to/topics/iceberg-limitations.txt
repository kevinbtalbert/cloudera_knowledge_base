Feature limitations
Apache Iceberg in CDP has some limitations you need to understand.
The following features have limitations or are not supported in this release:


When the underlying table is changed, you need to rebuild the materialized view
          manually, or use the Hive query scheduling to rebuild the materialized view.
From Impala, you can read, but not write, position updates and deletes. 
Hive and Impala do not support equality updates and deletes. 
An equality delete file in the table is the likely cause of a problem with updates or
          deletes in the following situations:
In Change Data Capture (CDC) applications
In upserts from Apache Flink
From a third-party engine
