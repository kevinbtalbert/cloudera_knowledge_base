Caching manifest files
Apache Iceberg provides a mechanism to cache the contents of Iceberg manifest files in
  memory. The manifest caching feature helps to reduce repeated reads of small Iceberg manifest
  files from remote storage by Impala Coordinators and Catalogd.
Impala caches table metadata in CatalogD and the local Coordinatorâ€™s catalog, making table
   metadata analysis fast if the targeted table metadata and files were previously accessed. Impala
   might analyze the same table multiple times across concurrent query planning and also within
   single query planning, so caching is very important.
Having a frontend written in Java, Impala can directly analyze many aspects of the Iceberg
   table metadata through the Java Library provided by Apache Iceberg. Metadata analysis such as
   listing the table data file, selecting the table snapshot, partition filtering, and predicate
   filtering is delegated through Iceberg Java API.
To use the Iceberg Java API while still maintaining fast query planning, Iceberg implements
   caching strategies in the Iceberg Java Library similar to those used by Apache Impala. The
   Iceberg manifest caching feature constitutes these caching strategies. For more information about
   manifest caching, see the Iceberg Manifest Caching Blog.You can configure manifest caching in Cloudera Data Warehouse
   (CDW). .
