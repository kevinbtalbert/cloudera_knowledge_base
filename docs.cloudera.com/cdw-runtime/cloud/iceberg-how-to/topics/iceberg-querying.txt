Prerequisites
You need to set up your environment and meet Data Lake prerequisites for querying
        Iceberg tables in CDP. You learn which query editors are supported and which roles are
        required. 
noteDo not drop, move, or change the old table during a migration
                operation. Doing so will delete the data files of the old and new tables.The
            following list covers prerequisites for using Iceberg.
You are using the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW).
You must have access to a CDP environment that was activated from your
                    environment UI. Your DATALAKE type, which you select when creating the Database
                    Catalog, must be SDX.
Data Lake version 7.2.12.1 or higher is required. 
One of the following query editors are required to query Iceberg tables: 
 Hue (recommended)
 A JDBC client 
 The Impala shell for remote users 

You must have the required role: DWUser.
You must obtain permission to run SQL queries from the Env Admin, who must add
                    you to the Hadoop SQL Storage Handler and the Hadoop SQL policies. 
You must use the HadoopFileIO. S3FileIO is not supported. URLs in metadata
                    starting with s3://... cause query failure.

Migrating from Impala Prerequisites

The original table is an EXTERNAL table from the Impala perspective: The
                    EXTERNAL table property value is true.
The original table is a non-ACID table.
You have  “ALL” privileges on the database containing the table.
