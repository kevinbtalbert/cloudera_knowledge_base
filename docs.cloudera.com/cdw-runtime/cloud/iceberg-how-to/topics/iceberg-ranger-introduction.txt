Accessing Iceberg tables
CDP uses Apache Ranger to provide centralized security administration and management.
  The Ranger Admin Web UI is the central interface for security administration. You
  use the UI to create a policy that allows users to query Iceberg tables.  
How you open the Ranger Admin UI differs from one CDP service to another. In Management
   Console, you can select your environment, and then click Environment Details > Quick Links > Ranger. 

You log into the Ranger Admin Web UI, the Ranger Service Manager appears. 


The default policies that appear differ from service to service. You need to set up two Hadoop

   SQL policies to query Iceberg tables: 
One to authorize users to access the file system or object store used by Iceberg.
One to authorize users to query Iceberg tables

You can find complete Ranger documentation for Public Cloud in "Security".
