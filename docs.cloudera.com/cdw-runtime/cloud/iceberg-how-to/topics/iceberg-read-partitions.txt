Selecting an Iceberg table
 You see an example of how to read an Apache Iceberg table, and understand the
        advantages of Iceberg. 
 Working with timestamps in Iceberg, you do not need to know whether the table is
            actually partitioned by month, day or hour, based on the timestamp value. You can simply
            supply a predicate for the timestamp value and Iceberg converts the timestamp to
            month/day/hour transparently. Hive/Impala must maintain actual partition values in a
            separate column (for example, ts_month or ts_day). Forgetting to reference the derived
            partition column in your query can lead to inadvertent full table scans. By default
                    iceberg.table_identifier is not set in CDP, so you can use the
                familiar <db_name.<table_name> in queries.


You must meet the prerequisites to query Iceberg tables mentioned earlier.



Use a database.
For example:USE mydatabase;

Query an Iceberg table partitioned by city.
For example:
                    SELECT * FROM ice_t2 WHERE city="Bangalore";
