Rollback table feature
In the event of a problem with your table, you can reset a table to a good state as long
  as the snapshot of the good table is available. From Hive, roll back the table data to the state
  at an older table snapshot, or to a timestamp. From Impala, this feature is not
  supported.
Hive syntax
ALTER TABLE test_table EXECUTE rollback(snapshotID);
ALTER TABLE test_table EXECUTE rollback('timestamp');

Hive examples
ALTER TABLE ice_7 EXECUTE ROLLBACK('2022-08-08 00:00:00')
ALTER TABLE ice_t EXECUTE ROLLBACK(3088747670581784990);
