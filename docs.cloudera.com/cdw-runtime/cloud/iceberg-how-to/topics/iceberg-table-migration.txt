Migrate Hive table to Iceberg feature
CDP supports Hive table migration from Hive and Impala to Iceberg tables using ALTER TABLE to set
  the table properties. 

noteDo not drop or move the old table during a migration operation. Doing so
   will delete the data files of the old and new tables. Exception: If you set the table property
   'external.table.purge'='FALSE', no data loss occurs when you drop the table.
In-place table migration process
In-place table migration saves time generating Iceberg tables. There is no need to regenerate
    data files. Only metadata, which points to source data files, is regenerated. 
To convert a Hive table to an Iceberg V1 table from Impala, use the following syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name CONVERT TO ICEBERG;
To convert a Hive table to an Iceberg V2 table from Impala you must run two queries. Use the
    following syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name CONVERT TO ICEBERG
    
ALTER TABLE table_name SET TBLPROPERTIES ('format-version' = '2'
    ...)
In-place table migration saves time generating Iceberg tables. There is no need to regenerate

Changing the metadata locationFrom Hive, you can change the table metadata location, also known as the snapshot   location.Parent topic: Apache Iceberg features
