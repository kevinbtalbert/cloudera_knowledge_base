Understanding Performance using Query Profile
 To understand the detailed performance characteristics for a
    query, issue the PROFILE command in
      impala-shell immediately after executing a query. This
    low-level information includes physical details about memory, CPU, I/O, and
    network usage, and thus is only available after the query is actually run. 
 The PROFILE command, available in impala-shell, produces
      a detailed low-level report showing how a query was executed. Unlike the
        EXPLAIN plan, this information is only available after the query has
      finished. It shows physical details such as the number of bytes read, maximum memory usage,
      and so on for each node. You can use this information to determine if the query is I/O-bound
      or CPU-bound, whether some network condition is imposing a bottleneck, whether a slowdown is
      affecting some nodes but not others, and to check that recommended configuration settings such
      as short-circuit local reads are in effect. 
 By default, time values in the profile output reflect the wall-clock
      time taken by an operation. For values denoting system time or user time,
      the measurement unit is reflected in the metric name, such as
        ScannerThreadsSysTime or
        ScannerThreadsUserTime. For example, a multi-threaded
      I/O operation might show a small figure for wall-clock time, while the
      corresponding system time is larger, representing the sum of the CPU time
      taken by each thread. Or a wall-clock time figure might be larger because
      it counts time spent waiting, while the corresponding system and user time
      figures only measure the time while the operation is actively using CPU
      cycles. 
 The EXPLAIN plan is also printed at the beginning of
      the query profile report, for convenience in examining both the logical
      and physical aspects of the query side-by-side. The
        EXPLAIN_LEVEL query option also controls the verbosity
      of the EXPLAIN output printed by the
        PROFILE command. 
The Per Node Profiles section in the profile output
      includes the following metrics that can be controlled by the
        RESOURCE_TRACE_RATIO query option.

CpuIoWaitPercentage

CpuSysPercentage
CpuUserPercentage
HostDiskReadThroughput: All data read by the host as
        part of the execution of this query (spilling), by the HDFS data node,
        and by other processes running on the same system.
HostDiskWriteThroughput: All data written by the host
        as part of the execution of this query (spilling), by the HDFS data
        node, and by other processes running on the same system.
HostNetworkRx: All data received by the host as part
        of the execution of this query, other queries, and other processes
        running on the same system. 
HostNetworkTx: All data transmitted by the host as
        part of the execution of this query, other queries, and other processes
        running on the same system. 



        Until this release, the impala-shell 'profile' command only returns the profile
        for the most recent profile attempt. There was no option to get the original
        query profile (the profile of the first query attempt that failed) from
        the impala-shell. This release added support for returning both the original and retried profiles for a
        retried query.
      

        impala-shell has been modified and the 'profile' command has a new set of
        options. The syntax is now:

PROFILE [ALL | LATEST | ORIGINAL]


        If you specify 'ALL', both the latest and original profiles are
        printed. When you specify 'LATEST', only the latest profile is printed.
        If 'ORIGINAL' is specified, only the original profile is printed. The
        default behavior is equivalent to specifying 'LATEST'.

noteSupport for this has only been added to HS2 given that Beeswax is being
          deprecated soon. The new 'profile' options have no affect when the
          Beeswax protocol is used.
