Storage Systems Supports
This section describes the storage systems that Impala
    supports.
Impala with Azure Data Lake Store (ADLS)You can use Impala to query data residing on the Azure Data Lake     Store (ADLS) filesystem and Azure Blob File System (ABFS). This capability     allows convenient access to a storage system that is remotely managed,     accessible from anywhere, and integrated with various cloud-based services. Impala with Amazon S3You can use Impala to query data residing on the Amazon S3 object     store. This capability allows convenient access to a storage system that is     remotely managed, accessible from anywhere, and integrated with various     cloud-based services.  Configure Impala Daemon to spill to S3Impala occasionally needs to use persistent storage for writing intermediate files   during large sorts, joins, aggregations, or analytic function operations. If your workload results   in large volumes of intermediate data being written, it is recommended to configure the heavy   spilling queries to use a remote storage location rather than the local one. The advantage of   using remote storage for scratch space is that it is elastic and can handle any amount of   spilling.
