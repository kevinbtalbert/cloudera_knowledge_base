Configure Impala Daemon to spill to S3
Impala occasionally needs to use persistent storage for writing intermediate files
  during large sorts, joins, aggregations, or analytic function operations. If your workload results
  in large volumes of intermediate data being written, it is recommended to configure the heavy
  spilling queries to use a remote storage location rather than the local one. The advantage of
  using remote storage for scratch space is that it is elastic and can handle any amount of
  spilling.
Before you begin
Identify the URL for an S3 bucket to which you want your new Impala to write the temporary
   data. If you use the S3 bucket that is associated with the environment, navigate to the S3 bucket
   and copy the URL. If you want to use an external S3 bucket, you must first configure your CDP
   environment to use the external S3 bucket with the correct read/write permissions.
Configuring the Start-up Option in Impala daemon
You can use the Impalad start option scratch_dirs to specify the locations of the
   intermediate files. The format of the option is scratch_dirs= remote_dir, local_buffer_dir(,
    local_dir…).
With the option specified above:

You can specify only one remote directory. When you configure a remote directory, you
     must specify a local buffer directory as the buffer. However you can use multiple local
     directories with the remote directory. If you specify multiple local directories, the first
     local directory would be used as the local buffer directory.
If you configure both remote and local directories, the remote directory is only used when
    the local directories are fully utilized.
The size of a remote intermediate file could affect the query performance, and the value can
    be set by remote_tmp_file_size in the start-up option. The default
    size of a remote intermediate file is 16MB while the maximum is 256MB.

Examples



A remote scratch dir with one local buffer dir, file size 64MB.


‑‑scratch_dirs="s3a://remote_dir, /local_buffer_dir"
    ‑‑remote_tmp_file_size=64M


A remote scratch dir with one local buffer dir, and one local dir.


‑‑scratch_dirs="s3a://remote_dir, /local_buffer_dir, /local_dir"


A remote scratch dir with one local buffer dir, and multiple local dirs.


‑‑scratch_dirs="s3a://remote_dir, /local_buffer_dir, /local_dir_1,
    /local_dir_2"
