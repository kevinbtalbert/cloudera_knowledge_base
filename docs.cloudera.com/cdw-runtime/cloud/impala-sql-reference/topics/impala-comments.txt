Impala SQL comments
Impala supports the syntax of standard SQL comments.

        All text from a -- sequence to the end of the line is considered a comment and ignored.
        This type of comment can occur on a single line by itself, or after all or part of a statement.
      

        All text from a /* sequence to the next */ sequence is considered a
        comment and ignored. This type of comment can stretch over multiple lines. This type of comment can occur
        on one or more lines by itself, in the middle of a statement, or before or after a statement.
