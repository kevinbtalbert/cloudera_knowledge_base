DATE data type
 Use the DATE data type to store date values. 

 Use the DATE data type to store date values. The
          DATE type is supported for HBase, Text, Avro, and
        Parquet. 

Range:

 0001-01-01 to 9999-12-31 

Literals and expressions:

 The DATE literals are in the form of
          DATE'YYYY-MM-DD'. For example, DATE
          '2013-01-01'


Parquet and Avro considerations:

 Parquet and Avro use DATE logical type for dates. The
          DATE logical type annotates an INT32
        that stores the number of days from the Unix epoch, January 1, 1970.
        This representation introduces an interoperability issue between Impala
        and older versions of Hive: 
 If Hive versions lower than 3.1 wrote dates earlier than 1582-10-15 to
        a Parquet or Avro table, those dates will be read back incorrectly by
        Impala and vice versa. In Hive 3.1 and higher, this is no longer an
        issue. 

Explicit casting between DATE and other data types:


DATE type can only be converted to/from
          DATE, TIMESTAMP, or
          STRING types as described below.

TIMESTAMP


DATE

 The date component of the TIMESTAMP is
                returned, and the time of the day component of the
                  TIMESTAMP is ignored. 



STRING


DATE

 The DATE value of
                  yyyy-MM-dd is returned.  The
                    STRING value must be in the
                    yyyy-MM-dd or yyyy-MM-dd
                    HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSSSS pattern. 
 If the time component is present in STRING,
                  it is silently ignored. 
 If the STRING value does not match the
                  above formats, an error is returned. 




DATE


TIMESTAMP

 The year, month, and day of the DATE is
                returned along with the time of day component set to
                  00:00:00. 



DATE


STRING

 The STRING value,
                  'yyyy-MM-dd', is returned. 



Implicit casting between DATE and other types: 

 Implicit casting is supported: 

 From STRING to DATE if the source
            STRING value is in the yyyy-MM-dd
          or yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSSSS pattern. 
 From DATE to TIMESTAMP. 


Added in:

 The DATE type is available in Impala 3.3 and higher.
      
Kudu considerations:
You can read and write DATE values to Kudu tables. For example:


create table kudu_date_key (fdatekey date primary key, val string)
stored as kudu
insert into kudu_date_key values (DATE '1970-01-01', 'Unix epoch'), (DATE '2019-12-12', 'today')
