Spooling Impala Query ResultsCloudera Docs
Spooling Impala Query Results
In Impala, you can control how query results are materialized and
  returned to clients, e.g. impala-shell, Hue, JDBC apps.
Result spooling is turned ON by default and can be controlled using the
   SPOOL_QUERY_RESULTS query option.


Since the query result spooling is enabled by default, result sets of queries are
     eagerly fetched and spooled in the spooling location, either in memory
     or on disk. Once all result rows have been fetched and stored in
      the spooling location, the resources are freed up. Incoming client
      fetches can get the data from the spooled results.


Admission Control and Result Spooling
Query results spooling collects and stores query results in memory that
    is controlled by admission control. Use the following query options to
    calibrate how much memory to use and when to spill to disk.
MAX_RESULT_SPOOLING_MEM

The maximum amount of memory used when spooling query results.
        If this value is exceeded when spooling results, all memory will
        most likely be spilled to disk. Set to 100 MB by default. 

MAX_SPILLED_RESULT_SPOOLING_MEM

The maximum amount of memory that can be spilled to disk when
        spooling query results. Must be greater than or equal to
        MAX_RESULT_SPOOLING_MEM. If this value is
        exceeded, the coordinator fragment will block until the client
        has consumed enough rows to free up more memory. Set to 1 GB by
        default.



Fetch Timeout
Resources for a query are released when the query completes its
    execution. To prevent clients from indefinitely waiting for query
    results, use the FETCH_ROWS_TIMEOUT_MS query option to
    set the timeout when clients fetch rows. Timeout applies both when query
    result spooling is enabled and disabled:
When result spooling is disabled (SPOOL_QUERY_RESULTS =
      FALSE), the timeout controls how long a client waits for
      a single row batch to be produced by the coordinator. 
When result spooling is enabled ( (SPOOL_QUERY_RESULTS =
      TRUE), a client can fetch multiple row batches at a time,
      so this timeout controls the total time a client waits for row
      batches to be produced.


Explain Plans
Below is the part of the EXPLAIN plan output for
    result spooling.F01:PLAN FRAGMENT [UNPARTITIONED] hosts=1 instances=1
     |  Per-Host Resources: mem-estimate=4.02MB mem-reservation=4.00MB thread-reservation=1
     PLAN-ROOT SINK
     |  mem-estimate=4.00MB mem-reservation=4.00MB spill-buffer=2.00MB thread-reservation=0
The mem-estimate for the PLAN-ROOT
       SINK is an estimate of the amount of memory needed to
       spool all the rows returned by the query.
The mem-reservation is the number and size of the
       buffers necessary to spool the query results. By default, the read
       and write buffers are 2 MB in size each, which is why the default is
       4 MB.


PlanRootSink
In Impala, the PlanRootSink class controls
    the passing of batches of rows to the clients and acts as a queue of
    rows to be sent to clients.



When result spooling is disabled, a single batch or rows is sent
       to the PlanRootSink, and then the client must
       consume that batch before another one can be sent.


When result spooling is enabled, multiple batches of rows can be
       sent to the PlanRootSink, and multiple batches
       can be consumed by the client.
