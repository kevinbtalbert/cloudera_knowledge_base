Configuring Impyla for ImpalaCloudera Docs
Configuring Impyla for Impala
Explains how to install Impyla to connect to and submit SQL queries to Impala. Impyla
        is a Python client wrapper around the HiveServer2 Thrift Service. It connects to Impala and
        implements Python DB API 2.0.

Impyla releases are available at pypi.org. To get the available releases, check Release history.
noteCloudera will not support versions of Impyla that are built manually from source code.
Key Features of Impyla

HiveServer2 compliant.
Works with Impala including nested data.
DB API 2.0 (PEP 249)-compliant Python client (similar to sqlite or MySQL
                    clients) supporting Python 2.6+ and Python 3.3+.
Works with LDAP, SSL.
SQLAlchemy connector.
Converts to pandas DataFrame, allowing easy integration into the Python data
                    stack (including scikit-learn and matplotlib); see the Ibis project for a
                    richer experience.

Different systems require different packages to be installed to enable SASL support
                in Impyla. The following list shows some examples of how to install the packages on
                different distributions.
You must have the following installed in your environment before installing
                impyla. Python 2.6+ or 3.3+ and the pip packages six, bitarray, thrift and
                thriftpy2 will be automatically installed as dependencies when installing
                impyla. However if you clone the impyla repo and run their local copy, you must
                install these pip packages manually.

Install the latest pip and setuptools:
                    python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools


                    RHEL/CentOS: sudo yum install gcc-c++ cyrus-sasl-md5 cyrus-sasl-plain cyrus-sasl-gssapi cyrus-sasl-devel


                    Ubuntu: sudo apt install g++ libsasl2-dev libsasl2-2 libsasl2-modules-gssapi-mit




Using pip you can install the latest release: pip install impyla


You also need to pip-install pandas for conversion to DataFrame objects or 
                    sqlalchemy for the SQLAlchemy engine.



Sample codes

Impyla implements the 
                Python DB API v2.0 (PEP 249) database interface (refer to it for API details):
from impala.dbapi import connect

conn = connect(host = "my.host.com", port = 21050)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM mytable LIMIT 100")
print(cursor.description)  # prints the result set's schema
results = cursor.fetchall()
cursor.close()
conn.close()
The Cursorobject also exposes the iterator interface, which is buffered (controlled by 
                cursor.arraysize):
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM mytable LIMIT 100")
for row in cursor:
    print(row)
Furthermore the Cursor object returns you information about the columns returned in
                the query. This is useful to export your data as a csv file.
import csv

cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM mytable LIMIT 100")
columns = [datum[0] for datum in cursor.description]
targetfile = "/tmp/foo.csv"

with open(targetfile, "w", newline = "") as outcsv:
    writer = csv.writer(
        outcsv,
        delimiter = ",",
        quotechar = '"',
        quoting = csv.QUOTE_ALL,
        lineterminator = "\n")
writer.writerow(columns)

for row in cursor:
    writer.writerow(row)
You can also get back a pandas DataFrame object
from impala.util import as_pandas

# carry df through scikit-learn, for example
df = as_pandas(cur)



Connecting to Impala Virtual Warehouse
Lists an example code to connect to Impala VW with LDAP over http using LDAP as the
            authentication mechanism.


Sample code

from impala.dbapi import connect

conn = connect(
    host = "Impala VW endpoint",  # could be coordinator or impala-proxy
    port = 443,
    auth_mechanism = "LDAP",
    use_ssl = True,
    use_http_transport = True,
    http_path = "cliservice",
    user = "ldap_userId",
    password = "ldap_password")
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM default.emax_temp")

for row in cursor:
    print(row)
cursor.close()
conn.close()
