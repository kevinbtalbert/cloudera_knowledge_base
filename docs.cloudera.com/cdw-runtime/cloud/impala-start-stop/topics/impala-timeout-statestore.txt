Increasing StateStore Timeout
If you have an extensive Impala schema, for example, with
    hundreds of databases, tens of thousands of tables, you might encounter
    timeout errors during startup as the Impala catalog service broadcasts
    metadata to all the Impala nodes using the StateStore service. To avoid such
    timeout errors on startup, increase the StateStore timeout value from its
    default of 10 seconds. 
Increase the timeout value of the StateStore service if you see
      messages in the impalad log such as:
      Connection with state-store lost
Trying to re-register with state-store

Log in to the CDP web interface and navigate to the Data Warehouse service.

In the Data Warehouse service, click Virtual Warehouses in
                    the left navigation panel.

Select the Impala Virtual Warehouse, click options for the warehouse you want to
                    set the timeout and retry options.

Click Edit and navigate to Impala Coordinatorunder Configurationstab.

Using the + sign, specify the following if the option is not already added.
Specify a new timeout value larger than the current
                    value using the option StateStoreSubscriber Timeout.
Click Apply and restart
                Impala.
