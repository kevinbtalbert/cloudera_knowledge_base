Downloading a JDBC driver from Cloudera Data Warehouse
To use third-party BI tools, your client users need a JDBC JAR to connect your BI
    tool and the service. You learn how to download the JDBC JAR to give to your client, and general
    instructions about how to use the JDBC JAR.

Before you can use your BI tool with the Data Warehouse service: 
You created a Database Catalog. You have the option to populate your Database Catalog
            with sample data when you create it. 
You created a Virtual Warehouse and configured it to connect to the Database Catalog.
            
Of course, to query tables in the Virtual Warehouse from a client, you must have
              populated the Virtual Warehouse with some data.


Log in to the CDP web interface and navigate to the Data Warehouse service.

In the Data Warehouse service, click Virtual Warehouses in
              the left navigation panel.

Select a Hive Virtual Warehouse, click options for the warehouse you want to connect to your BI tool, and
          select Download JDBC Jar to download the Apache Hive JDBC
          JAR.




Provide the JAR file you downloaded to your JDBC client.
On most
              clients, add the JAR file under the Libraries folder. Refer to your
              client documentation for information on the location to add the JAR file.

In the Data Warehouse service Overview page, for the Virtual
          Warehouse you want to connect to the client, in options, click Copy JDBC
            URL:


A URL is copied to your system clipboard in the following format:
jdbc:hive2://<your_virtual_warehouse>.<your_environment>.<dwx.company.com>/default;transportMode=http;httpPath=cliservice;ssl=true;retries=3          


Paste the URL into a text editor and configure your client BI tool to connect to the
          Virtual Warehouse using the following portion of the URL, represents the server name of
          the Virtual Warehouse:

<your_virtual_warehouse>.<your_environment>.<dwx.company.com>


In your JDBC client, set the following other options:
Authentication: Username and Password
Username: Username you use to connect to the CDP Data Warehouse service.
Password: Password you use to connect to the CDP Data Warehouse service.
