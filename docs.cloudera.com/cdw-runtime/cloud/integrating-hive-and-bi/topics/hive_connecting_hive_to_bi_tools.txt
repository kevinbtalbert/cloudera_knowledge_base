Connecting Hive to BI tools
         using a JDBC/ODBC driver in Cloudera Data Warehouse

To query, analyze, and visualize data stored in CDP, you use drivers provided by
      Cloudera to connect Apache Hive to Business Intelligence (BI) tools.
 How you connect to Hive depends on a number of factors: the location of Hive inside
         or outside the cluster, the HiveServer deployment, the type of transport, transport-layer
         security, and authentication. HiveServer is the server interface that enables remote
         clients to run queries against Hive and retrieve the results using a JDBC or ODBC
         connection.
         


Choose a Hive authorization model.
Configure authenticated users for querying Hive through JDBC or ODBC driver. For
               example, set up a Ranger
               policy. 



Downloading a JDBC driver from Cloudera Data WarehouseTo use third-party BI tools, your client users need a JDBC JAR to connect your BI     tool and the service. You learn how to download the JDBC JAR to give to your client, and general     instructions about how to use the JDBC JAR.
