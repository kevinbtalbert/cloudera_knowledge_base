Monitoring compaction
You can query the SYS database to monitor compactions.

 Querying the COMPACTIONS table provides information about completed and queued
                compactions. 


Run a query to find failed compactions.
SELECT * FROM SYS.COMPACTIONS WHERE C_STATE IN ("failed", "did not initiate");
