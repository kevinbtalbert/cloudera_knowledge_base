Vectorization default
Vectorized query execution can affect performance. You need to be aware of the Boolean default value of hive.vectorized.execution.enabled.
Vectorized query execution is enabled by default (true). Vectorized query execution processes Hive
   data in batch, channeling a large number of rows of data into columns, foregoing intermediate
   results. This technique is more efficient than the MapReduce execution process that stores
   temporary files.
