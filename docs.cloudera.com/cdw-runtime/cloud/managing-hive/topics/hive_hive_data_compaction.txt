Data compaction
As administrator, you need to manage compaction of
  delta files that accumulate during data ingestion. Compaction is a process that performs critical
  cleanup of files.
Hive creates a set of delta files for each transaction that alters a table or partition. By
   default, compaction of delta and base files occurs at regular intervals. Compactions occur in the
   background without affecting concurrent reads and writes. 
There are two types of compaction:
        

MinorRewrites a set of delta files to a single delta file for a bucket.
MajorRewrites one or more delta files and the base file as a new base file for a
    bucket.Carefully consider the need for a major compaction as this process can consume
    significant system resources and take a long time. Base and delta files for a table or partition
    are compacted.You can configure automatic compactions or do manual compactions. Start a major
     compaction during periods of low traffic. You use an ALTER TABLE statement to start compaction
     manually. A manual compaction either returns the accepted compaction request ID or shows the ID
     (and current state) of a compaction request for the very same target. The request is stored in
     the COMPACTION_QUEUE table. 


The compactor initiator must run on only one HMS instance at a time.


Related informationApache Wiki transactions and compaction documentationCompaction tasksCompaction in Hive goes hand-in-hand with Hive ACID. Compaction is not, however, necessarily required for Hive ACID. You need to understand     when you want, or do not want, compaction to occur.Starting compaction manuallyYou manually start         compaction when automatic compaction fails for some reason. You can start compaction by         running a Hive statement.Viewing compaction progressYou view the progress of compactions by running Hive queries. Monitoring compactionYou can query the SYS database to monitor compactions.Disabling automatic compactionYou can disable automatic compaction of a particular Hive ACID table by setting a Hive       table property. By default, compaction is enabled, so you must enter an ALTER TABLE command to       disable it.Configuring compaction using table propertiesYou see how to configure compaction using table properties and learn about the advantage   of using this method of configuration. Configuring the compaction check intervalYou need to know when and how to control the compaction process checking, performed in   the background, of the file system for changes that require compaction.
