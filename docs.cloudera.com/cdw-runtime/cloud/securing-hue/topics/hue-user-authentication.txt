User authentication in Hue
Cloudera Data Warehouse supports authenticating users to
      Hue using SAML.
After Hue is authenticated by a service such as Hive, Hue impersonates the user requesting the
   use of that service, for example, to create a Hive table. In this case, the Hive service uses
   Apache Ranger to ensure that the group to which the user belonged is authorized for that action
   (to create a Hive table).
noteBy default, the Hue session uses a secure cookie protocol. 

Authenticating Hue users with SAMLHue supports SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for Single Sign-on     (SSO) authentication.
