Configuring the DAS Event Processor scan frequencyCloudera Docs
Configuring the DAS Event Processor scan frequency
You can configure the frequency at which the Data Analytics Studio (DAS) Event
        Processor fetches the data from a Hadoop Compatible File System by setting the time in
        milliseconds (ms) in the “scan.folder.delay.millis” property in the Database Catalog
        configurations.

By default, the value of the “scan.folder.delay.millis” property is
                2000 ms. For a faster data refresh rate, you can set this value to less than 2000
                ms. But this can result in higher storage read costs. However, if you want stronger
                performance, and a higher refresh rate is not a priority, then you can set it to a
                higher value to reduce storage read costs.


Sign in to the Cloudera Data Warehouse service.

Go to Database Catalog > Edit > CONFIGURATIONS > Das event processor and select das-event-processor.json from
                    the Configuration files drop-down menu.

Change the value of the “scan.folder.delay.millis” property
                    under the “event-processing” section.

Click Apply.
