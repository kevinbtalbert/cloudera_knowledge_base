Configuring the Hue Query Processor scan frequency
You can configure the frequency at which the Hue Query Processor fetches the data
        from a Hadoop Compatible File System by setting the time in milliseconds (ms) in the
        “hue.query-processor.event-pipeline.folder-scan-delay-millis” property in the Database
        Catalog configurations.

By default, the value of the
                    “hue.query-processor.event-pipeline.folder-scan-delay-millis”
                property is 5 * 60 * 1000 ms (5 minutes). For a faster data refresh
                rate, you can set this value to less than 5 * 60 * 1000 ms (5
                minutes). But this can result in higher storage read costs. However, if you want
                stronger performance, and a higher refresh rate is not a priority, then you can set
                it to a higher value to reduce storage read costs.


Sign in to the Cloudera Data Warehouse service.

Go to Database Catalog > Edit > CONFIGURATIONS > Hue query processor and select hue-query-processor.json from
                    the Configuration files drop-down menu.

Change the value of the
                        “hue.query-processor.event-pipeline.folder-scan-delay-millis”
                    property under the “dasConf” section.
