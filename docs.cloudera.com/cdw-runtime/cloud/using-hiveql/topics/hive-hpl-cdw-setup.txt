Setting up a CDW client
As a Hive user who connects to CDW from a client, you need to know how to set up the
        client for using HPL/SQL.


You have
                    created a Database Catalog that is populated with data.You can select
                    an option to load sample airline data when you create the catalog.
You have an existing Hive Virtual Warehouse, or you added a new one, that is
                    configured to connect to the Database Catalog with data.



On the client end, download the latest version of the Hive JDBC driver from
                        Cloudera Downloads page.

Install the driver on the client end.
Typically, you add the JAR file to the Libraries folder. 

Log into the CDP web interface and navigate to the Data Warehouse
                    service.

In the Data Warehouse service, click Virtual Warehouse in the left navigation
                    panel.

On the Virtual Warehouses page, click the options menu of the Hive VW you want
                    to connect to, and select Copy JDBC URL.




Paste the copied JDBC URL into a text file.
jdbc:hive2://<your-virtual-warehouse>.<your-environment>.<dwx.company.com>/default;transportMode=http;httpPath=cliservice;ssl=true;retries=3


Append mode=hplsql to the end of the JDBC URL for connecting
                    to CDW from the client.  

jdbc:hive2://<your-virtual-warehouse>.<your-environment>.<dwx.company.com>/default;transportMode=http;httpPath=cliservice;ssl=true;retries=3;mode=hplsql                


On the client end, use the URL in Beeline to connect to CDW and enable
                    HPL/SQL.

beeline -n <csso_username> -p <password> -u "jdbc:hive2://<your-virtual-warehouse>.<your-environment>.<dwx.company.com>/default;transportMode=http;httpPath=cliservice;ssl=true;retries=3;mode=hplsql"

At the Hive prompt, you can run HPL/SQL. You can use the forward slash (/) as
                    a statement delimiter because a HPL/SQL statement can have multiple rows
                    consisting of multiple SQL statements.
