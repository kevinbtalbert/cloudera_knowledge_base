Aggregating and grouping
    data
You use AVG, SUM, or MAX functions to aggregate data, and the GROUP BY clause to group data query results in
    one or more table columns..
The GROUP BY clause explicitly groups data. Hive supports implicit grouping, which occurs when aggregating the table in full.

Construct a query that returns the average salary of all employees in
           the engineering department grouped by year. 
SELECT year, AVG(salary)
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'engineering' GROUP BY year;

Construct an implicit grouping query to get the highest paid employee.
SELECT MAX(salary) as highest_pay, 
AVG(salary) as average_pay
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'engineering';
