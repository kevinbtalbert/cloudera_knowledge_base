Creating a CRUD transactional table
You create a CRUD transactional table having ACID (atomic, consistent, isolated, and
        durable) properties when you need a managed table that you can update, delete, and merge.
        You learn by example how to determine the table type. 

In this task, you create a CRUD transactional table. You cannot sort this type of
                table. To create a CRUD transactional table, you must accept the default ORC format
                by not specifying any storage during table creation, or by specifying ORC storage
                explicitly.


Start Hive.
For example, start Hive from a JDBC client:
                    beeline -u jdbc:hive2://myhiveserver.com:10000 -n hive -p

Enter your user name and password.
The Hive 3 connection message, followed by the Hive prompt for entering
                    SQL queries on the command line, appears. 

Create a CRUD transactional table named T having two integer columns, a and
                    b:

CREATE TABLE T(a int, b int);


Confirm that you created a managed, ACID table.

DESCRIBE FORMATTED T;

The table type says MANAGED_TABLE and transactional = true.
