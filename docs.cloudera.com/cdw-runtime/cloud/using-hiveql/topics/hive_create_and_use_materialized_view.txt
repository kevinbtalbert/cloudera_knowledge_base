Creating and using a materialized view
You can create a materialized view of a query to calculate and store results of an
        expensive operation, such as a particular join, on a managed, ACID table that you repeatedly
        run. When you issue queries specified by that materialized view, the optimizer rewrites the
        query based on it. This action saves reprocessing. Query performance improves. 

In the tasks that follow, first you create, or use an existing, Hive Virtual
                Warehouse. You create and populate example tables. The tables are managed tables.
                You cannot create a materialized view of an external table. You create a
                materialized view of a join of the tables. Subsequently, you run a query to join the
                tables, and the query plan takes advantage of the precomputed join to accelerate
                processing. These over-simplified tasks show the syntax and output of a materialized
                view, and do not demonstrate accelerated processing that occurs in a real-world
                task, processing a large amount of data.



You have access to an existing Hive Virtual Warehouse, or you created a new
                    one.

You run the query, and the optimizer takes advantage of the         precomputation performed by the materialized view to speed response time.Using optimizations from a subqueryYou can create a query having a subquery that the optimizer rewrites based on a         materialized view. You create a materialized view, and then run a query that uses the         materialized view.Dropping a materialized viewYou must understand when to drop a materialized view to successfully drop related tables.Showing materialized viewsYou can list all materialized views in the current database or in another     database. You can filter a list of materialized views in a specified database using regular expression wildcards.Describing a materialized viewYou can get summary, detailed, and formatted information about a materialized         view.Managing query rewritesAfter changes to base tables, the data in a materialized view is stale. You need to         know how to prevent the SQL optimizer from rewriting queries in this situation. If you want         a query executed without regard to a materialized view, for example to measure the execution         time difference, you can disable rewriting and then enable it again. Purposely using a stale materialized viewA rewrite of a query based on a stale materialized view does not occur automatically.         If you want a rewrite of a stale or possibly stale materialized view, you can force a         rewrite. Creating and using a partitioned materialized viewWhen creating a materialized view, you can partition selected columns to improve         performance. Partitioning separates the view of a table into parts, which often improves         query rewrites of partition-wise joins of materialized views with tables or other         materialized views.Parent topic: Materialized views
