Use wildcards with SHOW DATABASES
 In a SHOW DATABASES LIKE statement, you can use wildcards, and in this release of
        Hive, specify any character or a single character.

SHOW DATABASES or SHOW SCHEMAS lists all of the databases defined in Hive metastore.
                You can use the following wildcards: 
* or %
Matches any single character or multiple characters


_
Matches any single character


|
Matches either the part of the pattern on the left or the right side of
                            the pipe. 


            For example,'students', 'stu%', 'stu_ents' match the database named students.
