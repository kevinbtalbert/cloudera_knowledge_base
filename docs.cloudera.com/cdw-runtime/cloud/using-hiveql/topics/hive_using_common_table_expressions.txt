Using common table expressions
Using common table expression (CTE), you can create a temporary view that repeatedly references a subquery.
A CTE is a set of query results obtained from
         a simple query specified within a WITH clause that immediately precedes a SELECT or
         INSERT keyword. A CTE exists only within the scope of a single SQL statement and not stored in the metastore. You can include one or more
         CTEs in the following SQL statements:


SELECT


INSERT


CREATE TABLE AS SELECT


CREATE VIEW AS SELECT


Recursive queries are not supported and the WITH clause is not supported within subquery blocks.
