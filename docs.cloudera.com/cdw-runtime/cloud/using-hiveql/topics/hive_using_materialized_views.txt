Materialized views
A materialized view is a Hive-managed database object that holds a query result you can
  use to speed up the execution of a query workload. If your queries are repetitive, you can reduce
  latency and resource consumption by using materialized views. You create materialized views to
  optimize your queries automatically.
Using a materialized view, the optimizer can compare old and new tables, rewrite queries to
   accelerate processing, and manage maintenance of the materialized view when data updates occur.
   The optimizer can use a materialized view to fully or partially rewrite projections, filters,
   joins, and aggregations.
In Unified Analytics, you can perform the following materialized view operations in either Hive
   or Impala:

Create a materialized view of queries or subqueries
Drop a materialized view
Show materialized views
Describe a materialized view
Enable or disable query rewriting based on a materialized view
Globally enable or disable rewriting based on any materialized view
Use partitioning to improve the performance of materialized views

When you enable BI mode to use Apache DataSketches approximations, a materialized view automatically calls DataSketches for some types of operations.
  

Related informationMaterialized view commandsCreating and using a materialized viewYou can create a materialized view of a query to calculate and store results of an         expensive operation, such as a particular join, on a managed, ACID table that you repeatedly         run. When you issue queries specified by that materialized view, the optimizer rewrites the         query based on it. This action saves reprocessing. Query performance improves.
