Creating roles and synchronizing users to FreeIPA
You must be an EnvironmentAdmin or EnvironmentUser to browse S3 buckets and create
        tables by importing CSV files. You must also synchronize users to FreeIPA. This is required
        for users accessing the Data Lake.

To assign roles to users, see Assigning resource roles to users in the
                    Management Console documentation.
To synchronize users to FreeIPA, see Performing user sync in the Management
                    Console documentation.
