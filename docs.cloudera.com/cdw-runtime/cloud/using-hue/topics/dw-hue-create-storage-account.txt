Creating an Azure storage account
You need an Azure storage account to use ABFS with Hue.

Sign in to the Microsoft Azure portal as an administrator.

On the Create storage account > Advanced page, enable Data Lake Storage Gen2 so
                    that the objects and files within your account can be organized into a hierarchy
                    of directories and nested subdirectories in the same way that the file system on
                    your computer is organized.
