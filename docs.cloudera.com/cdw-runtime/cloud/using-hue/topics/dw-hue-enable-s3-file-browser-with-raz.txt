Enabling the S3 File Browser for Hue in CDW with RAZ
The S3 File Browser in Hue is enabled by default. However, you must set the path to
        your S3 directory in the hue-safety-valve field to avoid a 403 error when you click on the
        S3 File Browser.

Sign in to Cloudera Data Warehouse  DWAdmin or DWUser.

Go to the Virtual Warehouse from which you want to access the S3 buckets and
                    click .

Go to CONFIGURATIONS > Hue and select hue-safety-valve from the
                        Configuration files drop-down menu.

Add the path to your S3 bucket under the [filebrowser] section as
                    follows:

[filebrowser]
remote_storage_home=s3a://[***S3-BUCKET-NAME***]/user

(Optional) Per-user home directories are created by default. To disable
                    automatic user directory creation, you can add the following lines in the
                        hue-safety-valve as follows:

[desktop]
[[raz]]
autocreate_user_dir=false


Click APPLY.
You should be able to view the icon for the S3 File Browser on the left
                    assist panel on the Hue web interface.
