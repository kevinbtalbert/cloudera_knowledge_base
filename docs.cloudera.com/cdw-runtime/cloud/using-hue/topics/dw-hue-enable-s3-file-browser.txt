Enabling the S3 File Browser for Hue in CDW without RAZ
To enable access to S3 buckets from the Hue web interface in a non-RAZ environment,
        you must add the AWS environment details in the hue-safety-valve configuration from your
        Virtual Warehouse. After enabling the S3 File Browser, you can browse the S3 buckets, create
        folders, and upload files from your computer, and import files to create tables.

Sign in to Cloudera Data Warehouse.

Go to the Virtual Warehouse from which you want to access the S3 buckets and
                    click .

On the Virtual Warehouses detail page, click the
                        Hue tab and select
                        hue-safety-valve from the drop-down menu.

Add the following configuration for Hive or Impala Virtual Warehouse in the
                    space provided:
For the Hive Virtual Warehouse:
                    [desktop]
# Remove the file browser from the blocked list of apps.
# Tweak the app_blacklist property to suit your app configuration.
app_blacklist=oozie,search,hbase,security,pig,sqoop,spark,impala

[aws]
[[aws_accounts]]

For Impala Virtual
                    Warehouse:[desktop]
