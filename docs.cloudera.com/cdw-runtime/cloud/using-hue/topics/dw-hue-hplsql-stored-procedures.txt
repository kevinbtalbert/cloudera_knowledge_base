How to run a stored procedure from Hue in Cloudera Data Warehouse
HPL/SQL allows you to implement business logic using variables, expressions,
    flow-of-control statements, and iterations. HPL/SQL makes SQL-on-Hadoop more dynamic. You can
    leverage your existing procedural SQL skills, and use functions and statements to make your
    typical ETL development more productive. In Cloudera Data Warehouse, Hue provides a smart
    interface to run stored procedures.
noteThis feature is available only for Hive queries.
To run stored procedures from Hue, create a Hive Virtual Warehouse in CDW and enable the
      hplsql option in the hue-safety-valve field.
The following example creates a procedure and returns records by passing a
      cursor:print 'Hello world';/
CREATE PROCEDURE greet(name STRING)
BEGIN
  PRINT 'Hello ' || name;
END;/
CREATE PROCEDURE even(cur OUT SYS_REFCURSOR)
BEGIN
  OPEN cur FOR
SELECT n FROM NUMBERS
WHERE MOD(n, 2) == 0;
END;/
CREATE PROCEDURE set_message(IN name STRING, OUT result STRING)
BEGIN
 SET result = 'Hello, ' || name || '!';
END;
-- Call the procedure and print the results
DECLARE str STRING;
CALL set_message('world', str);
PRINT str;
noteIn the hplsql mode, you must terminate the commands
      using the forward slash (/). The semicolon (;) is used throughout procedure declarations and
      can no longer be relied upon to terminate a query in the editor.
noteHPL/SQL does not support all types of Hive statements, such as JOIN or EXPLAIN. Refer to
      the HPL/SQL
        Reference for more information.
