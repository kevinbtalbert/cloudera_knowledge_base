Using Amazon S3 with Hue
Hue can read to and write to an Amazon S3 bucket.
note

In Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), you can browse
   Amazon S3 buckets from Hue in the following ways:
With Ranger Authorization Service (RAZ)
Without Ranger Authorization Service (RAZ)
If you have registered your CDP Public Cloud environment using RAZ, policies attached to the
   Ranger RAZ Service role at the Data Lake-level can control access to external S3 buckets. If your
   Virtual Warehouse predates the capability to use RAZ configurations and policies, then you must
   manually enable RAZ for CDW and then configure Hue to access S3 buckets. Your Data Lake must be
   RAZ-enabled to manually enable RAZ exclusively for CDW.
