Using governance-based data discovery
Hue can use the metadata tagging, indexing, and search features available in Apache
    Atlas data management. After integrating Hue with Atlas,  classifications and indexed entities
    can be accessed and viewed in Hue. This topic shows you how to
    use metadata classifications in Hue.
Integration between Hue and Atlas is enabled by default, but if your administrator has
      disabled it, it must be re-enabled before you can use governance-based data discovery.
In Cloudera Data Warehouse, you can only view tags that are created in Atlas in
      Hue. You must create tags in Atlas.

Searching metadata tagsThe SQL Editor in Hue provides a search text box where you can search on the metadata     tags or classifications that are associated with your databases, tables, and     columns.Parent topic: About using Hue
