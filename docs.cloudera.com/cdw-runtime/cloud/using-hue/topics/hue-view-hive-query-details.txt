Viewing Hive query details
You can search Hive query history, compare two queries, download debug bundles for
  troubleshooting, and view query details, a graphical representation of the query execution plan,
  and DAG information on the Job Browser page in Hue.


Viewing Hive query historyThe Queries tab on the Job Browser page in Hue displays all the queries that were run             on all Hive Virtual Warehouses within a Database Catalog from         various query interfaces, such as Beeline, Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC), Tableau, Hue, and         other JDBC BI clients and tools.Viewing Hive query informationThe Query Info tab provides information such as, the Hive query ID, the user who         executed the query, the start time, the end time, the total time taken to execute the query,         the tables that were read and written, application ID, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) IDs,         session ID, LLAP app ID, thread ID, and the queue against which the query was         run.Viewing explain plan for a Hive queryThe Visual Explain feature provides a graphical representation of the query execution         plan. The Explain plan is read from right to left. It provides details about every stage of         query execution.Viewing Hive query timelineThe Timeline tab provides a visual representation of Hive performance logs and shows         the time taken by each stage of the query execution.Viewing configurations for a Hive queryThe Query Config tab provides the configuration properties and settings that are used         in a Hive query. You can use this tab to verify that configuration property values align         with your expectations.Viewing DAG information for a Hive queryDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG) is created by the Hive engine every time you query the         Hive Virtual Warehouse. The Hive SQL queries are compiled and converted into a Tez execution         graph also known as a DAG. DAG is a collection of vertices where each vertex executes a         fragment of the query or script. Hue provides a web interface to view detailed information         about DAGs.Parent topic: About using Hue
