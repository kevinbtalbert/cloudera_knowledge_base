To submit the Flink job, you need to run the Flink client in the command line         including security parameters and other configurations with the run command.Using Flink CLIYou can use the Flink command line interface to operate, configure and maintain your   Flink applications.Enabling savepoints for Flink applicationsBeside checkpointing, you are also able to create a savepoint of your executed Flink     jobs. Savepoints are not automatically created, so you need to trigger them in case of upgrade     or maintenance. You can also resume your applications from savepoint.
