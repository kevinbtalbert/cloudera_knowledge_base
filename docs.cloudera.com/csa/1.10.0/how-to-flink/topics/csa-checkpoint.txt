Enabling checkpoints for Flink applications
To make your Flink application fault tolerant, you need to enable automatic
    checkpointing. When an error or a failure occurs, Flink will automatically restarts and restores
    the state from the last successful checkpoint. Checkpointing is not enabled by
    default.
While it is possible to enable checkpointing programmatically through the
        StreamExecutionEnvironment, Cloudera recommends to enable checkpointing
      either using the configuration file for each job, or as a default configuration for all Flink
      applications through Cloudera Manager.
To enable checkpointing, you need to set the
        execution.checkpointing.interval configuration option to a value larger
      than 0. It is recommended to start with a checkpoint interval of 10 minutes (600000
      milliseconds).
You can acces the configuration options of checkpointing in Cloudera Manager under the
      Configuration tab.
