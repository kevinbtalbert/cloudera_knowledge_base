Flink Dashboard
The Flink Dashboard is a built-in monitoring interface for Flink applications in
  Cloudera Streaming Analytics. You can monitor your running, completed and stopped Flink jobs on
  the dashboard. You reach the Flink Dashboard through Cloudera Manager.
After deploying Flink and the required components, you can configure and monitor each component
   individually, or the whole cluster with Cloudera Manager. For the general use of Cloudera
   Manager, see the Cloudera Manager documentation.
The Flink Dashboard acts as a single UI for monitoring all the jobs running on the YARN
   cluster. It shows all the running, failed, and finished jobs.noteThe Flink Dashboard is an
    updated version of the Flink HistoryServer.
You can also use the dashboard to navigate between the different Flink clusters from a central
    place.
