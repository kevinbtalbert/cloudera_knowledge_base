Kudu with Flink
Cloudera Streaming Analytics offers Kudu connector as a sink to create analytical
  application solutions. Kudu is an analytic data storage manager. When using Kudu with Flink, the
  analyzed data is stored in Kudu tables as an output to have an analytical view of your streaming
  application.
You can read Kudu tables into a DataStream using the KuduCatalog with Table
   API or using the KuduRowInputFormat directly in the DataStream. The difference
   between the two methods is that when using the KuduRowInputFormat, you need to
   manually provide information about the table.
For more information about the Kudu sink in DataStream API, see the official documentation.
