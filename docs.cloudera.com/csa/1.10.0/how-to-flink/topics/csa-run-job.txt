Running a Flink job
After developing your application, you can submit your Flink job in YARN per-job or
        session mode. To submit the Flink job, you need to run the Flink client in the command line
        including security parameters and other configurations with the run command.

Submitting a job means uploading the job’s JAR and related dependencies to the Flink
                cluster and initiating the job execution.
The Flink jobs you submit to the cluster are running on YARN. Submitting a job means
                that the JAR file of the Flink application is uploaded to the cluster with the
                related dependencies. and the job execution is initiated. You have the following
                mode in which you can run your Flink jobs:
Per-job modePer-job mode means that you run the Flink job in a
                            dedaction YARN application. In this case each submitted Flink job has
                            its own Flink cluster in YARN, with its own Job Manager and Task
                            Managers. When you run Flink jobs in per-job mode, every job submission
                            creates a new cluster. As the cluster deployment has to be created with
                            every submission, the execution of the job can take up time.
Session modeSession mode means that you run multiple Flink jobs in
                            the same YARN sessions. In this case every Flink job shares the cluster,
                            the allocated resources, the Job Manager and Task Managers. When you run
                            Flink jobs in session mode, the submitted jobs are created in one
                            cluster and are long-lived. The execution time is shorter than in
                            per-job mode, however you need to consider that in a session mode a
                            cluster failure affects every Flink job, and recreation from a savepoint
                            can take up time.

You can set how to run your Flink job with the execution.target
                setting in the Flink configuration file. By default,
                    execution.target is set to yarn-per-job, but
                you can change it to yarn-session. Alternatively, you can add the
                corresponding arguments to the flink run command when submitting
                the Flink job.




You have installed and configured the Flink service on your CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.For more
                            information, see the Adding Flink as a service
                            documentation.
You have HDFS Gateway, Flink and YARN Gateway roles assigned to the host you
                        are using for Flink submission.For more information, see the Cloudera Manager
                            documentation.
You have uploaded the Flink application JAR file and job properties file to
                        the Flink cluster.




Connect to the cluster using ssh where you want to run the
                    Flink application.

ssh root@<your_host_name>
noteYou are prompted to provide your password to the cluster.


Submit the Flink job using the flink run command.

note
To run a Flink job, your HDFS Home Directory has to exist. If it does not
                            exist, you receive an error message similar to:
                            Permission denied: user=$USER_NAME, access=WRITE, inode=“/user”
