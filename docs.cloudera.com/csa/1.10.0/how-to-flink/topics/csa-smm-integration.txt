Streams Messaging Manager integration
You can use the Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) UI to monitor end-to-end latency of your
  Flink application when using Kafka as a datastream connector.
End-to-end latency throughout the pipeline can be monitored using SMM. To use SMM with Flink,
   interceptors need to be enabled for Kafka in the Flink connectors.
For more information about enabling interceptors, see the SMM documentation.
