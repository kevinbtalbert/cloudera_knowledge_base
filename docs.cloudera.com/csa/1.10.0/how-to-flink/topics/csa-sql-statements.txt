SQL Statements in Flink
You can use the CREATE / ALTER / INSERT / DROP statements to modify objects in the
  chosen catalog. The statements are executed with the sqlUpdate() method of the
  TableEnvironment.

...
StreamTableEnvironment tableEnv = StreamTableEnvironment.create(env, settings);
tableEnv.sqlUpdate("CREATE TABLE t1(c1 STRING) WITH (...)");
tableEnv.sqlUpdate("DROP TABLE t1");
...



CREATE StatementsYou can use CREATE statements to register database, table, and function objects into     catalogs. You should add the connector, the name of the table, the schema and the data format to     the statement based on your application design. You can further customize your table statement     with computed columns to reflect time in a Flink application.DROP StatementsYou can remove the database, table, and function objects from catalogs with DROP     statements. You should also include the IF EXIST statement beside the DROP statement to avoid     errors due to non existing objects.ALTER StatementsYou can use the ALTER statements to modify already registered databases, tables, and     function definitions in the chosen catalogs. There are different limitations for databases,     tables and functions when altering them.INSERT StatementsData can be inserted into sink tables in various ways. You can use the INSERT clause to         insert the query result into a table, or you can use the VALUE clause to insert data into         tables directly from SQL.Parent topic: Flink SQL and Table API
