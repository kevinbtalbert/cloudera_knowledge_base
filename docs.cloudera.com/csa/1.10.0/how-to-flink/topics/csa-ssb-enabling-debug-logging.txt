Enabling Flink DEBUG logging
You can review the log text files of the Flink jobs when an error is detected during
        the processes. When you set the log level of Flink to DEBUG, you can easily trace the log
        file for errors.

A log file is created for every Flink process that contains messages for the
                different events happening in the given process. You can use these log files to
                solve the errors and problems that can occur during Flink processes. You can access
                the Flink logs using the Flink Dashboard.


Navigate to the Configuration page in Cloudera
                    Manager.

Search for Flink Client Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                        Valve) for flink-conf/log4j.properties configuration.
