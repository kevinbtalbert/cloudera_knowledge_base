Data formats
There is a set of table formats that can be used with the supported connectors of SQL
  Stream Builder (SSB). The data format is a storage format that defines how to map binary data to
  the columns of a table. You can use the data formats based on which connector they are supported
  for.
Adding data formatsWhen adding new data formats to SQL Stream Builder, you need to specify the property         list and must upload the data format JAR file to the Console.
