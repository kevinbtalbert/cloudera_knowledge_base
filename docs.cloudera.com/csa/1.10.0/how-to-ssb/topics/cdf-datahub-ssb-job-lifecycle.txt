SQL jobs

Creating and naming SQL jobsYou need to create or select an already existing SQL job on the Streaming SQL Console to     be able to submit SQL queries.Running SQL Stream jobsEvery time you run an SQL statement in the SQL Stream console, it becomes a job   and runs on the deployment as a Flink job. You can manage the running jobs using the Jobs tab on   the UI.Configuring SQL job settingsIf you need to further customize your SQL Stream job, you can add more advanced     features to configure the job restarting method and time, threads for parallelism, sample     behavior, exactly once processing and restoring from savepoint.Managing session for SQL jobsBy default, the SQL Stream jobs are running in a session cluster. This means that   multiple Flink jobs run in the same YARN session sharing the cluster, allocated resources, the Job   Manager and Task Managers. The session starts when you open the Streaming SQL Console. You can   reset the session, and set the properties of the session using the Streaming SQL   Console.
