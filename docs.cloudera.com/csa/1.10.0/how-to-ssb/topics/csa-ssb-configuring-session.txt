Managing session for SQL jobs
By default, the SQL Stream jobs are running in a session cluster. This means that
  multiple Flink jobs run in the same YARN session sharing the cluster, allocated resources, the Job
  Manager and Task Managers. The session starts when you open the Streaming SQL Console. You can
  reset the session, and set the properties of the session using the Streaming SQL
  Console.
Resetting a session
When you reset your session, every configuration, temporary table and view, default database
    and catalog will be lost.




Configuring properties for a session
You can configure the session properties using the SET statement in the SQL window.

Use the SET statement in the SQL Editor to configure a
          session property.Example:SET state.backend=rocksdbYou can
            review all of the configurable parameters on the Properties tab
            of the Session window.


Click Execute.



Executing SQL jobs in production modeAs by default the SQL jobs are running in a session cluster, there is a risk in case of     a cluster failure that every job is affected within that cluster. However, you can set a per-job     production mode in SQL Stream Builder to create a dedicated environment for your production     jobs.Parent topic: SQL jobs
