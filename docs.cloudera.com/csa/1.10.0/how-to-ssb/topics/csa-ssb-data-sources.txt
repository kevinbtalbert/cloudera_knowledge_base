Registering Data Sources in SSB
Data Sources are a set of data endpoints to be used as sources, sinks and catalogs.
        Data Sources allow you to connect to an already installed component on your cluster, then
        use that provider for adding tables in SQL Stream Builder (SSB).
You can register Kafka as a data source, or Kudu, Hive, Cloudera Schema Registry and
            Confluent Schema Registry as a catalog and you can also add custom catalogs. When
            registering the components, SSB can access the already existing topics from Kafka,
            tables from Kudu and Hive, and the schema in Cloudera Schema Registry and Confluent
            Schema Registry. This also means that when you update a data source, for example add new
            topics, tables and schemas, SSB automatically detects the changes.

Adding Kafka Data SourceYou need to register Kafka as a Data Source using the Streaming SQL Console to         create Kafka tables in SQL Stream Builder (SSB).Adding CatalogsYou need to add Cloudera Schema Registry, Kudu, Hive, Confluent Schema Registry or other services as a Catalog using the Streaming SQL         Console in SQL Stream Builder (SSB) to use them with Flink DDL.
