Example: joining Kafka and Kudu tables
Using lookup join, you can join Kafka and Kudu tables to enrich the streaming data of
  Kafka with information from the Kudu tables. In the this example, Orders of a Kafka streaming
  table are enriched with metadata information from a Kudu table.
As a prerequisite for the example, the following steps were completed in SQL Stream Builder:
Registering Kafka as a Data Source.
Registering Kudu as a Catalog.
Creating Orders Kafka table.
Creating ItemMeta Kudu table.
Generating data for Kafka and Kudu tables.
The tables in the example contain the following information:

Tables
Columns



Kafka - Orders


order_number
price
order_time
item_id




Kudu - ItemMeta


id
info



In the scope of this example, the Orders table will be joined with
   latest version of the ItemMeta table based on the item id,
   and the selected information is sampled under the Results tab of the
   Streaming SQL
   Console:SELECT order_time, item_id, info, price
FROM Orders
JOIN kudu.default_database.ItemMeta FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF PROCTIME()
ON item_id = id
After running the SQL query, the results are continuously sampled to the Streaming SQL Console,
   the rows of order_time, item_id and
    price are enriched with info column from the
    ItemMeta Kudu table:
