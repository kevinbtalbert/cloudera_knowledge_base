Deserialization tab
When creating a Kafka table, you can configure how to handle errors due to schema
    mismatch using DDL or the Kafka wizard.
You can configure every supported type of Kafka connectors (local-kafka, kafka or upsert) how
   to handle if a message fails to deserialize which can result in job submission error. You can
   choose from the following configurations:

Fail
 In this case an exception is thrown, and the job submission fails
Ignore
In this case the error message is ignored without any log, and the job submission is
          successful
Ignore and Log
In this case the error message is ignored, and the job submission is successful
Save to DLQ
In this case the error message is ignored, but you can store it in a dead-letter queue
          (DLQ) Kafka topic

Using the Kafka wizard
When you create the Kafka table using the wizard on the Streaming SQL Console, you can
        configure the error handling with the following steps:
Navigate to the Streaming SQL Console.
Go to your cluster in Cloudera Manager.
Select SQL Stream Builder from the list of services.
Click SQLStreamBuilder Console.

Click Create Job or select a previous job on the
              Getting Started page.You are redirected to the
                Console page.
Select Add tables > Apache Kafka.The Add Kafka table window appears
Select Deserialization tab.


Choose from the following policy options under Deserialization
              Policy:
Fail
Ignore
Ignore and Log
Save to DLQIf you choose the Save to DLQ option, you
                  need to create a dedicated Kafka topic where you store the error message. In this
                  case, you must select the dedicated DLQ topic from DLQ Topic
                    Name.


Click Create and Review.
