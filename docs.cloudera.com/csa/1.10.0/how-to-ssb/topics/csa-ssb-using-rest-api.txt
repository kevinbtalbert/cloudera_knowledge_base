Using SQL Stream Builder REST APICloudera Docs
Using SQL Stream Builder REST API
You can use the REST API to monitor, manage and configure the
      SQL Stream jobs with GET, POST and DELETE HTTP methods. You can use the SQL Stream Builder
      (SSB) REST API in the command line, import them to REST API Tools or by accessing the Swagger
      UI.
The following HTTP methods are available for SSB:
GET to query information about the specified endpoint
POST to create resources for the specified endpoint
PUT to update existing resources for the specified endpoint as a whole
PATCH to partially update existing resources for the specified endpoint
DELETE to remove objects from the specified endpoint

The REST API Reference document
      contains the available endpoints for SQL Stream Builder. However, you can also reach the SSB
      REST API reference document from on the main menu of Streaming SQL Console.


You can use the SSB REST API with Command Line Interface (CLI), you can
   also import the REST API swagger.json file to a REST API Tool, for example
   Postman, and you also have the option to use the REST API with the Swagger User Interface
   (UI).
The Streaming SQL Engine API details the following operations for SQL Stream Builder and
        Flink:
Heartbeat
Admin Operations
User Operations
User Keytab Operations
Data Source Operations
Table Operations
Project Operations
Project Environment Operations
Project Sync Operations
Project Invitation Operations
Project Permission Operations
SQL Operations
SSB Session Operations
Job Operations
Sampling Operations
Flink Job Operations
Flink Session Cluster Operations
Artifact Operations
UDF Artifact Operations
UDF Operations
API Key Operations
Connector Operations
Data Format Operations
Diagnostic Operations
The SSB project-related endpoints can be used with specifying which project the request
      is submitted to by adding the project ID parameter to the endpoint. This means that even
      though a project is selected as the active project on Streaming SQL Console, you can submit
      any request to a different project to which you have access to. The REST API user permissions
      are the same for a project as it is configured on the Members page in a project. The requests
      that are submitted using a specific project ID are submitted as a new session that does not
      interfere with the already existing user sessions in SSB.
Accessing the project ID
You can find the project ID on the homepage of Streaming SQL Console:

 You can also use the GET /api/v2/projects call in CLI to list all
        projects that the user has access to.

Using REST API Tool
When using REST API Tools, you need to connect to the cluster that
        hosts the SQL Stream Builder REST API. You can also use the following URL in a browser to
        download the swagger.json file when you need to manually upload the REST
        API endpoints for a Tool.REST API v1REST API v2http(s)://[***CLUSTER_DOMAIN***]:[***STREAMING_SQL_ENGINE_SERVER_PORT***]/swagger/api-docs/public-v1http(s)://[***CLUSTER_DOMAIN***]:[***STREAMING_SQL_ENGINE_SERVER_PORT***]/swagger/api-docs/public-v2

Using REST API with CLI
When using the SSB REST API with CLI Tool, you need to create the POST or GET commands with
          curl, and also include the Streaming SQL Engine hostname, port and the
        required operation for the endpoint. The submitted commands return the information, or
        complete the process you have requested and display the status in the CLI.
The following examples show a secured and unsecured GET method to list the SQL jobs:
UnsecuredSecured with SPENGOSecured with Knox$ curl -H 'Username: [***YOUR_USERNAME***]' \
       'https://[***STREAMING_SQL-ENGINE_HOST***]:[***STREAMING_SQL_ENGINE_SERVER_PORT***]/api/v1/ssb/jobs'$ kinit [***YOUR_USERNAME***]
$ curl -ik --negotiate -u: \
       'https://[***STREAMING_SQL-ENGINE_HOST***]:[***STREAMING_SQL_ENGINE_SERVER_PORT***]/api/v1/ssb/jobs'$ curl -ik --negotiate -u [***KNOX_USERNAME***[:[***KNOX_PASSWORD***] \
       'https://[***KNOX_HOST***]:[***STREAMING_SQL_ENGINE_SERVER_PORT***]/gateway/cdp-proxy-api/ssb-sse-api/api/v1/ssb/jobs'

noteWhen using the unsecured endpoints, you must provide the Username HTTP header for the
        command as an authentication method to indicate which user sends the request.

Using Swagger UI
You can access the Swagger UI to use the SSB REST API by adding your hostname and the
    Streaming SQL Engine port to the Swagger UI URL.
http(s)://[***CLUSTER_DOMAIN***]:[***STREAMING_SQL_ENGINE_SERVER_PORT***]/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/swagger/api-docs/swagger-config
You can also download the swagger.json for the SSB REST API using the Swagger
    UI.
