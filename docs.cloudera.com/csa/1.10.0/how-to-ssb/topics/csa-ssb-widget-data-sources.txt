Choosing data sources
The data sources are available for visualization as soon as a job sampling is in
  progress or a Materialized View endpoint is created. In both cases, the data is shown in the
  widgets when the corresponding SQL jobs are in running state.
Samples as data source
When using sampling as a data source, you must have a running job on Streaming SQL Console,
    which produces sampling data as the job runs. You can change the default sampling behavior at
    the Job Settings that affects the frequency, count and the sample window
    size of the sampled messages.



Materialized View as data source
When using Materialized View as a data source, you must have a running job with a Materialized
    View query. The Materialized View endpoint is called in a period of time according to the update
    interval and query limit configured for the widget. 
Update interval
The update interval is the time the widgets waits to call from the endpoint.
Query limit
The query limit sets the maximum amount of records to be returned for each call


noteThe data retention configuration that is provided when creating the Materialized
     View affects the results of this data source. For example, when setting the retention for row
     count, the specified number of values will be shown on the widget.If the update interval
    is set to Default, the update interval can be specified on the
     Dashboard after the widget is created. The time selected on the
     Dashboard will be applied to every widget that has
     Default configured for update interval.
