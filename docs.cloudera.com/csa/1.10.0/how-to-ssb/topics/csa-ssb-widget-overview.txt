Using widgets for data visualization
The built-in data visualization tool in SQL Stream Builder (SSB) enables you to present
  the sampling data and the results of the Materialized View query using widgets on Streaming SQL
  Console. As the widgets are integrated into SSB, the visualization tool works out of the box
  without any dependencies, which offers easy access to the underlying, running jobs as data
  sources.
You can use widgets on Streaming SQL Console to visualize data from the samples of a running
   job or from the results of a Materialized View query. Various visualization types and
   configuration options are available to visualize data. Widgets automatically refresh to update
   the visualization based on the data sampled directly from the job output or from Materialized
   Views.

Creating widgetsWidgets can be created on Streaming SQL Console when a SQL query is submitted and the         job is successfully running.Choosing data sourcesThe data sources are available for visualization as soon as a job sampling is in   progress or a Materialized View endpoint is created. In both cases, the data is shown in the   widgets when the corresponding SQL jobs are in running state.Managing data source jobsThe running jobs corresponding to the widgets can be manage from the Widget editor   page.Customizing visualization typesWidgets allow you to choose from a variety of visualization types and customize them   based on your requirements. Each visualization type has general configurations and its own graph   style configuration that can be set when creating the widget. Managing widgets on the DashboardAfter a widget is created, you can customize the layout and control the frequency of the   data update from the Dashboard page.
