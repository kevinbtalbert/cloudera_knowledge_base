Creating new Flink application versions
You need to build new versions of your existing Flink applications by updating the
  Cloudera Streaming Analytics (CSA) dependencies to the latest version.
You need to verify that your new application versions are compatible with the planned CSA
   release. For example, if you build your project with Maven, you need to increment your version
   number in the pom.xml.

Old version: <flink.version>x.x.x-csax.x.x.x</flink.version>
New version:  <flink.version>y.y.y-csay.y.y.y</flink.version>
