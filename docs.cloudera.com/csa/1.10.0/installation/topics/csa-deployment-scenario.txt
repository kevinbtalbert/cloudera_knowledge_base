Deployment scenarios
The application you want to build determines the Streaming Anaytics deployment process
    on CDP Private Cloud Base. You can choose between building either a DataStream application or a
    SQL streaming application.
You can deploy Streaming Analytics on Private Cloud Base depending on the application you
      want to build. 
DataStream application using only Flink. In this case, you need to create a Flink
          application cluster.
SQL Streaming application using Flink with SQL Stream Builder. In this case, you need to
          create a Streaming SQL cluster. 

You can use the following workflow to have an understanding of the deployment process:



Cluster service layout with FlinkIn Cloudera Streaming Analytics (CSA), Flink has mandatory dependencies   with   HDFS, YARN, and Zookeeper. You need to assign the Flink Gateway and HistoryServer roles to the   host, based on the mandatory dependencies.Cluster service layout with SSBIn Cloudera Streaming Analytics (CSA), SQL Stream Builder (SSB) has mandatory   dependencies   with   Flink and Kafka. But due to its dependency with Flink, you also need to add YARN, HDFS and   Zookeeper as a mandatory service on your cluster. You need to assign the SSB roles in the same way   as you assign the Flink roles.Parent topic: Installation
