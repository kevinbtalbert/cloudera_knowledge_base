Setting up your HDFS Home directoryCloudera Docs
Setting up your HDFS Home directory
You need an HDFS Home directory to store temporary logs and data of your application
        to run a Flink job. You must set up the HDFS Home directory for your user to avoid error
        when using Flink.

To run a Flink job, your HDFS Home directory has to exist. If it does not exist, you
                receive an error message similar to the
                following:Permission denied: user=$USER_NAME, access=WRITE, inode=“/user”.


Create HDFS Home directory. Ask your HDFS administrator to perform the
                    following (or obtain HDFS administrator role).
OptionsCommand

kinit hdfs

In case of an enterprise environment, you can use Hue to set up the Home
                        directory by enabling automatic synchronization for users. For more
                        information, see the Cloudera Runtime
                        documentation.
