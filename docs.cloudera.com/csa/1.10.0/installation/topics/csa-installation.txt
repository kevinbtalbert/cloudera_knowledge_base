Installation
You can review the different deployment scenarios for Cloudera Streaming Analytics.
  After you have decided by one of the deployment scenarios, you can start the installation process
  by adding the CSD and Parcel in Cloudera Manager, then adding and configuring Flink and SQL Stream
  Builder (SSB) services.


Deployment scenariosThe application you want to build determines the Streaming Anaytics deployment process     on CDP Private Cloud Base. You can choose between building either a DataStream application or a     SQL streaming application.Installing CSD and ParcelFor installing Cloudera Streaming Analytics (CSA), you need to upload the downloaded         Flink and SQL Stream Builder (SSB) Custom Service Descriptor (CSD) files to the default CSD         directory, and add the CSA parcel to your cluster using Cloudera Manager.Adding Flink as a ServiceYou need to use the Add Service wizard in Cloudera Manager to include the Flink         service on your cluster. When assigning roles, you must install Flink, HDFS, and YARN roles         on the same node from where the Flink jobs are submitted.Configuring Databases for SSBBefore adding SQL Stream Builder (SSB) as a service to your cluster, you need to         manually configure the databases to use SSB. The databases are used to store the metadata         information of the Streaming SQL Engine and the Materialized Views. Adding SSB as a ServiceYou need to use the Add Service wizard in Cloudera Manager to have the SQL Stream         Builder (SSB) service on your cluster.Enabling High Availability for SSBHigh Availability for SQL Stream Builder (SSB) SSB can be enabled using a Load         Balancer. To enable the Load Balancer for SSB after the SSB service is installed, you need         to add the Load Balancer instance to the SSB cluster.
