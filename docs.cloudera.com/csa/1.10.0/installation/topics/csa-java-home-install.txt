Setting the Java executable for the Flink client
To avoid error when using Flink, you must set the Java_home environment manually
        through the command line for the Flink clients. The configuration in Cloudera Manager only
        applies to services, and not to clients.

Cloudera Manager offers a configuration for the JAVA_HOME
                environment variable under Hosts > All Hosts > Configuration. However, this only applies to services (for example YARN NodeManager
                or Flink HistoryServer) and does not propagate to clients such as the JVM created
                locally by the Flink executable. JVM uses the Bigtop utility under
                    /usr/bin/bigtop-detect-javahome to automatically detect the
                    JAVA_HOME.


Set a fixed value for JAVA_HOME:

> cat /etc/default/bigtop-utils
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/default


note
Cloudera recommends providing  the same value  set in Cloudera Manager.
                            It is also recommended to set it uniformly on all the nodes to avoid
                            confusion. This is a known issue in the Cloudera Community.
