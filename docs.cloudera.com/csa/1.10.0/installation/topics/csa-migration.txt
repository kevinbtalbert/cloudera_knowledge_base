Migration
You can migrate your Flink service and SQL jobs to different clusters. When migrating
  the Flink service, you need to resubmit your Flink jobs on the new cluster. For migrating your SQL
  jobs you can use a migration tool in command line or the REST API.


Migrating Flink service to a different hostThe Flink Dashboard role cannot be directly migrated from one host to another. You         need to delete the existing role and add a new one to the host where you want to migrate the         Flink Dashboard role. As Flink has mandatory dependencies for YARN, ZooKeeper and HDFS,         these services should already be on the target host. Migrating SQL jobsYou can migrate your SQL jobs using the SQL Stream Builder (SSB) job migration tool. The     migration tool can be used from Streaming SQL Console, Command Line Interface (CLI) or using the     SSB REST API. The migration tool enables you to export your SQL jobs, and import them to a     different cluster or deployment when needed.
