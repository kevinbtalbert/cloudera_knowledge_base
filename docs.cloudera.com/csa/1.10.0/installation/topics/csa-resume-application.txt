Resuming Flink applications
After updating the Cloudera Streaming Analytics artifacts, you can resume your
  application by the Flink run command. In case you have stopped your application by creating a
  savepoint, you must add the savepoint location to the command.
If you had stopped your Flink applications with a savepoint, you must define the path to the
   savepoint with an additional -s <savepointPath> parameter to the original
    run command.

flink run -d -ynm YarnApplicationName -s <savepointPath> application.jar

To start your stateless applications or stateful applications with an empty application state,
   use the original Flink run command.important
Additional TLS related properties were added to the Gateway role. If you previously enabled
     TLS on your cluster, you can define Gateway TLS/SSL Client Trust Store File and
      Gateway TLS/SSL Client Trust Store Password configurations. You can set
      {{CM_AUTO_TLS}} as the property values when using Auto TLS in Cloudera
     Manager. 


You can verify your settings by running the flink list -yD
      security.ssl.rest.enabled=true command.
