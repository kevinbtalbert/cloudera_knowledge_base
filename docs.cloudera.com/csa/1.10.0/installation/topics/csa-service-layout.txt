Cluster service layout with Flink
In Cloudera Streaming Analytics (CSA), Flink has mandatory dependencies
  with
  HDFS, YARN, and Zookeeper. You need to assign the Flink Gateway and HistoryServer roles to the
  host, based on the mandatory dependencies.
Flink jobs are executed as YARN applications. HDFS is used to store recovery and log data,
   while ZooKeeper is used for high availability coordination for jobs. In a standard layout, an
   Apache Kafka cluster is often located close to the YARN cluster executing the Flink cluster.
The Flink Gateway is collocated with YARN and HDFS Gateways. The Flink HistoryServer is
   collocated with an HDFS role, which can be either an active role or a Gateway. Use the following
   general service layout when collocating Flink roles and dependencies.
