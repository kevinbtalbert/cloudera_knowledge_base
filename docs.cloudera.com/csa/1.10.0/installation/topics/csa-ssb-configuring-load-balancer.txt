Enabling High Availability for SSB
High Availability for SQL Stream Builder (SSB) SSB can be enabled using a Load

Go to your cluster in Cloudera Manager.

Select SQL Stream Builder from the list of
                    services.

Click Actions > Add Role Instances.
The Add Role Instances wizard is displayed.

On the Assign Roles page, click Select hosts for Load Balancer.

Select a host and click OK.
You can add additional SQL Stream Engine and Materialized View Engine servers
                    to boost performance:


Select hosts for SQL Stream Engine.


Select hosts for Materialized View Engine.


Click OK > Continue.



Click Continue.
The newly added hosts are displayed on the Instances tab.

Select all the newly added hosts.

Click Actions for Selected > Start.

Update the Load Balancer URL and Host.


Click Configuration.


Search for load-balancer url.


Provide the host url where the SSB service is installed.








Restart Cloudera Manager.

Access the Streaming SQL Console with Load Balancer.


Go to your cluster in Cloudera Manager.


Select SQL Stream Builder from the list of
                            services.

                                    (recommended).

            load balanced instance of Streaming SQL Console from the SSB service page in Cloudera
            Manager.
