Setting up MySQL/MariaDB database for SSB
After installing MySQL/MariaDB server, you must rename the JDBC connector, and create
        a database with credentials for SQL Stream Builder (SSB) to be able to install the service
        on your cluster. You also must install the MySQL Python connector to integrate with the
        Streaming SQL Engine.
Before you begin
You need to install and configure MySQL or MariaDB based on which one you plan to use,
            before setting up the databases for SSB. To install and configure MySQL or MariaDB, you
            must complete the basic steps mentioned in the Private Cloud Base documentation.

Installing the MySQL JDBC connector


Download the MySQL JDBC Driver from the MySQL website.
Extract the JDBC driver JAR file from the downloaded file with the following
                    command:tar zxvf mysql-connector-java-8.0.27.tar.gz
Rename the JDBC jar file to
                    mysql-connector-java.jar.mv mysql-connector-java-8.0.27-bin.jar mysql-connector-java.jar
Copy the MySQL JDBC jar file to your host.This host must be the same host
                        where you plan to assign the Streaming SQL Engine service role. The service
                        roles are assigned as a next step when installing SQL Stream Builder as a
                        service in Cloudera
                        Manager.scp <location>/mysql-connector-java.jar root@<your_hostname>:You
                        will be prompted to provide your password.
Access the host on your cluster.This host must be the same host where you
                        have added the JDBC jar
                        file.ssh root@<your_hostname>You will be prompted
                        to provide your password.
Copy the MySQL JDBC jar file to /usr/share/java folder using
                    the following
                    command.sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/java
sudo cp <location>/mysql-connector-java.jar /usr/share/java
Check if the MySQL connector is in the folder with ls
                    command.




Creating MySQL/MariaDB database for SSB


Access a host on your cluster.This host must be the same host where you plan
                        to assign the Streaming SQL Engine service role. The service roles are
                        assigned as a next step when installing SQL Stream Builder as a service in
                        Cloudera Manager.ssh root@<your_hostname>You will
                        be prompted to provide your password.
Log in as the root user to
                    MySQL:mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
Create databases for the Streaming SQL
                    Engine:CREATE DATABASE ssb_admin DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
Grant all privileges for the
                    database:GRANT ALL ON ssb_admin.* TO 'ssb_admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
Confirm that you have created the Streaming SQL Engine
                    database:SHOW DATABASES;
