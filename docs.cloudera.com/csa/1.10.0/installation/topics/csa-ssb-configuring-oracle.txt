Setting up Oracle database for SSB
After installing Oracle database server, you must rename the JDBC connector, and
        create a database with credentials for SQL Stream Builder (SSB) before installing the
        service on your cluster. You also must install the Oracle Python connector to integrate with
        the Streaming SQL Engine.
Before you begin
You need to install and configure Oracle database, before setting up the databases for
            SSB. To install and configure Oracle DB, you must complete the basic steps mentioned in
            the Private Cloud Base documentation.

Installing the Oracle JDBC connector


Download the Oracle JDBC Driver from the Oracle website.
Rename the JDBC jar file to
                    oracle-connector-java.jar.mv ojdbc8-19.3.0.0.jar oracle-connector-java.jar
Copy the Oracle JDBC jar file to your host.This host must be the same host
                        where you plan to assign the Streaming SQL Engine service role. The service
                        roles are assigned as a next step when installing SQL Stream Builder as a
                        service in Cloudera
                        Manager.scp <location>/oracle-connector-java.jar root@<your_hostname>:You
                        will be prompted to provide your password.
Access the host on your cluster.This host must be the same host where you
                        have added the JDBC jar
                        file.ssh root@<your_hostname>You will be prompted
                        to provide your password.
Copy the Oracle JDBC jar file to /usr/share/java folder using
                    the following command: 
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/java
sudo cp <location>/oracle-connector-java.jar /usr/share/java
sudo chmod 644 /usr/share/java/oracle-connector-java.jar

Check if the Oracle connector is in the folder with ls
                    command.




Creating Oracle database for SSB



Access a host on your cluster.This host must be the same host where you
                            plan to assign the Streaming SQL Engine service role. The service roles
                            are assigned as a next step when installing SQL Stream Builder as a
                            service in Cloudera
                            Manager.ssh root@<your_hostname>You will be
                            prompted to provide your password.
Log in to the Oracle
                        client:sqlplus system@localhost
Enter password: ******

Create a user and schema for Streaming SQL
                        Engine:create user ssb_admin identified by <password> default tablespace ssb_admin;
grant CREATE SESSION to ssb_admin;
grant CREATE TABLE to ssb_admin;
grant CREATE SEQUENCE to ssb_admin;
grant EXECUTE on sys.dbms_lob to ssb_admin;
Grant a quota on the ssb_admin tablespace where the tables will be
                            created:ALTER USER ssb_admin quota 100m on ssb_admin;You
                            can also create unlimited space with the following
                            command:ALTER USER ssb_admin quota unlimited on ssb_admin;
Confirm that you have created the Streaming SQL Engine and Materialized View
                        Engine database using the \l command.
