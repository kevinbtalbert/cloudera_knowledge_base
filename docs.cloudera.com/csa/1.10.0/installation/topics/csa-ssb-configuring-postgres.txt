Setting up PostgreSQL database for SSB
After installing PostgreSQL server, you must rename the JDBC connector, and create a
        database with credentials for SQL Stream Builder (SSB) before installing the service on your
        cluster. You also must install the PostgreSQL Python connector to integrate with the
        Streaming SQL Engine.
Before you begin
You need to install and configure PostgreSQL, before setting up the databases for SSB. To
            install and configure PostgreSQL, you must complete the basic steps mentioned in the
            Private Cloud Base documentation.

Installing the PostgreSQL JDBC connector


Download the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver from the PostgreSQL website.
Rename the JDBC jar file to
                    postgresql-connector-java.jar.mv postgresql-jdbc.jar postgresql-connector-java.jar
Copy the PostgreSQL JDBC jar file to your host.This host must be the same
                        host where you plan to assign the Streaming SQL Engine service role. The
                        service roles are assigned as a next step when installing SQL Stream Builder
                        as a service in Cloudera
                        Manager.scp <location>/postgresql-connector-java.jar root@<your_hostname>:You
                        will be prompted to provide your password.
Access the host on your cluster.This host must be the same host where you
                        have added the JDBC jar
                        file.ssh root@<your_hostname>You will be prompted
                        to provide your password.
Copy the PostgreSQL JDBC jar file to /usr/share/java folder
                    using the following
                    command:sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/java
sudo cp <location>/postgresql-connector-java.jar /usr/share/java
Check if the PostgreSQL connector is in the folder with ls
                    command.




Creating PostgreSQL database for SSB



Access a host on your cluster.This host must be the same host where you
                            plan to assign the Materialized Views Engine and Streaming SQL Engine
                            service role. The service roles are assigned as a next step when
                            installing SQL Stream Builder as a service in Cloudera
                            Manager.ssh root@<your_hostname>You will be
                            prompted to provide your password.
Connect to PostgreSQL:sudo -u postgres psql
Create a database for the SQL Stream Builder
                        metadata:CREATE ROLE ssb_admin LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>';
CREATE DATABASE ssb_admin OWNER ssb_admin ENCODING 'UTF8';

Create a database for the Materialized View
                        Engine:CREATE ROLE ssb_mve LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>';
CREATE DATABASE ssb_mve OWNER ssb_mve ENCODING 'UTF8';
Confirm that you have created the Streaming SQL Engine and Materialized View
                        Engine database using the \l command.
