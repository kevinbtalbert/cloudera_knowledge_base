Migrating SQL jobs
You can migrate your SQL jobs using the SQL Stream Builder (SSB) job migration tool. The
    migration tool can be used from Streaming SQL Console, Command Line Interface (CLI) or using the
    SSB REST API. The migration tool enables you to export your SQL jobs, and import them to a
    different cluster or deployment when needed.
You can migrate your SQL jobs using the Streaming SQL Console, the API Explorer or the SSB
      migration tool from CLI. The migration process consists of exporting and importing the details
      of the SQL job. No matter which migration option you choose, the underlying process is the
      same as both solutions are based on calling the SSB REST API endpoints. However, when using
      the API Explorer, you need to manual copy and paste the job details between the endpoints. The
      Streaming SQL Console and the migration tool in CLI automatically take care of accessing this
      information.
The following details of the SQL jobs can be exported and imported:
SQL statement executed in the jobWhen importing a SQL job under a different team,
            avoid using the simple names of the tables as it can cause unexpected behavior. The
            tables used for the query are exported with fully qualified names.
Tables and views used in the query. This include the DDL and the tables that are in the
          SSB catalogsWhen importing a SQL job, the tables and views are not created if there are
            tables and views with the same name already in the database. The tables and views that
            reference each other also need to be in topological order, so that the tables are only
            referenced when they are created.
Table names of the external catalogs used in the queryThe external catalogs need to
            be registered before importing the SQL job.
Names and SQL statements of the Java User-Defined Functions (UDFs)The Java jars need
            to be uploaded manually before importing the SQL job.
Names and implementations of the Javascript UDFs
Details of the Materialized Views
noteJob settings, advanced configurations, job notifications, UDF jars and Materialized
        View queries are not exported.
Before migrating your SQL jobs, you need to stop the job if it is in a running state. To stop
      the SQL job you can use the Stop button either under the SQL window on
      the Compose page, or next to the running job on the SQL Jobs tab. Make a note of the SQL job
      name as you need to provide it for the job migration.
Streaming SQL ConsoleAPI ExplorerCLI

You can import and export your SQL jobs using Streaming SQL Console. 
The Import Job button can be found on the Getting
              Started page or on the Console page using   button.
            After clicking on the Import Job button, you need to choose the
            SQL job file, and provide a chosen name for it if needed. The selected SQL job is
            imported to the Streaming SQL Console.
The Export as JSON button can be found on the
              Console page or the SQL Jobs page using
              
            button. The JSON file is automatically saved in your downloads folder and named as the
            job.

Access the API Explorer.
Click API Explorer on the main menu of Streaming SQL
              Console.

Open the GET/api/v1/ssb/jobs/{jobsName} operation.
Paste the copied job name to jobName.
Provide your username.
Click Execute.The details about the job is exported, and
            returned in a JSON string. To import the job, you need to copy the JSON detail and add
            it to the POST request.
Copy the JSON string.
Open the POST/api/v1/ssb/jobs/{jobsName} operation.
Provide a job name.
Provide your username.
Click Execute.The job is imported to the Streaming SQL
            Console, and is listed under the SQL jobs tab with a stopped
            status.

Connect to your cluster using ssh.
Use the following command to export the
          job:ssb-migration-tool -u <ssb_username> -pw <ssb_password> -api <api_base_url> -o job-export -j <jobname> -f <target_filename>
Use the following command to import the
            job:ssb-migration-tool -u <ssb_username> -pw <ssb_password> -api <api_base_url> -o job-import -j <jobname> -f <source_filename>Example:ssb-migration-tool -u test_user -pw test_password -api http://csa-test-1.vpc.cloudera.com:18121/api/v1 -o job-export -j gallant_keller -f export.jsonThe
            job is imported to the Streaming SQL Console, and is listed under the SQL
              jobs tab with a stopped status.
