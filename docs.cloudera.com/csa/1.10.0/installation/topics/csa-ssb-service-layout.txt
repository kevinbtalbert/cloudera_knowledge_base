Cluster service layout with SSB
In Cloudera Streaming Analytics (CSA), SQL Stream Builder (SSB) has mandatory
  dependencies
  with
  Flink and Kafka. But due to its dependency with Flink, you also need to add YARN, HDFS and
  Zookeeper as a mandatory service on your cluster. You need to assign the SSB roles in the same way
  as you assign the Flink roles.
