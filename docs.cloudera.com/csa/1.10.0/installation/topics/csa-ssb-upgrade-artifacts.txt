Upgrading CSA artifacts for SQL Stream Builder service
You need to upgrade the Cloudera Streaming Analytics (CSA) artifacts to the newer
        version by manually deleting the old CSD file from the repository, deactivating the old
        parcel and installing the latest CSD file and parcel.

noteThe CDH version in the CSD and parcel filenames reflect the latest supported
                version of CDP Private Cloud Base. The version in the filename does not indicate
                that CSA is supported only on that version. For more information about the list of
                supported CDP Private Cloud Base versions for CSA, see the Cloudera Support Matrix.


Stop the SQL Stream Builder service on your cluster.


Go to your cluster in Cloudera Manager.


Select SQL Stream Builder from the list of
                            services.


Click Action > Stop.



Download the new CSD files from the Download location.

Delete the old CSD version from /opt/cloudera/csd.


Access the host where the CSD is stored.

ssh root@<hostname>
cd /opt/cloudera/csd
rm FLINK-1.15.1-csa1.9.0.0-cdh7.1.8.0-801-38169064.jar
rm SQL_STREAM_BUILDER-1.15.1-csa1.9.0.0-cdh7.1.8.0-801-38169064.jar




Copy the new artifacts to the /opt/cloudera/csd folder.

warningThe upgrade process fails if you only add the new parcel
                        file in Cloudera Manager. You must add the Flink and SSB CSD to the
                            /opt/cloudera/csd folder as well.


scp <download_location>/FLINK-1.16.1-csa1.10.0.0-cdh7.1.8.0-801-41959971.jar root@<hostname>/opt/cloudera/csd:
scp <download_location>/SQL_STREAM_BUILDER-1.16.1-csa1.10.0.0-cdh7.1.8.0-801-41959971.jar root@<hostname>/opt/cloudera/csd:


Ensure that you maintain the appropriate file ownership and access the
                    attributes if needed.

chown cloudera-scm:cloudera-scm /opt/cloudera/csd/FLINK-1.16.1-csa1.10.0.0-cdh7.1.8.0-801-41959971.jar
chown cloudera-scm:cloudera-scm /opt/cloudera/csd/SQL_STREAM_BUILDER-1.16.1-csa1.10.0.0-cdh7.1.8.0-801-41959971.jar


Restart the Cloudera Manager Server with the following command:


RHEL 7 Compatible, SLES 12, Ubuntu: systemctl restart
                                cloudera-scm-server
RHEL 6 Compatible: service cloudera-scm-server
                            restart



Restart the Cloudera Management Services.


When upgrading from versions lower than CSA 1.7.0:
Due to the backend changes of SSB, after adding the new CSD, the SSB
                                service will not work which is indicated in the list of services in
                                the following way: 

 The following error message is displayed when reviewing the
                                configuration issue: 

 This means that you need to manually remove the Streaming SQL
                                Console role, and restart the Streaming SQL Engine role after

noteMake sure that the Remote Parcel Repository URL uses HTTPS link. To
                        install a different version of the parcel, you can change the URL as
                        needed.


Click Save & Verify Configuration to commit the
                    change.

Click Close.
