Upgrading Flink service
To upgrade the Flink service to the latest version in Cloudera Streaming Analytics, you
  need to create new application versions, stop your Flink applications with savepoint, upgrade the
  CSA artifacts and resume your Flink applications from savepoint.
Creating new Flink application versionsYou need to build new versions of your existing Flink applications by updating the   Cloudera Streaming Analytics (CSA) dependencies to the latest version.Stopping Flink applications You must stop your Flink applications before updating the artifacts. You can use the         stop command to create a savepoint of your application. You can also use the cancel command         to stop your Flink application without creating a savepoint.Upgrading CSA artifacts for Flink serviceYou need to upgrade the Cloudera Streaming Analytics (CSA) artifacts to the newer         version by manually deleting the old CSD file from the repository, and adding the latest CSD         file to the same location.Resuming Flink applicationsAfter updating the Cloudera Streaming Analytics artifacts, you can resume your   application by the Flink run command. In case you have stopped your application by creating a   savepoint, you must add the savepoint location to the command.Parent topic: Upgrade
