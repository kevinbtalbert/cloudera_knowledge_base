Stopping Flink applications
 You must stop your Flink applications before updating the artifacts. You can use the
        stop command to create a savepoint of your application. You can also use the cancel command
        to stop your Flink application without creating a savepoint.

You can use savepoints to resume the application state after the upgrade.


Determine the related Flink job IDs.

Stop your Flink applications.
You have two choices:
Stop your applications with a savepoint to store the application state.
flink stop <Flink job ID>
The command returns an HDFS path, which is the automatically
                                created savepoint that stores the application state.
Cancel your applications without creating a savepoint.
flink cancel <Flink job ID>
Use this method if you do not need to restore the application
                                state after the upgrade.
