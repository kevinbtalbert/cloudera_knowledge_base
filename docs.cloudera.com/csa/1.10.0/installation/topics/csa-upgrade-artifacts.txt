Upgrading CSA artifacts for Flink service
You need to upgrade the Cloudera Streaming Analytics (CSA) artifacts to the newer
        version by manually deleting the old CSD file from the repository, and adding the latest CSD
        file to the same location.

Download the new CSD files from the Download location.
In case you are upgrading to the latest CSA version that includes SQL Stream
                    Builder (SSB), you also must download the SSB CSD, and add it to the
                        /opt/cloudera/csd folder with the new Flink CSD. For more
                    information, see the Installing parcel and CSD
                    documentation.

Delete the old CSD version from /opt/cloudera/csd.

Copy the new artifacts to the /opt/cloudera/csd folder.

warningThe upgrade process fails if you only add the new parcel
                        file in Cloudera Manager. You must add the Flink and SSB CSD to the
                            /opt/cloudera/csd folder as well.


Ensure that you maintain the appropriate file ownership and access the
                    attributes if needed.

Restart the Cloudera Manager Server with the following command:


RHEL 7 Compatible, SLES 12, Ubuntu: systemctl restart
                                cloudera-scm-server
RHEL 6 Compatible: service cloudera-scm-server
                            restart



Restart the Cloudera Management Services.

Select Parcels on the Home > Hosts
                    tab in the Cloudera Manager main navigation bar.

Click on Parcel Repositories & Network Settings
                    tab.

Add the new Remote Parcel Repository URL for CSA.

https://user:password@archive.cloudera.com/p/csa/1.10.0.0/parcels/


noteMake sure that the Remote Parcel Repository URL uses HTTPS link. To
                        install a different version of the parcel, you can change the URL as
                        needed.


Click Save & Verify Configuration to commit the
                    change.

Click Close.
You are redirected to the Parcels
                    page.

Deactivate the old version of the parcel on the Parcels
                    page.

Download, activate and distribute the new version of the parcel.

Restart the Flink service when prompted in the wizard.
