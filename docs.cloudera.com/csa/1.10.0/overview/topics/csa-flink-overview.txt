What is Apache Flink?
Flink is a distributed processing engine and a scalable data analytics framework. You
        can use Flink to process data streams at a large scale and to deliver real-time analytical
        insights about your processed data with your streaming application. 
Flink is designed to run in all common cluster environments, perform computations at
            in-memory speed and at any scale. Furthermore, Flink provides communication, fault
            tolerance, and data distribution for distributed computations over data streams. A large
            variety of enterprises choose Flink as a stream processing platform due to its ability
            to handle scale, stateful stream processing, and event time.
