What's new in Cloudera Streaming Analytics
Cloudera Streaming Analytics 1.10.0 covers new features
  beside the core streaming functionality of Apache Flink and SQL Stream Builder.

Rebase to Apache Flink 1.16
Apache Flink 1.16 is supported in Cloudera Streaming Analytics 1.10.0.For more
            information on what is included in the Apache Flink 1.16 version, see the Apache Flink 1.16 Release Post and the Apache Flink 1.16 Release Notes
Built-in Data Visualization tool
The built-in data visualization tool in SQL Stream Builder (SSB) enables you to present the
          sampling data and the results of the Materialized View query using widgets on Streaming
          SQL Console. As the widgets are integrated into SSB, the visualization tool works out of
          the box without any dependencies, which offers easy access to the underlying, running jobs
          as data sources.
For more information, see the Using widgets for data visualization documentation.
Schema Handling
Cloudera Schema Registry catalog can now handle key schemas as well based on the provided
          key (and value) schema name suffix for custom naming convention.
For more information, see the Adding Catalogs
          documentation.
PyFlink Support
Python API for Flink is supported in Cloudera Streaming Analytics that enables you to
          create Flink DataStream applications using Python.
For more information, see the Application development and Job lifecycle documentation.
