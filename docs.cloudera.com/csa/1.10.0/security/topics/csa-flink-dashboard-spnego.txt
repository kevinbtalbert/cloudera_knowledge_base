Providing user credentials for flink list
The Flink CLI uses the Flink Dashboard when you use the flink list command.
    In this case, the Flink CLI connects to the Flink Dashboard and lists the running and scheduled
    applications. The connection between the CLI and Dashboard requires user credentials for the
    SPNEGO authentication.
The following methods can be used to provide the user credentials:
You can use the kinit command and the custom ticket cache file:
Connect to your host using
         ssh.ssh root@<your_hostname>You
         are prompted to provide your password.
Run the kinit command to obtain a valid TGT.
kinit <your_principal>

In this case, the flink list command reads the TGT from the default
      ticket cache file of the user.noteWhen you need to use custom ticket cache file, you must
       set the path of the cache
       directory:KRB5CCNAME=/path/to/custom/ticket/cache
You can provide the keytab file and login principals directly to the flink list command:
Connect to your host using
         ssh.ssh root@<your_hostname>You
         are prompted to provide your password.
Run the flink list command using your keytab information:
flink list -yD security.kerberos.login.keytab=<your_keytab_file_name> -yD security.kerberos.login.principal=<your_principal>
