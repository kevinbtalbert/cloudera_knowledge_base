Authentication in SSB
You can authenticate users to access the Streaming SQL Console using Kerberos or Knox
  authentication.
On an non-Kerberized cluster, you need to register a new account to access the SSB Console.
   Provide a Username, Password, and your
    First Name and Last Name to create an account.


After creating an account, you can log in to the Streaming SQL Console by providing the
   registered Username and Password.

noteYou can later change your password by clicking on your
     username on the main menu of Streaming SQL Console, and by selecting the
     Profile tab.



Enabling Kerberos authenticationYou need to enable Kerberos authentication in Cloudera Manager as well as directly for   your browser to securely reach the Streaming SQL Console, and to use Knox   authentication.Enabling Knox authenticationYou can use Knox authentication for SQL Stream Builder (SSB) to provide integration with     customer Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions. Knox uses Kerberos (SPNEGO) to strongly authenticate     itself towards the services.Uploading or unlocking your keytabAfter setting Kerberos or Knox authentication for SSB, you             need to unlock the user specific keytabs on the Streaming SQL Console by providing your             keytab password or uploading the keytab file. You cannot submit jobs until the keytab             stays locked.Parent topic: Securing SQL Stream Builder
