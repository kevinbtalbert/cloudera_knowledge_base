Enabling TLS for database connection

noteWhen you are using Auto-TLS the configuration for the Database TLS connection is not
            enabled automatically.
You can enable encrypted communication between SSB and the configured databases using
        the Database connection property in Cloudera Manager.

Go to your cluster in Cloudera Manager.

Click SQL Stream Builder from the list of
                    services.

Select Configuration tab.

Add database_tls_connection to the Search box.






Select Database TLS connection to enable encryption for
                    the databases.

Click Save changes.

Restart the SQL Stream Builder service.


Click Action > Restart next to the SQL Stream Builder service name.



Encrypted communication is enabled between SSB and the configured
            databases.
You must rotate the Certificate Authority and Host Certificates to update the
            security requirements of your cluster. For more information, see the Rotate Auto-TLS Certificate Authority and Host
                Certificates in Cloudera Manager documentation.
