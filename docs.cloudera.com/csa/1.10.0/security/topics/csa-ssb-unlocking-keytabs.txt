Uploading or unlocking your keytab
After setting Kerberos or Knox authentication for SSB, you
            need to unlock the user specific keytabs on the Streaming SQL Console by providing your
            keytab password or uploading the keytab file. You cannot submit jobs until the keytab
            stays locked.

Navigate to the Streaming SQL Console.


Go to your cluster in Cloudera Manager.


Select SQL Stream Builder from the list of services.


Click SQLStreamBuilder Console.
The Streaming SQL Console opens in a new window.



Click your username on the sidebar of the Streaming SQL
                    Console.

Click Manage keytab.
The Keytab Manager window appears.
You can either unlock the keytab already existing on the cluster, or you can
                    directly upload your keytab file in the SQL Stream Builder.


Unlock your keytab by providing the Principal
                                Name and Password, and clicking
                                Unlock Keytab. The Principal Name and
                            Password should be the same as the workload username and password set
                            for the Streaming Analytics cluster.







Upload your keytab by clicking on the Upload
                            tab, uploading the keytab file directly to the Console, and clicking
                                Unlock Keytab.
