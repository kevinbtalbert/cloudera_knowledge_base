Configuring custom Kerberos principal for SQL Stream Builder
The Kerberos principal for SQL Stream Builder is configured by default to use the
        same service principal as the default process user. However, you can change the default
        setting by providing a custom principal in Cloudera Manager. 

importantCloudera Manager configures
            CDP services to use the default Kerberos principal names. Cloudera recommends that you
            do not change the default Kerberos principal names. If it is unavoidable to do so,
            contact Cloudera Professional Services because it requires extensive additional custom
            configuration.


Go to your Cluster in Cloudera Manager.

Select SQL Stream Builder from the list of
                    services.

Go to the Configuration tab.

Search for the Kerberos principal by entering kerberos
                    in the search field.

Provide a custom name to the Kerberos Principal
                    property.

Click Save Changes.

Click Actions > Restart next to the SQL Stream Builder
                    service name to restart the service
