Limitations
Learn about the limitations, and the impacts or changes to the functionality of
    components in Cloudera Stream Processing (CSP) Community Edition.
importantCSP Community Edition is an unsecured deployment of Cloudera Streams
      Messaging and Streaming Analytics. The security features available in Apache Kafka, Apache
      Flink, SQL Stream Builder, Schema Registry, and Streams Messaging Manager are not supported.
      In addition, support services are not provided for the Community Edition. As a result, CSP
      Community Edition is not meant for the requirements to be used in production.
Streams Messaging

Kafka
Kafka producers have a quota of 100000 bytes per second. This means that producers get
            throttled if they reach this threshold.
Schema Registry
Schema Registry is limited to a maximum of 50 schemas.


Streaming Analytics

SQL Stream Builder


Only 3 SQL jobs can be run simultaneously.
Hive catalog is not supported.
