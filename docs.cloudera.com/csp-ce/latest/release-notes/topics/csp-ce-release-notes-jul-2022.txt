What's new in CSP Community Edition July 2022.
This is the GA release of CSP Community Edition.
The Community Edition of CSP makes developing stream processors easy as it can be done right
      from your desktop or any other development node. Analysts, data scientists, and developers can
      now evaluate new features, develop SQL-based stream processors locally using SQL Stream
      Builder powered by Flink, and develop Kafka Consumers/Producers and Kafka Connect Connectors,
      all locally before moving to production.
