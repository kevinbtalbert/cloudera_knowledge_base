Linux
The Community Edition should run on any Linux distribution that has a working docker and
     docker-compose installation. No configuration changes are typically required.
MacOS/Windows
MacOS and Windows users should use Docker Desktop to run SQL Stream Builder.noteThe CSP
      Community Edition runs on both x86 and Apple Silicon architecture.
By default, Docker Desktop limits resources to containers. To run SQL Stream Builder, you
     need to select Docker -> Preferences, and increase the memory and CPU allocations.
