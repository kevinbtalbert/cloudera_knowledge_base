Service Triggers
The configured triggers for this service. This is a JSON-formatted list of
                triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health system. Every trigger
                expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions
                provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:
triggerName
(mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the
                    specific service. 
triggerExpression
(mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. 
streamThreshold
(optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition
                    of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream
                    returned causes the condition to fire. 
enabled
 (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is
                    not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig
 (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger
                    should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can
                    lead to inconsistencies.
For example, the followig JSON formatted trigger fires if there are more than
                10 DataNodes with more than 500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName":
                  "sample-trigger", "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType =
                  DataNode and last(fd_open) > 500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 10,
                  "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details
                on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change
                and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

                Each cluster has to be added in a new line, if cluster has multiple nodes, add all
                nodes to the same line and delimit each with a comma. Cluster replication pairs can
                be defined as follows: 'primary->backup.enabled=true'.. Each unique replication pair

Streams Replication Manager Driver TLS/SSL Client Trust Store File
The location on disk of the trust store, in .jks format, used to confirm the
                authenticity of TLS/SSL servers that Streams Replication Manager Driver might
                connect to. This is used when Streams Replication Manager Driver is the client in a
                TLS/SSL connection. This trust store must contain the certificate(s) used to sign
                the service(s) connected to. If this parameter is not provided, the default list of
                well-known certificate authorities is used instead.

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of
                triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health system. Every trigger
                expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions
                provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:
triggerName
(mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the
                    specific role. 
triggerExpression
(mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. 
streamThreshold
(optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition
                    of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream
                    returned causes the condition to fire. 
enabled
 (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is
                    not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig
 (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger
                    should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can
                    lead to inconsistencies.
For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode
                fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors
                  opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger", "triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT
                  fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad",
                  "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules
                documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON
                format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not

Cgroup CPU Shares
Number of CPU shares to assign to this role. The greater the number of shares,
                the larger the share of the host's CPUs that will be given to this role when the
                host experiences CPU contention. Must be between 2 and 262144. Defaults to 1024 for
                processes not managed by Cloudera Manager.

Cgroup I/O Weight
Weight for the read I/O requests issued by this role. The greater the weight,
                the higher the priority of the requests when the host experiences I/O contention.
                Must be between 100 and 1000. Defaults to 1000 for processes not managed by Cloudera
                Manager.

Cgroup Memory Hard Limit
Hard memory limit to assign to this role, enforced by the Linux kernel. When
                the limit is reached, the kernel will reclaim pages charged to the process. If
                reclaiming fails, the kernel may kill the process. Both anonymous as well as page
                cache pages contribute to the limit. Use a value of -1 to specify no limit. By
                default processes not managed by Cloudera Manager will have no limit. If the value
                is -1, Cloudera Manager will not monitor Cgroup memory usage therefore some of the
                charts will show 'No Data'

Cgroup Memory Soft Limit
Soft memory limit to assign to this role, enforced by the Linux kernel. When
                the limit is reached, the kernel will reclaim pages charged to the process if and
                only if the host is facing memory pressure. If reclaiming fails, the kernel may kill
                the process. Both anonymous as well as page cache pages contribute to the limit. Use
                a value of -1 to specify no limit. By default processes not managed by Cloudera
                Manager will have no limit. If the value is -1, Cloudera Manager will not monitor
                Cgroup memory usage therefore some of the charts will show 'No Data'

Streams Replication Manager Service TLS/SSL Client Trust Store File
The location on disk of the trust store, in .jks format, used to confirm the
                authenticity of TLS/SSL servers that Streams Replication Manager Service might
                connect to. This is used when Streams Replication Manager Service is the client in a
                TLS/SSL connection. This trust store must contain the certificate(s) used to sign
                the service(s) connected to. If this parameter is not provided, the default list of
                well-known certificate authorities is used instead.

                available for those roles that have an HTTP server endpoint exposing the current
                stacks traces of all threads. When the servlet method is selected, that HTTP
