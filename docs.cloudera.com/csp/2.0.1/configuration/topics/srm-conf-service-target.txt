Configuring the Service Role Target Cluster
Learn about the Streams Replication Manager Service role target cluster and how to
    configure it.

The Streams Replication Manager Service role consists of a REST API and a Kafka Streams
        application that aggregates and exposes cluster, topic, and consumer group metrics. With the
        help of these metrics, users can monitor replications. The service can only be installed on
        one host per cluster.
Each instance of the service is associated with a single target cluster. The target is the
        cluster that the service gathers and exposes metrics from. Because each instance of the
        service can only target and expose metrics from a single cluster, monitoring multiple
        clusters requires the deployment of multiple instances of the service.
The target cluster of the service is configured with the streams replication
          manager service target cluster property. The property accepts any cluster
        alias that is specified in Streams Replication Manager Cluster alias.
        as long as data is being replicated to that cluster. Configuring a service target is
        mandatory.


In Cloudera Manager select Streams Replication Manager. Go to Configuration.Find the streams
                replication manager service target cluster property. Add the target cluster alias. For
              example: 
secondary
Enter a Reason for change, and then click Save
            Changes to commit the changes.
Restart Streams Replication Manager.

The service target is set. The service gathers and exposes metrics from the
      specified cluster.
