Cross Data Center Replication of Multiple Clusters
Configuration example with three data centers that have two Kafka clusters
    each.

In more advanced deployments, you may have multiple Kafka clusters in each of several data
        centers. To prevent creating a fully-connected mesh of all Kafka clusters, Cloudera
        recommends leveraging a single Kafka cluster in each data center for cross data center
        replication. 
This example demonstrates the steps required to configure a deployment with three data
        centers that each have two Kafka clusters. Additionally, it also provides example commands
        to start bidirectional replication of all topics within each data center and an example on
        how to replicate a single topic across all data centers.

          Clusters
The steps shown here have to be carried out on all clusters in a given
          deployment. Configuration properties presented in Steps 3-5 are configured identically on
          all clusters. The configuration property presented in Step 7 will differ for each
          cluster.
noteThe following list of steps assume that the Streams Replication Manager
        Service role is running on 1 host on each cluster and is targeting the cluster it is running
        on.


In Cloudera Manager select Streams Replication Manager. Go to Configuration.Specify cluster aliases:
          
Find the Streams Replication Manager
                Cluster alias. property.
Add a comma
              delimited list of cluster aliases. For example:
west1, west2, east1, east2, south1, south2
Cluster aliases are arbitrary names
              defined by the user. Aliases specified here are used in other configuration properties
              and with the srm-control tool to refer to the clusters added for
              replication.
Specify cluster connection
          information:
Find the
                streams.replication.manager's replication configs
              property.
Click the add button and add new lines
              for each cluster alias you have specified in the Streams Replication
                Manager Cluster alias. property
Add connection information for your
              clusters. For example:
west1.bootstrap.servers=west1_host1:9092,west1_host2:9092,west1_host3:9092
west2.bootstrap.servers=west2_host1:9092,west2_host2:9092,west2_host3:9092

east1.boostrap.servers=east1_host1:9092,east1_host2:9092,east1_host3:9092
east2.boostrap.servers=east2_host1:9092,east2_host2:9092,east2_host3:9092

south1.boostrap.servers=south1_host1:9092,south1_host2:9092,south1_host3:9092
south2.boostrap.servers=south2_host1:9092,south2_host2:9092,south2_host3:9092

Each cluster has to be added to a new line. If a cluster has multiple hosts, add
                them to the same line but delimit them with commas.

Add and enable
          replications:
Find the
                streams.replication.manager's replication configs
              property.
Click the add button and add new lines
              for each unique replication you want to add and enable.
Add and enable your replications. For example:
Enable cross data center replication by adding the following replications:
west1->east1.enabled=true
west1->south1.enabled=true
east1->west1.enabled=true
east1->south1.enabled=true
south1->west1.enabled=true
south1->east1.enabled=true

Enable bidirectional replication within each data center by adding the following
                replications:
west1->west2.enabled=true
west2->west1.enabled=true
east1->east2.enabled=true
east2->east1.enabled=true
south1->south2.enabled=true
south2->south1.enabled=true

          Streams Replication Manager Driver role instances to all Kafka broker
          hosts:
Go to
                Instances.
Click Add Role
                Instances.
Click Select
                Hosts.
Select all Kafka broker hosts
              and click Ok.
Click
                Continue.
Find the streams
                replication manager driver target cluster property.
Add the cluster aliases that you want
              the driver role to target. For
              example:

In the west data center:west1, west2
In the east data center: east1, east2
In the south data center:south1, south2


The streams replication
                manager driver target cluster property allows you to specify which
              clusters the driver should write to. In this example, the drivers read data from all
              clusters, but only write to the cluster they are running on. This allows you to
              distribute replication workloads.
Click
                Continue.

Restart Streams Replication Manager.
Replicate topics between hosts within each data center:
srm-control topics --source west1 --target west2 --add ".*"
srm-control topics --source west2 --target west1 --add ".*"
srm-control topics --source east1 --target east2 --add ".*"
srm-control topics --source east2 --target east1 --add ".*"
srm-control topics --source south1 --target south2 --add ".*"
srm-control topics --source south2 --target south1 --add ".*"
Replicate topic1 across all data centers:
srm-control topics --source west1 --target east1 --add topic1,west2.topic1

srm-control topics --source west1 --target south1 --add topic1,west2.topic1
srm-control topics --source east1 --target west1 --add topic1,east2.topic1
srm-control topics --source east1 --target south1 --add topic1,east2.topic1
srm-control topics --source south1 --target west1 --add topic1,south2.topic1
srm-control topics --source south1 --target east1 --add topic1,south2.topic1
