Configure Apache Kafka for SMM
After you have installed and configured Apache Kafka, you must set one configuration
        parameter to enable Kafka and SMM to communicate.


You have installed Apache Kafka either by installing CDH 6.3.0 or later, or by
                    using the CDK 4.1 parcel to install Apache Kafka onto CDH 5.13.0 or later.
You have configured Kafka according to your use case needs. Use the information
                    available in Apache Kafka Administration to configure Kafka as
                    needed.



Select Kafka from your cluster drop-down, and then select the
                        Configuration tab.

Ensure that the Enable Producer Metrics check box is
                    selected.
