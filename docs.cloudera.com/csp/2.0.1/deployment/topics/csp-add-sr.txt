Add and Configure Schema Registry


From the Cloudera Manager Home page, select the
                    drop-down to the right of your cluster, and select Add a
                        Service and select Schema Registry.
                    You may install one service at a time.

If you updated the JDK in the Prepare your environment section of
                    this document, ensure that you also update the Java Home Path
                        Override field in the Cloudera Manager configuration. 

Specify the Jar Storage Type. 

Your options
                            are:
Local
HDFS

For example:
schema.registry.jar.storage.type=local


Configure the Registry Storage properties, based on the database you created to
                    use as the Schema Registry metadata store. 

Schema Registry Storage Connector URL / schema.registry.storage.connector.connectURI

Schema Registry Storage Connector User / schema.registry.storage.connector.user
Schema Registry Storage Connector Password / schema.registry.storage.connector.password


Ensure that Schema Registry Storage Connector URL has
                    the fully qualified host name for the database installation location, the
                    connector URL, and the default port for the database selected. For
                    example:

MYSQL example:
jdbc:mysql://FQDN_MYSQL:3306/registry

Postgres example:
jdbc:postgresql://FQDN_POSTGRES:5432/registry

Oracle example:
jdbc:oracle:thin:@FQDN_ORACLE:3306/registry
