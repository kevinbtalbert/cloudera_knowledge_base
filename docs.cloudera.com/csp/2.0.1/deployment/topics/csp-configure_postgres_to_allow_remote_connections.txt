Configure Postgres to Allow Remote Connections
Configuring Postgres to allow remote connections involves editing the
         pg_hba.conf and postgresql.conf files and
      restarting Postgres.
It is critical that you configure Postgres to allow remote
         connections before you deploy a cluster. If you do not perform these steps in advance of
         installing your cluster, the installation fails. Open /var/lib/pgsql/9.6/data/pg_hba.conf and update to the following  


# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local all all trust


# IPv4 local connections:
host all all 0.0.0.0/0 trust 


# IPv6 local connections: 
host all all ::/0 trust 

 Open /var/lib//pgsql/9.6/data/postgresql.conf and update to the
               following:   

listen_addresses = '*'

 Restart Postgres:  

systemctl stop postgresql-9.6.service
systemctl start postgresql-9.6.service
