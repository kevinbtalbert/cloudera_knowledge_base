Enabling Sentry Authorization for SMM
You can use Sentry to configure and manage authorization for SMM.

To enable Sentry Service admin permissions for the SMM user, add
                        streamsmsgmgr to the
                        sentry.service.admin.group field.

To add SMM to the list of allowed Sentry Service users, add
                        streamsmsgmgr to the
                        sentry.service.allow.connect field.

From the Kafka Configurations tab, click the
                        + next to the super.users
                    field and add streamsmsgmgr.

From the Kafka Configurations tab, search for Sentry
                    Service and select the Sentry instance you want to use for Kafka authorization.
                    For example: Sentry-1

From the SMM Configurations tab, search for Sentry
                    Service and select the Sentry instance you want to use for SMM authorization.
                    For example: Sentry-1

noteSMM users need to be granted Sentry privileges to Kafka and the topics.
                        The following is an example of Sentry permissions required for Kafka, for
                        granting access to all the topics:
Create a Sentry role for SMM
                                users.$ kafka-sentry -cr -r smm_user_role
Assign the Sentry role to an SMM user
                                group.$ kafka-sentry -arg -r smm_user_role -g smm_user_group
Grant the required privilege to the Sentry role.
$ kafka-sentry -gpr -r smm_user_role -p "Host=*->Topic=*->action=describe"
$ kafka-sentry -gpr -r smm_user_role -p "Host=*->Cluster=kafka-cluster->action=describe"
$ kafka-sentry -gpr -r smm_user_role -p "Host=*->Consumergroup=*->action=describe"
