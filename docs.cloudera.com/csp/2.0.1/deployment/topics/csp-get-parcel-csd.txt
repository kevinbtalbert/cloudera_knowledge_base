Install the Parcel and CSD files
To install the CSP services, copy the parcels and CSD files into the respective
        directories, restart cloudera managers, and then download, distribute, and activate the CSP
        service parcels. 
Install the services in this order:
Schema Registry
SRM
SMM




You have obtained the CSD, parcel and .sha files from the Cloudera Archive
                        using your authentication credentials (username/password) provided as part
                        of the subscription fulfillment process. You can use your license file to
                        obtain the authentication credentials by generating them on the CDP Private Cloud Base download
                            page after logging in and selecting Download
                            Now.


You have installed Apache Kafka. 




Copy the parcel and .sha files into the parcel directory.
                    By default, the parcel repository is
                        /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo, located on the server where
                    Cloudera Manager is running. 

Copy the CSD files into the CSD directory. By default, this is located at
                        /opt/cloudera/csd, located on the server where Cloudera
                    Manager is running.

Change the parcel, .sha, and CSD files ownership and
                    permissions. Enter:


# For parcels
chown cloudera-scm:cloudera-scm /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo/*
chmod 644 /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo/*
# For CSDs
chown cloudera-scm:cloudera-scm /opt/cloudera/csd/*
chmod 644 /opt/cloudera/csd/*



Restart the Cloudera Manager Server. 

For RHEL 7
sudo systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server
For RHEL 6
sudo service cloudera-scm-server restart


Restart the Cloudera Management Service. From the Cloudera Manager Status tab,
                    click the Restart Icon or select
                        Restart from the Cloudera Management
                        Service drop-down. 

From the Cloudera Manager navigation bar, click Hosts
                    then Parcels, and click the
                        Configuration button.

Review the parcel list and verify that the Schema Registry, SRM, and SMM
                    parcels are available. If not, click the Check for New
                        Parcels button. The new parcels should display Available
                        for Download on the Parcels page.

From the Parcels page, download, distribute, and
                    activate the Schema Registry, SRM, and SMM parcels.
