Configuring SMM to Monitor SRM Replications
If you plan to use SMM to monitor Kafka cluster replication, ensure that you have
        configured SMM to communicate with SRM. 

From the Clusters drop-down, select Streams
                        Messaging Manager.

Click the Configuration tab.

Click the Configure Streams Replication Manager
                    box.

Specify the SRM protocol, host, and port in the remaining fields. 


The SRM host is a host where the Streams Replication Manager Service
                            role is running.
The SRM service port is the port where Streams Replication Manager
                            service is running. It is specified in the config
                                streams.replication.manager.service.port field.



Restart Cloudera Manager if prompted to do so.
