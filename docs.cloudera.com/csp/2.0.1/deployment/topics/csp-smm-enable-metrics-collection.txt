Enable partition level metric collection
You must enable SMM to configure partition level metrics about Kafka
        topics.

You have obtained the Cloudera Manager Kafka service name. See Obtain the Kafka
                    service name for information.


In Cloudera Manager, select Hosts, and then
                        Hosts Configuration.

To allow SMM to collect partition level metrics about Kafka topics, add the
                    following to Cloudera Manager Agent Monitoring Advanced Configuration
                        Snippet (Safety Valve):

<serviceName>_broker_topic_partition_metrics_for_smm_enabled=true
When you are configuring partition level metrics collection, your Kafka
                        service name should always be in lower case letters.
For example if KAFKA is the Kafka serviceName,
                        enter the following: 
kafka_broker_topic_partition_metrics_for_smm_enabled=true


Restart Cloudera Manager if prompted to do so.
