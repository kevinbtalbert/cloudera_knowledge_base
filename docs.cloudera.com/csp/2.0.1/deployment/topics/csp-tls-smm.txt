Enable TLS for SMM
Learn how to enable TLS/SSL encryption for Streams Messaging Manager (SMM). You can
        enable the settings in Cloudera Manager according to the cluster configuration.
If Kerberos is enabled, then you must enable SSL for SMM.
            SMM UI fails to load if Kerberos is enabled and SSL is not enabled. Also,
                if Kafka has Kerberos/SSL enabled, the same should be enabled for SMM.

Go to Cloudera Manager.

Select Streams Messaging Manager cluster.

Click Configuration from the menu bar.

In the Search field, type TLS/SSL to
                    show the SMM TLS/SSL properties.

The security related properties appear.


Edit the security properties according to the cluster configuration.

Click Save Changes.
