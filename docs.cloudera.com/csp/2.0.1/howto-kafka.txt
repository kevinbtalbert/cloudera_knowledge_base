Apache Kafka


Apache Kafka is a distributed commit log service that functions much like a publish/subscribe messaging system, but with better throughput, built-in partitioning, replication, and fault tolerance. Kafka provides the following:

Persistent messaging with O(1) disk structures that provide constant time performance, even with terabytes of stored messages.
High throughput, supporting hundreds of thousands of messages per second, even with modest hardware.
Explicit support for partitioning messages over Kafka servers and distributing consumption over a cluster of consumer machines while maintaining per-partition ordering semantics.
Support for parallel data load into Hadoop.
