Integrating with NiFi

Understanding NiFi Record Based ProcessingThe RecordReader and RecordWriter Controller Services and Processors that allow you       convert events from one type (json, xml, csv, Avro) to another (json, xml, csv, Avro). These       controller services use the Schema Registry to fetch the schema for the event to do this       conversion.Setting up the HortonworksSchemaRegistry Controller ServiceTo configure Schema Registry to communicate with NiFi dataflows, the first thing you       must do is tell NiFi about the Schema Registry instance with which you want to communicate.       You do this from the NiFi UI, using the HortonworksSchemaRegistry       Controller Service.Adding and Configuring Record Reader and Writer Controller ServicesNiFi provides Record Reader and Writer Controller Services to support record-based       processing. These Controller Services are new services that allows you convert events from one       type (JSON, XML, CSV, Avro) to another. These Controller Services use the Schema Registry to       fetch the schema for the event to do this conversion. Before using these new Controller       Services, you must configure them for use with Schema Registry.Using Record-Enabled ProcessorsRecord-enabled Processors allow you to use convert data between formats by specifying       Controller Services for record reading and record writing. This streamlines your dataflows and       inproves overall performance.
