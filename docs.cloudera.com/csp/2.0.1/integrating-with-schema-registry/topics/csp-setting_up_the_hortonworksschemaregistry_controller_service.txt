Setting up the HortonworksSchemaRegistry Controller Service
To configure Schema Registry to communicate with NiFi dataflows, the first thing you
      must do is tell NiFi about the Schema Registry instance with which you want to communicate.
      You do this from the NiFi UI, using the HortonworksSchemaRegistry
      Controller Service.

You have already installed Schema Registry.
 From the Global Menu, click Controller Settings and select
                  Controller Services tab.  Click the + icon to display the Add Controller
                  Service dialog.  Use the Filter box to search for HortonworksSchemaRegistry and click
                  Add.  Click the Edit icon to display the Configure Controller Service dialog.  Provide the Schema Registry URL with which you want NiFi to communicate and click
                  Apply.  

tip
If you are running an Ambari-managed cluster, you can find this value in the
                     Streaming Analytics Manager Service in Ambari for the configuration property
                     called registry.url. The URL looks similar to
                        http://$REGISTRY_SERVER:7788/api/v1.

 Enable this HortonworksSchemaRegistry by clicking the Enable icon,
               selecting the Scope, and clicking
                  Enable.
