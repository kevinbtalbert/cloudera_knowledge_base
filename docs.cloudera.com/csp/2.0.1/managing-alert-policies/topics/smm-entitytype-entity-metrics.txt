Component Types and Metrics for Alert Policies
You create an alert policy for a component type. The component type drives the list of
  metrics to select for creating a threshold.
The following table lists the component types and metrics for an alert policy:Table 1. Component Types and Metrics

Description
Suggested Alert



Topic
UNDER REPLICATED PARTITIONS COUNT
Total number of partitions that are under replicated for a topic.
Value > 0.


BYTES IN PER SEC
Bytes per second coming in to a topic.
Two kinds of alert can be configured.
Alert-1: Value = 0, raises an alert when the topic becomes idle.
Alert-2: Value > max_bytes_in_expected, raises an alert when the topic input
                    load is higher than usual.



BYTES OUT PER SEC
Bytes per second going out from a topic. It does not count the internal
                replication traffic.
Two kinds of alert can be configured.
Alert-1: Value = 0, raises an alert when the topic becomes idle.
Alert-2: Value > max_bytes_out_expected, raises an alert when the topic output
                    load is higher than usual.



OUT OF SYNC REPLICA COUNT
Total number of replicas that are not in sync with the leader for a
                topic.
Value > 0, raises an alert if there are out of sync replicas for the
                topic.


TOPIC PARTITION CONSUMPTION PERCENTAGE

Percentage of bytes consumed per topic partition compared according to the
                  configured parameter retention.bytes. If
                    retention.bytes is not configured, any condition involving this
                  metric would be false.

Value > max_expected_value, raises an alert if the topic partition reaches a
                certain consumption percentage.


TOPIC PARTITION BYTES IN PER SEC
Bytes per second coming in to a topic partition.
Two kinds of alert can be configured.
Alert-1: Value = 0, raises an alert when the topic partition becomes
                    idle.
Alert-2: Value > max_bytes_in_expected, raises an alert when the topic
                    partition input load is higher than usual.



TOPIC PARTITION BYTES OUT PER SEC
Bytes per second coming out of a topic partition.
Two kinds of alert can be configured.
Alert-1: Value = 0, raises an alert when the topic partition becomes
                    idle.

                  of brokers falls below the min.insync.replicas configured for the
                    producer.
Alert-1: Value < min.insync.replicas, raises an alert when producer could
                      not send any messages.
Alert-2: Value = min.insync.replicas, raises an alert that denotes if any
                      one of the remaining brokers goes down, then producer would not be able to
