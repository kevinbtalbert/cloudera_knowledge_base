Monitoring Replication Latency for Cluster Replication
You can monitor the replication latency of a Kafka cluster replication in
  SMM.
Replication latency is defined as the amount of time taken for a message to get replicated from
   the source cluster to the destination cluster. Replication latency is measured in
    milliseconds.
In the image, you can see the average replication latency for the CDFCluster to CDFClusterDR
   replication is 16.0 milliseconds. You can fetch the maximum or minimum replication latency for
   the replication by clicking the MAX or MIN button located above the cluster replication.
You can monitor the replication latency of a cluster replication graphically. SMM displays the
   Replication Latency graphs for each cluster in the cluster details. The following image shows the
   graph for replication latency for CDFCluster to CDFClusterDR replication:
