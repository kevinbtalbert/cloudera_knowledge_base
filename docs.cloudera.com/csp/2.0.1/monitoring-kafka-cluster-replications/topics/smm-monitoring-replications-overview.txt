Monitoring Cluster Replications Overview
You can use Streams Replication Manager (SRM) to implement cross-cluster Kafka topic
  replication in SMM.
SRM is an enterprise-grade replication solution that enables fault tolerant, scalable
   and robust cross-cluster Kafka topic replication. SRM provides the ability to dynamically change
   configurations and keeps the topic properties in sync across clusters at high performance. SRM
   also delivers custom extensions that facilitate installation, management and monitoring making
   SRM a complete replication solution that is built for mission critical workloads. For more
   information about SRM, see the Streams Replication Manager for HDF and HDP document
   library.
You need to configure SRM properties in SMM. After you configure SRM in SMM, you can use SMM to
   monitor all the Kafka cluster replications available in your environment. You can view all
   replication details in SMM. You can monitor status of the Kafka cluster replications, number of
   topics associated with the replication, throughput, replication latency, and checkpoint latency
   of Kafka cluster replications in SMM.
noteYou can also create alerts to receive notifications based on the conditions that you
   configure in the alert policy for monitoring Kafka cluster replications in your system. For more
   information about creating alerts to monitor Kafka cluster replications, see the Managing
    Alert Policies guide.
