Monitoring Status of the Clusters to be Replicated
You can monitor the status of the Kafka cluster replications in the Status column in the
  Cluster Replications page. 
The status has three variations:
Active. Indicates that the cluster replication is running.
Inactive. Indicates that the cluster replication is not running.
Warning. Indicates that the cluster replication is facing issues.

If the status of a Kafka cluster replication shows inactive or warning, check the
   logs, and troubleshoot the replication.
