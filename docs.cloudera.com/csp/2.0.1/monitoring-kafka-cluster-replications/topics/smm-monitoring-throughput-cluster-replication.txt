Monitoring Throughput for Cluster Replication
You can monitor the throughput of a Kafka cluster replication in SMM.
Throughput is defined as the data replicated between the source cluster and the destination
   cluster per second. Throughput is measured in bytes per second.
In the image, you can see the average throughput for the CDFCluster to CDFClusterDR replication
   is 3 bytes per second. You can fetch the maximum or minimum throughput for the replication by
   clicking the MAX or MIN button located above the cluster replication.
You can also monitor the throughput of a cluster replication graphically. SMM displays the
   Throughput graph for each cluster in the cluster details. The following image shows the graph for
   throughput for CDFCluster to CDFClusterDR replication:
