Compatibility Policies
A key Schema Registry feature is the ability to version schemas as they evolve.
    Compatibility policies are created at the schema metadata level, and define evolution rules for
    each schema.
After a policy has been defined for a schema, any subsequent version updates
        must honor the schemaâ€™s original compatibility, otherwise you experience an error.
Compatibility of schemas can be configured with any of the below
        values:

Backward Compatibility

Indicates that new version of a schema would be compatible with earlier version of
              that schema. That means the data written from earlier version of the schema, can be
              deserialized with a new version of the schema.
When you have a Backward Compatibility policy on your schema, you can evolve
              schemas by deleting portions, but you cannot add information.

Forward Compatibility

Indicates that an existing schema is compatible with subsequent versions of the
              schema. That means the data written from new version of the schema can still be read
              with old version of the schema.

Full Compatibility

Indicates that a new version of the schema provides both backward and forward
              compatibilities.

None

Indicates that no compatibility policy is in place.


The default value is None.
You set the compatibility policy when you are adding a schema. Once set, you cannot
        change it.
