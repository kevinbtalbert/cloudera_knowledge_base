Schema Registry Component Architecture
The below diagram represents the component architecture of Schema
      Registry.



Schema Registry has three main components:


Registry web server – Web Application exposing the REST endpoints you can
          use to manage schema entities. You can use a web proxy and load balancer with multiple Web
          Servers to provide HA and scalability.
          


Pluggable storage – Schema Registry uses the following two types of
          storages:


Schema Metadata Storage – Relational store that holds the metadata for
              the schema entities. Inn-memory storage (for development purposes) and mySQL databases
              are supported.


Serdes Storage – File storage for the serializer and deserializer jars.
              Local file system and HDFS storage are supported. Local file system storage is the
              default.




Schema Registry Client – A java client that components can use to interact with the
               RESTful services.


There are two integration points:

Custom NiFi Processors – New processors and controller services in NiFi that
                  interact with the Schema Registry.


Kafka Serializer and Deserializer – A Kafka serializer and deserializer that uses
                  Schema Registry. The Kafka serdes can be found on GitHub.
