Schema Registry Overview

As the diagram below instructions, Schema Registry is part of the enterprise services that
      powers the CSP platform.





Schema Registry provides a shared repository of schemas that allows applications to
      flexibly interact with each other.
Applications built often need a way to share metadata across 3 dimensions:


Data format


Schema


Semantics or meaning of the data


The Schema Registry design principle is to provide a way to tackle the challenges of
      managing and sharing schemas between components and in such a way that the schemas are
      designed to support evolution such that a consumer and producer can understand different
      versions of those schemas but still read all information shared between both versions and
      safely ignore the rest.
Hence, the value that Schema Registry provides and the applications that integrate with it
      are the following:

Centralized registry – Provide reusable schema to avoid attaching schema to every piece
            of data


Version management – Define relationship between schema versions so that consumers and
            producers can evolve at different rates


Schema validation – Enable generic format conversion, generic routing and data
            quality
