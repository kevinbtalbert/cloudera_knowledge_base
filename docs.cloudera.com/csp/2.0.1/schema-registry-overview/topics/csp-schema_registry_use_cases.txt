Schema Registry Use Cases
With a basic understanding of Schema Registry, the below sections walks through common
      use cases for Schema Registry.
Use Case 1: Registering and Querying a Schema for a Kafka TopicWhen Kafka is integrated into enterprise organization deployments, you typically have       many different Kafka topics used by different apps and users. With the adoption of Kafka       within the enterprise, some key questions that often come up are the following:Use Case 2: Reading/Deserializing and Writing/Serializing Data from and to a Kafka TopicIn addition to storing schema metadata, another key use case is to store metadata for     the format of how data should be read and how it should be written. Schema Registry supports     this use case as well by providing capabilities to store JAR files for serializers and     deserializers and then mapping the serdes to the schema.Use Case 3: Dataflow Management with Schema-based RoutingImagine if you are using NiFi to move different types of syslog events to downstream     systems. You have data movement requirements where you need to parse the syslog event to extract     the event type, and route the event to a certain downstream system (different Kafka topics, for     example) based on the event type.Parent topic: Schema Registry Overview
