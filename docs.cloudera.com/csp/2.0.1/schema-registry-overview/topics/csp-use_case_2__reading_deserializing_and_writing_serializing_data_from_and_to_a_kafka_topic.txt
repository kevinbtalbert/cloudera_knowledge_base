Use Case 2: Reading/Deserializing and Writing/Serializing Data from and to a Kafka Topic
In addition to storing schema metadata, another key use case is to store metadata for
    the format of how data should be read and how it should be written. Schema Registry supports
    this use case as well by providing capabilities to store JAR files for serializers and
    deserializers and then mapping the serdes to the schema.
