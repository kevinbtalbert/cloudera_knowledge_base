Active / Active Architecture
Active / Active architecture example for SRM.
In an Active / Active scenario, your producers can be load balanced to either your primary or
      secondary cluster. SRM is configured to replicate topics bi-directionally between both
      clusters. What makes this architecture Active / Active, is the fact that you now have
      consumers reading from both clusters at the same time, essentially acting like a cross-cluster
      consumer group. In case of a disaster the VIP or load balancer directs the producers to the
      secondary cluster and the secondary cluster consumer group is still able to process
      messages.While the primary cluster is down, your producers are still able to ingest and your
      consumers are still able to process messages. This results in a 0 downtime and hands-off
      failover in case of a disaster. Once the primary cluster is back online, SRM automatically
      takes care of synchronizing both clusters and your primary consumer group resumes processing
      messages.
