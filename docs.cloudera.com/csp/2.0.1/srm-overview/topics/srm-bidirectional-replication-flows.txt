 Learn more about bi-directional replication flows.
SRM understands cycles and will never replicate records in an infinite loop. This enables
      bi-directional replication flows in which clusters are mutually replicated. In this case,
      records sent to one cluster will be replicated to the other and the other way around. You can
      configure any number of clusters in this way.
