Cross Data Center Replication
Cross data center replication architecture example for SRM.
Certain applications not only require local high availability within one data center or one
      availability zone, but have to be highly available across data centers too. You can use SRM to
      set up replication between Kafka clusters in different data centers which results in messages
      being available to consumers in each of your data centers.
A load balancer directs your producers to the local data center or closest data center if the
      primary data center is down. SRM is configured to replicate topics between all data centers.
      If you are using more than two data centers, SRM is configured to create a “replication
      circle”, ensuring a single data center failure (for example us-north in the example below)
      does not halt replication between the remaining clusters.
