Learn how to use the srm-control command line tool which is used to
    manage replication of topics and consumer groups. 
The srm-control tool enables users to manage replication of topics and
      consumer groups. The tool has three subcommands topics,
        groups, and offsets. The topics
      subcommand is used to control which topics are replicated. The
        groups subcommand is used to control which consumer groups are replicated.
      The offsets subcommand is used to export translated offsets for a
        source->target cluster pair.
The srm-control command line tool is located in
        /opt/cloudera/parcels/STREAMS_REPLICATION_MANAGER/bin. By default no alias
      is provided for the tool. This means that in order to use it, you need to reference its path
      every time you want to pass a command. For ease of use, Cloudera recommends that you either
      create an alias, or add the SRM bin directory to your PATH
      environment variable.importantDo not use the srm-driver,
          srm-service, and srm.sh command line tools which are
        also located in the SRM bin directory. Instead, use Cloudera Manager to
        manage the SRM driver and service.
