Migrating Consumer Groups Between Clusters
Learn how to migrate consumers between clusters. 
If a primary Kafka cluster is temporarily unavailable, you can
      migrate mission-critical workloads to a secondary Kafka cluster (failover). When the primary
      cluster is restored, you can migrate back (failback).  The steps for migrating consumers in a
      failover or failback scenario are identical. However, depending on the scenario, your source
      and target clusters will be different. During failover you migrate consumers from primary to
      secondary, while during failback you migrate consumers from secondary to primary. 



Make sure that the clusters that you are migrating consumers between are set up with
            bidirectional replication.
 Verify that  all mission critical consumer groups and topics, including the ones on
            the secondary cluster are whitelisted.




Export the translated consumer group offsets of the source cluster:
srm-control offsets --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --target [TARGET_CLUSTER] --group [GROUP1] --export > out.csv
Reset consumer offsets on the target cluster:
kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server [TARGET_BROKER:PORT] --reset-offsets --group [GROUP1] --execute --from-file out.csv

Start consumers on the target cluster.


Consumers automatically resume processing messages on the target cluster where they left
        off on the source cluster.
