Replicating Data 
A step by step guide on how to start replicating data between Kafka clusters with
    SRM.
Installing and starting SRM on your cluster does
      not automatically start  data replication. In order to kick off replication, you need to
      update the whitelists with the srm-control tool.  

In Cloudera Manager, verify that  the SRM driver role is started and is in
        good health.
Verify that SRM is configured correctly. Make sure that connection information for
        each Kafka cluster is added as well as at least one source->target
        replication is specified and enabled.

Update the topics whitelist to start data replication.
srm-control topics --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --target [TARGET_CLUSTER] --add [TOPIC1],[TOPIC2]

note If required, instead of listing the topics that you want to add, you can also use
            regular expressions to add multiple topics with one command. 
Verify that the topics have been added to the whitelist. 
srm-control topics --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --target [TARGET_CLUSTER] --list


The topics you specify with the --add option are added to the topic
        whitelist and are replicated to the specified target cluster.
