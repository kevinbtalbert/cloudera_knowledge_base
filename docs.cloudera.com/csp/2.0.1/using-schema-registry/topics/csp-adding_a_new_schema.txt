Adding a new schema
To add a new schema to Schema Registry, provide information about the schema entities,
      select a compatibility policy and upload the schema text from a file. Schema entities are the
      collection of information that help you organize and sort your schemas. They include group,
      version, and informational metadata.

Ensure that you understand compatibility policies. Once selected, you cannot change the
            compatibility policy for a schema.
 From the Schema Registry UI, click the + icon.  Add the Schema metadata as follows:  



Name – A unique name for each schema. Used as a key to look up schemas.


Description – A short description of the schema.
note
Avro is currently the only supported type.



Schema Type – The schema format.


Schema Group – Allows you to group schemas in any logical order.


Compatibility – Sets the compatibility policy for the schema. Once set, this
                        cannot be changed.


 To allow schema to evolve over time by creating multiple versions, select the
                  Evolve checkbox.  

note
Deselecting Evolve means that you can only have one
                     version of a schema.

 Click Choose File to upload a new schema.
