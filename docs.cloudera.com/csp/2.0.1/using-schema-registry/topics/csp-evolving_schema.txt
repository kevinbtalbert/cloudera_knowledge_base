Evolving a schema
You evolve a schema when you create a new version. Schema Registry tracks the changes
      made to your schema, and stores each set of changes in a separate version of the schema. When
      multiple versions exist, you can select which version you want to use. Ensure that you
      understand compatibility policies, as they determine how you can evolve your
      schemas.



You have selected the Evolve checkbox when initially
                  adding the schema.


You have the schema you want to evolve saved to a file.




From the Schema Registry UI, identify the schema that you want to version. 

 Click the pencil icon to open the Edit Version dialog.
            

 Add a description of what has changed in this new version of the schema. You can
               view the description in the Schema Registry UI to easily understand what has changed
               in each version of the schema so we recommend that you add as much detail as you can.
            

 Click Choose File to upload the schema you want to
               evolve. 

 Click Ok.
