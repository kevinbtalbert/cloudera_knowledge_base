Querying a schema
You can use the Search box at the top of the Schema Registry UI to search for schemas
      by name, description, or schema text. To search, you can enter a schema name, key words, or
      any text string to return schemas with that value.
To return to your full list of schemas, clear the search bar and press Enter on your
      keyboard.
