Restricting access for certain users of Data Catalog
When a subscriber is provided with user access either as EnvironmentAdmin or
            EnvironmentUser, by default, the user is synchronized with default Atlas
        policies in Ranger. This implies that the same user has access to all the datasets in
        the Data Catalog environment.
To have a fine-grained access to the same user from accessing the assets in Data Catalog,
            you can perform some additional changes. For example, if you want to restrict some users
            from accessing specific table information, you must set-up a Ranger policy such that
            these users will not have access to the asset details in Data Catalog.
To create the Ranger policy to restrict users from accessing asset details,
            refer to the following images:



The following image displays the “Deny Conditions” set for the specific
            user.



The resultant is depicted in the following image, where the user has no
            permissions to access the specified dataset. In this example, it is
                us_customers.



Additionally, when you plan to restrict data access, please note the
            following:


Audit summarisation for the asset evolves from the Ranger audit
                    profiler and Metrics service.


Various Hive Column Statistical metrics for columns of the asset
                    evolves from Atlas as part of the profile_data of a column.


To ensure that the data related to audit summary and Hive Column Statistics are
            not visible to the subscribers, you must make sure to turn off the audit profiler and
            Hive Column profiler respectively.
