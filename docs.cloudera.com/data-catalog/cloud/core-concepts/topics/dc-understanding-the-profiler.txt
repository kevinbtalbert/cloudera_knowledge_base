Understanding the Data Catalog Profiler
Data Catalog includes a profiler engine that can run data
      profiling operations as a pipeline on data located in multiple data lakes. You can install the
      profiler agent in a data lake and set up a specific schedule to generate various types of data
      profiles. Data profilers generate metadata annotations on the assets for various purposes. 

noteYou can launch the profiler engine (DataHub cluster) for a data lake
            after selecting the data lake and clicking Launch Profilers. Note
            that, if the selected data lake already has the profiler engine attached, then the
               Launch Profilers option is not displayed.
noteProfilers DataHub can be set up only by accessing the Data Catalog UI and is not
            supported through the Management Console.

         box plot or histogram).
