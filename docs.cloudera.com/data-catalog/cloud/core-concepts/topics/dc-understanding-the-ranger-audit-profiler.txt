Understanding the Ranger Audit Profiler
You can view who has accessed which data from a forensic audit or compliance
  perspective, visualize access patterns, and identify anomalies in access patterns using the
   Ranger Audit Profiler. 
The audit profiler uses the Apache Ranger audit logs to show the most recent raw audit event
      data as well as summarized views of audits by type of access and access outcomes
      (allowed/denied). Such summarized views are obtained by profiling audit records in the data
      lake with the audit profiler.
