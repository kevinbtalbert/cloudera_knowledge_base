About the script
The Backup and Restore script can be used only on
            Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and
            Google Cloud Platform clusters where they support cloud storage. 
Scenarios for using the script

When you upgrade the Data Lake cluster and preserve Profiler data
                        in the DataHub cluster. You might want to delete the DataHub cluster but
                        preserve the Profiler data.
When you want to re-launch the Profiler and access the older
                        processed data. You might want to delete a DataHub cluster but preserve the
                        Profiler data of the DataHub cluster. 

noteFor users using Data Catalog on Cloudera Runtime 7.2.14
                            version, note the following

No user action or manual intervention needed after the upgrading
                                DataHub cluster to 7.2.14 version is completed.
Also, as an example use case scenario, incase a new profiler cluster
                                is launched that contains Custom Sensitiviy
                                    Profiler tags and which is deleted and relaunched
                                later, the changes are retained and no further action is
                                required.
No user action is required to backup and restore the profiler data.
                                The changes are automatically restored.
