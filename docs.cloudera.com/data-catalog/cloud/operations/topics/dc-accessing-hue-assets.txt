Accessing Hue assets
When you are on the Data Catalog search page or the Asset Details page, to access Hue
        assets, an external link button is used.

You must fulfill all the three conditions as listed in Prerequisites for accessing Hue tables and databases for viewing the external link button. 
You must activate Cloudera Data Warehouse on your selected
                environment.


Login to Cloudera Data Platform.

Under Management Console > select Data
                        Warehouse

On the Overview page, click on the left pane property
                    displaying Environments. 
AWS/Azure environments are listed.

Locate the enabled AWS / Azure environment and activate CDW by clicking on the
                    bolt icon.
This action also creates a default Database
                        Catalogs.



Once the environment is activated and a DB Catalog is created and running, you
                    can create a virtual warehouse as per the requirement.

For more information about AWS and Azure Environment, see AWS environments overview and
                            Azure environments overview.




You will now be able to navigate to the Hue assets on these virtual
                    warehouses using the links provided by Data Catalog.
