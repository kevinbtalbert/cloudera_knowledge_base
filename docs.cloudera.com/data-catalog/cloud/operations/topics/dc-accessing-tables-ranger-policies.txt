Accessing Tables based on Ranger policies
In Data Catalog service, when a table (in blue color link) is clicked, the
            Asset Details view page is displayed. 
If a user is not authorized to click or view table details, it implies that the user
            permissions have not been set-up in the Ranger.
noteThe user permissions to view table details are configured in
                Ranger.
As seen in the following diagram, if users are not able to view the table
            details, a message appears next to the same table "Some information might not be
                available to unauthorised users".



In the next example diagram, tables that have the permissions to view are
            embedded in blue color link. And the ones that do not have read permissions are visible
            in grey.
