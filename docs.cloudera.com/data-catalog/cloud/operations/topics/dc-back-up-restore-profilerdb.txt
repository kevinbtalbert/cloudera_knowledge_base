Backing up and Restoring Profiler Database
Using certain scripts that can be executed by the root users, you
        can take the backup of the Profiler databases. Later, if you want to delete the existing
        DataHub cluster and launch a new DataHub cluster, you must have an option to restore the old
        data.
Data Catalog includes Profiler services that run data profiling operations on
            data that is located in multiple Data Lakes. As of the latest Cloudera
                Runtime release, the Profiler services run on a DataHub cluster. When
            you delete the DataHub cluster, the profiled data and the user configuration information
            stored in the local databases are lost.
Profiler clusters run on the DataHub cluster using a couple of embedded databases -
                profiler_agent and
            profiler_metrics.

noteIf you download the modified Custom Sensitivity Profiler
                rules before deleting the Profiler cluster, and later when you create a new Profiler
                cluster, you can restore the state of the rules manually. If the System rules are
                part of the downloaded files, you must Suspend those rules. If Custom rules are part
                of the downloaded files, you must Deploy those rules. This is applicable if the
                Profiler cluster has Cloudera Runtime below 7.2.14
                version.


About the scriptThe Backup and Restore script can be used only on             Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and             Google Cloud Platform clusters where they support cloud storage. Running the scriptWhen you run the script, note that there are a couple of phases through which you can         accomplish your task. Parent topic: Managing Profilers
