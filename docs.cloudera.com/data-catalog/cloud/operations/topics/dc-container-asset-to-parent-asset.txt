Navigating from the container asset to the parent asset from Asset Details
        page
A generic Assets Details page is available for container data
        types like buckets and databases. 
A Contents tab (similar to the
                Schema tab) lists all the contents of the selected entity.
            Clicking on any element available in the selected entity list navigates you to the
                Asset Details page. 



For example, for a database entity having a list of tables, clicking on any
            listed table navigates to the Asset Details page of the same table. Helps you understand
            the parent-child relationship as far as asset management is concerned. The
                Contents tab displays entities that are contained within
            assets of container entity types. The entities in the table of
                Contents tab are clickable, which will allow you to navigate
            to the Asset Details page of these contained assets.
The following table lists the entity types, their parent, and contents.
