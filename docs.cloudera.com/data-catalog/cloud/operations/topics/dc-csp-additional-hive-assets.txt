Associating Custom Sensitivity Profiler tags to Hive assets
Associating Custom Sensitivity Profiler tags to Hive assets fails on the 7.2.16 Cloudera
  Runtime cluster.
The issue can be resolved by adding the Spark configuration:
spark.sensitive.profiler.tableSamplePercentage=50 to profiler scheduler conf by
   adding the configuration under the key - profiler_scheduler_spark_conf.
The value passed in the configuration must be an integer value ranging from 1 to 100. 
This value indicates the percentage of rows to be picked up as a sample for the
   profiler job.
