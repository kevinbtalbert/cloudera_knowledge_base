Delete Datasets
You might want to delete an Datasets if you no longer need to track those Datasets, or
      if you want to reassign those assets to another Dataset. You can delete Datasets at any time.
      Deleting an Datasets does not delete the assets contained therein, it only disassembles the
      Datasets. You can re-create Datasets or reassign assets to new Datasets.

From Data Catalog > Datasets page, click the More Options icon beside the
               name of the Dataset you want to delete.

Click Delete.

Click Confirm.
You are returned to the Datasets home
               page.
