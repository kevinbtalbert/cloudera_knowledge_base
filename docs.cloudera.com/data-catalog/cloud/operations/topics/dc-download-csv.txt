Download CSV option
The download CSV feature in Data Catalog allows you to download the search result for
  the current / specified query with the selected data lake. This feature allows you to download
  upto 10000 rows for the current search query.
The CSV format does not confirm with any specific order or continuation in the downloaded
   results. For example, a user downloads 10000 assets once and later downloads the CSV again with
   about 10000 assets. The CSV may not contain the search results in the same order as it was
   downloaded earlier or previously.
The following example images provides a sample download flow.
