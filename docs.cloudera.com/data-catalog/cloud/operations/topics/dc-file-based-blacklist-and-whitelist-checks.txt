File based denylist and allowlist checks
When the number of allowlist and denylist entries are many and cannot be defined
    inline, you can create allowlist or denylist files with one value in each line.
Keywords: allow-list, deny-list
Make sure to place the file in an HDFS location that is accessible to the Profiler
        Agent user.
You can provide the location of the file as an attribute in the DSL definition.
For example:
whitelist(\"/apps/dpprofiler/profilers/sensitive_info_profiler/1.0/lib/kraptr/meta/whitelist\")
blacklist(\"/apps/dpprofiler/profilers/sensitive_info_profiler/1.0/lib/kraptr/meta/blacklist\")
