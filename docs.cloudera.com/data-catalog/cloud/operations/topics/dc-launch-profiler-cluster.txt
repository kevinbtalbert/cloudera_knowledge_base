Launch Profiler Cluster
You must launch the Profiler cluster to view the profiler results for your assets and
        datasets. You must be a Power User to launch Profiler cluster. 
A new user interface which is introduced to launch
            profilers in Data Catalog. The Profiler Services is now supported by enabling the High
            Availability (HA) feature. noteThe profiler HA feature is under entitlement. Based on
                the entitlement, the HA functionality is supported on the Profiler cluster. Contact
                your Cloudera account representative to activate this feature in your CDP
                environment.noteBy default when you launch a Profiler
                cluster, the instance type of the Master node will be:
AWS - m5.4xlarge
Azure - Standard_D16_v3
GCP - e2-standard-16

noteThis is applicable for the latest build of Data Catalog version
                            2.0.17: 2.0.17-b26

There are two types of Profiler Services:
Profiler Manager
Profiler Scheduler
The Profiler Manager service consists of
                Profiler administrators, metrics, and data discovery services. These three entities
                support HA. The HA feature supports Active-Active mode.
importantThe Profiler Scheduler service does
                    not support the HA functionality.
How to launch the cluster profilerOn the Data Catalog search page, select the data lake from which you want
                to launch the profiler cluster. On the right-hand side of the window, the
                application displays the page to set up the profiler for the selected data lake.
                Click the Get Started link to proceed.

For setting up the profiler, you have the option to
                    enable or disable the HA. Note that the HA functionality is being supported only from
                    Cloudera Runtime 7.2.10 release onwards. If you are using
                the Cloudera Runtime version below 7.2.10, you shall not be able to use the HA
                feature for launching the profiler services.

Once you enable HA and click Setup Profiler,
                Data Catalog processes the request and the profiler creation is in progress.

Later, a confirmation message appears that the profiler cluster is
                created.

Next, you can verify the profiler cluster creation under
                    CDP Management Console >
                    Environments > DataHubs
                pane.Note that the newly created profiler cluster has
                some unique representations under the following categories:



Data Hub Type - The term
                            “ha” is appended to the type of cluster that is
                        newly created.

Version - 7.2.10
Node Count - (Which is
                    6)
Your Profiler cluster with HA is set up successfully.
