Using Behaviors
You can use various behaviors to take single inputs of type text and evaluate them to a Boolean value.
The profiler can take column values of any type and pass the values to each behaviour as text. Behaviors include the following:

Regular expressions
File based allowlist and denylist checks
File based allowlist and denylist checks
Luhn algorithm


Regular expressionsYou can include one or more regular expressions and evaluate to True if one of these matches the provided value.File based denylist and allowlist checksWhen the number of allowlist and denylist entries are many and cannot be defined     inline, you can create allowlist or denylist files with one value in each line.Luhn algorithmYou can do a Luhn check on identification numbers in columns.Parent topic: Creating Custom Profiler Rules
