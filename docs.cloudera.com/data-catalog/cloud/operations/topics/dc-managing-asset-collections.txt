Related informationUnderstanding asset collectionsCreate DatasetsYou can group data assets into Datasets. This enables you to organize data based on       business classifications, purpose, protection requirements, or more. Examples of Datasets are:       customer profiles, sales assets, financials, PII, and HR data. Edit DatasetsYou can edit Datasets by adding or removing assets and changing the access state of         the Datasets.Delete DatasetsYou might want to delete an Datasets if you no longer need to track those Datasets, or       if you want to reassign those assets to another Dataset. You can delete Datasets at any time.       Deleting an Datasets does not delete the assets contained therein, it only disassembles the       Datasets. You can re-create Datasets or reassign assets to new Datasets.
