Mapping glossary terms
Data Catalog contains the glossary terms that are created in
            Atlas.
You can search for those terms in Data Catalog and map specific terms with Data assets.
            You can search for terms in Data Catalog to either add and delete them from the selected
            data asset. The selected asset displays the total number of terms associated or mapped
            accordingly.
When you map a specific term for your dataset, the term is displayed in the following
            format:

<termname>@glossaryname>




You can use the icon in the Terms widget on the
                Asset Details page to add new terms for your dataset. Click
                Save to save the changes.






You can search for the same asset in the corresponding
                Atlas environment as shown in the example image.



Additionally, you can also associate terms to your datasets by selecting one or
            more assets on the Data Catalog search page. You can associate terms with multiple
            datasets at a time.






When you select a Hive table asset and navigate to the Asset
                Details page, under the Schema tab, you can view
            the list of terms associated with the asset.



You can add or update the terms for the associated datasets by clicking the
                Edit button.
