Navigation Support for Hive entity within Lineage
When you click a Hive entity within lineage, the Asset Details
        page of the selected Hive entity is displayed. 
Previously, when you clicked on any entity for which slider information was
            available, a slider would display the entity details. As of now, as seen in the
            corresponding images, the Asset Details page of the Hive entity is displayed. The option
            selected in Depth drop-down and Show
                Process nodes are now displayed on the upper-left corner of the Lineage
            module.



Alternatively, if you do not want to navigate away from the current page and
            want to view the information with respect to any entity, hover on the entity and click
            the information icon  to view the details.
The screenshot depicts the slider information for the clicked entity:
