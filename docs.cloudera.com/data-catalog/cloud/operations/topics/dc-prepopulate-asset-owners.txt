Prepopulating Asset Owners
In Data Catalog, under the search page, you can filter for assets based on the
        owners. 
Rather than having to type in the owners manually, the available asset owners are listed
            in drop down. Select the record from the list and add it as a filter criteria
For example, in the following diagram, the selected asset
                TYPE is “Hive”.
For the selected TYPE the owner “hive” is available in the drop-down and based
            on this condition, the assets can be filtered in the search page.
