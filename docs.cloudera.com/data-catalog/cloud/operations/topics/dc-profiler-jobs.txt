Viewing Profiler Jobs
You can monitor the overall health of your profiler jobs by viewing their status on
        the Profiler > Jobs.
Each profiler runs a Spark job
            on a user-defined schedule defined via the
            profiler configuration. You can view the status of each of those jobs for all your
            clusters.
Monitoring the profiler jobs has the following uses: 
By seeing long-term trends in job execution, you can determine the
                    overall health of your profilers. 
If you do a data ingest, you can find out if the profiling has
                    completed. 
Knowing when jobs first failed can help when troubleshooting problems
                    with profilers. 

You can take the following actions:
            
Filter by cluster, job status, or profiler. 
Sort by jobs ID, status, start time, cluster, queue, or profilers. 
Expand or narrow to show a day, week, or month of jobs.
