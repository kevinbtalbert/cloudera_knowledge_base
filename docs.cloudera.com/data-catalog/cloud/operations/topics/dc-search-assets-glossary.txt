Searching for assets using Glossary
Use glossaries to define a common set of search terms that data users across your
        organization use to describe their data.
Data can describe a wide variety of content: lists of names or
            text or columns full of numbers. You can use algorithms to describe data as having a
            specific pattern, of being within a range or having wide variation, but what’s missing
            from these descriptions is what does the data mean in a given business context and what
            is it used for? Is this column of integers the count of pallets that entered a warehouse
            on a given day or number of visitors for each room in a conference center? 
The glossary is a way to organize the context information that your business
            uses to make sense of your data beyond what can be figured out just by looking at the
            content. The glossary holds the terms you’ve agreed upon across your organization so
            business users can use familiar terms to find what they are looking for.
Glossaries enable you to define a hierarchical set of business terms that
            represents your business domain. 
Glossary terms can be thought of as of a flat (but searchable) list of business
            terms organized by glossaries. Unlike classifications, terms are not propagated through
            lineage relationships: the context of the term is what’s important, so propagation may
            or may not make sense.
