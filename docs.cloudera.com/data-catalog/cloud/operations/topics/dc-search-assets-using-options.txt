Additional search options for asset types
Using Data Catalog, you can add or edit asset description values to search for data
        assets across both Data Catalog and Atlas
        services by using the asset content. 
In the Asset Details page for each asset type that you select, you
            can add or edit comment and description
            fields. For each asset type in Data Catalog, you can add or edit comments or include a
            description. Including these values for the selected asset helps you to identify your
            chosen asset when you perform the search operation. 
Later, using the same set of values (comment or
                description), you can search for the asset types in
            Atlas.

noteThe comment and description options
                are supported only for Hive table and Hive
                    Column assets. For other asset types, only the
                    description option is supported.




Click + besides Comment and
                Description to include the respective values.



Click Save to save the changes.




noteYou can also edit the already saved valued by clicking the  icon.

Clicking on the Atlas button will navigate to the
            corresponding Atlas asset page as displayed.
