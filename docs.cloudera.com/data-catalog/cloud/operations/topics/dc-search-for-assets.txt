Search for Assets
On the Data Catalog Search page, select a data lake and enter a search string in the
  search box to view all the assets with details that contain the search string. 
When you enter the search terms in Data Catalog Search, you are looking up names, types,
   descriptions, and other metadata collected by Data Catalog. The search index includes metadata
   (not data) about your environment and cluster data assets and operations. You can make the search
   more powerful by associating your own information (business metadata) to the assets that Data
   Catalog stores.
