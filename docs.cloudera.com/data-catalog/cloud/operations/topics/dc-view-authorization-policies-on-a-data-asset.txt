View Authorization Policies on a Data Asset
The Asset Details Policy page displays all the Apache Ranger policy details associated with a particular data
      asset. This helps you understand how data access is secured and protected: what users can see
      what data (or metadata) under what conditions (security policies, data protection, and
      anonymization). 

From the Data Catalog search page, select a data asset.
The Asset Overview window opens.

Click the Policy tab.
The Policy table shows the data asset policies as
               retrieved from Apache Ranger.
