View Data Asset Audit Logs
The Asset Details Audit page displays all the Apache Ranger audit events associated with a particular data
      asset. This helps you to view who has accessed what data from a forensic audit or compliance
      perspective, and to visualize access patterns and identify anomalies.

From the Data Catalog search page, select a data asset.
The Asset Overview window opens.

Click the Audit tab.
The Audit table shows the most recent raw audit event data by type of access and access outcome
               (authorized/unauthorized). 
            

(Optional) You can filter the audit results by Access Type
               or Result. 

Access type: SELECT, UPDATE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, INDEX, READ, WRITE.
Result: ALLOWED, DENIED.
