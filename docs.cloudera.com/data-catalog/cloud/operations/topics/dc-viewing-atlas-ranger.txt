Viewing Ranger and Atlas applications
 For the selected data lake, click Ranger to view the Ranger app
  in a new browser tab. Click Atlas to view the Atlas app in a new browser
  tab. 



 The Atlas and Ranger buttons seen on the search page of Data Catalog allows you to navigate
      to the specific SDX component. Clicking on Atlas navigates to the Atlas landing page in a new
      browser tab and the same process takes place to land you on the Ranger landing page when you
      click on Ranger. This allows finer access and control over the assets and the surrounding
      policies.
