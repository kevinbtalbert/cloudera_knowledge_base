Accessing Data Lakes
In the Data Catalog search dashboard, the accessible data
        lakes are displayed under the search panel.
Users have access to the lakes based on the permissions that are granted. You
            can choose the available lake by selecting the appropriate radio button.
For more information about the user permissions, see Prerequisite to access Data Catalog
            Service.
For example, in the following diagram, the logged in user has access to all the listed
            data lakes.
