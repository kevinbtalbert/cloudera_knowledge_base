Additional Entity type selection for searching Assets
Using Data Catalog service, you can search for assets by using the entity
        types.
Data Catalog users can search and discover assets of more types. Users can
            search assets of types just like they do for Hive Table with some
            restrictions.
Supported entity types include:

AWS S3 Object


AWS S3 Bucket


AWS S3 Pseudo Dir

HBase Namespace

HDFS Path

Selecting a type triggers a search query for that type. Currently two types of
            entities are supported but totally about twelve types of generic entities can be
            selected to search for assets depending on the data lake. 
Owners data is derived from the response received from type based queries.
The following example diagrams depict the entity type selection search
            results.
