On-Demand Profilers
You can use on-demand profilers to profile specific assets without depending on the
            cron-based scheduling of profilers jobs. On-demand profiler option is available
        on the asset details page of the selected asset. 
For example, the diagram displays the Asset Details page of an
            asset. Run On-Demand profiler for Hive Column Statistics and Custom Sensitivity Profiler
            by clicking on the appropriate Run button. The next schedule run provides details
            about the next scheduled profiling for the respective profilers.
noteYou can use the On-Demand Profiler feature to profile both
                External and Managed tables.
