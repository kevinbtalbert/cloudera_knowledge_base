Profiler Tag Rules
You can use preconfigured tag rules or create new rules based on regular expressions
        and allow or deny files on specific columns in your tables. 
Rules are categorized into three groups: 

System Deployed : These are in-built rules that cannot be
                edited. 
Custom Deployed: Tag rules that you create and deploy on
                clusters after validation will appear under this category. Hover your mouse over the
                tag rules to deploy or suspend them as needed. You can also edit these tag rules. 
Custom Draft : You can create new tag rules and save them for
                later validation and deployment on clusters. Such rules appear under this
                category.
