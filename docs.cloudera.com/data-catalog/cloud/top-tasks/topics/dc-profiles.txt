Managing Profilers
The Data Catalog profiler engine runs data profiling
        operations as a pipeline on data located in multiple data lakes. These profilers create
        metadata annotations that summarize the content and shape characteristics of the data
        assets. 

Table 1. List of built-in profilers

Profiler Name

Data Catalog profiler data testingYou must note about the important information about profiler services.Launch Profiler ClusterYou must launch the Profiler cluster to view the profiler results for your assets and         datasets. You must be a Power User to launch Profiler cluster. Deleting profiler clusterDeleting profiler cluster removes all the Custom Sensitivity Profiler rules         and other updates to the specific cluster. It could also cause loss of data specific to         currently applied rules on the deleted profiler cluster.On-Demand ProfilersYou can use on-demand profilers to profile specific assets without depending on the             cron-based scheduling of profilers jobs. On-demand profiler option is available         on the asset details page of the selected asset. Profiling table data in non-default bucketsYou must configure a parameter in Profiler Scheduler in your         Cloudera Manager instance, to profile table data in non-default buckets.Tracking Profiler JobsThe Data Catalog profiler page is updated to provide a better         user experience for tracking respective profiler jobs.Viewing Profiler JobsYou can monitor the overall health of your profiler jobs by viewing their status on         the Profiler > Jobs.Viewing Profiler ConfigurationsYou can monitor the overall health of individual profilers by viewing their status on Profiler > Configs.Edit Profiler ConfigurationIn addition to turning on and off the profiler configurations, the individual         profilers can be run with their own execution parameters. These parameters are for         submission of the profiler job onto Spark. You can edit the configuration of profilers and update these parameters to run profiler jobs.Backing up and Restoring Profiler DatabaseUsing certain scripts that can be executed by the root users, you         can take the backup of the Profiler databases. Later, if you want to delete the existing         DataHub cluster and launch a new DataHub cluster, you must have an option to restore the old         data.Enable or Disable ProfilersBy default, profilers are enabled and run every 30 minutes. If you want to disable         (or re-enable) a profiler, you can do this by selecting the appropriate profiler from the             Configs tab.Profiler Tag RulesYou can use preconfigured tag rules or create new rules based on regular expressions         and allow or deny files on specific columns in your tables.
