Running the script
When you run the script, note that there are a couple of phases through which you can
        accomplish your task. 
Firstly you backup your Profiler database and next you can restore the Profiler
            database.

To backup the Profiler database:


Stop the Profiler Manager and Profiler
                        Scheduler services from the Cloudera Manager
                    instance of the DataHub cluster.
SSH to the node where Profiler Manager is installed as a
                        root user.
Execute the backup_db.sh script:noteFor users of
                            Cloudera Runtime below 7.2.8 version,
                        contact Cloudera Support.noteIf the profiler
                        cluster having the Cloudera Runtime version 7.2.11 or below, you must run
                        the following command: bash /opt/cloudera/parcels/PROFILER_MANAGER/profileradmin/scripts/users/backup_db.sh

noteIf the profiler cluster having the Cloudera Runtime version 7.2.12
                                or onwards , you must run the following command:
                                bash /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/profiler_manager/profileradmin/scripts/users/backup_db.sh

Delete the Profiler cluster.
Install a new version of Profiler cluster:
[Scenario-1] When the Data Lake upgrade is successfully completed.
[Scenario-2] When the user decides to launch a new version of the
                            Profiler cluster.


To restore the Profiler database:
Stop the Profiler Manager and Profiler
                            Scheduler services from the Cloudera Manager
                        instance of the DataHub cluster.
SSH to the node where Profiler Manager is installed
                        as a root user.
Execute the restore_db.sh script.noteFor
                            users of Cloudera Runtime below 7.2.8
                            version, contact Cloudera
                            Support.noteIf the profiler cluster having the Cloudera
                            Runtime version 7.2.11 or below, you must run the following command: bash /opt/cloudera/parcels/PROFILER_MANAGER/profileradmin/scripts/users/restore_db.sh

noteIf the profiler cluster having the Cloudera Runtime version
                                    7.2.12 or onwards , you must run the following command:
                                    bash /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/profiler_manager/profileradmin/scripts/users/restore_db.sh

Start the Profiler Manager and Profiler
                            Scheduler services from Cloudera Manager.


noteWhen you upgrade the Data Lake cluster and a new version of Profiler cluster
                    is installed, the Profiler configurations that have been modified by users in
                    the older version is replaced with new values as detailed:
