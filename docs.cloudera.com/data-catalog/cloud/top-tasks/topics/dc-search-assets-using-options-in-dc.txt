Searching for assets in Data Catalog using additional search options
Consider a scenario in Data Catalog, where you select a data asset type and under the
            Asset Details page, you insert a comment and provide the
        description for the selected asset.
Navigate to the Data Catalog search query pane and enter the
                Comment and Description value(s) that
            you saved for the selected asset type in Data Catalog. The result page displays the
            asset type that you added for the Comment and
                Description fields in Data Catalog.
When you query for the entered Comment value for the
            selected asset type in Data Catalog, the relevant asset type is displayed in the search
            result page.



Clicking on the asset type in Data Catalog displays the comment and description values as
            it was assigned in Data Catalog.



When you query for the entered Description value for the
            selected asset type in Data Catalog, the relevant asset type is displayed in the search
            result page.



Your search query displays the results.
