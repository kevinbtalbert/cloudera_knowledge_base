Using Terms in Data Catalog
You can use the Asset Details page in Data Catalog to add or modify “terms”
        for your selected assets.
A new widget called “Terms” is available in the Asset Details
            page. You can define rich glossary vocabularies using the natural terminology (technical
            terms and/or business terms). To semantically relate the term(s) to each other. And
            finally to map assets to glossary terms(s). 
You can assign terms with entities, search for entities, filter entities by
            glossary term(s), and also search for entities by using associated term(s).

noteWhen you work with terms in Data Catalog and map them to your assets, you can
                search for the same datasets in Atlas by using the corresponding terms.
