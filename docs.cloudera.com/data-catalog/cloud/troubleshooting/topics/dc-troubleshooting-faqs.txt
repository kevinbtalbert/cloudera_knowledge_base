 This page provides answers to frequently asked questions about problems that you
        might encounter while you use Data Catalog service.
Issue while accessing Data Catalog
You must note about specific permissions that are needed to access Data Catalog
                service.
In order to use the Data Catalog UI, however, users have to add themselves to at
                least one Data Lake as an Environmental Admin / Environmental User. It
                allows you to search for assets on the Data Lake, add tags, and business glossaries
                to these assets.
In order to use Profilers (DataHub clusters specific to Data Catalog) related
                features, you must have a PowerUser role. This runs Spark jobs and provides
                some valuable insights / suggestions.
