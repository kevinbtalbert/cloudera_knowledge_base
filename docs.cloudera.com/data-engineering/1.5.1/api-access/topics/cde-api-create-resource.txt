Creating a Cloudera Data Engineering resource using the API
A resource in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) is a
    named collection of files referenced by a job. The files can include
    application code, configuration files, and even Python virtual environment
    specifications (requirements.txt). You can create a
    resource using the CDE API.

As with all API calls, make sure you have a valid access token. For
        instructions, see Getting a Cloudera Data Engineering API
          access token.

Create a JSON file describing the resource, using the structure
          for the type of resource you want to create.The JSON
          payload for a resource is structured as follows:
files resource type

{
   "name":"<resourceName>",
   "type":"files",
   "retentionPolicy":"keep_indefinitely"
}

python-env resource type

{
   "name":"<resourceName>",
   "type":"python-env",
   "retentionPolicy":"keep_indefinitely",
   "pythonEnv":{
      "pythonVersion":"python3"
   }
}

custom-runtime-image resource type

{
  "customRuntimeImage": {
    "credential": "string",
    "engine": "string",
    "image": "string",
    "modified": "string"
  },
  "name": "<resourceName>",
  "retentionPolicy": "keep_indefinitely",
  "type": "custom-runtime-image"
}

Create the resource by submitting a POST
          request to the resources endpoint. The JSON filename
          is referenced using the @/path/to/filename.json
          convention. In this example, the JSON filename is
            fileResource.json, and describes a
            files type resource named
            example-job-files.
curl <jobs_api_url>/resources
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${CDE_TOKEN}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-X POST -d @${HOME}/fileResource.json
Verify that the resource was creating by requesting the
          resource details from the
            /resources/<resourceName> endpoint:
curl <jobs_api_url>/example-job-files \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${CDE_TOKEN}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-X GET
