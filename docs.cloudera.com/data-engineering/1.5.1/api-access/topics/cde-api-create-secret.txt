Creating a workload secret for Cloudera Data Engineering Spark Jobs using API
Creating a workload secret for Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Spark Jobs using API
    provides a secure way to create workload secrets. This is a more secure alternative to storing
    credentials in plain text embedded in your application or job configuration.

Create Workload Credentials with name workload-cred-:

curl -k -X "POST" 'https://<dex-vc-host>/dex/api/v1/credentials' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CDE_TOKEN}" \
  --data '{
  "workloadCred": {
    "aws-secret": "secret123",
    "db-pass": "dbpass123"
  },
  "name": "workload-cred-1",
  "type": "workload-credential",
  "description": "workload credential description"
}'


Edit the existing workload credentials with new data. For example, edit
            workload-cred-1:

curl -k -X "PATCH" 'https://<dex-vc-host>/dex/api/v1/credentials/workload-cred-1' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CDE_TOKEN}" \
  --data '{
  "workloadCred": {
    "aws-secret": "newsecret123",
    "db-pass": "newdbpass123"
  }
}'
