Getting Cloudera Data Engineering job information using the
    API
You can get Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) job information using
    the API by issuing a GET request to the
        /jobs/<job_name>
    endpoint.

Get an access token and save it as an environment variable as described in Getting a Cloudera Data Engineering API access
          token.


Determine the API URL for the virtual cluster you want to access
          using the API:


In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the
                Data Engineering tile. The CDE Home
              page displays.


In the Virtual Clusters section, navigate to the virtual
              cluster for which you want to interact with, and click Cluster
                Details.

Issue a GET request to the
              /jobs/<jobname>
          endpoint:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CDE_TOKEN}" -X GET "https://pmjkrgn5.cde-czlmkz4y.na-01.xvp2-7p8o.cloudera.site/dex/api/v1/jobs/SparkPi"
