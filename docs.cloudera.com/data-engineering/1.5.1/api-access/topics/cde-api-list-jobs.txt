Listing Cloudera Data Engineering jobs using the API
You can list Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) jobs using the API
    by issuing a GET request to the /jobs
    endpoint.

Get an access token and save it as an environment variable as described
        in Getting a Cloudera Data Engineering API
          access token.


Determine the API URL for the virtual cluster you want to access
          using the API:


In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the
                Data Engineering tile. The CDE Home
              page displays.


In the Virtual Clusters section, navigate to the virtual
              cluster for which you want to interact with, and click Cluster
                Details.


Click JOBS API URL to copy the URL.
For example:
                https://pmjkrgn5.cde-czlmkz4y.na-01.xvp2-7p8o.cloudera.site/dex/api/v1


Issue a GET request to the
            /jobs endpoint:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CDE_TOKEN}" -X GET "https://pmjkrgn5.cde-czlmkz4y.na-01.xvp2-7p8o.cloudera.site/dex/api/v1/jobs"
