Listing an existing workload secret for Cloudera Data Engineering Spark Jobs using
    API
You can list an existing secret for Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Spark Jobs using
    API.

List the existing workload credentials in the virtual cluster by creating a filter with
          type that is equal to workload-credential
curl -k -X "GET" 'https://<dex-vc-host>/dex/api/v1/credentials?filter=type%5Beq%5Dworkload-credential' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CDE_TOKEN}"
Response:
{
  "credentials": [
    {
      "name": "workload-cred-1",
      "type": "workload-credential",
      "description": "workload credential description",
      "created": "2022-10-18T07:26:41Z",
      "modified": "2022-10-18T07:26:41Z"
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "hasNext": false,
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0,
    "count": 1
  }
}


Get the existing specific workload credential. For example,
            workload-cred-1:

curl -k -X "GET" 'https://<dex-vc-host>/dex/api/v1/credentials/workload-cred-1' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CDE_TOKEN}"
Response:
{
      "name": "workload-cred-1",
      "type": "workload-credential",
      "description": "worklaod credential description",
      "created": "2022-10-18T07:26:41Z",
      "modified": "2022-10-18T07:26:41Z"
}
