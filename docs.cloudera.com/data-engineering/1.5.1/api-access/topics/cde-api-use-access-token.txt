Using an access token in Cloudera Data Engineering API calls
Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for
    API authentication.

Get an access token and save it as an environment variable as described in Getting a Cloudera Data Engineering API access
          token.


Determine the API URL for the virtual cluster you want to access
          using the API. The API URL for managing jobs is different from the URL
          used to obtain the access token.


In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the Data
                Engineering tile. The CDE Home page
              displays.


In the Virtual Clusters section, navigate to the virtual
              cluster for which you want to interact with, and click Cluster
                Details.

Click JOBS API URL to copy the
              link to your clipboard.For example:
                https://pmjkrgn5.cde-czlmkz4y.na-01.xvp2-7p8o.cloudera.site/dex/api/v1

When you make an API call, include the JWT as a bearer token.
          For example, to list all jobs associated with the virtual cluster,
          assuming you have saved the token as an environment variable named
            CDE_TOKEN:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CDE_TOKEN}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET "https://pmjkrgn5.cde-czlmkz4y.na-01.xvp2-7p8o.cloudera.site/dex/api/v1/jobs"
