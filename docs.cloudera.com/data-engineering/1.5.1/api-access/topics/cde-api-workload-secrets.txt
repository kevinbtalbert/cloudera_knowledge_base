Managing workload secrets with Cloudera Data Engineering Spark Jobs using the API
 This API provides a secure way to create and store workload secrets for Cloudera Data
  Engineering (CDE) Spark Jobs. This is a more secure alternative to storing credentials in plain text embedded in your application or job configuration.


Creating a workload secret for Cloudera Data Engineering Spark Jobs using APICreating a workload secret for Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Spark Jobs using API     provides a secure way to create workload secrets. This is a more secure alternative to storing     credentials in plain text embedded in your application or job configuration.Listing an existing workload secret for Cloudera Data Engineering Spark Jobs using APIYou can list an existing secret for Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Spark Jobs using     API.Deleting a workload secret for Cloudera Data Engineering Spark Jobs using APIYou can delete an existing secret for Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Spark Jobs using     API.Linking a workload secret to the Cloudera Data Engineering Spark Job definitions using APIOnce you've created a workload secret, you can link it to the Cloudera Data Engineering     (CDE) Spark Job definitions that you created using API.Using the workload secret in the Spark application codeTo use the workload secret credentials, you can read the credentials that are mounted     into the Spark drivers and executors as read-only files.
