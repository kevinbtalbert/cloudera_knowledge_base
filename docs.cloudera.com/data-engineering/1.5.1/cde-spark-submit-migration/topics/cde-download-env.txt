Downloading the cde-env tool
You can use the cde-env tool to migrate your
      spark-on-YARN workloads to CDE:

in the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the
            Data Engineering tile. The CDE Home page
          displays. 

In the Home page, click the Migration Tool
          link under Docs & Downloads to download the migration
          tool.


Unzip the archive. This is a temporary installation package and can be saved in any location. The folder contains
              README.md, cde, cde-env.sh, spark-submit-cde, and
              spark3-submit-cde files.
