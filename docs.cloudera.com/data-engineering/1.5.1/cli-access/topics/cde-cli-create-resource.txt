Creating a Cloudera Data Engineering resource using the CLI
A resource in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) is a named collection of
    files or other assets referenced by a job, including application code, configuration files, or
    any other arbitrary files required by a job. A resource can also be a Python virtual
    environment, or a custom Docker container image.

noteCustom Docker container images is a Technical Preview feature. Contact your
        Cloudera account representative to enable access to this feature.
Make sure that you have downloaded and configured the CLI client.


Create a resource using the cde resource create
          command. 
The cde resource create syntax is as
            follows:cde resource create [flags]You can
            view the list of flags by running cde resource create
              --help, or you can view the CDE CLI reference
            documentation.
Example: Create a file
          resourcecde resource create --name cde-file-resource --type filesExample: Create a Python virtual environment
            resourcecde resource create --name cde-python-env-resource --type python-env --python-version python3note
You can specify a PyPi mirror for a Python virtual environment resource using the
                --pypi-mirror flag. Note, that this requires network access to the
              mirror from the CDP environment.
Example:
            Create a custom Docker container image
          resourcecde resource create --name cde-container-image-resource --type custom-runtime-image
Verify that the resource was created by running cde
            resource list.
