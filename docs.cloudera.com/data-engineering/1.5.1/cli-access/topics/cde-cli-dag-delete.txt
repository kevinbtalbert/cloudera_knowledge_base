Deleting an Airflow DAG
You can delete unused Airflow DAGs using the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) command
        line interface (CLI).
The default process of removing CDE resources is to delete
            them together with the jobs owning them, using the cde job delete
            command. The cde airflow delete-dag command is a fallback for when
            Airflow gets into an unexpected situation and you have to remove a DAG with no
            associated Airflow job.

To delete a DAG from Airflow that is not associated with a job, use the
                        cde airflow delete-dag command:

cde airflow delete-dag --dag-id <DAG_ID>
