Deleting Docker credentials
To allow the use of private Docker registries, Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE)
        supports the creation and management of credentials. These are stored securely in the
        Kubernetes cluster as secrets and cannot be accessed by end users directly. Credentials are
        attached to job runs automatically by the CDE backend.


Make sure that you have downloaded and configured the CLI client.
Make sure that the credential you are deleting is no longer needed for any
                    jobs.



noteCustom Docker container images is a Technical Preview feature.
                Contact your Cloudera account representative to enable access to this
                feature.


Delete the credential by running cde credential delete --name
                                <cred_name>

Run cde credential list to verify that the credential was
                    deleted:
cde credential list [--filter <filter>]For
                    more information on filtering syntax, see CDE CLI list command syntax reference.
