Creating and updating Docker credentials
To allow the use of private Docker registries, Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) supports
  the creation and management of credentials. These are stored securely in the Kubernetes cluster as
  secrets and cannot be accessed by end users directly. Credentials are attached to job runs
  automatically by the CDE backend.

noteCustom Docker container images is a Technical Preview feature. Contact your
    Cloudera account representative to enable access to this feature.


To create a new Docker credential:

cde credential create --name <cred_name> --type docker-basic --docker-server <registry_URL_or_hostname> --docker-username <docker_user>


Enter the Docker registry password when you are prompted.
An optional --description field allows you to annotate the credential
     with a human readable description.

Run cde credential list to verify that the credential was created:
cde credential list [--filter <filter>]For
     more information on filtering syntax, see CDE CLI list command syntax reference.

If you want to update a credential, use the cde credential update
     command.

This command allows you to update the secret content, the credential description, or
      both.
cde credential update --name <cred_name> [--docker-server <registry_URL_or_hostname> --docker-username <docker_user>] [--description "<desc>"]
