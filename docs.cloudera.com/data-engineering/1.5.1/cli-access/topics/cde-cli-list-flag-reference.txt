CDE CLI list command syntax reference
You can include flags with the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) command line interface
    (CLI) list command calls to filter the result set. 
cde [credential|job|resource|run|...] list [--filter
        [fieldname[operator]argument]] [--filter [fieldname[operator]argument]]
      ...

A list command call can include multiple filter flags, where all filters
        must match for the entry to be returned. You have to enclose filters in quotes.

fieldname
is selected from the top-level fields of the returned entries. Filtering of fields
            nested within other fields is supported using MySQL 8 JSON path expressions.
operator
is one of: eq, noteq, lte,
              lt, gte, gt, in,
              notin, like, rlike. The
              in and notin operators work on an argument of
            comma-separated values. The like operator matches using SQL LIKE
            syntax, e.g. %test%. The rlike operator matches using
            the SQL REGEXP regular expression syntax.
argument

is the value, list, or expression to match with the operator. If the argument
              contains commas the filter has to be enclosed in a second set of quotes, for example:
                '"id[in]12,14,16"'.


note
Timestamps must be formatted as MySQL date time literals.



For example:
cde run list --filter 'spark.spec.file[rlike]jar'
