Uploading files or other assets to a Cloudera Data Engineering resource using the
        CLI
A resource in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) is a named collection of
        files or other assets referenced by a job, including application code, configuration files,
        or any other arbitrary files required by a job. A resource can also be a Python virtual
        environment, or a custom Docker container image.

noteCustom Docker container images is a Technical Preview feature.
                Contact your Cloudera account representative to enable access to this
                feature.
Make sure that you have downloaded and configured the CLI client.
Make sure that you have created a
                resource.


Upload assets to a resource using the cde resource upload
                    command. 
The cde resource upload syntax is as
                        follows:cde resource upload [flags]You can view
                        the list of flags by running cde resource upload --help, or
                        you can view the CDE CLI reference
                        documentation.noteFor Python environment resources, you can only
                        upload a requirements.txt file. Python environment
                        resources do not support arbitrary file upload. If the local file is named
                        something other than requirements.txt, you must add the
                        flag --resource-path requirements.txt to the
                        command.
Example: Upload a file
                        resourcecde resource upload --name [***RESOURCE_NAME***] --local-path [***LOCAL_PATH***] [--resource-path [***PATH_IN_RESOURCE***]]
Use
                        repeated local path flags, and/or
                            */?/[a-z] wildcards,
                        to specify multiple files. Use quotes around the local path when including
                        wildcards, for example, --local-path "*.jar". For a single
                        file --resource-path is used for the resource filename. For
                        multiple files --resource-path is used for the resource
                        directory.
Example: Upload a Python virtual environment
                    resourcecde resource upload --name cde-python-env-resource --local-path ${HOME}/requirements.txt
Example: Upload a custom Docker container image
                    resourcecde resource upload --name cde-container-image-resource --type custom-runtime-image
Example: Upload a file for a file
                    resourcecde resource upload --name cde-file-resource --local-path /path/to/local/file
Example: Upload and extract archive to resourceCurrently
                        supported archive file formats are : .zip and
                            .tar.gzcde resource upload-archive --name cde-file-resource --local-path /path/to/local/file

Verify that the file is included in the resource by running cde
                        resource describe --name
                    <resource_name>.
