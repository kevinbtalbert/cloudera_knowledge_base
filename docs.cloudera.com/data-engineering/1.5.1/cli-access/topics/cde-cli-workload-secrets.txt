Managing workload secrets with Cloudera Data Engineering Spark Jobs using the CLI
 Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) provides a secure way to create and store workload
  secrets for CDE Spark Jobs. This is a more secure alternative to storing credentials in plain text
  embedded in your application or job configuration. 


Creating a workload secret for Cloudera Data Engineering Spark Jobs using CLIYou can create workload secrets using interactive mode or using a       JSON file. You can use the --workload-cred-json-file and     the --workload-cred-key flags along with the --type flag     supporting workload-credential.Updating a workload secret for Cloudera Data Engineering Spark Jobs using CLIYou can update an existing secret to use it with the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE)     Spark Jobs.Linking a workload secret to the Cloudera Data Engineering Spark Job definitions using CLI After you create a workload secret, you can link it to the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Spark Job definitions that you created using CLI. Using a workload secret in Spark application codeTo use the workload secret credentials, you can read the credentials that are mounted     into the Spark drivers and executors as read-only files.Listing an existing workload secret to the Cloudera Data Engineering Spark JobYou can list an existing secret for Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Spark Jobs using     CLI.Deleting a workload secret for Cloudera Data Engineering Spark Jobs using CLIYou can delete an existing secret for Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Spark Jobs using     CLI.
