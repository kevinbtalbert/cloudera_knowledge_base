Creating and updating Apache Airflow jobs using the CLI
The following example demonstrates how to create an Airflow DAG in Cloudera Data
    Engineering (CDE) using the command line interface (CLI).
Make sure that you have downloaded the CLI client. For more
      information, see Using the Cloudera Data Engineering
        command line interface.


Run the cde job create command as follows:

cde job create --name <job_name> --type airflow --dag-file <DAG_file> --mount-1-resource <your_DAG_resource> [other Airflow flags...]

<DAG_file>
is a reference to a file within a CDE resource


To see the full command syntax and supported options, run cde job create
            --help.

noteAirflow DAGs manage their own schedules and so their schedules cannot be set through
            the CLI.


Run cde job describe to verify that the job was created:

cde job describe --name <job_name>


If you want to update the job configuration, use the cde job update
          command.
For example, to change the number of
          executors:cde job update --name test_job
To see the full command syntax and supported options, run cde job update
            --help.
To verify the updated configuration, run cde job
            describe again:
cde job describe --name <job_name>
