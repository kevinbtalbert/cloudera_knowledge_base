Creating and using multiple profiles using CDE CLI 
You can now add a collection of CDE CLI configurations grouped together as profiles, to
    the config.yaml file. You can use these profiles while running commands.
    You can set the configurations either at a profile level or at a global level.
The CDE CLI client uses ~/.cde/config.yaml configuration file to
      define the default CDE virtual cluster to interact with and to define other configuration
      parameters. CDE CLI now supports the profiling option in the configuration file. A profile is
      a collection of configurations that you can apply to a CLI command. Multiple named profiles
      can be stored in the configuration file. 
Make sure that you have downloaded the CLI client. For more information, see Using
        the Cloudera Data Engineering command line interface. 

Create or open the ~/.cde/config.yaml file.

Add profiles to the config.yaml file based on the following
          structure:
<Global Configurations>

profiles:
- name: <Profile Name 1>        
 <Profile Configurations>
- name: <Profile Name 2>
 <Profile Configurations>
            Example Configuration file:vcluster-endpoint: https://g7f9bnv2.cde.dev.cldr.work/dex/api/v1
user: cdpuser

profiles:
- name: dev
  user: cdpuser1
  vcluster-endpoint: https://y86gbhv3.cde.dev.cldr.work/dex/api/v1

- name: test
  vcluster-endpoint: https://g7f9bnv2.cde8x.dev.cldr.work/dex/api/v1
Global Configuration: These configurations are set at the
              global level. The configurations set here are used by default when a profile name is
              not specified or the configuration is not specified in the profile
Profile Configuration: These configurations are set at the
              profile level and overrides the respective configurations set at the global level. You
              can select the profile either by using the environment variables, or command flags.
            
noteAny profile mentioned under profiles overrides the keys of
            global configuration and does not replace all the configurations. For example, if
              there are five parameters in global and only three are configured in
              the selected profile, the final configurations will be three from the
              selected profile and the remaining from global . In
              the above test profile example, it does not have the user
              configuration defined, so if the user selects the test profile,
              except vcluster-endpoint, which is set in the
                test profile, all the other configurations are used from
                global .Global configuration is accessed as the
                default profile name. Hence, you cannot create a profile named
                default .

You can select the profile using the flag or environment variable. 
Flag
cde job list --config-profile <PROFILE NAME>
Environment variable
export CDE_CONFIG_PROFILE=<PROFILE NAME>
cde job list


[Optional] You can view the active profile in the configuration file.
