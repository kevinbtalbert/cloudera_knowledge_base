Cloudera Data Engineering CLI authentication 
The Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) CLI tool supports both interactive and transparent
    authentication. For interactive authentication, if you have configured the CLI with your
    workload username, you are prompted for a password. For transparent authentication, the CDE CLI
    supports a password file, Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) access keys, and CDP credentials
    file.
The CDE CLI provides the following mechanisms for authentication:

CDP access key stored in a credentials file
CDP access key specified by CLI flag or environment variable
Interactive prompt for workload password
Workload password specified by CLI flag or environment variable

In all cases, the CLI uses the provided credentials to obtain an
      authentication token for the specified user, and caches it locally in a
      file on the machine where the CLI is running. You can disable caching of
      tokens entirely by using the --auth-no-cache CLI flag or
      the CDE_AUTH_NO_CACHE environment variable.
importantThe minimum required roles to obtain an access
      token are DEUser and EnvironmentUser. EnvironmentAdmin role is not
      required.
The cache file location is automatically determined based on the default
      system user cache:

Linux:
$HOME/.cache/cloudera/cde or
          $XDG_CACHE_HOME/cloudera/cde/
macOS:
$HOME/Library/Caches/cloudera/cde/
Windows:
%LocalAppData%\cloudera\cde\

If you want to use a custom location, specify it with the --auth-cache-file
      flag or the CDE_AUTH_CACHE_FILE environment variable. You can use the special
      string $USERCACHE, which is expanded according to the default system user
      cache (as listed above, without the /cloudera/cde/ suffix).noteIf you include user: in your
          config.yaml file, the CLI tool will not use the access token and will
        instead keep prompting for a password. If you want to use a credential file, then you must
        remove the specified user from the profile.
CDP credentials file
When you generate a CDP access key, you
        can download it to a credentials file:



The access key is only displayed and available for download when you
        first generate it. After you close the dialog, there is no way to
        recover the key.
Save or copy the credentials file to
        $HOME/.cdp/credentials on the machine where you are
        running the CDE CLI. Credentials stored in this file are automatically
        discovered by both the CDE and CDP CLIs. If a credentials file is found,
        authentication occurs transparently using the discovered CDP access
        key.
The CDE CLI automatically looks for a CDP access key in the following
        locations in the order given:
./credentials
$HOME/.cde/credentials
/etc/cde/credentials
$HOME/.cdp/credentials

You can override this by using the --credentials-file
        </path/to/credentials> CLI flag to
        specify a different file location.
You can also skip credential discovery by using the
        --skip-credentials-file flag.

CDP access key
If you do not want to use the credentials file, you can specify the
         access key using environment variables or command line flags as
         follows:
Table 1. CDP access key environment variables and CLI flags

Parameter
Environment variable
CLI flag



Access key ID
CDE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access_key_id>
--access-key-id
                <access_key_id>


Access key secret
CDE_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=<access_key_secret>
--access-key-secret string
                <access_key_secret>


Along with the above flags, CDE CLI expects CDP endpoint URL to be configured. CDP Endpoint
        URL is same as the CDP private cloud console URL. You can configure this using environment
        variables or command line flags as follows:
Table 2. CDP endpoint environment variables and CLI flags

Parameter
Environment variable
CLI flag



CDP Endpoint
CDE_CDP_ENDPOINT=<cdp_endpoint> 
--cdp-endpoint <cdp_endpoint>



Workload password prompt
When the CLI requires a new token for a virtual cluster, you are
        prompted for the password for the workload user, identified by the
          --user CLI flag or the CDE_USER
        environment variable.
 The workload password, for both human and machine users, can be set
        using the CDP User Management console. For more
        information, see Managing user access and
          authorization.

Workload password file
If you do not want to be prompted for your workload password, you can
        provide a password file. A password file is a file containing your
        workload password, and nothing else.
noteWhen using a password file, the CLI strips one trailing newline
        character. If your password actually includes a newline character at the
        end, add an extra newline at the end of the file.
You can specify the password file by using an environment variable or a
        command line flag as follows:

Environment variable
CDE_AUTH_PASS_FILE=</path/to/password/file>
Command line flag
--auth-pass-file
                </path/to/password/file>
