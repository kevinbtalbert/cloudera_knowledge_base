Cloudera Data Engineering CLI TLS configuration

importantThe CLI in this release does not support TLS
      validation. You must disable TLS validation by adding the following lines
      to the CDE configuration file
      (~/.cde/config.yaml):tls-insecure: true
All CDE virtual cluster endpoints are configured with TLS. In non-production or on-premises
   environments the TLS certificates are usually signed by a non-production or non-public
   certificate authority (CA). In these cases, without additional configuration, the CLI tool fails
   as it attempts to validate the API server's TLS certificate. The CLI provides a TLS configuration
   when using non-public/non-production CAs.
Specify a file containing the PEM encoded public certificate(s) of the signing CA in one of the
   following ways:

add the --tls-ca-certs [***/PATH/TO/CA.PEM***] flag on
    the command line
define the tls-ca-certs: [***/PATH/TO/CA.PEM***] variable
    in the ~/.cde/config.yaml configuration file
set the CDE_TLS_CA_CERTS environment variable 

Replace [***/PATH/TO/CA.PEM***] with the path to a valid
    ca.pem file.
For public cloud, certificates are issued and signed by LetsEncrypt:
noteLetsEncrypt Production CA Chain is part of the standard CA bundle therefore you do not need
   to add it on Linux or macOS. It is however, mandatory on Windows, where you have to
   concatenate the following into a single CA file:
https://letsencrypt.org/certs/lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem.txt
https://letsencrypt.org/certs/trustid-x3-root.pem.txt

For internal or on-premises environments you need to obtain your CA certificates through your
   internal process.
note
If using the CLI on Windows, ensure you use path styles such as
          C:\Users\janeblogs\.cde\ca.pem when referencing local
        files.
