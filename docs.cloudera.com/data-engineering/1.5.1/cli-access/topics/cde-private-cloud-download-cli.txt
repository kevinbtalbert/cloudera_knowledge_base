Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) provides a command line interface
    (CLI) client.
In addition to the CDE API, you can use the CDE CLI client to access your
      CDE service. Using the CLI, you can manage clusters and applications.
noteThe CLI client is not forward compatible. Download
      the client for the version of the cluster you are accessing. The
        Cluster Details page for every virtual cluster
      includes a link to download the CLI client for that cluster
      version.
To download the CLI client:

Navigate to the Cloudera Data Engineering
          Overview page by clicking the Data
          Engineering tile in the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP)
        management console.
In the CDE web console, select an environment.
Click the Cluster Details icon for the virtual
        cluster you want to access.
Click the link under CLI TOOL to download the
        CLI client.
