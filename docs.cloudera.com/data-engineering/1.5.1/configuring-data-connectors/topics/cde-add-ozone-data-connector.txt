Adding Ozone data connector for Cloudera Data Engineering service
You can configure Ozone as the backend storage for  Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE)
    workloads. 
Data connectors are bound to a CDE service and you must first
      create a CDE service before configuring Ozone storage. 

In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the
          Data Engineering tile. The CDE Home page
          displays.

Click Administration in the left navigation menu. The
            Administration page displays.

In the Services column, click  for the CDE
          service you want to configure for accessing the Ozone file system. 

Click the Data Connectors tab. On the Data
            Connectors tab, you can view details about the existing data connectors, if
          any, including the service name and CDP environment. 

Click Create. The Add a Connector pane is
          displayed. 

Specify the connector's name.

 Select Ozone from the Type of Connector
          drop-down list.  

Review the summary and click Create. 

After configuring the CDE service to access the Ozone filesystem, use this data
      connector during job creation to read and write from Apache Ozone Object Store through your
      workload Spark job.
