Backing up and Restoring Data Connectors
Before you upgrade your clusters or delete an existing cluster to create a new cluster,
    you can back up the data connectors and restore those data connectors post-upgrade on the new
    cluster. The data connector pre-upgrade jobs work seamlessly on the upgraded cluster after you
    restore those jobs. 
Backing up the data connectorYou must back up your data connectors before you delete or upgrade your cluster. Restoring the data connectorYou can restore the backed-up data connectors post-upgrade or on the new CDE Service in     the same cluster or across clusters.
