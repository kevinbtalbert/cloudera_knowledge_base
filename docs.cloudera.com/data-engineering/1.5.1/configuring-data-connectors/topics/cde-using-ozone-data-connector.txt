Using Ozone storage with Cloudera Data Engineering Private Cloud
Apache Ozone is an object store available on the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster which
    enables you to optimize storage for big data workloads. You can configure Ozone as the backend
    storage for workloads of CDE clusters.
Data connectors enable you to access different storage using only a few configurations
      specific to storage. Data Connectors are bound to a CDE service. Hence, you must first create
      a CDE service before configuring Ozone storage through Data Connectors. All the virtual
      clusters managed by that CDE service can use the same data connectors.

Deleting Ozone data connector for Cloudera Data Engineering serviceYou can delete an existing data connector. Backing up and Restoring Data ConnectorsBefore you upgrade your clusters or delete an existing cluster to create a new cluster,     you can back up the data connectors and restore those data connectors post-upgrade on the new     cluster. The data connector pre-upgrade jobs work seamlessly on the upgraded cluster after you     restore those jobs.
