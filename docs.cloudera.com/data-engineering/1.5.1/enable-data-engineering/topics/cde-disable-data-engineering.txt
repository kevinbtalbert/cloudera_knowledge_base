Removing a Cloudera Data Engineering service
Disabling an existing Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service stops
    all jobs, and deletes all associated virtual clusters and virtual cluster
    metadata. Do not do this unless you are certain that you no longer need any
    of these. Disabling CDE does not delete your CDP data. If enabling the CDE
    service on an environment for the first time fails, you must disable the
    service before you can try again. In this scenario, there are no clusters or
    jobs, and you can safely perform this procedure.



In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the
          Data Engineering tile. The CDE Home page
          displays.

Click Administration on the left navigation menu. The
            Administration page
          displays.

In the Services column, click  at the top right of the CDE service, and then
          click Disable Service.

          unless you are certain that you no longer need any of these. Additionally, if you're
          prompted to perform a Force Disable, in the event that a Disable is not successful, you
          must perform a manual cleanup of cloud infrastructures such as Security Group, EBS Volume,
          and S3 Bucket. A manual cleanup is not required for a standard
            Disable.Confirm that you want
          to disable CDE by typing the environment name and then clicking
            Disable.
The CDE Administration page displays the status of the
      environment that is being disabled.
If you disabled CDE as a result of a failure to enable CDE for
      the first time on an environment, resolve any reported issues, and then try again.
