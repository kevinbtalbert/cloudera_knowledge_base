Deleting virtual clusters
If you no longer need a particular virtual cluster, you can delete
    it. Deleting a virtual cluster instantly deletes all metadata associated
    with the cluster, including job configurations and log files. Do not delete
    a virtual cluster unless you are certain you no longer need access to any of
    the applications, jobs, or log files. Job run history is maintained
    separately, and is not deleted even if you delete a virtual
    cluster.



In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP)  console, click the
            Data Engineering tile. The CDE Home page
          displays.

Click Administration in the left navigation menu. The
            Administration page displays.

In the Services column, select the environment containing the
          virtual cluster you want to delete.

In the Virtual Clusters column for the selected environment,
          click  at the top right of the virtual cluster that you want to delete, and then click
            Delete.

warningDeleting a virtual cluster deletes all metadata associated with the
            cluster, including job configurations and log files. Do not do this unless you are
            certain that you no longer need any of these.

Confirm that you want to delete the cluster
          by entering the cluster name and then clicking
            Delete.
