Deleting Jobs in Cloudera Data Engineering
If you no longer need a job, you can delete it. Deleting a job does
    not delete the job run history.



In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console , click the
            Data Engineering tile. The CDE Home page
          displays.

Click Jobs  on the left navigation menu. The
            Jobs page displays.

Click  in the Actions column next to the job, and then click
            Delete.
