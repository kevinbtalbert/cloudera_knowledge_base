Configuring service account key tab to the machine user 
You can configure a service account Kerberos key tab file to a machine user id in order
    to submit CDE jobs. The machine user will now have access to the hdfs storage through
    jobs.

Create a CDP machine user. For example, mu_cde.
Generate access key and secret key for the machine user and download the credential
        information. 
On the ECS or HDFS gateway host, create a filename containing the user principal, and
          generate a keytab. If you do not have the ktutil utility, you might
          need to install the krb5-workstation package. The following example
          commands assume the user principal is mu_cde@example.com.


Create a file named <username>.principal (for example,
                mu_cde.principal) containing the user principal:
              mu_cde@example.com
Generate a key tab file for the actual service account. For example,
                svc_acc. Name this keytab file as
                <username>.keytab, example: mu_cde.keytab.
              The generation of keytab can be done for the user using the ktutil
              command:sudo ktutil
ktutil:  addent -password -p mu_cde@example.com -k 1 -e aes256-cts
Password for pmu_cde@example.com: 
ktutil:  addent -password -p mu_cde@example.com -k 2 -e aes128-cts
Password for mu_cde@example.com: 
ktutil:  wkt mu_cde.keytab

ktutil:  q



Validate the keytab using klist and kinit
          commands:
klist -ekt mu_cde.keytab 

Keytab name: FILE:mu_cde.keytab
KVNO Timestamp           Principal
---- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
   1 08/01/2021 10:29:47 mu_cde@example.com (aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96) 
   1 08/01/2021 10:29:47 mu_cde@example.com (aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96) 

kinit -kt mu_cde.keytab mu_cde@example.comMake sure that the keytab is valid
          before continuing. If the kinit command fails, the user will not be
          able to run jobs in the virtual cluster. After verifying that the kinit
          command succeeds, you can destroy the Kerberos ticket by running
            kdestroy. 

Upload the keytab file for the user id as mu_cde and use the principal
          and keytab file of the actual service account (svc_acc). 
./cde-utils.sh init-user-in-virtual-cluster -h <endpoint_host> -u <user> -p <principal_file> -k <keytab_file>
          For example, using the mu-cde user, for the
            dfdj6kgx.cde-2cdxw5x5.ecs-demo.example.com endpoint
          host:./cde-utils.sh init-user-in-virtual-cluster -h dfdj6kgx.cde-2cdxw5x5.ecs-demo.example.com -u mu-cde -p mu-cde.principal -k mu-cde.keytab

 Set the Ranger authorization policy for the svc_acc
            account.
