Configuring LDAP users
You must complete the following manual steps to prepare the cluster for each user that
    needs to submit jobs. Perform
    these steps for each user that needs to submit jobs to the virtual
    cluster.
In Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE), jobs are associated with virtual
      clusters. Before you can create a job, you must create a virtual cluster that can run it.
      For more information, see Creating virtual clusters.

If you already downloaded the utility script and uploaded it to an
          ECS or HDFS gateway cluster host as documented in Creating virtual clusters, you
          can skip to step 8.

Download cde-utils.sh to your local
          machine.

Create a directory to store the files, and change to that
          directory:
mkdir -p /tmp/cde-1.3.4 && cd /tmp/cde-1.3.4



Embedded Container Service (ECS)
Copy the extracted utility script (cde-utils.sh) to one of the
            Embedded Container Service (ECS) cluster hosts. To identify the ECS cluster hosts:
Log in to the Cloudera Manager web interface.
Go to Clusters > Experience Cluster > ECS > Hosts.
Select one of the listed hosts, and copy the script to that host.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)
Copy the extracted utility script (cde-utils.sh) and the OpenShift
              kubeconfig file to one of the HDFS service gateway hosts, and install
            the kubectl utility:
Log in to the Cloudera Manager web interface.
Go to Clusters > Base Cluster > HDFS > Instances.
Select one of the Gateway hosts, and copy the script to that
              host.
Copy the OCP kubeconfig file to the same host.
On that host, install the kubectl utility following the instructions in the Kubernetes documentation.


On the cluster host that you copied the script to, set the script
          permissions to be
          executable:
chmod +x /path/to/cde-utils.sh

Identify the virtual cluster endpoint:


In the Cloudera Manager web UI, go to the
            Experiences page, and then click
            Open CDP Private Cloud Experiences.
Click the Data Engineering tile.
Select the CDE service containing the virtual cluster you want
            to activate.
Click 
Cluster Details.
Click JOBS API URL to copy the URL to
            your clipboard.
Paste the URL into a text editor to identify the endpoint host.
            For example, the URL is similar to the
            following:https://dfdj6kgx.cde-2cdxw5x5.ecs-demo.example.com/dex/api/v1The
              endpoint host is
              dfdj6kgx.cde-2cdxw5x5.ecs-demo.example.com.



On the ECS or HDFS gateway host, create a filename containing the
          user principal, and generate a keytab. If you do not have the
          ktutil utility, you might need to install the
          krb5-workstation package. The following example
          commands assume the user principal is
          psherman@EXAMPLE.COM

Create a file named
            <username>.principal (for
            example, psherman.principal) containing the user
            principal:psherman@EXAMPLE.COM
Generate a keytab named <username>.keytab for
              the user using ktutil:sudo ktutil

ktutil:  addent -password -p psherman@EXAMPLE.COM -k 1 -e aes256-cts
Password for psherman@EXAMPLE.COM:  
ktutil:  addent -password -p psherman@EXAMPLE.COM -k 2 -e aes128-cts
Password for psherman@EXAMPLE.COM: 
ktutil:  wkt psherman.keytab
ktutil:  q


Validate the keytab using klist and
          kinit:
        klist -ekt psherman.keytab 
Keytab name: FILE:psherman.keytab
KVNO Timestamp           Principal
---- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
   1 08/01/2021 10:29:47 psherman@EXAMPLE.COM (aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96) 
   1 08/01/2021 10:29:47 psherman@EXAMPLE.COM (aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96) 
          
kinit -kt psherman.keytab psherman@EXAMPLE.COMMake
          sure that the keytab is valid before continuing. If the
          kinit command fails, the user will not be able to
          run jobs in the virtual cluster. After verifying that the
          kinit command succeeds, you can destroy the
          Kerberos ticket by running kdestroy.

Use the cde-utils.sh script to copy the user keytab to the virtual
          cluster hosts:
./cde-utils.sh init-user-in-virtual-cluster -h <endpoint_host> -u <user> -p <principal_file> -k <keytab_file>For
          example, using the psherman user, for the
            dfdj6kgx.cde-2cdxw5x5.ecs-demo.example.com endpoint
          host:./cde-utils.sh init-user-in-virtual-cluster -h dfdj6kgx.cde-2cdxw5x5.ecs-demo.example.com -u psherman -p psherman.principal -k psherman.keytab

Repeat these steps for all users that need to submit jobs to the
          virtual cluster.
