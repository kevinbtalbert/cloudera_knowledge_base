Creating and running Spark 3.2.1 Iceberg jobs
Create and run a spark job which uses iceberg tables.

importantYou must complete the manual steps to prepare the cluster
        for each user who need to submit jobs. If your application code directly uses Iceberg
          APIs, you need to build it against the Iceberg dependencies. For more information, see
          Iceberg library dependencies for Spark applications.
In Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE), jobs are associated with virtual
        clusters. Before you can create a job, you must create a virtual cluster
        that can run it. For more information, see Creating virtual clusters.


In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the
          Data Engineering tile. The CDE Home page
          displays.

In the CDE Home page, in Jobs, click
            Create New under Spark or click
            Jobs in the left navigation menu and then click Create
            Job.
Provide the Job Details:

Select Spark for the job type. If you are creating the job
              from the Home page, select the virtual cluster where you want
              to create the job.

Specify the Name.
Select File or
                URL for your application file, and
              provide or specify the file. You can upload a new file or select a
              file from an existing resource.
If your application code is a JAR file, specify the
                Main Class.

Click the Add Configuration button to add the following
              configuration parameters:config_key: cde.iceberg.enabled 
config_value: true

If your application code is a Python file, select the
                Python Version, and optionally select a
                Python Environment.

Click Advanced Configurations to display more customizations,
          such as additional files, initial executors, executor range, driver and executor cores,
          and memory.
By default, the executor range is set to match the range of CPU cores configured for
          the virtual cluster. This improves resource utilization and efficiency by allowing jobs to
          scale up to the maximum virtual cluster resources available, without manually tuning and
          optimizing the number of executors per job.
Click Schedule to display scheduling
          options.You can schedule the application to run
          periodically using the Basic controls or by
          specifying a Cron Expression.
Click Alerts and provide the email id to receive alerts. Click
            + to add more email IDs. Optionally, you can select when you want
          email alerts whether for job failures or missed job service-level agreements or both. 

note You must configure the Configure Email
              Alerting option while creating a virtual cluster to send your email
            alerts. For more information about configuring email alerts, see Creating virtual clusters. 

If you provided a schedule, click
            Schedule to create the job. If you did not
          specify a schedule, and you do not want the job to run immediately,
          click the drop-down arrow on Create and Run and
          select Create. Otherwise, click
            Create and Run to run the job
          immediately.
