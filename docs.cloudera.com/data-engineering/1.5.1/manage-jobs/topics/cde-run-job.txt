Running Jobs in Cloudera Data Engineering
Jobs in CDE can be run on demand, or scheduled to run on an ongoing basis. The
    following instructions demonstrate how to run a job in CDE.



In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the
            Data Engineering tile. The CDE Home page
          displays.

Click Jobs  on the left navigation menu. The
            Jobs page displays.

To run a job immediately, click  in the Actions column next to
          the job, and then click Run Now.
You can cancel a running job by clicking Cancel in the same
            Actions menu.Job Run Notices:The running jobs provide
            notifications, in the form of a
              Bell
              icon next to the job Run ID, when certain conditions are met,
            without having to parse low level logs, or navigating away to a cloud provider or
            Kubernetes interface. This will help you to identify why certain job is running slow or
            stuck, and take actions to rectify this.
