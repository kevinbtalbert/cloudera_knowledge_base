Updating the Airflow file mounts using the CDE CLI [technical preview]
You can update or delete an existing file mount, or add new Airflow file mounts for
        your pipeline with these commands. 
Changing an existing file mount

cde job update --name my_pipeline --airflow-file-mount-1-resource my_new_pipeline_resource


Changing a file mount prefix

cde job update --name my_pipeline --airflow-file-mount-1-prefix my_new_pipeline_resource_prefix


Adding a new file mount
Add a new file mount when one already exists:

cde job update --name my_pipeline --airflow-file-mount-2-resource my_new_pipeline_resource


Removing an existing file mount

cde job update --name my_pipeline --unset-airflow-file-mount-index 2

noteYou can only delete one mount at a time. After the mount is
                deleted, they will be re-indexed.
