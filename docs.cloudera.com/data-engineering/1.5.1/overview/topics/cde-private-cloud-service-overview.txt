Cloudera Data Engineering service
Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) is a service for CDP Private Cloud Data Services that allows you to submit jobs to
    auto-scaling virtual clusters.
Cloudera Data Engineering allows you to create, manage, and schedule
      Apache Spark jobs without the overhead of creating and maintaining Spark
      clusters. With Cloudera Data Engineering, you define virtual clusters with
      a range of CPU and memory resources, and the virtual cluster scales up and
      down as needed to run your Spark workloads.
The CDE service involves several components:

Environment
A logical subset of your private cloud deployment, including a
          datalake and multiple compute resources. For more information, see
            Environments.
CDE Service
A logical subset of the long-running Kubernetes cluster and services
          that manage the virtual clusters. The CDE service must be enabled on
          an environment before you can create any virtual clusters.
Virtual Cluster
An individual auto-scaling cluster with defined CPU and memory
          ranges. Virtual Clusters in CDE can be created and deleted on demand.
          Jobs are associated with clusters.
Job
Application code along with defined configurations and resources.
          Jobs can be run on demand or scheduled. An individual job execution is
          called a job run.
Resource
A defined collection of files such as a Python file or application
          JAR, dependencies, and any other reference files required for a
          job.
Job run
An individual job run.
