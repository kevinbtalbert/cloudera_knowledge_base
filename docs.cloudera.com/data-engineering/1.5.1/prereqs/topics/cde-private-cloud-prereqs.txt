    Cloud
Prerequisites for Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) on Cloudera Data
    Platform (CDP) Private Cloud.
Before deploying CDE, make sure you have reviewed and complied with the
      requirements in the installation guide for your environment:
Installing on OpenShift
Installing using the Embedded Container Service



CDP Private Cloud Base cluster requirements

The CDP Private Cloud Base cluster that you are using for the Cloudera
        Data Engineering service must have the Apache Ozone service enabled.



Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform requirements
For CDE Private Cloud running on Red Hat OpenShift Container
      Platform (OCP), you must configure a route admission policy.
You must configure the OpenShift cluster for running applications in
        multiple namespaces with the same domain name. Run the following
        commands. If you have not installed the oc command line
        utility, install it using the instructions in the OpenShift
        documentation. For instructions on downloading the OCP kubeconfig file,
        see Downloading the kubernetes
          Configuration.
