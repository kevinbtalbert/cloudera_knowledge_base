Accessing Grafana dashboards
Cloudera provides pre-built Grafana dashboards comprising metrics data, charts, and
    other visuals. You can access pre-built Grafana dashboards to monitor your jobs and virtual
    clusters in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE). You can immediately view the Kubernetes and Virtual
    Cluster Metrics pre-built dashboards in CDE.
You must first connect to the Grafana dashboards in CDE Private Cloud to view the
        Kubernetes and Virtual Cluster Metrics
      dashboards.

After you connect to the Grafana Dashboards from the CDE UI, click the   icon
          to view the left navigation pane. 

Click Dashboards > Browse. The Dashboards
          screen is displayed. 

In the Browse tab of Dashboards, click
            Kubernetes or Virtual Cluster Metrics to
          view the respective dashboard.
