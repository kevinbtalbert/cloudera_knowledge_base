Cloudera Data Engineering diagnostic bundles and summary status
Cloudera Data Engineering provides the ability to download log files, diagnostic data,
    and a summary status for the running CDE services and virtual clusters. You can provide this
    data to Cloudera Support for assistance troubleshooting an issue.
The following section describes about CDE Diagnostic Bundles and Summary Status, and the
      information collected in each.
Diagnostic Bundle
importantThe CDE service inCDP Private Cloud Data Services does not currently support diagnostic
        bundles.
The diagnostic bundle is a collection of the logs from the CDE Services. These logs can be
        downloaded on-demand from CDE UI. CDE gives you the functionality to select the sources for
        which you want to download the logs and you can also select a predefined or custom time
        range for these logs.
Information Collected in Diagnostic Bundles
Container logs for all running CDE service pods (excluding user compute pods).


Summary Status
The Status Summary shows the status of each service instance being managed by the CDE
        Control Plane. It is a package of JSON files consisting of information related to
        configuration, monitoring, logging, events and health test results of the service and its
        instances.
Information Collected in Summary Status

Status of all cloud resources created during CDE provisioning
Kubernetes resource status for critical infrastructure pods, deployments, pods, services
          and events for core service infrastructure pods or virtual cluster infrastructure
          pods
