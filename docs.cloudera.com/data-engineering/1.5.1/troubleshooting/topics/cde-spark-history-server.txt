Using Spark history server to troubleshoot Spark jobs
The Spark history server is a monitoring tool that displays information about completed
    Spark applications. It provides information for debugging such as Spark configurations, DAG
    execution, driver and executor resource utilization, application logs, and job, stage and
    task-level details. 
To view spark history server information for a job run:

In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the Data
          Engineering tile. The CDE Home page displays.
Click Jobs in the left navigation menu.
From the drop-down in the upper left-hand corner, select the Virtual
          Cluster that you want to restore jobs to.
Select the job that you want to troubleshoot.
Click Jobs Runs in the left menu, and click the Run
          ID for the job run you want to view the information. 
Click the Spark UI tab to access the Spark History Server.
