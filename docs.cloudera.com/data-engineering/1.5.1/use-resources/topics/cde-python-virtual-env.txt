Using Python virtual environments with Cloudera Data
    Engineering
Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) supports Python virtual
    environments to manage job dependencies by using the
      python-env
resource type.
A resource in CDE is a
      named collection of files or other resources referenced by a job. The
        python-env resource type allows you to specify a requirements.txt
      file that defines a virtual environment that you can then associate with a
      CDE job. You can specify any Python package in the
        requirements.txt file, including those with C
      dependencies.

Creating a Python virtual environment resourceAfter you have created the requirements.txt file,     you can create the Python virtual environment resource.Associating a Python virtual environment with a Cloudera Data Engineering jobYou can associate the Python virtual environment with a CDE job at     the time of creation, or you can update an existing job.Updating Python virtual environment resourcesCurrently, Python virtual environments cannot be updated. Instead,     create a new Python virtual environment resource and update the job to     reference the new resource.
