Updating Python virtual environment resources
Currently, Python virtual environments cannot be updated. Instead,
    create a new Python virtual environment resource and update the job to
    reference the new resource.
CDE CLIWeb UI
Before you begin

Download and configure the CDE CLI.
Create a new requirements.txt file specifying the
            Python package and version dependencies required by your CDE
            job.

Steps

Create a new python-env
            resource.cde resource create --name new-cde-python-env-resource --type python-env --python-version python3
Upload the new or updated requirements.txt file
            to the new
            resource.cde resource upload --name new-cde-python-env-resource --local-path ${HOME}/requirements.txt
Update the CDE job to specify the new
            resource.cde job update --name pyspark-example --python-env-resource-name new-cde-python-env-resource


Before you begin

Create a new requirements.txt file specifying the
            Python package and version dependencies required by your CDE
            job.

Steps

Create a new Python virtual environment using the new
              requirements.txt file, following the instructions
            in Creating a Python virtual
              environment resource. 
Update the CDE job to reference the new Python virtual
            environment, following the instructions in Associating a Python virtual
              environment with a CDE job.
