Creating a Cloudera Data Engineering job using the API
You can create a job in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) using the
    CDE jobs API endpoint.

Request an access token and save it as an environment variable to use in API calls. For
        instructions, see Getting a Cloudera Data Engineering API access
          token.importantThe
          user interface for  CDE 1.17 and above has been updated. The left-hand menu was updated to
          provide easy access  to commonly used pages. The steps below will vary slightly, for
          example, the  Overview page has been replaced with the 
            Home page. To view CDE Services, click 
            Administration in the left-hand menu. The new home page still 
          displays Virtual Clusters, but now includes quick-access links located at the top for the 
          following categories: Jobs, Resources, and 
            Download & Docs.If you're using secrets or if you want to
            access workload secrets, refer to Managing workload secrets with Cloudera Data
            Engineering using the API linked below.


Determine the API URL for the virtual cluster you want to access
          using the API:

Navigate to the Cloudera Data Engineering
                Overview page.

In the CDE Services column, select the environment
              containing the virtual cluster you want to interact with using the API.

In the Virtual Clusters column on
              the right, click the Cluster Details icon
              for the virtual cluster you want to interact with.
Copy the URL under JOBS API
              URL.For example:
                https://pmjkrgn5.cde-czlmkz4y.na-01.xvp2-7p8o.cloudera.site/dex/api/v1


Submit the job creation request using the API to the
            /jobs endpoint.
The JSON payload to create a job is structured as
          follows:{
  "name": "demoJob",
  "spark": {
    "className": "com.example.demoJobMainClass",
    "file": "local:/path/to/demoJobJar"
  },
  "type": "spark"
}

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CDE_TOKEN}" <jobs_api_url>/jobs \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-X POST -d "{\"name\":\"demoJob\",\"spark\":{\"className\":\"com.example.demoJobMainClass\",\"file\":\"local:/path/to/demoJobJar\"},\"type\":\"spark\"}"

Verify the job was created. You can view job details using the
              /jobs/<jobName>
          endpoint:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CDE_TOKEN}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET "https://pmjkrgn5.cde-czlmkz4y.na-01.xvp2-7p8o.cloudera.site/dex/api/v1/jobs/demoJob"
