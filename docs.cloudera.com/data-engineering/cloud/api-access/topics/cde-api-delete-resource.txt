Deleting a Cloudera Data Engineering resource using the API
A resource in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) is a
    named collection of files referenced by a job. The files can include
    application code, configuration files, and even Python virtual environment
    specifications (requirements.txt). You can delete a
    resource using the CDE API.

As with all API calls, make sure you have a valid access token. For
        instructions, see Getting a Cloudera Data Engineering API
          access token.

Make sure that you no longer need the resource before deleting
          it.Delete the resource by sending a DELETE
          request to the
            /resources/<resourceName>
          endpoint.For example, to delete a resource named
            example-job-files:curl <jobs_api_url>/example-job-files \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${CDE_TOKEN}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-X DELETE
