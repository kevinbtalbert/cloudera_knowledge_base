Getting a Cloudera Data Engineering API access token
Cloudera Data Engineering uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for API
    authentication. To interact with a virtual cluster using the API, you must
    obtain an access token for that cluster.

importantThe user interface
          for  CDE 1.17 and above has been updated. The left-hand menu was updated to provide easy
          access  to commonly used pages. The steps below will vary slightly, for example, the 
            Overview page has been replaced with the 
            Home page. To view CDE Services, click 
            Administration in the left-hand menu. The new home page still 
          displays Virtual Clusters, but now includes quick-access links located at the top for the 
          following categories: Jobs, Resources, and 
            Download & Docs.Determine the authentication endpoint
        for your virtual cluster:

Navigate to the Cloudera Data Engineering
            Overview page by clicking the Data
            Engineering tile in the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP)
          management console.
In the CDE Services column, select the environment containing the
          virtual cluster you want to interact with.
In the Virtual Clusters column on the right,
          click the Cluster Details icon on the virtual
          cluster you want to interact with.
Click the link under GRAFANA CHARTS. The
          hostname of the URL in your browser is the base URL, and
            /gateway/authtkn/knoxtoken/api/v1/token is the
          endpoint. For
          example:https://service.cde-czlmkz4y.na-01.xvp2-7p8o.cloudera.site/gateway/authtkn/knoxtoken/api/v1/token



From the client you want to use to access the API, run curl
            -u <workload_user> <auth_endpoint>. Enter your
          workload password when prompted.For
          example:curl -u csso_psherman https://service.cde-czlmkz4y.na-01.xvp2-7p8o.cloudera.site/gateway/authtkn/knoxtoken/api/v1/tokenThe
          user account is your CDP workload
        user.In the output, the access_token value is the
          JWT. For convenience, copy it and set it as an environment
          variable:
export CDE_TOKEN=<access_token>
Alternatively, you can set the token in a single step
          using jq to extract the
          token:export CDE_TOKEN=$(curl -s -u <workload_user> <auth_endpoint> | jq -r '.access_token')
See Using an access token in Cloudera Data
        Engineering API calls for instructions on using the token in API
      calls.
