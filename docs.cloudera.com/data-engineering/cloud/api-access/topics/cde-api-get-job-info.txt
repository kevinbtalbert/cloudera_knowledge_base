Getting Cloudera Data Engineering job information using the
    API
You can get Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) job information using
    the API by issuing a GET request to the
        /jobs/<job_name>
    endpoint.

Get an access token and save it as an environment variable as described in Getting a Cloudera Data Engineering API access
          token.importantThe
          user interface for  CDE 1.17 and above has been updated. The left-hand menu was updated to
          provide easy access  to commonly used pages. The steps below will vary slightly, for
          example, the  Overview page has been replaced with the 
            Home page. To view CDE Services, click 
            Administration in the left-hand menu. The new home page still 
          displays Virtual Clusters, but now includes quick-access links located at the top for the 
          following categories: Jobs, Resources, and 
            Download & Docs.


Determine the API URL for the virtual cluster you want to access
          using the API:

Navigate to the Cloudera Data Engineering
                Overview page.

In the CDE Services column, select the environment
              containing the virtual cluster you want to interact with using the API.

In the Virtual Clusters column on
              the right, click the Cluster Details icon
              for the virtual cluster you want to interact with.
Copy the URL under JOBS API
              URL.For example:
                https://pmjkrgn5.cde-czlmkz4y.na-01.xvp2-7p8o.cloudera.site/dex/api/v1

Issue a GET request to the
              /jobs/<jobname>
          endpoint:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CDE_TOKEN}" -X GET "https://pmjkrgn5.cde-czlmkz4y.na-01.xvp2-7p8o.cloudera.site/dex/api/v1/jobs/SparkPi"
