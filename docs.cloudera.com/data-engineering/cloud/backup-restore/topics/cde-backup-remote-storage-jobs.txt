Backing up Cloudera Data Engineering jobs on remote storage 
You can back up Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) jobs and associated resources. Backups
    are saved as zip files that can be used to restore jobs and their associated resources. Backups
    and restores is also supported for remote storage (also known as object store).
noteCurrently, the user who runs the cde backup restore
      command has permissions, by default, to run the Jobs. This may cause CDE jobs to fail if the
      workload user differs from the user who runs the Jobs on Source CDE Service where the backup
      was performed. This failure is due to the Workload User having different privileges as the
      user who is expected to run the job. Additionally, backup and restore functionality does not
      include Airflow metadata related to connections and variable definitions. Those must be
      manually recreated in the new service.

Steps for backing up on remote storage

Run the cde backup create command to create a backup of the jobs in the virtual
            cluster your CDE CLI is configured to interact with. By default, all job configurations
            in the cluster are backed up, but the resources are not. You can use command flags to
            change this behavior as follows:
--include-job-resources
Backs up all resources associated with the selected jobs. These resources cannot
                  be filtered out by the --resource-filter parameter.
--include-jobs
Backs up all jobs in the virtual cluster. This is the default behavior.

--include-resources
Backs up all resources in the virtual cluster, including those not associated
                  with jobs.

--job-filter <filter_string>
Selects jobs to back up using the fieldname[operator]argument
                  syntax. This command flag can be repeated. The name of the job and resource API
                  field is 'fieldname' and 'operator is one of the following: 'eq', 'noteq',
                    'lte', 'lt', 'gte', 'gt', 'in', 'notin', 'like', 'rlike'. Multiple
                  filters are ANDed. For example: 
[[[[[[[[Please provide example]]]]]]]]]


--resource-filter <filter_string>
Selects resources to back up using the
                    fieldname[operator]argument syntax. This command flag can be
                  repeated. Filter by adding detail to the filter syntax, for example, filter syntax
                  'fieldname[operator]argument'. The name of the job and resource API field is
                  'fieldname' and 'operator is one of the following: 'eq', 'noteq', 'lte',
                    'lt', 'gte', 'gt', 'in', 'notin', 'like', 'rlike'. Multiple filters are
                  ANDed. For example: 
'name[noteq]my-resource','created[gte]2020-01-01'


--remote-storage
Backsup to remote storage. The default value is false

 --remote-path
The remote backup file relative path must be used together with param
                  remote-storage. The path should not include a file name and should be relative to
                  dir /dex/backup/.

--remote-name
The remote backup file name must be used together with param remote-storage. If
                  the file name is not specified, then a default generated value will be used.


Example for backing up to remote storage all jobs and its related resources, plus all
            resources whose name contains "data".
cde backup create --remote-storage --include-resources --resource-filter "name[like]%data%"
Example for creating a backup on remote storage:
./cde backup create --remote-storage --remote-path test --remote-name archive.zip

# output 
{"archiveRelativePath":"test/archive.zip","archiveURL":"s3a://dex-dev-default-aws-storage/datalake/logs/dex/backup/test/archive.zip","code":201} 

Result
Depending on your browser settings, you are either prompted for a location to save the
          file, or the file is downloaded to your default download location. The file is a ZIP file
          named archive-<timestamp>.zip.
