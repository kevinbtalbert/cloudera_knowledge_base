Interacting with a Session using the CDE CLI
Once your Session has been created, you can interact with it using the cde sessions
    interact command.
Below is an example that demonstrates how to interact with a
      PySpark or Scala Session in CDE using the CLI.
Ensure that you are using a version of CDE 1.19 or higher for your Virtual Cluster and
      ensure that you have set up the CDE CLI client and have created a CDE Session using the CLI or
      UI. For more information, see  Using the Cloudera Data
        Engineering command line interface.

Run the following command in the CDE CLI: 

cde session interact --name <session-name>
