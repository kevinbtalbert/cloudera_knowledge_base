Managing the status of scheduled job instances
Using the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) command line interface (CLI), you can clear
        the statuses of a range of scheduled instances or mark a scheduled job instance as
        successful.

To clear the status of a range of scheduled instances, run the following
                    command:

cde job schedule clear [--schedule-start <start of clear period>] [--schedule-end <end of clear period>]



To mark a single scheduled instance as successful, run the following
                    command:

cde job schedule mark-success --execution-date <execution date of scheduled instance>

where <execution date of scheduled instance>  is the
                        timestamp that the instance was scheduled for, not when it actually ran.
