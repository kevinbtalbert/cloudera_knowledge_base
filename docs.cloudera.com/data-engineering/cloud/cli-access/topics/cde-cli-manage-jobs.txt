Managing Cloudera Data Engineering jobs using the CLI
A job in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) is a definition of something that
  CDE can run. For example, the information required to run a JAR file on Spark with specific
  configurations. A 'job run' is an execution of a job. For example, one run of a Spark job on a CDE
  cluster.
Creating and updating Apache Spark jobs using the CLIThe following example demonstrates how to create a Spark     application in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) using the command line     interface (CLI).Creating and updating Apache Airflow jobs using the CLIThe following example demonstrates how to create an Airflow DAG in Cloudera Data     Engineering (CDE) using the command line interface (CLI).Listing jobs using the CLITo view existing applications, run cde job list. To view details for a     specific application, run cde job describe --name       <job_name>Submitting a Spark job using the CLIThe following example demonstrates how to submit a JAR or Python file to run on CDE         Spark in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) using the command line interface (CLI).Running raw Scala code in Cloudera Data EngineeringCloudera Data Engineering (CDE) supports running raw Scala code     from the command line, without compiling it into a JAR file. You can use the       cde spark submit command to run a .scala     file. CDE recognizes the file as Scala code and runs it using       spark-shell in batch mode rather than       spark-submit.Submitting an Airflow job using the CLIThe following example demonstrates how to submit a DAG file to immediately run on CDE         Airflow in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) using the command line interface         (CLI).Running a Spark job using the CLIThe following example demonstrates how to run a Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Spark         job using the command line interface (CLI).Running a Airflow job using the CLIThe following example demonstrates how to run a Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE)         Airflow job using the command line interface (CLI).
