Enabling, disabling, and pausing scheduled jobs
Using the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) command line interface (CLI), you can
        enable, disable, or pause scheduled job runs.

note
Disabling the schedule removes all record of prior schedule instances.

note
Pausing and unpausing the schedule does not remove the record of prior schedule
                    instances.



To enable or disable a job schedule, use the following command:

cde job (create | update) --name <job name> --schedule-enabled=(true | false) ...



To pause a job schedule upon schedule creation:

cde job (create | update) --name <job name> --schedule-enabled=true --schedule-paused=true ...



To pause an existing job schedule:

cde job schedule pause --name <job name>



To unpause an existing job schedule:

cde job schedule unpause --name <job name>
