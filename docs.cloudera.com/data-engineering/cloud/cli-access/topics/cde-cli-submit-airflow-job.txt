Submitting an Airflow job using the CLI
The following example demonstrates how to submit a DAG file to immediately run on CDE
        Airflow in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) using the command line interface
        (CLI).

Using the cde airflow submit command is a quick and efficient way of
                testing an Airflow job, as it spares you the task of creating and uploading
                resources and job definitions before running the job, and cleaning up after running
                the job.
This command is recommended only for Airflow DAGs that need to be run just once,
                because the DAG is removed from Airflow at the end of the run. To manage Airflow
                DAGs that need to be run more than once, or that contain schedules, use cde
                    job run instead of this command.


To submit a DAG file to run on CDE Airflow, use the CLI command:

cde airflow submit <DAG python file> [--config <key=value>]* [--job-name <job name>]    
To see the full command syntax and supported options, run cde airflow
                            submit --help.

For example:To submit a job with a local DAG
                    file:cde airflow submit my-dag.py

When the job has been submitted the CLI displays the job run ID, waits for
                        the job to terminate, and returns an exit code of 0 for
                        success or 1 for failure.
