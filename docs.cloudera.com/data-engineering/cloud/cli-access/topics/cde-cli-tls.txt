Cloudera Data Engineering CLI TLS configuration

All CDE virtual cluster endpoints are configured with TLS. In non-production or on-premises
   environments the TLS certificates are usually signed by a non-production or non-public
   certificate authority (CA). In these cases, without additional configuration, the CLI tool fails
   as it attempts to validate the API server's TLS certificate. The CLI provides a TLS configuration
   when using non-public/non-production CAs.
Specify a file containing the PEM encoded public certificate(s) of the signing CA in one of the
   following ways:

add the --tls-ca-certs [***/PATH/TO/CA.PEM***] flag on
    the command line
define the tls-ca-certs: [***/PATH/TO/CA.PEM***] variable
    in the ~/.cde/config.yaml configuration file
set the CDE_TLS_CA_CERTS environment variable 

Replace [***/PATH/TO/CA.PEM***] with the path to a valid
    ca.pem file.
Certificates for CDE are issued and signed by LetsEncrypt and Amazon. If
      you are using an older system that does not already trust these
      certificate authorities, you must specify them as trusted using the
        --tls-ca-certs option. Additionally, if you are using
      the CDE CLI on Microsoft Windows with the --tls-ca-certs
      option, the operating system trusted root CAs are ignored. To make sure
      that your CA certificate file includes all of the necessary certificates,
      you can download the certificate chain from by doing the following:

Go to the Cloudera Data Engineering Overview
        page.
In the Environments column, select the
        environment containing the virtual cluster you want to interact
        with.
In the Virtual Clusters column on the right,
        click the Cluster Details icon for the virtual
        cluster you want to interact with.
Click JOBS API URL to copy the link to your
        clipboard.
Paste the link into your browser and press
          Enter.
In your browser, click the lock icon to view the certificate
        chain.
Export the certificate chain as a Base64-encoded X.509 certificate
        (.CER). Save it as ca.pem.

tipWhen using the CLI on Windows, remember to use path styles
      such as C:\Users\janeblogs\.cde\ca.pem when referencing
      local files.
