Using the Cloudera Data Engineering command line interface
Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) provides a command line interface
    (CLI) client. You can use the CLI to create and update jobs, view job
    details, manage job resources, run jobs, and so on.
noteThe CLI client is not forward compatible. Download
      the client for the version of the cluster you are accessing. The
        Cluster Details page for every virtual cluster
      includes a link to download the CLI client for that cluster
      version.
The CLI client can also use a password file for non-interactive uses,
      such as automation frameworks.
