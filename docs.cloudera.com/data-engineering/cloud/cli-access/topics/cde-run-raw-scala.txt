Running raw Scala code in Cloudera Data Engineering
Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) supports running raw Scala code
    from the command line, without compiling it into a JAR file. You can use the
      cde spark submit command to run a .scala
    file. CDE recognizes the file as Scala code and runs it using
      spark-shell in batch mode rather than
      spark-submit.

Limitations:


When setting the Log Level from the user interface, the setting is not applied to
              the raw Scala jobs.
Do not use package <something> in the raw Scala job file
              as Raw Scala File is used for Scripting and not for Jar development and
              packaging.



noteCDE does not currently support interactive sessions. The Scala code
      runs in batch mode spark-shell.
Run cde spark submit as follows to run a Scala file:
cde spark submit filename.scala --jar <jar_dependency_1> --jar <jar_dependency_2> ...
