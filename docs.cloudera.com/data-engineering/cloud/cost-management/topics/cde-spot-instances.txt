Cloudera Data Engineering Spot Instances
Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) supports spot instances to
    facilitate cloud cost savings for workloads that are not SLA-bound. If you
    have enabled spot instances for your CDE service, when you create a virtual
    cluster, you can specify whether drivers and executors run on spot instances
    or on-demand instances. The default setting uses on-demand instances for
    drivers, and spot instances for executors.
note Spot Instances are not currently supported for CDE on Microsoft
        Azure.Spot instances are discounted instances that can be reclaimed at any time by
      the cloud provider. For fault-tolerant workloads such as Apache Spark, utilizing spot
      instances can provide significant cost savings. Because spot instances can disappear,
      impacting job performance, Cloudera recommends only using them for workloads without strict
      SLA requirements.
For development, testing, and other workloads that have more flexible
      requirements, Cloudera recommends using on-demand instances for drivers,
      and spot instances for executors. This reduces the impact of losing a spot
      instance, because executor failure recovery is more efficient than
      recovery from a driver failure.
To use spot instances, you must enable them on the CDE service. For
      instructions, see Enabling Cloudera Data
      Engineering. You cannot enable spot instances on an existing CDE
      service. To use spot instances, create a new service.
After you have enabled spot instances for the CDE service, you can
      configure individual virtual clusters to use on-demand instances only,
      spot instances only, or the default hybrid model (on-demand for drivers,
      spot for executors).
