Enabling a Cloudera Data Engineering service
Before you can use the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service, you
    must enable it on each environment that you want to use CDE on.

Make sure that you have a working environment for which you want to
        enable the CDE service. For more information about environments, see
          Environments.
importantThe user interface for
        CDE 1.17 and above has been updated. The left-hand menu was updated to provide easy access
        to commonly used pages. The steps below will vary slightly, for example, the
          Overview page has been replaced with the
          Home page. You enable a CDE service by clicking
          Administration on the left-hand menu, then proceed to step 2 listed
        below. The new home page still displays Virtual Clusters, but now includes quick-access
        links located at the top for the following categories: Jobs,
          Resources, and Download & Docs.
noteCDE on Microsoft Azure does not currently support SSD or Spot
        instances.


In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the
            Data Engineering tile. The CDE Home page
          displays.

Click Administration in the left navigation menu. The
            Administration page displays.

In the Services column, click the plus icon at the top to enable
          CDE for an environment.

Type the name of the service that you want to enable CDE for. 

Select the Environment from the drop-down menu. 
Select the Workload Type.The
          workload type corresponds to the instance size that will be deployed
          to run your submitted Spark jobs. When you select a type, the
          corresponding cloud provider instance size is displayed in the
            Summary section to the right.
If you want to use SSD storage, check the box labeled
                Use SSD instances. In this configuration,
              SSD storage is used for the workload filesystem, such as the Spark
              local directory. If your workload requires more space than is
              available in the instance storage, select a larger instance type
              with sufficient local storage or select an instance type without
              SSD, and then configure the EBS volume size.
Set the Auto-Scale Range.The
          range you set here creates an auto scaling group with the
          specified minimum and maximum number of instances that can be used.
          The CDE service launches and shuts down instances as needed within
          this range. The instance size is determined by the Workload
            Type you selected.If you want to use spot instances, check the box labeled
            Use Spot instances and select a range of spot
          instances to request. This creates another auto scaling group of spot
          instances. Spot instances are requested with similar CPU and memory
          profiles as the instances selected for the Workload
            Type. For more information, see Cloudera Data Engineering Spot
            Instances.
On Microsoft Azure you may create a fully private AKS cluster by selecting
            Enable Private Network.

noteCurrently this feature is only available on Microsoft
            Azure.
note
Fully private AKS cluster setup is currently supported as a Technical Preview.
              Contact your Cloudera account representative to enable access to this feature.




Optionally, on Microsoft Azure, you can select the User Defined
                Routing checkbox. Use this to avoid exposing public IP addresses in your
              service by using a user defined routing (UDR) table. After, you'll need to specify a
              Subnet.



If you create the service in an AWS environment using a non-transparent proxy, you find
          a Proxy CIDR Source Ranges field. You are only required to enter
          the proxy CIDR ranges for the proxy instances if you registered your proxies using host
          names, as the Cloudera Control Plane has no way to resolve those to IPs. If your proxy
          instances were registered using IP addresses, you can leave this field blank.
For example, if you have a load balanced proxy with static IPs running on
          10.80.199.105 and 10.80.200.45, add "10.80.199.105/32" and "10.80.200.45/32". If your
          proxy instances are dynamic (behind a load balancer or virtual IP) then you would enter a
          wider range, e.g.: "10.80.200.0/24".noteCurrently non-transparent support is only
            available on Amazon Web Services.

If you want to create a load balancing endpoint in a public subnet, check the box
          labeled Enable Public Loadbalancer. If you leave this unchecked,
          the load balancing endpoint will be created in a private subnet, and you will need to
          configure access manually in your cloud account.

Specify a comma-separated list of CIDRs in API server Authorized IP
            Ranges that can access the Kubernetes master API server.
You may specify a comma-separated list of CIDRs that can access the Kubernetes master
          API server. noteLeaving this field empty renders
            the Kubernetes API server open to all traffic. 
Make sure that the provided IP addresses do not overlap with the following ranges:
0.0.0.0 - 0.255.255.255
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
100.64.0.0 - 100.127.255.255
127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255
169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255s
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
192.0.0.0 - 192.0.0.255
192.0.2.0 - 192.0.2.255
192.88.99.0 - 192.88.99.255
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
198.18.0.0 - 198.19.255.255
198.51.100.0 - 198.51.100.255
203.0.113.0 - 203.0.113.255
224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255
240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.254
255.255.255.255


Specify a comma-separated list of client IP ranges in Load Balancer Source
            Ranges that should be allowed to access the load balancer. 

Specify which subnets to use for the Kubernetes worker nodes. Select from available
            Subnets in the drop-down list.

Check the box labeled Enable Workload Analytics to automatically
          send diagnostic information from job execution to Cloudera Workload Manager.

Optionally add Tags as needed. Tags are applied to the cloud
          provider resources associated with the CDE service (including virtual clusters created in
          that service). For more information about tags, see the cloud provider
          documentation:


Amazon AWS

Microsoft Azure
Use tags to organize your Azure resources and
                  management hierarchy



Default Virtual Cluster selection is enabled by default to
          create a default virtual cluster after enabling a CDE service. This will help you get a
          jump start to create your jobs easily, without having to wait to create a CDE virtual
          cluster as mentioned in Creating virtual clusters, making the onboarding
          smoother. You can turn this toggle off if you do not wish to use a default virtual
          cluster.

Click Enable.

The CDE Administration page displays the status of the
      environment initialization. You can view logs for the environment by clicking on the
      environment vertical ellipsis menu, and then clicking View
      Logs.
