Limiting Incoming Endpoint Traffic for CDE Services For AWS
You can limit incoming endpoint traffic for a CDE service.

importantThe user interface for
        CDE 1.17 and above has been updated. The left-hand menu was updated to provide easy access
        to commonly used pages. The steps below will vary slightly, for example, the
          Overview page has been replaced with the
          Home page. The new home page still displays Virtual Clusters, but
        now includes quick-access links located at the top for the following categories:
          Jobs, Resources, and Download
          & Docs.


Note the CDE service ID, which you can obtain from the URL in the CDE Management
          Console when the service is highlighted:


Go to the AWS console for the account where the CDE service is enabled.

Navigate to EC2 -> Load Balancers in the AWS console and enter the
          following filter:

 tag:cde-cluster-id : <id_from_step_1>
, e.g. tag:cde-cluster-id : cluster-cn92cs9g


Select the Load Balancer instance and then under the
            Description tab in the Detail window,
          click on the link to the Source Security Group.

In the subsequent view, select the correct security group ID.

In the subsequent window, click Edit inbound rules.

Modify the "0.0.0.0/0" CIDR ranges for the HTTPS rule to your desired CIDR ranges. 
Add additional ranges and rules as required but note that HTTPS traffic must be
          enabled for each range. The HTTP (port 80) and ICMP rules can be removed.
