Deleting virtual clusters
If you no longer need a particular virtual cluster, you can delete
    it. Deleting a virtual cluster instantly deletes all metadata associated
    with the cluster, including job configurations and log files. Do not delete
    a virtual cluster unless you are certain you no longer need access to any of
    the applications, jobs, or log files. Job run history is maintained
    separately, and is not deleted even if you delete a virtual
    cluster.

importantThe user interface for
        CDE 1.17 and above has been updated. The left-hand menu was updated to provide easy access
        to commonly used pages. The steps below will vary slightly, for example, the
          Overview page has been replaced with the
          Home page. The new home page still displays Virtual Clusters, but
        now includes quick-access links located at the top for the following categories:
          Jobs, Resources, and Download
          & Docs.


On the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE)

          containing the virtual cluster that you want to delete.In the Virtual Clusters column for the
          selected environment, click the menu icon at the top right of the
          virtual cluster that you want to delete, and then click
            Delete.
warningDeleting a virtual cluster deletes all metadata
          associated with the cluster, including job configurations and log
          files. Do not do this unless you are certain that you no longer need
          any of these.Confirm that you want to delete the cluster
          by entering the cluster name and then clicking
            Delete.
