Locking and unlocking a CDE Service
Locking a Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Service freezes the configuration of a
        Service and its corresponding Virtual Clusters. When a Service is locked, you are unable to
        edit, add, or delete a Service and its Virtual Clusters.

You may want to lock a Service in scenarios where you don't want configuration
                changes to occur during a planned upgrade of CDE. The lock and unlock options will
                display interchangeably, depending on the state that the Service is in. For example,
                if the Service is unlocked, you will only see the Lock
                    Service option when you complete the steps below. Once your Service
                is locked, you will see the option to Unlock it as you
                complete the steps below.

Note that locking a Service is a preview feature starting in
            CDE 1.19. Ensure that you are on CDE 1.19 and above.

In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the
                        Data Engineering tile. The CDE
                        Home page displays.

Click Administration.

Locate the Service that you want to lock or unlock.

Click  on
                    the Service, and select the Lock Service or
                        Unlock Service option.

Enter the name of the Service that you want to lock or unlock as this confirms
                    your choice.

Click the appropriate Lock Service or Unlock
                        button.
