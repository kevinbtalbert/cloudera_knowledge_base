Deleting Jobs in Cloudera Data Engineering
If you no longer need a job, you can delete it. Deleting a job does
    not delete the job run history.

importantThe user interface for
        CDE 1.17 and above has been updated. The left-hand menu was updated to provide easy access
        to commonly used pages. The steps below will vary slightly, for example, the
          Overview page has been replaced with the
          Home page. You can also view jobs by clicking
          Jobs on the left-hand menu, then selecting your desired Virtual
        Cluster from a drop-down at the top of the Jobs page. To view CDE
        Services, click Administration on the left-hand menu. The new home
        page still displays Virtual Clusters, but now includes quick-access links located at the top
        for the following categories: Jobs, Resources,
        and Download & Docs.


In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) management console, click the Data
            Engineering tile and click Overview.

In the CDE Services column, select the environment containing
          the virtual cluster where you want to delete the job.
In the Virtual Clusters column on the
          right, click the View Jobs icon on the virtual
          cluster containing the job you want to delete.
