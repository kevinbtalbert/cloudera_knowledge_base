Running Jobs in Cloudera Data Engineering
Jobs in CDE can be run on demand, or scheduled to run on an ongoing basis. The
    following instructions demonstrate how to run a job in CDE.

importantThe user interface for
        CDE 1.17 and above has been updated. The left-hand menu was updated to provide easy access
        to commonly used pages. The steps below will vary slightly, for example, the
          Overview page has been replaced with the
          Home page. You can also manage a job by clicking
          Jobs on the left-hand menu, then selecting your desired Virtual
        Cluster from a drop-down at the top of the Jobs page. To view CDE
        Services, click Administration on the left-hand menu. The new home
        page still displays Virtual Clusters, but now includes quick-access links located at the top
        for the following categories: Jobs, Resources,
        and Download & Docs.


In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) management console, click the Data
            Engineering tile and click Overview.

In the CDE Services column, select the environment containing
          the virtual cluster where you want to run the job.

In the Virtual Clusters column on the right, click the
            View Jobs icon on the virtual cluster containing the job you want
          to run.

To run a job immediately, click the Actions menu next to the
          application, and then click Run.
You can cancel a running job by clicking Cancel in the same
            Actions menu.Job Run Notices:The running jobs provide
            notifications, in the form of a Bell icon next to the job Run ID, when certain
            conditions are met, without having to parse low level logs, or navigating away to a
            cloud provider or Kubernetes interface. This will help you to identify why certain job
            is running slow or stuck, and take actions to rectify this.
