Accessing Iceberg tables
CDP uses Apache Ranger to provide centralized security administration and management.
  The Ranger Admin UI is the central interface for security administration. You can use Ranger to
  create two policies that allow users to query Iceberg tables.
How you open the Ranger Admin UI differs from one CDP service to another. In Management
   Console, you can select your environment, and then click Environment Details > Quick Links > Ranger. 

You log into the Ranger Admin UI, and the Ranger Service Manager appears. 


The default policies that appear differ from service to service. You need to set up two Hadoop
   SQL policies to query Iceberg tables:


One to authorize users to access the Iceberg filesFollow steps in "Edit a policy to access Iceberg files" below.

This policy is one of the two Ranger policies required to         use Iceberg.Creating a policy to query an Iceberg table You learn how to set up the second required policy for using Iceberg. This policy         manages SQL query access to Iceberg tables.Parent topic: Using Apache Iceberg in Cloudera Data Engineering
