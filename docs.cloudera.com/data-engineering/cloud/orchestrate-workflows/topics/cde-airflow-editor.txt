Creating an Airflow DAG using the Pipeline UICloudera Docs
Creating an Airflow DAG using the Pipeline UI
With the CDE Pipeline UI, you can create multi-step pipelines with a combination of
        available operators. 

This feature is available starting in CDE 1.16 in new Virtual Cluster
                installations.
noteCloudera supports all major browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox
                and Safari) for this feature. If you’re using a browser in incognito mode, you’ll
                need to allow all cookies in your browser settings so that you can view Pipelines,
                Spark, Airflow page.


Go to Jobs > Create Job.
Under Job details, select
                        Airflow.
The UI refreshes, only Airflow-specific options remain.

Specify a name for the job.

Under DAG File select the Editor
                    option.

Click Create.
You are redirected to the job Editor
                    tab.

Build your Airflow pipeline.


Drag and drop operators to the canvas from the left hand pane.
When selecting an operator, you can configure it in the editor pane that
                            opens up. On the Configure tab you can provide
                                operator-specific settings. The Advanced tab
                                allows you to make generic settings that are common to all
                                operators, for example execution timeout or retries.
Create dependencies between tasks by selecting them and drawing an arrow
                            from one of the four nodes on their edges to another task. If the
                            dependency is valid the task is highlighted in green. If invalid, it is
                            highlighted in red.
To modify DAG-level configuration, select
                                Configurations on the upper right.



When you are done with building your pipeline, click
                        Save.
