Creating a basic Airflow pipeline using CDE CLI
By creating a basic pipeline in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) using the CLI, you
        can create multi-step pipelines with a combination of available operators. 

To create a basic pipeline in CDE, you must upload the Airflow (Directed Acyclic
                Graph) DAG to a CDE resource and create a CDE Airflow job from this DAG.


In the CDE CLI, run the following command:

cde resource create --name my_pipeline_resource
cde resource upload --name my_pipeline_resource --local-path my_pipeline_dag.py
cde job create --name my_pipeline --type airflow --dag-file my_pipeline_dag.py --mount-1-resource my_pipeline_resource
