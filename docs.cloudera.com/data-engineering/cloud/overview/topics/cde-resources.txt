Cloudera Data Engineering resources
A resource in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) is a
    named collection of files used by a job. Resources can include application
    code, configuration files, custom Docker images, and Python virtual
    environment specifications (requirements.txt).
noteCustom Docker container images is a Technical Preview feature, requiring
      entitlement. Contact your Cloudera account representative to enable access to this feature.
      See CDP Public Cloud Preview Features below.
Resources are associated with virtual clusters. A resource can be used by
      multiple jobs, and jobs can use multiple resources.The resource types
      supported by CDE are files, python-env,
      and custom-runtime-image.

files
An arbitrary collection of files that a job can reference. The
          application code for the job, including any necessary configuration
          files or supporting libraries, can be stored in a
            files resource. Files can be uploaded to and
          removed from a resource as needed.
python-env
A defined virtual Python environment that a job runs in. The only
          file that can be uploaded to a python-env resource is
          a requirements.txt file. When you associate a
            python-env resource with a job, the job runs within
          a Python virtual environment built according to the
            requirements.txt specification.
custom-runtime-image
A Docker container image. When you run a job using a
            custom-runtime-image resource, the executors that
          are launched use your custom image.
