Upgrade to the latest Data Engineering version
To upgrade your Cloudera Data Engineering service to the latest
        version, which addresses the log4j2 security
        vulnerability, follow these steps. These steps provide a comprehensive
        upgrade and are the recommended approach. To ensure compatibility with
        the CDP environment, you must also upgrade the environment DataLake
        to Runtime 7.2.11 or higher.

For each existing virtual cluster, create a backup of the jobs
          and resources.
Enable a new Cloudera Data
            Engineering service for each existing CDE service you have.
          Make sure to use the same settings as the existing service for each
          new corresponding service.
Within each new Data Engineering service, create a new virtual cluster
          for each existing virtual cluster in the pre-existing service. Make
          sure to use the same settings as the existing virtual cluster for each
          new corresponding virtual cluster.
After making sure that you have added CDE services and virtual
          clusters to match your existing deployment, restore the backup file for
          each pre-existing virtual cluster to the corresponding new virtual
          cluster.

Result
Your Cloudera Data Engineering service and all associated virtual
        clusters are upgraded to the latest version.
