This release (1.17-h1) of the Cloudera Data Engineering Service on CDP Public Cloud now supports Apache Iceberg 0.14.
Support for Iceberg 0.14
When you upgrade to CDE 1.17-h1, ensure that you also upgrade to Iceberg 0.14. For
    more information, see Using Apache Iceberg in Cloudera Data Engineering. The following features are included with Iceberg 0.14:
MERGE operations allow for bulk updates and DELETES. 
CDE Azure deployments are now able to leverage Iceberg for Lakehouse architecture. 
[Technical Preview] Iceberg table format version 2 (v2) is the latest specification
      available and includes the following key updates:
UPDATE and DELETE operations follow the Iceberg format v2 row-level position delete
        specification and enforce snapshot isolation.
DELETES, UPDATES, and MERGE operations use the merge-on-read function by default.
        Merge-on-read is more efficient than the copy-on-write function because it does not rewrite
        file data. 


Set default values for the variables in CDE job specification
Using [--default-variable] flags you can now replace strings in job values. For more information, see
