This release (1.1) of the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service
    on CDP Public Cloud introduces the new features and improvements that are
    described in this topic.
Spot instance support
Users now have an additional knob to control cost, by being able to
        choose between running on Spot or On-Demand instances, providing up to
        90% discount in AWS resources.

Local (native) SSD
For memory and shuffle heavy workloads, CDE now allows using instances
        with local (native) SSD for intermediate results boosting
        performance.

Resource tags
Allows administrators to define tags during CDE service creation to
        track and audit cloud provider resources.

IP Whitelisting
Administrators can lock down access to the EKS control plane components
        via a CIDR range.

Stability & Security
New CDE service deployment will now use Kubernetes 1.15 and Helm 3;
        this improves the stability and security of the service moving
        forward
