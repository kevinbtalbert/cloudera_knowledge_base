This release (1.2) of the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service
    on CDP Public Cloud introduces the new features and improvements that are
    described in this topic.
CDP CLI Integration
Administrators can now automate the enabling of CDE services and
        creation of Virtual Clusters through CDP CLI. Jobs will continue to be
        managed through the CDE CLI shipped with the service.

Multiple CDE Services
It's now easier to enable CDE service multiple times within the same
        environment (datalake/SDX). This allows admins to set up multiple CDE
        services with differing instance profiles and allows for easier
        consumption tracking through AWS tags at the service level.

Python virtual environments
Users can now specify a list of python libraries as dependencies for
        Pyspark jobs. This can be specified through a
          requirements.txt file that is uploaded and managed
        through CLI/API.

CDP Trial Tours
The first trial tour for Data Engineering admins is now available.
