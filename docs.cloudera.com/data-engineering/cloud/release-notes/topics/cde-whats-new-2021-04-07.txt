This release (1.6) of the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service
    on CDP Public Cloud introduces the new features and improvements that are
    described in this topic.
API keys

CDE users can now use API keys, managed using the CDP user
          management service (UMS), to interact with the CDE Jobs API using the
          command line.


Raw Scala code

Users can now submit jobs with raw Scala code, without compiling.
          These jobs run spark-shell to process the application
          file.


Diagnostic bundles

Admins can now access summary diagnostic logs directly on their
          local machine.
A new Diagnostic page has been added to the
          CDE Service details to generate and download the bundle.


Force TLS certificate renewal 

 CDE services older than 90 days will have expired TLS certificates.
          A new action has been added to the CDE service hamburger menu to renew
          the certificates and avoid access issues for DE users.


[Technical Preview] GANG scheduling

GANG is a new resource scheduling policy that overcomes scale-up
          challenges in situations where high rates of job submission lead to
          queuing. The new scheduling policy moves jobs off the queue in
          batches. This clears up the queue, forces scale-up of nodes to process
          the burst of incoming jobs, and reduces wait and startup time of
          jobs.
By default, GANG scheduling is disabled. It can be turned on for
          specific jobs by adding a new job-level configuration option.
