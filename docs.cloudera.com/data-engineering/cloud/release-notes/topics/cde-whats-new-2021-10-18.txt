This release (1.12) of the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service on CDP Public Cloud
    introduces the new features and improvements that are described in this topic.
Apache Airflow 2
With this release, Apache Airflow 2.1 is the new default managed scheduler in CDE. It comes
        with governance, security and compute autoscaling enabled out-of-the-box, along with
        integration with CDE's job management APIs giving users the flexibility to deploy custom
        DAGs that tap into Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) data services like Spark in CDE and Hive in
        CDW.
For more information on what's new in Airflow 2, see the upstream documentation.

[Technical Preview] Airflow pipeline authoring UI
With the CDE Pipeline Authoring UI, any CDE user irrespective of their level of
        Airflow expertise can create multi-step pipelines with a combination of out-of-the-box
        operators (CDEOperator, CDWOperator, BashOperator, PythonOperator). Nevertheless, you can
        still deploy your own customer Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) as before, or use the
        Pipeline Authoring UI to bootstrap your projects for further customization.
This feature is in Technical Preview and available on new CDE services only. When
        creating a Virtual Cluster, a new option allows you to enable the Airflow Authoring UI.
For best user experience, Cloudera suggests using Google Chrome for this feature

[Technical Preview] Email alerts
You can now configure email alerts during Virtual Cluster setup and schedule them
        in custom Airflow DAGs. 

Kubernetes update
CDE now supports K8s 1.20.
