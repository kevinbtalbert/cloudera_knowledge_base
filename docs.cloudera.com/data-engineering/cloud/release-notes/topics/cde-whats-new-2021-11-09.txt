This release (1.13) of the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service on CDP Public Cloud
  introduces the new features and improvements that are described in this topic.
Non-transparent proxy support

CDE supports deploying into CDP environments using a non-transparent proxy. 
The proxy is registered and enabled during CDE environment creation.
The proxy configuration is automatically added to the deployed CDE service and virtual
     clusters (VCs). 


UI support for Python virtual environments

You can now create custom Python resources on the CDE UI, including virtual environments
     (venvs)
These custom venvs are selectable in the job creation wizard when creating PySpark
     jobs.


Support for Airflow core operators

With Airflow 2, Cloudera now supports all core operators.


Support for Ranger Authorization Service

CDE now supports Ranger Authorization Service (RAZ) in AWS and Azure environments.
