This release (1.15-h1) of the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service on CDP Public
        Cloud has certified support for Apache Iceberg v0.13.
GA of Apache Iceberg

You can use Cloudera Data Engineering virtual clusters running Spark 3 to
                    interact with the latest version (0.13) of Apache Iceberg tables.
CDE supports row level updates via copy-on-write MERGE / UPDATES/ DELETES
                    operations. Copy-on-write is helpful in bulk updates in read heavy
                    use-cases.
Compaction is also supported using Spark Iceberg APIs.
As support for Atlas lineage is still in progress, users should set the
                    following Spark property in their jobs:
                        spark.lineage.enabled=false.
