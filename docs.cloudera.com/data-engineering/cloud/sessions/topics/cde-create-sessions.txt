Creating Sessions in Cloudera Data Engineering [Technical Preview]
A Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Session is an interactive short-lived development
    environment for running Spark commands to help you iterate upon and build your Spark workloads. 
The commands that are run in a CDE Session are called
      Statements. You can submit the Statements through the connect CLI command or the Interact tab
      in the CDE UI for a Session. Python and Scala are the supported Session types. Learn how to
      use Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Sessions in CDE 1.19 using the user interface and
      CLI.
Ensure that you are using a version of CDE 1.19 or higher for your Virtual
      Cluster.

In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) console, click the Data
            Engineering tile. The Home page displays.

Click Sessions in the left navigation menu and then click Create
            Session.






Enter a Name for the Session.

Select a Type, for example, PySpark or
          Scala.

Select a Timeout value. The Session will stop after the
          indicated time has passed.

Optionally, enter a Description for the session.

Optionally, enter the Configurations.

Set the Compute options.

Click Create. The Connect tab displays a
          list of connectivity options available to interact with the Session. The
            Interact tab allows you to interact with the Session, and becomes
          available once the Session is running.
