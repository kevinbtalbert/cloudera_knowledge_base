Known Issues and Limitations
This page lists the current known issues and limitations that you might run into while
    using the cde-env tool.
Limited to spark-submit commands and does not include
          spark-shell, pyspark, and sparksql. 
When activating a profile using the cde-env.sh script, there is no
        validation yet on whether such profile exists. However, if a profile does not exist, it will
        display an error when running the spark-submit command. 
The following spark-submit flags are not yet supported in CDE:

--archives


--exclude-packages


--driver-class-path


--driver-library-path


--driver-java-options
Users are instead suggested to create CDE jobs to handle the above mentioned
              scenarios.
