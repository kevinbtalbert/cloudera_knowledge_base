Configuring the cde-env tool
 The CDE env-tool uses the ~/.cde/config.yaml
    configuration file to manage jobs in CDE virtual clusters. You must manually edit the
      ~/.cde/config.yaml file and update the profiles with the required
    information. For more information, see
    Creating and using multiple profiles. 
PrerequisitesYou must obtain the virtual cluster endpoint URL, CDP endpoint URL, and generate user     keys for each user whose Spark jobs you are migrating over to CDE.Adding profile for each userEdit the ~/.cde/config.yaml file in the same host where the       cde-env tool is installed and update the profiles with the required     information. You can create multiple profiles in the ~/.cde/config.yaml     file and can be used while running commands. Parent topic: Using spark-submit drop-in migration tool for migrating Spark workloads to CDE
