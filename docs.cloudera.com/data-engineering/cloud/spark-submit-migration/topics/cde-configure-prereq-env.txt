You must obtain the virtual cluster endpoint URL, CDP endpoint URL, and generate user
    keys for each user whose Spark jobs you are migrating over to CDE.
Virtual Cluster Endpoint URL: Determine the virtual
          cluster endpoint URL.


Navigate to the Cloudera Data Engineering  Home page. 
In the Environments column, select the environment containing
              the virtual cluster you want to use. 
In the Virtual Clusters column on the right, click the
                Cluster Details icon for the virtual cluster you want to use
              to migrate your spark jobs to. 
Click JOBS API URL to copy the URL to your clipboard. 
Paste the URL into a text editor to identify the endpoint host. For example, the URL
              is similar to the following:
                https://dfdj6kgx.cde-2cdxw5x5.ecs-demo.example.com/dex/api/v1In
                the above example, the endpoint host is
                dfdj6kgx.cde-2cdxw5x5.ecs-demo.example.com



CDP Endpoint URL: Copy the CDP console URL. 

Access Key: Generate access key for each user
            whose Spark jobs you are migrating over to CDE: 


Sign in to the Cloudera Data Platform console as an
              Administrator. 
In the Cloudera Data Platform Home page, click
                Management Console. 
On the left navigation menu, click Users. 
On the Users page, click the name of the user or the machine
              user account for which you want to generate an access key. 
On the user account page, go to the Access Keys section and
              click Generate Access Key.Cloudera Data Platform creates the
                key and displays the information on the screen.
