Installing the cde-env tool
You can install the cde-env tool as an
    Administrator or as a normal user. Cloudera
    recommends you to install the tool as an Administrator in the
    /opt/cloudera/bin folder so that all the users in the host can access the
    tool. 
AdministratorUser

Install the tool by copying the required binary and script files to the
              /opt/cloudera/bin folder so that the migration tool can run in the
            current gateway host.
            $ ./cde-env.sh enable-spark-submit-proxy
Enable the installed binary and script files by granting access to those files for all
            users on the host using one of the following options. noteIf the
              host machine has update-alternatives installed, no need to perform
              this step. You can check this by running the update-alternatives
              command. Otherwise, perform the following:
Link the existing /usr/bin/spark-submit and
                  /usr/bin/spark3-submit.
                  $ ln -s /opt/cloudera/bin/cde /usr/bin/cde
$ ln -s /opt/cloudera/bin/cde-env.sh /usr/bin/cde-env.sh
$ ln -s -f /opt/cloudera/bin/spark-submit /usr/bin/spark-submit
$ ln -s -f /opt/cloudera/bin/spark3-submit /usr/bin/spark3-submitor
Update PATH to point to the new installation location at the host
                level. $ export PATH=/opt/cloudera/bin:$PATH            




Install the tool on the host by running the following command:By default, the binary
              and script files will be installed in the $HOME/bin folder. You can
              change the location by replacing the $HOME/bin folder to the target
              folder in the following command.Linux$ sed -i "s#CLOUDERA_BIN=/opt/cloudera/bin#CLOUDERA_BIN=$HOME/bin#g" cde-env.sh && ./cde-env.sh enable-spark-submit-proxy -f privateMacOS$ sed -i '' "s#CLOUDERA_BIN=/opt/cloudera/bin#CLOUDERA_BIN=$HOME/bin#g" cde-env.sh && ./cde-env.sh enable-spark-submit-proxy -f private
Update PATH to give access to those binary and script
            files.$ export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
