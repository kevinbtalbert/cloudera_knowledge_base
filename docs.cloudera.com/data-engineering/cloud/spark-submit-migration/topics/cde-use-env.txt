Using the cde-env tool
You can run the spark-submit command after installing the
      cde-env tool. You can use the cde-env tool even without
    administrator privileges. You can activate the specific profile you want to use by running the following command:
      $ cde-env.sh activate -p <profile-name>For example, to alternatively run the the same spark-submit command either
      against YARN or one of the CDE virtual cluster, you can activate the relevant profile:

Run spark jobs on YARN by activating the yarn profile.
          yarn is a reserved profile name
        here.$ cde-env.sh activate -p yarn 
Run spark jobs on a CDE virtual cluster configured by CDE CLI profile named
          vc-1:
        $ cde-env.sh activate -p vc-1
Switching profiles back and forth this way lets you run the same spark-submit
      command either against YARN or one of the CDE virtual clusters.
