Cloudera Data Engineering Deep Analysis
You can run an on-demand deep analysis on a Cloudera
    Data Engineering (CDE) job run. Deep analysis analyzes job logs and
    generates detailed information for a given job run, including memory
    utilization and stage-level analysis.
Because deep analysis consumes cluster resources by running an internal
      CDE job, you must run it manually for any job run you want to analyze or
      troubleshoot.
