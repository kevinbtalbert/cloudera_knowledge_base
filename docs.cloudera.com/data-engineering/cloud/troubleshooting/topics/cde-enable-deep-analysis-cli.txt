Enabling deep analysis on a Cloudera Data Engineering job run using the CLI
Using the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) CLI you can enable an on-demand deep
            analysis on a CDE job run to generate detailed information, including memory
        utilization and stage-level analysis.

importantDeep analysis is currently supported only
                for Spark 2 jobs.


You can enable deep analysis for a job run by using the cde job
                        run or cde spark submit commands with the
                        --enable-analysis flag.
cde job
                    run:cde job run --name [***JOB NAME***] --enable-analysis
For
                    example:cde job run --name test_job --enable-analysis
cde spark
                    submit:cde spark submit [***JAR/PY FILE***] --enable-analysis
For
                    example:cde spark submit test_job.jar --enable-analysis
Metrics are collected for deep analysis.
