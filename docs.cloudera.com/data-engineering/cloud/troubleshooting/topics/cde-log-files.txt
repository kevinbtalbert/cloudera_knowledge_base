Cloudera Data Engineering log files
You can view logs for Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) using the web
    console, including CDE service logs, virtual cluster logs, and job
    logs.
To view logs for a CDE service or virtual cluster, click the three-dot menu for the service
      or virtual cluster, and then select View Logs. When the View
        Logs modal is displayed, you can download the logs or copy them to the clipboard
      by clicking the associated icon at the top right of the modal.importantThe user interface for CDE 1.17 and above
        has been updated. The left-hand menu was updated to provide easy access to commonly used
        pages. The steps below will vary slightly, for example, the Overview
        page has been replaced with the Home page. You can also manage a job
        by clicking Jobs on the left-hand menu, then selecting your desired
        Virtual Cluster from a drop-down at the top of the Jobs page. The new
        home page still displays Virtual Clusters, but now includes quick-access links located at
        the top for the following categories: Jobs,
          Resources, and Download &
      Docs.

From the CDE Overview page, select the CDE
        service for the job you want to troubleshoot.

          View Jobs icon for the cluster containing the
        job.
Select the job you want to troubleshoot.
In the Run History tab, click the
          Job ID for the job run you want to
        troubleshoot.
Go to the Logs tab.
Select the log you want to view using the Select log
          type drop-down menu and the log file tabs.
