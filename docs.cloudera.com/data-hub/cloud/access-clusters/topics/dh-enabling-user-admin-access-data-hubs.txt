Enabling admin and user access to Data Hubs 
Data Hub resource roles can be assigned on the scope of a specific Data hub cluster. 
When you grant access to admins and users of a Data Hub, consider the following
      guidelines:


Any user or group that needs to access a specific Data Hub needs the
            EnvironmentUser role at the scope of the environment where that Data Hub is
          running. 
A user with the DataHubCreator (or higher) account role can create Data
          Hubs.
The user who creates a Data Hub gets the Owner role for that Data
          Hub.
The Owner of the Data Hub cluster can grant others access to the
          cluster. The following roles can be assigned:
Owner - Grants the permission to mange the Data Hub cluster in CDP and delete
              it. It does not grant any cluster-level access (such as access to Cloudera
              Manager).
DataHubAdmin (Technical Preview) - Grants administrative rights over the Data
              Hub cluster.



The roles are described in detail in Resource roles. The steps for
      assigning the roles are described in Assigning resource roles to users and
        Assigning resource roles to groups.
