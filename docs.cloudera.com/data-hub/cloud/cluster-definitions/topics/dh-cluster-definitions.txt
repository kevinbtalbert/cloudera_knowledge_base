Cluster definitions
A cluster definition is a reusable cluster template in JSON format that can be used for
    creating multiple Data Hub clusters with identical cloud provider settings.


Data Hub includes a set of default cluster definitions for common data
          analytics and data engineering use cases, and allows you to save your own custom
            cluster definitions. While default cluster definitions can be used across all
          environments, custom cluster definitions are associated with one or more specific
          environments. Cluster definitions facilitate repeated cluster reuse and are therefore
          useful for creating automation around cluster creation. 
The easiest way to create a custom cluster definition is to open the create
          cluster wizard, provide all the parameters, and then save the settings as a cluster
          definition. The option to save is available on the last page of the create cluster
          wizard.
note
A cluster definition is not synonymous with a cluster template. While a cluster
            template primarily defines Cloudera Runtime services, a cluster definition primarily
            includes cloud provider settings. Furthermore, a cluster definition always references
            one specific cluster template. 



Prior to creating your own cluster definitions, we recommend that you review the default
      cluster definitions to check if they meet your requirements. You can access the default
      cluster definitions by clicking Environments, then selecting an
      environment and clicking the Cluster Definitions tab.  To view details
      of a cluster definition, click on its name. For each cluster template, you can access a
      graphical representation ("list view") and a raw JSON file ("raw view") of all cluster host
      groups and their components.
