Operational Database with SQL clusters
Learn about the default Operational Database (OpDB) with SQL clusters, including
    cluster definition and template names, included services, and compatible Runtime version. 
Operational Database is a NoSQL database powered by Apache HBase designed to support custom
      OLTP applications that want to leverage the power of BigData. Apache HBase is a NoSQL, scale
      out database that can easily scale to petabytes and stores tables with millions of columns and
      billions of rows. 
This template provides a fully capable standalone deployment of Apache HBase and supporting
      packages (HDFS, ZooKeeper) and can be used as a standalone DBMS to which you can point an
      application or as a D/R instance for an on-prem HBase cluster.
importantOperational Database does not support any CR
      versions in OpDB DataHub template starting from 7.2.14. Cloudera recommends you to use
      Cloudera Operational Database (COD) to create Operational Database clusters.
