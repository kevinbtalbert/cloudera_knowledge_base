Learn about the default Flow Management clusters, including cluster definition and
    template names, included services, and compatible Runtime versions. 
Flow Management delivers high-scale data ingestion, transformation, and management to
      enterprises from any-to-any environment. It addresses key enterprise use cases such as data
      movement, continuous data ingestion, log data ingestion, and acquisition of all types of
      streaming data including social, mobile, clickstream, and IoT data. 
The Flow Management template includes a no-code data ingestion and management
      solution powered by Apache NiFi. With NiFiâ€™s intuitive graphical interface and 300+
      processors, Flow Management enables easy data ingestion and movement between CDP services as
      well as 3rd party cloud services. NiFi Registry is automatically set up and provides a central
      place to manage versioned Data Flows.
