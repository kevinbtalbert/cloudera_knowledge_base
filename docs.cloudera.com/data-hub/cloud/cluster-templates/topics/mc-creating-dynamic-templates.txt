Dynamic cluster template parameters
You can add dynamic parameters to a cluster template. The values of the variables
    specified in the cluster template are dynamically replaced during the cluster creation phase,
    picking up the parameter values that you provided in the Data Hub cluster wizard. Data Hub
    supports the "mustache" formatting syntax for dynamic properties. 
Production cluster configurations typically include certain configuration parameters,
      forcing you to create multiple versions of the same cluster template to handle different
      component configurations for these external systems. Dynamic parameters in a cluster template
      solve this problem by offering the ability to manage external sources outside of your cluster
      template. They use the cluster template as a blueprint, and Data Hub injects the actual
      configurations into your cluster template. This simplifies the reuse of cluster configurations
      for external sources and simplifies the cluster templates themselves.
note
You cannot use functions in the cluster template file; only variable injection is
            supported.

The following provides a list of properties that can be used in a dynamic cluster template
         and an example:

Recipe and cluster template parametersThe following supported parameters can be specified as variables/dynamic parameters in     recipes or cluster templates by using mustache formatting with "{{{ }}}" syntax.Example: A cluster template with parametersThe template below is an example of a cluster template that includes placeholder values     (the {{{general.clusterName}}} property) that will be dynamically fetched and     replaced during cluster creation.
