Cluster deployment options
You have two basic options when creating a cluster: (1) create a cluster from one of the
  default or custom cluster definition, or (2) create a custom cluster. 
Cluster definitions
Data Hub includes a set of prescriptive cluster definitions that can be used to
    quickly provision clusters for common use cases. These default cluster definitions include
    prescriptive options related to compute instance types and storage options. 
We recommend that you start by reviewing these definitions. If you conclude that
    they do not match your requirements, you can customize them and then save them as custom cluster
    definitions.

Custom deployment
Use the custom cluster deployment option if you would like to select specific
    Cloudera Runtime components for your cluster. 

note
Currently, this feature is limited and only allows you to select a cluster template that determines
      which components will be used for your cluster.



Advanced options
The cluster wizard includes a set of advanced options that can be optionally configured. Some
    of these options require additional configuration prior to cluster creation, so if you would
    like to use these options, read the cluster planning documentation first.
