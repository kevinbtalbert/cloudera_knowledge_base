Create a cluster from an existing cluster
You can copy the CDP CLI command used to create a Data Hub cluster on AWS or Azure
    and then use the command to create a new cluster with the same or similar settings.

Click Data Hub Clusters in the left navigation menu and then
          click the tile of the Data Hub cluster that you want to use to create the new
          cluster.From the Data Hub details page, click the Actions menu in
          the top right of the page and then Show CLI Command.Copy the CDP CLI command used for the cluster creation.Before you use the command in the CDP CLI to create a new cluster, ensure that you
          change the --cluster-name parameter as this must be a unique
        name.
You can now use the CDP CLI to run the command to create a new
      cluster.
