Image catalog
The options on the "Image Settings" page of the advanced create cluster wizard allow
      you to select custom image settings. 
By
      default, Data Hub uses the prewarmed image from the image catalog provided in Data Hub. If
      necessary, you can also customize a default image.
Choose image catalog
Data Hub uses the image catalog provided by default. If you would like to use a custom
        image catalog instead of the default image catalog, you must first prepare your custom
        images, then create and register an image catalog.
        

Choose image type
By default, Data Hub uses the included prewarmed images with the default Cloudera
        Manager and Cloudera Runtime version, but you can select a different prewarmed image or
        customized prewarmed image to use for your cluster. Data Hub currently supports the
        following types of images for launching clusters:

Prewarmed Image

By default, Data Hub launches clusters from prewarmed images. Prewarmed
                        images include the operating system as well as Cloudera Manager and Cloudera
                        Runtime. The Cloudera Manager and Cloudera Runtime version used on prewarmed
                        images cannot be customized.

Custom Image
You can customize a default image for compliance or security reasons. You can
                then use the CDP CLI to register a custom image catalog and set the custom image
                within the custom image catalog. Later, you can use this custom image to create Data
                Hub cluster.
