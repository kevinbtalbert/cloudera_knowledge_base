Create a cluster with an external database
Through the CDP CLI, you can configure an external, durable database when you create a
    Data Hub cluster. An external database keeps a persistent state for cluster services like Hue,
    DAS and Zeppelin in case of instance failures. You also have the option to configure an external
    database as a custom property within a cluster definition.
A top-level custom property for the external managed database is available to be set within a
      cluster definition:

"externalDatabase": {
  "availabilityType": "NONE" | "NON_HA" | "HA"

For more information on using custom cluster definitions to create clusters, see
        Cluster definitions.
A new flag, called --datahub-database, is available in the CDP CLI
        create-azure-cluster command. The supported values are
        NONE, NON_HA, and HA. To create a Data
      Hub cluster with an external managed database, use the following CLI options:

create-azure-cluster
          [--cluster-name <value>]
          [--cluster-definition-name <value>]
          [--environment-name <value>]
          [--cluster-template-name <value>]
          [--instance-groups <value>]
          [--subnet-id <value>]
          [--image <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--request-template <value>]
          [--datahub-database <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton]



--cluster-name: String. The name of the cluster. This name must be
          unique, must have between 5 and 40 characters, and must contain only lowercase letters,
          numbers and hyphens. Names are case-sensitive.
--cluster-definition-name: String. The name or CRN of the cluster
          definition to use for cluster creation.
--environment-name: Name or CRN of the environment to use when
          creating the cluster. The environment must be an Azure environment.
--cluster-template-name: String. Name or CRN of the cluster
          template to use for cluster creation.
--instance-groups: Array. Instance group details.
--subnet-id: String. The subnet ID.
--image: Object. The details of the image used for cluster
          instances.
--tags: Array. Tags to be added to Data Hub-related resources.
--request-template: String. JSON template to use for cluster
          creation. This is different from the cluster template and would be removed in the
          future.
--datahub-database: String. Database type for the Data Hub cluster.
          Currently supported values: NONE, NON_HA, HA
--cli-input-json: String. Performs service operation based on the
          JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by
          --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI
          values will override the JSON-provided values.
--generate-cli-skeleton: Prints a sample input JSON to standard
          output. Note the specified operation is not run if this argument is specified. The sample
          input can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json.


For information on shorthand and JSON syntax of these options, and the output of the command,
      invoke the CDP CLI help.

noteThe external managed database is destroyed along with the Data Hub cluster.
