Create a cluster from a definition on AzureCloudera Docs
Create a cluster from a definition on 
    Azure
You can quickly create clusters from default or custom cluster definitions within an
    existing 
    Azure
     environment.
To create a Data Hub cluster on Azure, you must have an existing Azure
       environment. Also, you should make sure that the Runtime version
      of the Data Lake cluster matches the Runtime version of the Data Hub cluster that you are
      about to create; If these versions don't match, you may encounter warnings and/or
      errors.

Log in to the CDP web interface.

Navigate to the Management Console > Environments > click on an
          environment where you would like to create a cluster > click Create Data Hub. The
          following page is displayed:





Select Cluster Definition.

From the Cluster Definition dropdown, select the cluster definition that you
          would like to use for your cluster.

The cluster template referenced in the selected cluster definition determines which
            services are included in the cluster. The list of services is automatically shown below
            the selected cluster definition name:


Specify General Settings for your cluster:




Parameter
Description



Cluster Name
Enter a name for your cluster. The name must be between 5 and 40 characters,
                  must start with a letter, and must only include lowercase letters, numbers, and
                  hyphens.


Tags
(Optional) Add tags that Data Hub should use to tag your Azure resources.
                  Click Add to add a tag, and then enter a key and value for each tag. Repeat
                  the steps if you would like to add more tags. For more information about tags,
                  refer to Tags.





Optionally, click on Advanced Options to modify advanced cluster settings. For
          more information on these options, refer to Advanced cluster options.
On AWS and Azure only: Optionally, when you have finished providing the cluster
          settings, you can click the Show CLI Command  button at the bottom
          of the page to review or copy the CDP CLI command used to create the cluster. You can copy
          the command from the pop-up window that appears, either to provision the cluster later or
          for use in scripts. You also have the option to review or copy the cluster template that is generated
          and will be used in cluster creation. Click the Show Generated Cluster
            Template button at the bottom of the page. 
To proceed with cluster provisioning immediately, click on Provision
          Cluster.

You will be redirected to the Data Hub cluster dashboard, and a new tile representing
          your cluster will appear at the top of the page.

The following messages are written to the event history as your cluster is being
            created:
