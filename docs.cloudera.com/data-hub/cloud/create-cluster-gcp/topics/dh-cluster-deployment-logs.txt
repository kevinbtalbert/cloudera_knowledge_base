Cluster deployment logs
Cluster deployment logs gather the same diagnostic (system and service) logs that are
    collected into your cloud storage location, but CDP sends the logs to Cloudera engineering and
    support for troubleshooting purposes. You can apply configurable redaction rules on any
    sensitive data.
Cluster deployment logs are disabled by default. You can change this setting during
      environment creation or after environment creation, though CDP will only collect logs for new
      deployments. You can also set a default behavior at the CDP account level, so that you wonâ€™t
      have to enable the setting every time in the wizard. The logs are only gathered during
      deployment, which is approximately the first 20 minutes of cluster creation. 
You can configure anonymization rules for log collection at the CDP account level. The rules
      are a list of rule objects with two fields: a regex pattern (PCRE) as the value, and a
      replacement string. Configure these rules to hide any sensitive data. By default, the rules
      hide email addresses and card numbers. This default behavior is the same as Cloudera Manager
      diagnostics collection.
The anonymization options are available under Global
          Resources > Telemetry:



Currently, cluster deployment logs are collected only for Data Lake and Data Hub
      cluster shapes.

Enabling/disabling cluster deployment log collectionYou can enable cluster deployment log collection during environment creation. You can     also enable or disable it after environment creation.Parent topic: Advanced cluster options
