Creating a cluster template override
From the Shared Resources menu, you can create a cluster
    template override to overwrite the default values of service and role configs in a Data Hub
    template. 

In the Management Console UI, Shared
              Resources > Cluster Template
          Overrides.Click Create Custom Override.



Provide the following information:


Property
Description



Name
Provide a unique name for the override.


Cloudera Runtime Version
Select a specific Runtime version to which this override applies, or select
                    “Not Runtime specific.”


Service Config / Role Config
Use the radio buttons to select whether you are customizing a service
                    config or a role config.


Config Name/Path
Exact name/path of the config are you customizing.


Config Value
New value for the config. Ensure the value is valid.


Service Type
From the drop-down menu, select the service type for the service or role
                    config that you are customizing. 


Role Type
For role configurations: the role type as it appears in the cluster
                    template that you will apply the override to (or any valid role configuration
                    that is recognized by Cloudera Manager).


For example:

Click Add and then repeat the previous step (excluding the
          Name and Runtime Version) for each service or role config that you want to customize in
          this template override. When you are finished adding service and role configs to the template override,
          click Save. The override appears in the list of saved overrides,
          accessible from the Shared Resources menu.
