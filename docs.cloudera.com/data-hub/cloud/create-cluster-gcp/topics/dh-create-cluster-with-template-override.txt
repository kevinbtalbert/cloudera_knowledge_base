Creating a Data Hub cluster with a cluster template override
You can use a cluster template override that you previously created to provision a
    Data Hub cluster.

Click Data Hub Clusters > Create Data Hub
              Cluster.Enter the information required to create your cluster, then at the bottom of the
          cluster creation wizard, select Advanced
              Options > Cluster
        Extensions.From the Cluster Templates Overrides drop-down box, select
          the template override that you previously created and want to apply when the cluster is
          provisioned. The only visible overrides are those with a Runtime version matching the
          selected cluster definition version, or those that are Runtime-agnostic.


Click Provision Cluster.
The Data Hub cluster is provisioned using the service and role cofigs that you
      specified in the template override.
