Default cluster configurations
Data Hub includes a set of prescriptive cluster configurations. Each of these default
    cluster configurations include a cloud-provider specific cluster definition, which
    primarily defines cloud provider settings. The cluster definition references a cluster
      template, which defines a number of Cloudera Runtime or Cloudera DataFlow components used
    for common data analytics and data engineering use cases.
Refer to the topic for each default cluster configuration to view the included
      services and compatible Runtime versions. These topics include links to documentation that
      will help you to understand the included components and use the workload cluster.
Many of the cluster components are included in the Cloudera Runtime software
      distribution. The Streams Messaging, Flow Management, and Streaming Analytics cluster
      configurations are part of Cloudera DataFlow for Data Hub and have distinct planning
      considerations and how-to information. See the Cloudera DataFlow for Data Hub documentation
      for more details. 
You can access the default cluster definitions by clicking Environments,
      then selecting an environment and clicking the Cluster Definitions tab. 
You can access the default cluster templates from Shared
          Resources > Cluster Templates. 
To view details of a cluster definition or cluster template, click on its name. For each
   cluster definition, you can access a raw JSON file. For each cluster template, you can access a
   graphical representation ("list view") and a raw JSON file ("raw view") of all cluster host
   groups and their components.
