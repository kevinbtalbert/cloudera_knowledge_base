Advanced cluster options
In the create cluster wizard, click on Advanced Options to view the advanced
      cluster configuration options.



While some of these advanced options can be configure in the wizard, others require prior
         setup.
The following options are available:

TagsYou can define tags that will be applied to your       cluster-related resources (such as VMs) on your cloud provider account.Image catalogThe options on the "Image Settings" page of the advanced create cluster wizard allow       you to select custom image settings. Custom images and image catalogsIf necessary, you can use a custom Runtime or FreeIPA image for compliance or security     reasons. You can then use the CDP CLI to register a custom image catalog and set the custom     image within the custom image catalog. Later, you can use this custom image to create a Data     Lake/Data Hub cluster or environment with a custom FreeIPA image.Network and availabilityThe "Network and availability" options allow you to customize the networking settings of   your cluster.Hardware and storageThe "Hardware and storage" options allow you to customize the cloud provider specific   cluster hardware and storage options.Cloud storageThe options on the "Cloud Storage" page allow you to optionally specify the base storage   location used for YARN and Zeppelin.RecipesThe "Recipes" option allows you to select previously uploaded recipes (scripts that       can be run pre or post cluster deployment) for each host group. Cluster template overridesYou can specify custom configurations that override or append the properties in a     built-in Data Hub template or a custom template.Custom propertiesThe "Custom Properties "option allows you to set properties on a per-cluster basis. Cluster deployment logsCluster deployment logs gather the same diagnostic (system and service) logs that are     collected into your cloud storage location, but CDP sends the logs to Cloudera engineering and     support for troubleshooting purposes. You can apply configurable redaction rules on any     sensitive data.
