Tags
You can define tags that will be applied to your
      cluster-related resources (such as VMs) on your cloud provider account.The tags added during cluster creation are displayed in your cloud account on the resources that
      Data Hub provisioned for your clusters. You can use tags to categorize your cloud resources by
      purpose, owner, and so on. Tags come in especially handy when you are using a corporate  cloud
      provider account and you want to quickly identify which resources belong to your cluster(s).
      In fact, your corporate cloud account admin may require you to tag all the resources that you
      create, in particular resources, such as VMs, which incur charges.By
      default, the following tags are created:

Tag
Description



Cloudera-Resource-Name
The workload-appropriate Cloudera resource name. This CRN serves as a unique
              identifier for the resource over time.


Cloudera-Creator-Resource-Name
Cloudera resource name of the CDP user that created the resource.


Cloudera-Environment-Resource-Name
The name of the environment with which the resource is associated.

You can optionally add additional tags. To add custom tags:
In the create cluster wizard, navigate to the General Configuration page.
Specify your tags in the Tags section by providing a key and value for each
          tag.
note
It is not possible to add tags via Data Hub after your cluster has been created. In this
        case, you can only add the tags manually via your cloud provider's interface.
To learn more about tags and their restrictions, refer to GCP documentation.
