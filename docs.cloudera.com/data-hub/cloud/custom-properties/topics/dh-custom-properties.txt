Custom properties
Custom properties are configuration properties that can be set on a Cloudera Runtime
  cluster, but Data Hub allows you to conveniently set these during cluster creation.
When working with on-premise clusters, you would typically set configuration
      properties once your cluster is already running by using Cloudera Manager or manually in a
      specific configuration file. 
When you create a Data Hub cluster in CDP, you can specify a list of configuration
      properties that should be set during cluster creation and Data Hub sets these for you. note
Alternatively, it is also possible to set configuration properties by using Cloudera
          Manager once the cluster is already running.
