Monitor cluster creation
Once cluster creation has been triggered, you can monitor it from cluster details. 
You are redirected to environment details > Data Hub Clusters and you can see
   a new entry corresponding to your cluster. Click on the entry corresponding to the name of your
   cluster to navigate to cluster details: 

The cluster details page provides various information related to your Data Hub
   cluster. Once the cluster is running, you will be able to access links to cluster UIs and cluster
   management options from this page. 
While your cluster is being created, you can monitor the progress by scrolling down
   to Event History:

The Event History logs all events related to cluster creation progress. When
   your cluster is ready, its status will change from In Progress to Running and
   events similar to the following will be present in its Event History:
