SSH to the cluster
To connect to a cluster node through SSH, obtain the cluster node IP address and then
    use either the user's SSH private key or your workload credentials. 
To SSH to the cluster using your workload credentials:

Cluster nodeâ€™s public IP.
Your workload user name and workload password. 
If you were following this tutorial from the beginning, you should have set the workload
        password in Set workload password.
For instructions on how to find your workload user name, refer to Finding your workload user name. 

You can obtain the IP from cluster details > Hardware tab:

On a Mac, you can SSH by using the following and then, when prompted, providing your
      workload password:

$ ssh user@nodeIPaddress

For example:

$ ssh jsmith@192.12.141.12

To SSH to a cluster using the private key file that pairs with the public key associated with
      a user, use the ssh utility:

$ ssh -i path-to-private-key-file user@nodeIPaddress

For example:

$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-private.key jsmith@192.12.141.12

On Windows, you should use an SSH client such as PuTTY. For more information, refer
      to How to
        use PuTTY on Windows.
