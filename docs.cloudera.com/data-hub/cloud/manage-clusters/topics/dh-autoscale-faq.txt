Autoscaling FAQ
Review frequently asked questions about Data Hub autoscaling.

A node is not running any tasks, why is it not being scaled down?
There are multiple possibilities:
The cluster may already be at min-node-count.
Check if running on a Runtime version prior to 7.2.15, with max-capacity of queues
              not set to 100%.
Check user-limit-factor. Is this preventing YARN from executing additional tasks for
              a user?
Nodes that are not running containers, but have run containers for a running job,
              will not be considered for load-based downscaling. This is because the data generated
              on these nodes could be required while the job is running. 

Will load-based autoscaling remove nodes that have running tasks?
Not unless the maximum node count limit is reduced. This forces the removal of certain
          nodes to reach the new limit.
I've encountered the following error: "Autoscaling Trigger Failed. Autoscaling
            Collection metrics via user <CRN> failed." How should I proceed?
For CDP accounts with a large number of users, autoscaling might encounter failures when
          capturing cluster metrics to scale up/down. If you encounter this issue please contact
          Cloudera Support.
