Managing autoscaling
The CDP CLI has two options for reviewing autoscaling activity.


cdp datahub list-scaling-activities
Returns all of the scaling activities (or only failed scaling activities) in the given
            duration, or activities that have a start time in the given time interval between
            start-time and end-time for a particular
              cluster.list-scaling-activities
--cluster <value>
[--duration <value>]
[--start-time <value>]
[--end-time <value>]
[--only-failed-scaling-activities | --no-only-failed-scaling-activities]
[--max-items <value>]
[--starting-token <value>]
[--page-size <value>]
[--cli-input-json <value>]
[--generate-cli-skeleton]Table 1. 

Parameter
Description



--cluster
Required. The cluster Name or CRN of the cluster for which you want to
                      list all of the scaling activities.


--duration
Value of the duration in minutes from the current point to current point
                      minus the duration. The default value is 60 minutes.


--start-time
Time in epoch milliseconds after which you want the activities.


--end-time
Time in epoch milliseconds until which you want the activities.


--only-failed-scaling-activities |
                      --no-only-failed-scaling-activities
Determines if only the failed scaling activities for that particular
                      cluster are returned.


--max-items
Indicates the maximum number of scaling activities that can be present in
                      a page. Also indicates next-token in the output, which can be used as
                      starting-token to get the next set of scaling-activities.


--starting-token
Number of the page from which you want all the pages. Default value is
                      0.


--page-size
Number of entries you want to get in each API call for listing scaling
                      activities. The default value is 100.


cdp datahub describe-scaling-activity
Returns the scaling activity corresponding to the cluster and operationId provided by
            the
              user.describe-scaling-activity
--cluster <value>
--operation-id <value>
[--cli-input-json <value>]
[--generate-cli-skeleton]Table 2. 

Parameter
Description



--cluster
Required. The cluster name or CRN of the cluster for which you want to
                      fetch the particular scaling activity.


--operation-id
Required. The operation ID of the scaling activity that you want to
                      fetch.
