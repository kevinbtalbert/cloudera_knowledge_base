Placement group support
You can configure a Data Hub cluster on AWS for placement group support. Placement
    groups support placing VM instances across different physical hardware within a single
    availability zone. Placement groups can help ensure cluster availability in the event of a
    physical hardware failure within an availability zone.
In a Data Hub cluster, each host group can be associated with a placement group, of which
      there are three supported types: partition, spread, or cluster. Cloudera
      recommends using the partition type as the default for all host groups. For a partition
      placement group, the partition count will always be 2 and is not configurable.

noteOnly specific host groups, such as the master host group of the Data Engineering HA
        template, can be configured with the spread placement group. The spread placement group has
        a maximum instance limit of seven instances per placement group, per availability zone.
        Configuring multiple spread placement groups does not guarantee hardware isolation across
        the placement group.

Configuring placement group support requires adding custom properties to a cluster definition
      at the host group level. You can define the strategy as “NONE,”
        “PARTITION,” “SPREAD,” or
        “CLUSTER.” 
For example:
{
  "environmentName": "sample-env",
  "instanceGroups": [
    {
      "nodeCount": 1,
      "name": "master",
      "type": "GATEWAY",
      "recoveryMode": "MANUAL",
      "template": {
        "aws": {
          "encryption": {
            "type": "NONE",
            "key": null
          },
          "placementGroup": {
            "strategy": "PARTITION"
          }
        },
        "instanceType": "m5.2xlarge",
        "rootVolume": {
          "size": 50
        },
        "attachedVolumes": [
          {
            "size": 100,
            "count": 1,
            "type": "standard"
          }
        ],
        "cloudPlatform": "AWS"
      },

Placement groups have a number of rules and limitations. Importantly, it is possible to run
      out of placement groups within an availability zone. Refer to the AWS documentation for
      detailed rules and limitations.
