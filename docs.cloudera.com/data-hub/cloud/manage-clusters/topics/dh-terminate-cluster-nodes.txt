Terminate cluster nodes
Rather than terminating an entire Data Hub cluster, you have the option to terminate
    one or more nodes of the cluster.

Required role:
Owner at the scope of the Data Hub (which provides delete access).


In the CDP UI, navigate to Data Hub Clusters and click on the
          cluster details tile.Click the Hardware tab.Select the checkbox of the node(s) that you want to delete from the desired
          instance group.Click the Delete (garbage can) icon.
Click Yes to confirm.
Node deletion may fail if the Management Console is unable to delete one or more of the
            cloud resources that were part of the node's infrastructure. Use the Force
              terminate option to remove the node entry from the Management Console web
            UI. If you use this option, you must also check your cloud provider account to see if
            there are any resources that must be deleted manually.
