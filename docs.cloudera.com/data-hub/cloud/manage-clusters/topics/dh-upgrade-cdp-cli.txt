Upgrading a Data Hub with the CDP CLICloudera Docs
Upgrading a Data Hub with the CDP CLI
You can initiate a Data Hub upgrade (either OS, Runtime, or both) with the CDP CLI.
    Using the same CLI command, you can also search for and validate available images to upgrade to,
    and generate JSON templates for specific upgrade scenarios.
The cdp datahub upgrade-cluster command has the following options:
cdp datahub upgrade-cluster 

          --cluster-name <value>
          [--image-id <value>]
          [--runtime <value>]
          [--lock-components | --no-lock-components]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--show-available-images | --no-show-available-images]
          [--show-available-image-per-runtime | --no-show-available-image-per-runtime]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton]

importantThe --runtime option does not upgrade the OS. Upgrading
      the OS is a separate process that requires specifying the --lock-components
      option.

Option
Description



--cluster-name (string)
Required. The name or CRN of the Data Hub to upgrade.


--image-id (string)
The ID of an image to upgrade to.


â€“runtime (string) 
The Runtime version to upgrade to. When you specify the Runtime version, the
              upgrade uses the latest image ID of the given Runtime version from the same image
              catalog used for Data Hub creation.


--lock-components | --no-lock-components (boolean)
Use --lock components to perform an OS upgrade only.


 --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
Checks the eligibility of an image to upgrade. Can be used in conjunction with
              any other parameter, returning the available image (with respect to image Id, Runtime
              or lock-components set) without performing any actions.


--show-available-images | --no-show-available-images (boolean)
Returns the list of images that are eligible to upgrade to.


--show-latest-available-image-per-runtime |
              --no-show-latest-available-image-per-runtime (boolean)
Returns the latest image that is eligible to upgrade to, for each Runtime version
              with at least one available upgrade candidate.


When you run the cdp datahub upgrade-cluster command to initiate an upgrade, you have one of
      three options:

Specify one of either --image-id, --runtime, or
          --lockComponents, which makes an explicit choice of the exact image,
        Runtime (latest OS), or latest OS (same Runtime) for upgrade.
Specify both
--image-id and --lockComponents,which specifies an image
        and ensures the image represents an OS only upgrade.
Specify none of the --image-id, --runtime, or
          --lockComponents parameters, which initiates a Runtime/CM upgrade to the
        latest compatible version and OS image.

Outside of upgrade, you can use the following options:
--show-available-images/--no-show-available-images 
--show-available-images-per-runtime/--no-show-available-images-per-runtime
 --dry-run
