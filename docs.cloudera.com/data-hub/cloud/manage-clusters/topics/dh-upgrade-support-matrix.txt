Ranger Authorization (RAZ) Upgrades

Data Hub service pack upgrades, both RAZ and non-RAZ, are supported only for Runtime versions

noteUpgrading a custom template is supported, if the template contains only services
      that are included in any supported built-in templates.  If your cluster contains a
        custom service, such as a third-party CM service, contact Cloudera support for an
        entitlement that will allow you to upgrade the cluster. Cloudera cannot support failed
        upgrades for clusters that run unsupported services. Always test any cluster upgrade in
      a development environment first.
