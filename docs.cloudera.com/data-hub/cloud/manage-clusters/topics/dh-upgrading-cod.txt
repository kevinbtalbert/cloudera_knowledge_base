Upgrading Cloudera Operational Database clusters
Cloudera Operational Database clusters cannot be upgraded through the Data Hub user
    interface. Instead, use the CDP Beta CLI to run the upgrade-database
    command.
For more information on CDP CLI beta commands, see the CDP CLI Beta command
        reference.
Before you perform the COD upgrade: In the Cloudera Manager properties, increase the
        omid_max_heap_size property for the Omid service to at least 3GB before
      starting the upgrade from 7.2.9/7.2.10 to 7.2.11:
