            were part of your cluster infrastructure. Use the Terminate > Force
               terminate option to remove the cluster entry from the Data Hub web UI. If you use
            this option, you must also check your cloud provider account to see if there are any

When terminating a cluster with Kerberos enabled, you have an option to disable
               Kerberos prior to cluster termination. This option removes any cluster-related
               principals from the KDC.This deletes the cluster tile from the UI.Log in to your cloud provider account and manually delete any resources that failed to
            be deleted.If force-termination fails, you may have to delete the cluster manually.
