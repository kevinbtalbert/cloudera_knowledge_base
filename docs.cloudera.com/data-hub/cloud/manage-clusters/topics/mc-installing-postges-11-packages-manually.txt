Installing Postgres 11 packages manually
Steps for manual installation of PostgreSQL 11 packages. 

The last step of the Database upgrade flow is the installation of
                PostgreSQL 11 packages on the cluster hosts. This is relevant in the case of an
                operating system image that does not yet contain the PostgreSQL 11 packages.
The required repositories are being hosted in the same location that is
                used for Cloudera Runtime upgrades: https://archive.cloudera.com/p/postgresql/11/redhat7/
If for some reason the package installation fails, it is required for the
                customers to manually install the aforementioned packages because otherwise the
                    pg_dump utility driving the backup functionality will stop
                working. 


Method 1 : Installation using Cloudera hosted 
This method works only if you have proper network access and paywall
                        credentials to the archive.cloudera.com repository as the
                        required metadata is already push onto the nodes during the RDS upgrade
                        process.
SSH into the master node and run the following with superuser privileges.
source activate_salt_env
salt '*' state.apply postgresql/pg11-install


Method 2: Manual installation
Using this method you will install PostgreSQL packages using the official repo file


SSH into the master node and run the following with superuser
                                privileges (install PostgreSQL packages using the official repo file)
yum install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-7-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm


Install required packages
yum install -y postgresql11-server postgresql11 postgresql11-contrib postgresql11-docs
