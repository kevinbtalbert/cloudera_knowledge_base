Resize a cluster
The resize option allows you to add or remove cluster nodes.
Ensure that you are using a cluster that can be
        resized.noteYou can scale up and down Flow Management clusters since 7.2.11 and you can
        scale up and down Streams Messaging clusters since 7.2.12. For more information, see
          Scaling up or down a NiFi cluster and Scaling Kafka broker
        nodes.

Required role: The DataHubAdmin or Owner roles at the scope of the
        Data Hub allow you to manage the Data Hub. Note that EnvironmentAdmin and
          Owner of the environment can also manage Data Hubs.
 Unhealthy clusters can be resized, provided that the failed node is not a gateway node. If
        a new node fails to come up after scaling, the upscale operation will still complete
        successfully, and the failed nodes will be marked as "zombie" nodes. The stack is usable
        without these nodes, and you can clean them up manually. The "zombie" status indicates that
        the node provision has failed.

Log in to the CDP web interface.

Navigate to the Management Console > Data Hub Clusters

Browse to cluster details.
Click Actions and select Resize. The cluster resize dialog is
            displayed.Using the +/- controls, adjust the number of nodes for a chosen host group.note
You can only modify one host group at a time. It is not possible to resize the
              Cloudera Manager server host group (by default, this is the master host group).

note
Downscaling the worker host group below 3 nodes is not possible on clusters
                     that have at least 3 worker nodes by design.
Click Yes to confirm the scale-up/scale-down.While nodes are being added or removed, cluster status changes to “Update In Progress”. Once the
                                    operation has completed, cluster status changes back to
                                    “Running”. Messages similar to the following are written to even
