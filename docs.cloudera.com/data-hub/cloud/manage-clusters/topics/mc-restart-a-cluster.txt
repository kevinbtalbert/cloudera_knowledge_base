Restart a cluster
If your cluster is in the “Stopped” state, you can restart it by using the "Start"
      option. 

Required role: The DataHubAdmin or Owner roles at the scope of the
        Data Hub allow you to manage the Data Hub. Note that EnvironmentAdmin and
          Owner of the environment can also manage Data Hubs.
noteMost clusters that use ephemeral volumes cannot be stopped/restarted via Data Hub. If a
        cluster has a host group that contains only yarn-NODEMANAGER and/or any "-GATEWAY" service
        roles, using ephemeral volumes as temporary storage for these host groups is supported,
        which allows for stop-start of the cluster. 

Log in to the CDP web interface.

Navigate to the Management Console > Data Hub Clusters

Browse to cluster details.
Click Start. This option is only available when the cluster has been
            stopped.Click Yes to confirm.Your cluster status changes to “Start in progress” and then once new VMs have been provisioned
