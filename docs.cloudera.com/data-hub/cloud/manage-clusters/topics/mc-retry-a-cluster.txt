Retry a cluster
When stack provisioning or cluster creation fails, use the retry option to resume the
      process from the last failed step.

Required role: The DataHubAdmin or Owner roles at the scope of the
        Data Hub allow you to manage the Data Hub. Note that EnvironmentAdmin and
          Owner of the environment can also manage Data Hubs.
Only failed stack or cluster creations can be retried. A retry can be initiated any
            number of times on a failed creation process. 
In some cases the cause of a failed stack provisioning or cluster creation can be
            eliminated by simply retrying the process. For example, in case of a temporary network
            outage, a retry should be successful. In other cases, a manual modification is required
            before a retry can succeed. For example, if you are using a custom image but some
            configuration is missing, causing the process to fail, you must log in to the machine
            and fix the issue; Only after that you can retry the process.

Log in to the CDP web interface.

Navigate to the Management Console > Data Hub Clusters.

Browse to cluster details.

Click Actions and select Retry.

note
Only failed stack or cluster creations can be retried, so the option is only
                     available in these two cases.


Click Yes to confirm. The operation continues from the last failed
            step.
