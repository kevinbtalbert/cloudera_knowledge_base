Stop a cluster
Data Hub supports stopping and restarting clusters. Once a cluster is in the "Running"
    state, it can be stopped.

Required role: The DataHubAdmin or Owner roles at the scope of the
        Data Hub allow you to manage the Data Hub. Note that EnvironmentAdmin and
          Owner of the environment can also manage Data Hubs.
noteMost clusters that use ephemeral volumes cannot be stopped via Data Hub. If a cluster
        has a host group that contains only yarn-NODEMANAGER and/or any "-GATEWAY" service roles,
        using ephemeral volumes as temporary storage for these host groups is supported, which
        allows for stop-start of the cluster. 
Log in to the CDP web interface.

Navigate to the Management Console > Data Hub Clusters

Browse to cluster details.
Click Stop to stop a currently running cluster.Click Yes to confirm.
Your cluster status changes to “Stopping in progress” and then to “Stopped”.

Once stopping the infrastructure has completed, you will see a Start option
                  to restart your cluster. When a cluster is put in the “stopped” state, cluster VMs
                  are given back to the cloud provider. To provision new VMs, restart the cluster.
