Cloud storage
The options on the "Cloud Storage" page allow you to optionally specify the base
    storage location used for YARN and Zeppelin.


During environment creation under Data Access > Storage Location Base
          you configure a default S3, ADLS Gen2, or Google Cloud Storage base storage location for
          the environment, and all Data Hub clusters created within that environment use this
          location. The Cloud Storage options in the Data Hub cluster wizard allow you to
          additionally specify a different location for YARN application logs and Zeppelin
          Notebook's root directory:
Existing Base Storage Location - By default, this is set to the Storage
                Location Base configured on environment level. If you do not want to make any
              changes, simply leave this blank. If you would like to use a different location for
              YARN application logs and Zeppelin Notebook's root directory, you can specify a
              different S3 or ADLS Gen2 location. Note that the specified S3, ADLS Gen2, or Google
              Cloud Storage location must exist prior to Data Hub cluster creation and that you must
              adjust the IAM policies created during environment's cloud storage setup to make sure
              that IDBroker has write access to this location. 
Path for YARN Application Logs property - This directory structure gets
              created automatically during cluster creation. You can customize it if you would like
              it be different than what is suggested by default. 
Path for Zeppelin Notebooks Root Directory property - This directory
              structure gets created automatically during cluster creation. You can customize it if
              you would like it to be different than what is suggested by default. 




noteAny S3 bucket that you designate for Data Hub cloud storage on AWS must be in the same
      region as the environment.
