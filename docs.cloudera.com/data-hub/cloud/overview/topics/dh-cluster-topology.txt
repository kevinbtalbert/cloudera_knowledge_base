Default cluster topology
Data Hub uses a specific cluster topology including the following host groups: master,
  worker, and compute.
Data Hub uses the following host groups. These host groups are defined in cluster templates and
   cluster definitions used by Data Hub: 

Host group
Description
Number of nodes



Master
The master host group runs the components for managing the cluster resources
        (including Cloudera Manager), storing intermediate data (e.g. HDFS), processing tasks, as
        well as other master components.
1


Worker
The worker host group runs the components that are used for executing processing tasks
        (such as NodeManager) and handling storing data in HDFS such as DataNode).
