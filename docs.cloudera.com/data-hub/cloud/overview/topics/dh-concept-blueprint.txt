Cluster templates
Data Hub uses cluster templates for defining cluster topology: defining host groups and
  components installed on each host group.
A cluster template is a reusable template in JSON format that can be used for
   creating multiple Data Hub clusters with identical Cloudera Runtime settings. It primarily
   defines the list of host groups and how components of various Cloudera Runtime services are
   distributed on these host groups. A cluster template allows you to specify stack, component
   layout, and configurations to materialize a cluster instance via Cloudera Manager REST API,
   without having to use the Cloudera Manager install wizard. After you provide the cluster template
   to Data Hub, the host groups in the JSON are mapped to a set of instances when starting the
   cluster, and the specified services and components are installed on the corresponding nodes.

note
A cluster template is not synonymous with a cluster definition, which primarily defines cloud
     provider settings. Each cluster definition must reference a specific cluster template.


Data Hub includes a few default cluster templates and allows you to upload your own
   cluster templates. Custom cluster templates can be uploaded and managed via the CDP web interface or CLI
   and then selected, when needed, for a specific cluster.
