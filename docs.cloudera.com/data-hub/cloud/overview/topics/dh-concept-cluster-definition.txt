Cluster definitions
Data Hub provides a set of default cluster definitions for prescriptive use cases and
  allows you to create your own custom cluster definitions.


A cluster definition is a reusable cluster template in JSON format that can be used
     for creating multiple Data Hub clusters with identical cloud provider settings.
Data Hub includes a set of default cluster definitions for common data
     analytics and data engineering use cases, and allows you to save your own custom cluster
      definitions. While default cluster definitions can be used across all environments, custom
     cluster definitions are associated with one or more specific environments. Cluster definitions
     facilitate repeated cluster reuse and are therefore useful for creating automation around
     cluster creation. 
The easiest way to create a custom cluster definition is to start with an existing
     cluster definition, modify it in the create cluster wizard, and then save it. Or you can open
     the custom create cluster wizard, provide all the parameters, and then save the cluster
     definition. 
note
A cluster definition is not synonymous with a cluster template. While a cluster template
      primarily defines Cloudera Runtime services, a cluster definition primarily includes cloud
      provider settings. Furthermore, a cluster definition always references one specific cluster
      template.
