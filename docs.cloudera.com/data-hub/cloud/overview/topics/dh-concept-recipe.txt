Recipes
A recipe is a script that runs on all nodes of a selected host group at a specific time.
  You can use recipes to create and run scripts that perform specific tasks on your Data Hub cluster
  nodes. 
You can use recipes for tasks such as installing additional software or performing
   advanced cluster configuration. For example, you can use a recipe to put a JAR file on the Hadoop
   classpath.
Recipes can be uploaded and managed via the CDP web interface or CLI and then
   selected, when needed, for a specific cluster and for a specific host group. If selected, they
   will be executed on a specific host group at a specified time. 
Depending on the need, a recipe can be executed at various times. Available recipe
   execution times are:

Before Cloudera Manager server start
After Cloudera Manager server start
After cluster installation
Before cluster termination
