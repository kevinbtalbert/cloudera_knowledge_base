Workload clusters
All Data Hub clusters are workload clusters. These clusters are created for running
  specific workloads such as data engineering or data analytics.
Data Hub clusters are powered by Cloudera Runtime. They can be ephemeral or long-running. Once
   a Data Hub cluster is created it can be managed by using the Management Console and Cloudera
   Manager. 
Each Data Hub cluster is created within an existing environment and is attached to a data lake,
   which provides the security and governance layer.
