Core concepts
The following concepts are key to understanding the Data Hub:
Workload clustersAll Data Hub clusters are workload clusters. These clusters are created for running   specific workloads such as data engineering or data analytics.Cluster definitionsData Hub provides a set of default cluster definitions for prescriptive use cases and   allows you to create your own custom cluster definitions.Cluster templatesData Hub uses cluster templates for defining cluster topology: defining host groups and   components installed on each host group.RecipesA recipe is a script that runs on all nodes of a selected host group at a specific time.   You can use recipes to create and run scripts that perform specific tasks on your Data Hub cluster   nodes. Custom propertiesCustom properties are configuration properties that can be set on a Cloudera Runtime   cluster, but Data Hub allows you to conveniently set these during cluster creation.Image catalogsData Hub provides a set of default, prewarmed images. You can also customize the default     images.
