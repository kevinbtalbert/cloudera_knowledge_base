Data Mart clusters
Learn about the default Data Mart and Real Time Data Mart clusters, including cluster
  definition and template names, included services, and compatible Runtime version. 
Data Mart is an MPP SQL database powered by Apache Impala designed to support custom Data Mart
   applications at big data scale. Impala easily scales to petabytes of data, processes tables with
   trillions of rows, and allows users to store, browse, query, and explore their data in an
   interactive way. 
Data Mart clusters
The Data Mart template provides a ready to use, fully capable, standalone deployment
    of Impala. Upon deployment, it can be used as a standalone Data Mart to which users point their
    BI dashboards using JDBC/ODBC end points. Users can also choose to author SQL queries in
    Clouderaâ€™s web-based SQL query editor, Hue, and execute them with Impala providing a delightful
    end-user focused and interactive SQL/BI experience.

Real Time Data Mart clusters
The Real-Time Data Mart template provides a ready-to-use, fully capable, standalone
    deployment of Impala and Kudu. You can use a Real Time Data Mart cluster as a standalone Data
    Mart which allows high throughput streaming ingest, supporting updates and deletes as well as
    inserts. You can immediately query data through BI dashboards using JDBC/ODBC end points. You can
    choose to author SQL queries in Cloudera's web-based SQL query editor, Hue.  Executing queries
    with Impala, you will enjoy an end-user focused and interactive SQL/BI experience. This template
    is commonly used for Operational Reporting, Time Series, and other real time analytics use
    cases.
