Databases for cluster components
By default, Data Hub provisions embedded databases for all cluster services that require
  it. These databases run on the Cloudera Manager server node (By default Cloudera Manager is
  installed on the master node).

note
One exception is Hive Metastore, which always uses the external database attached to the data
     lake. Therefore, no embedded database is needed for Hive Metastore.
