Streams Messaging clusters
Learn about the default Streams Messaging clusters, including cluster definition and
  template names, included services, and compatible Runtime version. 
Streams Messaging provides advanced messaging and real-time processing on streaming data using
   Apache Kafka, centralized schema management using Schema Registry, as well as management and
   monitoring capabilities powered by Streams Messaging Manager, as well as cross-cluster Kafka
   topic replication using Streams Replication Manger and Kafka partition rebalancing with Cruise
   Control.
This template sets up a fault-tolerant standalone deployment of Apache Kafka and
   supporting Cloudera components (Schema Registry, Streams Messaging Manager, Streams Replication
   Manager and Cruise Control), which can be used for production Kafka workloads in the cloud or as
   a disaster recovery instance for on-premises. Kafka clusters.
note
Streams Messaging clusters have distinct planning considerations and how-to information. See
