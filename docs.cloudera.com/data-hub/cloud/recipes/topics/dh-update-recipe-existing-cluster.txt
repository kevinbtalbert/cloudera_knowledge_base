Update a recipe
You can attach or detach recipes to/from existing Data Hub clusters. Using this
    capability, you can update a recipe by removing it from the cluster, replacing the old recipe
    with a modified recipe of the same type, and attaching the new modified recipe to the cluster. 
Attaching or detaching a recipe will not execute the recipe.
      The next execution of the recipe will take place based on the type of the recipe. After an
      upscale, a newly attached recipe runs only on the new hosts.Required role (one of the
          following):
PowerUser on CDP tenant
Owner of the environment
EnvironmentAdmin
Owner of the Data Hub
DataHubAdmin


Create a new recipe (with updated/modified content) of the same type as the old recipe
          that you want to replace.Click Data Hub Clusters > <Cluster
              Name> > Recipes and find the recipe that
          you want to remove in the list of recipes for the cluster.Click Remove Recipe next to the name of the recipe that you
          want to remove, then click Yes in the confirmation
        window.Once you have removed the old recipe, click on the Add
            Recipe button for the cluster and select the same host group that you
          previously used for the old recipe. Then select the name of the new recipe that contains
          the modified content and click Add.


You should see the new recipe appear for the same host group. After this change, the
      next recipe execution will execute the new script.
