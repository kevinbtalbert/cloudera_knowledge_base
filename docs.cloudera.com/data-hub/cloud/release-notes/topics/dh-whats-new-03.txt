This release of the Data Hub service introduces the following new features: 
Cloudera Runtime 7.0.2
By default, Data Hub creates clusters running Cloudera Runtime 7.0.2 and Cloudera Manager
    7.0.2. Previously, 7.0.1 was used.

New Real-Time Data Mart cluster definition 
The Real-Time Data Mart cluster definition is now available in Data Hub with Apache Kudu,
    Apache Impala, and Apache Spark for real-time data management and operational analytics use
    cases. This cluster definition is suitable for real-time analytics on fast changing data, and
    can be leveraged together with the Data Warehouse service for a holistic analytics
    experience.

Enhanced SQL access for Data Engineering clusters
Data Hub clusters built with Data Engineering cluster definition now offer an improved SQL
    experience for Hive SQL users with smart query authorizing, build-in performance analysis and
    recommendations tools available in Data Analytics Studio (DAS). This capability provides an
    enhanced self-service experience for data analysts and data engineers. Note that DAS web UI can
    be accessed by using workload user name and FreeIPA password.

Operational Database cluster enhancements
The Operational Database cluster definition enables you to build real-time, high-concurrency,
    mission-critical business applications in the cloud environment. Key enhancements in this
    release include real-time monitoring, out-of-the-box resilience, and replication capabilities
    (Tech Preview) for Disaster Recovery (DR) and for enabling seamless migration of operational
    applications from on-premises to cloud.
