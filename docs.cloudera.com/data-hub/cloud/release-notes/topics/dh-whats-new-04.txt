This release of the Data Hub service introduces the following new features: 
Cloudera Runtime 7.0.2.2
By default, Data Hub creates clusters running Cloudera Runtime 7.0.2.2 and Cloudera Manager
    7.0.2.2. Previously, 7.0.2.0 was used. Note that there is no separate 7.0.2.2 documentation
    available, but Cloudera Runtime 7.0.2 and Cloudera Manager 7.0.2 documentation has been updated
    to reflect the 7.0.2.2 changes; 

New Streams Messaging cluster templates and definitions
The Streams Messaging Heavy Duty and Streams Messaging Light Duty cluster templates and
    definitions are now available in Data Hub with advanced messaging and real-time processing on
    streaming data using Apache Kafka, centralized schema management using Schema Registry, and
    management and monitoring capabilities powered by Streams Messaging Manager.
note
The Streams Messaging cluster templates and definitions are technical preview: They are not
     suitable for production.
