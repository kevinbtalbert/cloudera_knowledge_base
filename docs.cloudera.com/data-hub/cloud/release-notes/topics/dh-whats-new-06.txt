This release of the Data Hub service introduces the following new features:
Flow Management for Data Hub Cluster Definitions
New Flow Management cluster definitions are available in Data Hub. The Flow Management
        cluster definitions (heavy duty and light duty) include the Nifi, Nifi Registry, and
        Zookeeper services. The cluster definitions are available for both AWS and Azure.

Data Engineering HA Cluster Definition (Technical Preview)
A new Data Engineering HA cluster definition is available in Data Hub for technical
        preview. The cluster definition deploys YARN, HDFS, and Hive in a highly available
        fashion.

External Databases for Data Hub Clusters
Through the CDP CLI, you can now configure an external, durable database for Data Hub
        clusters. An external database can keep a persistent state for services like Hue, DAS, and
        Zeppelin.
