This release of the Data Hub service introduces new features.
Google Cloud Platform support for Data Hub
CDP now supports the creation of Data Hub clusters on the GCP platform. For more
        information see Create a Data Hub cluster on Google Cloud.

Show CLI Command
You can obtain the CDP CLI command for creating a Data Hub cluster from the details of an
        existing Data Hub or from the create Data Hub wizard. See Create a Data Hub cluster on AWS from an existing
          cluster and Create a Data Hub cluster on Azure from an existing
          cluster. 

Default Root Volume Size
The default root volume size has been increased from 30-50 GB (depending on cloud provider)
        to 100 GB for all cloud providers.

Data Engineering and Data Engineering HA Templates


Instance types in the Data Engineering and Data Engineering HA templates have been
            updated to 64 GB memory machines from 32 GB memory machines:
The master instance in the DE template has changed from m5.2xlarge to m5.4xlarge
                for AWS and from Standard_D8_v3 to Standard_D16_v3 for Azure.
All instances in the DE HA template have changed from m5.2xlarge to m5.4xlarge for
                AWS and from Standard_D8_v3 to Standard_D16_v3 for Azure

From Cloudera Runtime 7.2.8 onwards, the DE HA template includes a new load-balancer
            added for the Knox instances for UI access. The external endpoint has changed from
            "-manager0" to "-gateway" because of the presence of the load-balancer.
