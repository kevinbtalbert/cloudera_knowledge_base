This release of the Data Hub service introduces new features.
Updating recipes post-deployment
You can attach or detach recipes to/from existing Data Hub clusters. Using this capability,
        you can update a recipe by removing it from the cluster, replacing the old recipe with a
        modified recipe of the same type, and attaching the new modified recipe to the cluster. For
        more information refer to Update a recipe.

Custom images and catalogs
If necessary, you can use a custom Runtime image for compliance or security reasons. You
        can then use the CDP CLI to register a custom image catalog and set the custom image within
        the custom image catalog. For more information refer to Custom images and catalogs.
