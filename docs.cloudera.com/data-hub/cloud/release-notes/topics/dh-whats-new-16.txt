This release of the Data Hub service introduces new features.
Customer managed encryption keys for Azure disks and databases

    by the Data Lake and Data Hubs are encrypted with server-side encryption (SSE) using Platform
    Managed Keys (PMK), but during environment registration you can optionally configure SSE with
    Customer Managed Keys (CMK). For more information, refer to Adding a customer managed encryption
    key for Azure. For more information, refer to Adding a customer managed encryption key for Azure.
