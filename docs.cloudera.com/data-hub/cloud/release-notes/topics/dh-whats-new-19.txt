This release of the Data Hub service introduces new features.
Resilient scaling improvements (May 10, 2022)

It is possible to upscale a Data Hub cluster even if there are unhealthy nodes in the
            stack.
An upscale operation will finish successfully even if one of the new nodes fails to
            come up. Nodes that fail during an upscale will be marked as "zombie" nodes.
For more information, see Resize a cluster.
