This release of the Data Hub service introduces new features.
The default authentication method for Kafka brokers is changed to LDAP (June 28,
        2022)
To improve performance, the default SASL_SSL/PLAIN authentication method for Kafka brokers
        is changed to LDAP. Previously, brokers were configured to use PAM. This change is Runtime
        version independent and applies to all Data Hub clusters provisioned after July 28, 2022.
        For existing clusters, Cloudera recommends that you transition from PAM to LDAP. For more
        information on how to enable and configure LDAP on existing clusters, see Kafka LDAP Authentication.
