This release of the Data Hub service introduces new features.
Database Upgrade and default major version change (September 27, 2022)
Newly deployed Data Lake and Data Hub clusters with Cloudera Runtime 7.2.7 or above
                are now configured to use a PostgreSQL version 11 database by default.
A new Database Upgrade capability is now available for existing Data Lake
                and Data Hub clusters. If you are running clusters on Cloudera Runtime version 7.2.6
                or below, please upgrade to a more recent version before performing the database
                upgrade.
The major version of the database used by Data Lake or Data Hub clusters is
                now also displayed on the Database page of the respective service.
Cloudera strongly recommends that the Database Upgrade is performed on
                    all clusters running PostgreSQL version 10 before November 10, 2022.
For more information, see  Upgrading database.

Recipe type changes
The following recipe types have been renamed for Data Hub, Data Lake, and FreeIPA recipes:
pre-service-deployment (formerly pre-cluster-manager-start)
post-service-deployment (formerly post-cluster-install)

These changes will not affect existing recipe automation. For more information see Recipes.

Instance support (September 1, 2022)
The following new AWS instance types are supported in Data Hub:

m5dn.xlarge
m5dn.2xlarge
m5dn.4xlarge
m5dn.8xlarge
m5dn.12xlarge
m5dn.16xlarge
m5dn.24xlarge


Validate and prepare for upgrade (September 1, 2022)
Before you perform a Data Hub upgrade, you can run the new Validate and Prepare
        option to check for any configuration issues and begin the Cloudera Runtime parcel download
        and distribution. Using the validate and prepare option does not require downtime and makes
        the maintenance window for an upgrade shorter. For more information see Preparing for an upgrade.
