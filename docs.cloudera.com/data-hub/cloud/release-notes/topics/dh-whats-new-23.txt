Changes to Data Hub cluster deployments on AWS (October 28, 2022)
The CloudFormation template previously in use for Data Hub deployments on AWS is no longer
        required for new Data Hub deployments. Clusters provisioned without the CloudFormation template
        will have the following changes:
Hostnames in the AWS Management Console appear differently between native and
            CloudFormation clusters. For example:
dev-pdp-de-fix-01-master0 is an example of a hostname in a cluster deployed
                with the CloudFormation template
devpdpdefix01-164597-master-0 is an example of a hostname in a cluster
                deployed without the CloudFormation template

Some of the default tags were removed during the implementation of this change from
            CloudFormation to native deployed clusters:
aws:autoscaling:groupName
aws:cloudformation:stack-id
aws:ec2launchtemplate:id
aws:ec2launchtemplate:version
aws:cloudformation:logical-id
aws:ec2:fleet-id
aws:cloudformation:stack-name
