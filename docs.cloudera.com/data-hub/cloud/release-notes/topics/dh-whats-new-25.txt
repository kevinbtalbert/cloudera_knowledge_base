Data Hub Autoscaling (February 27, 2023)
Autoscaling is a feature that adjusts the capacity of cluster nodes running YARN by
        automatically increasing or decreasing, or suspending and resuming, the nodes in a host
        group. You can enable autoscaling based either on a schedule that you define, or the
        real-time demands of your workloads. For more information see Autoscaling clusters.
