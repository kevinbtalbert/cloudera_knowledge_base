This release of the Data Hub service introduces new features and behaviors.
GP3 support for attached storage disks (April 19)
Data Hubs now support GP3 (SSD) volume types for attached storage. GP3 volumes allow you to
        increase performance (independently provisioning IOPS and throughput) without increasing
        storage size. GP3 volumes will deliver similar performance as GP2 volumes at a lower cost.
        GP3 is now the default attached storage type for Data Hub instances that previously used GP2
        storage. You can configure storage options when you provision a Data Hub cluster under the
          Hardware and Storage section of the Advanced
          Options.
