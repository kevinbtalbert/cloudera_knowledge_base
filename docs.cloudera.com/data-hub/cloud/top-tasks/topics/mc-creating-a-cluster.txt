Create a custom cluster on AWS

Create a custom Data Hub cluster within an existing AWS
     environment. To create a Data Hub cluster on AWS, you must have an existing AWS environment. Also, you should make sure that the
      Runtime version of the Data Lake cluster matches the Runtime version of the Data Hub cluster
      that you are about to create; If these versions don't match, you may encounter warnings and/or
          errors.


Log in to the CDP web interface.

Navigate to the Management Console > Environments > click on an
               environment > click Create Data Hub.

Under Selected Environment, confirm that the selected environment is the one
               where you would like to create your cluster.

Select Custom.

Under Platform Version, current Cloudera Runtime version is
               pre-selected.

Under Cluster template, select the cluster template that you would like to use.
The selected cluster template determines which services are included in the
               cluster. Select the cluster template and the list of services is automatically shown
               below it:

For more information about cluster templates, refer to Cluster templates.

Specify General Settings for your cluster:




Parameter
Description



Cluster Name
Enter a name for your cluster. The name must be between 5 and 40 characters,
                  must start with a letter, and must only include lowercase letters, numbers, and
                  hyphens.


Tags
(Optional) Add tags that Data Hub should use to tag your AWS resources.
                  Click Add to add a tag, and then enter a key and value for each tag. Repeat
                  the steps if you would like to add more tags. For more information about tags,
                  refer to Tags.





Optionally, click on Advanced Options to modify advanced cluster settings.
               For more information on these options, refer to LINK.

Once done, click on Provision Cluster.

You will be redirected to the Data Hub cluster dashboard, and a new tile
               representing your cluster will appear at the top of the page.
