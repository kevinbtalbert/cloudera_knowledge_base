Checking logs
When troubleshooting Data Hub clusters, you
      can access the following logs:
Cloudera Manager logsData Hub uses Cloudera Manager to       orchestrate the installation of Cloudera Runtime components. Each instance in the cluster runs       an Cloudera Manager agent which connects to the Cloudera Manager server. Cloudera Manager       server is declared by the user during the cluster installation wizard.Recipe logsData Hub supports “recipes” - user-provided       customization scripts that can be run prior to or after cluster installation. It is the user’s       responsibility to provide an idempotent well tested script. If the execution fails, the recipe       logs can be found at /var/log/recipes on the nodes on which the recipes were       executed.
