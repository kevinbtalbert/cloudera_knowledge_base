Quota limitations
Each cloud provider has quota limitations
      on various cloud resources, and these quotas can usually be increased on request. If there is
      an error message in Data Hub stating that there are no more available EIPs (Elastic IP
      Address) or VPCs, you need to request more of these resources. 
To see the limitations visit the cloud providerâ€™s site:
