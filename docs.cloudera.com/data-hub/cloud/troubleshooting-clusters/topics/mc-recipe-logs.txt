Recipe logs
Data Hub supports “recipes” - user-provided
      customization scripts that can be run prior to or after cluster installation. It is the user’s
      responsibility to provide an idempotent well tested script. If the execution fails, the recipe
      logs can be found at /var/log/recipes on the nodes on which the recipes were
      executed.
It is advised, but not required to have an advanced logging mechanism in the script, as
         Data Hub always logs every script that are run. Recipes are often the sources of
         installation failures as users might try to remove necessary packages or reconfigure
         services.
