Failed to retrieve the server's certificate
Data Hub cluster fails with "Infrastructure creation failed. Reason: Failed to retrieve
  the server's certificate". 
When a cluster fails with "Infrastructure creation failed. Reason: Failed to retrieve the
   server's certificate", the most common reasons for this error are related to using your own
   custom image. If you are using your own custom image and if using the CLI, you must send the
    imageId explicitly in the CLI in the cluster template request.
