Configuring account lockout
Cloudera Data Visualization allows an administrator to change the
    default account lockout configurations.

noteThis feature is only available to users with administrative privileges.

To change the account lockout settings for a user, edit the following parameters in
          the settings_local.py file.
note Updated values can get overwritten if the application is restarted. 

AXES_FAILURE_LIMIT

Specifies the number of failed login attempts after which the user is locked
                  out.
The limit definition uses the following formula:
AXES_FAILURE_LIMIT = Number of failed attempts * 2
note The default setting is '10', which means that users will be locked out after
                  five failed attempts. 

AXES_LOCK_OUT_BY_COMBINATION_USER_AND_IP

Specifies the account lockout settings based on a combination of failed login
                  attempts and IP address. The default ruevalue is 'True'.
If the flag is set to True, the user cannot login using the same
                  IP address after exceeding login attempts specified in the
                    AXES_FAILURE_LIMIT . However, other users can login using the
                  same IP address. 
If the flag is set to False, the user cannot login using the
                  same IP address after exceeding login attempts specified in the
                    AXES_FAILURE_LIMIT . In this case, other users are also not
                  able to login using the same IP address.
noteIn both settings the locked out user and other users can login using a
                  different IP address.
To lock the user based on a combination of failed login attempts and IP address,
                  enter the the following command
                  syntax:AXES_LOCK_OUT_BY_COMBINATION_USER_AND_IP = <True>

AXES_COOLOFF_TIME

An integer that specifies the number of hours after lockout that the user must
                  wait before being able to login again. The default value is '0.33 hours' (20
                  mins.)
To specify a wait time before user can login again after failed attempts, enter
                  the the following command
                  syntax:AXES_COOLOFF_TIME = <Number of Hours>
