Component Type
The component of the activity, such as Dashboard, Data Connection,
            Dataset, Mixed, Snapshots, Thumbnail, or
          Workspaces.

Component ID
The ID of the component.

Visual
The ID of the visual that generates the activity. Click on this number to navigate to the

          Datasets interface for that connection.

Type
The type of connection, such as arcengine, impala, hive, and so
          on.

Fallback
If the connection is of arcengine type, you can have a fallback engine enabled. For
          example, the second row shows that Dashboard ID = 500 uses the fallback option. Typically,
          the value of this column is N/A.

Cache
This column indicates whether the query was served from the cache; values are true
          or false.

Cache Check
This column indicates that Cloudera Data Visualization served the query
          from the cache after checking the base data to confirm that no changes occurred between
          the cache capture and the time the query ran in the cache. Values are true or
            false.

Aview Used
This column indicates if the query execution used an analytical view; values are
            Yes, No, or N/A.

Runtime
The duration of the activity, in seconds.

State
The completion status of the query, such as Done, if it is running, or if it is in
          an error state.

Error
This column shows if there is an error in any of the actions.

Query
You can examine the SQL statement for each query event. By default, Cloudera Data Visualization hides the SQL statements. To see all statements,
          click the Plus icon under the column title Query. To hide all
          statements, click the Minus icon. To see only specific queries,
          click Show SQL in the specific row.For example, this is the
          SQL statement for the first Dashboard (component
        ID=500):SELECT cast((((TA_0.'duration') - 0.007558) / 1.5571718) as bigint) as 'Buckets', sum(1) as 'Record Count' 
            FROM 'default'.'historical_queries' TA_0 WHERE TA_0.'start_date' = to_date(date_sub(now(), interval 1 Days)) 
            GROUP BY 1 
            LIMIT 5000
