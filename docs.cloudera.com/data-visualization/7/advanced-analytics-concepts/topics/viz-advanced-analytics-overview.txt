Advanced Analytics overview
Cloudera Data Visualization provides an extensive array of tools to support advanced
        analysis.
Complex data types
Cloudera Data Visualization supports native complex data type configurations,
                bypassing ETL workflows and avoiding unnecessary flattening at query time. Explore
                    complex data types to leverage the powerful native SQL already optimized
                for complex types. 

Dimension hierarchies
Cloudera Data Visualization provides full support for dimensional hierarchy modelling
                at dataset level, enabling smooth natural transition between granularity levels of
                data. For more information, see Dimension hierarchies.

Segments
Segments can be very powerful in data visualization, and form the foundation of
                cohort analysis and row-level access restrictions. For more information, see
                    Segments.

Events
Identifying and managing events within your time-stamped data enables you to measure
                outcomes of complex workflow scenarios. For more information, see Events.

Visuals for analytics
For advanced analysis, you can create advanced visual types, such as funnels, flows,
                correlation flows, and histograms. For more information, see Visuals for
                    Analytics.

Advanced visualization techniques
Advanced visualization techniques, such as trellises, dual-axis line visuals, and
                dimension hierarchies free you to explore the visualized data from diverse
                perspectives. For more information, see Advanced Visualization
                Techniques.

Analytic functions
On select connection types, Cloudera Data Visualization supports several analytic
                functions that examine overlapping groupings of data. For more information, see
                    Supported connections.

Derived data
You can derive data from an existing query, build computed columns for re-use, and
                reference results in new queries. Derived data enables you to stack sub-query
                analytical results.
