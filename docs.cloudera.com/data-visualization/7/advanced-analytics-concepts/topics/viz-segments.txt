Segments
With Cloudera Data Visualization, you can create and manage segments within your
    data.
Segments can be used to analyze subsets of the data that have specified properties. Normally,
      segments are defined by filtering data based on dimensions or measures. Discovering trends
      within segments and making comparisons across segments provides powerful insights into the
      data and the business it represents.
To create and manage segments in the Dataset Segments user interface,
      see the following topics: 


Creating Segments
Cloning Segments
Editing Segments
Creating Entity Segments
Deleting Segments 


You can also segments from filter definitions in a visual. See, Creating segments from
        filters
To view how segments work in a visual, see Using segments in visuals.
To see how you can use natural segments to restrict data access through filter association,
      see Setting segments .
