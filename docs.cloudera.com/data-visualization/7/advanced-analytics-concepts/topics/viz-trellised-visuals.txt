Trellised visuals
Trellis charts are grouped sets of visuals that represent different partitions
        (segments) of the dataset in the same chart type, scale, and axes. This makes the comparison
        of sub-groups very intuitive. Trellis charts are sometimes called lattice charts,
            grid charts, panel charts, or small multiples.
Any chart type that uses the X and Y axes
            explicitly may be trellisable, depending on the dataset. What is required is an extra
            entry on either the X or Y shelf; the
            first field on the shelf represents the segment definition of the trellis, and the
            second field is the actual dimension. Some charts types have optional
                X and Y shelves so that trellises may
            be enabled.
A dataset may be double-trellisable â€” you could declare a 'partition' on both
                X and Y shelves at the same time.
There are two approaches for trellises: 

Commonly, we use Trellising on dimensions to show the sections of data in
                separate but related charts. 
We can also show different data aggregates, side by side, by placing extra
                measurements on the Measures shelf, to Trellis on
                    measures.

You can find specific examples of trellised charts in the following articles:

Some visual types (bars, lines, areas, and grouped bars) support trellising on
            measures.
