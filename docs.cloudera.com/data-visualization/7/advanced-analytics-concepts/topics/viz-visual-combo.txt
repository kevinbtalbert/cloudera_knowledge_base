Combined bar/line visuals
In CDP Data Visualization, Combined Bar/Line (Combo) visuals unite bar and line plots
      to enable easy comparison of trends and measures across the same dimensions.
noteThis visual type supports smooth rendering of streaming
         data.
The bars and the line can share the same vertical axis, or use a secondary axis. For more
         information, see Creating basic combo visuals and Assigning a measure to a
            secondary axis.
You can optionally render the line portion of the visual as an area. For more details, see
            Change the line to an area.
