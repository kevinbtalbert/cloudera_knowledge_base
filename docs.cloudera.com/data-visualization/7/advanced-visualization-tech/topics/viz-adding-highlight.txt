Adding highlights to visuals
Highlights are a practical way to bring attention to values that exceed a particular
    threshold. Cloudera Data Visualization currently supports highlight marks at
    specific values on the combined bar/line chart type, and enables you to customize these
    highlights.

The following steps demonstrate how add highlights to an existing chart. To start, we are
        using the visual World Population - Dual Bar and Line, developed on dataset
          World Life Expectancy [data source
          samples.world_life_expectancy]. For more information, see Combo
          visuals.


Open the visual World Population - Dual Bar and Line in
              Edit mode. For information on building this
          visual.

Clone the visual.






Click the Pencil icon next to the title of the visualization to
          edit it, and enter the new name.
Optional: 
Click the Pencil icon below the title of the visualization to
          add a brief description of the visual.

Change the title to World Population - Highlights on Dual Bar and
          Line.

At the top left corner of the Visual Designer, click
            Save.

Add the un_region field to the Filters shelf, and select
            Europe from the list of possible values.

This graph has more variation than the unified World data.


Click Refresh Visual.




You can see the pronounced peak in the GDP per Capita line,
            centered around the year 2005.


Based on the graph,  highlight the values where GDP per Capita
          is over $25,000.

Place the field gdp_per_capita on the shelf Highlight Mark
            Measure.

On the same shelf, click the Down arrow icon on the
            gdp_per_capita field, and choose Enter/Edit
            Expression.

In the Enter/Edit Expression window modal, delete the text in
          the default expression, change the function groupings to
            Conditional, and select the if
          statement.

note
Depending on the SQL dialect of the connection you are using, the syntax of the
                if statement may be different.






Complete the expression template.

It should look similar to the following expression:
if(avg([gdp_per_capita])>=25000, avg([gdp_per_capita]), null)
Optionally, you can alias the highlight; see the bold font in the changed
            expression.
if(avg([gdp_per_capita])>=25000, avg([gdp_per_capita]), null) 
            as 'GDP per Capita > 25K'


Click Save.






Save the visual, and then click View to change to
              View mode.




noteThe graph has green circle highlights when GDP per Capita
            values are equal or greater than 25,000.




Optional: 
The default highlight mark is a circle. To convert it to another type, use the visual
          Settings interface, as described in Change highlight type. You can also change the
          relative size of the mark, as described in Change highlight type.
