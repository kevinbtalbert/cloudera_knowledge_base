Multiple measure analysis
Cloudera Data Visualization supports measures in the trellis, for
    comparing multiple measures at the same time. This feature works in bar, line, area, and grouped
    bar visual types.

To implement this feature, simply add all the required measurement fields to the trellising
        shelves of the visual.
Follow these steps to create a multi-measure representation of data in the World
          Life Expectancy dataset.


Start a new visual based on dataset World Life Expectancy [data source
            samples.world_life_expectancy].For more information, see
            Creating a visual.
In the visuals menu, choose the Lines visual type.

Populate the shelves from the available fields (Dimensions,
            Measures, and so on) in the Data
          menu.


Under Dimensions, select year and place it
              on the X Axis shelf. Specify ascending order, and alias the
              field as 'Year'.
Under Measures, select gdp_per_capita and
              place it on the Y Axis shelf. 
Under Measures, select life_expectancy and
              place it on the Y Axis shelf. 
Under Measures, select population and place
              it on the Y Axis shelf.
Under Measures, select un_region and place
              it on the Colors shelf. Alias the field as 'UN
              Region'.



Change the calculations and alias for each of the fields on the Y
            Axis using the Expression Editor:



Change gdp_per_capita to the following expression, and click
                  Validate & Save.
sum([gdp_per_capita] * [population]) / sum([population]) as 'GDP per Capita'


Change life_expectancy to the following expression, and click
                  Validate & Save.
sum([life_expectancy] * [population])/sum([population]) as 'Life Expectancy'


Change population to the following expression, and click
                  Validate & Save.
sum([population]) as 'Population'




In the Settings menu, open the Axes group
          and select the Independent Aggregate Scale option.
Optional: 
In the Settings menu, open the Axes group
          and select the Gridlines Enables option.
Optional: 
In the Settings menu, open the Axes group
          and deselect the Include Y Axis Label option.

Click Refresh Visual. 

The trellised line visual appears. This approach makes it easy to see the values of all
            measurements along the same horizontal dimension (in this case, year).
