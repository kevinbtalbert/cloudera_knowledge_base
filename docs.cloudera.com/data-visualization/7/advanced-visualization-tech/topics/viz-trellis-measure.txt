Trellis on measures
Some visual types (bars, lines, areas, and grouped bars) may be trellised on measures,
    simply by adding more fields to the measurement shelf.

You can change the chart developed in Bars (Country /
          Life Expectancy) into a visual trellised on three measures: Life
          Expectancy, Population, and GDP per Capita. You
        can accomplish this by placing all three measurements on the Y Axis
        shelf.


Click the Y Axis shelf. Life Expectancy is
          already on the shelf.

With the shelf active, click the population field in the
            DATA menu.

Click the gdp_per_capita field in the DATA
          menu.

Click REFRESH VISUAL.




noteAs the magnitudes of the measurements vary, Cloudera
            recommends that you specify independent measurements and then click REFRESH
              VISUAL again.



This setup produces a measurement-trellised bar chart visual.



To compare this approach with plotting two measures onto the same line chart, see
          Line visuals with dual axes.
