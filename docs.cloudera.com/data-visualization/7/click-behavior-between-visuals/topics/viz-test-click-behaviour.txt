Exploring Click behavior


Before starting, make sure to refresh the browser page to load the updated Target
          Visual. Note that it does not show a map.


In the Control Visual, left-click one of the states (California) until the
          control menu appears, then click Test click behavior.




The Target Visual changes, zooming in on the California portion of the map,
            displaying population density in county choropleth mode.





Save the app and open it in View mode.

noteEvery click on a state region in the Control Visual
            refreshes the Target Visual.
