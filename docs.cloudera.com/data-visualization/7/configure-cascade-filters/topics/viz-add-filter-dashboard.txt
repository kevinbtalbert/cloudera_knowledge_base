Adding filters to the dashboard

Add the three filters to the dashboard.

In the Dashboard Designer, click the
            Filters tab on the left.

Under Dimensions, click the date field.
This adds a filter to the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also drag the field you
          want to use as a filter and drop it into the filter bar.

This filter is based directly on the field date, and has a type
              timestamp.



Add the other two filters. Under Dimensions, click the
            category field to add a filter based on that field. Similarly, click
          the pddistrict field to create the next filter.






Save the dashboard.
