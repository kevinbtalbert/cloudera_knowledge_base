Specifying default aggregation field for a dataset in NLS
In Data Visualization, you can specify which field's values report the default
        aggregation.

When a search phrase does not specify an aggregate measure, Data Visualization
                reports results of a default column as an aggregate. In the majority of cases, this
                default column is Record Count, a default aggregation measurement generated
                by the system.
In this example, inspection_score is selected to illustrate this
        functionality.


Navigate to the Fields page on the dataset page.

Click Edit Fields.






Click Edit Field for the field that you want to use as
                    an aggregate.






Choose a Default Aggregation type from the drop-down
                    list.






Click APPLY.

Navigate to the Search Modeling page.

Select the Default Aggregation Field from the drop-down
                    list.






Click SAVE.


If you type 'inspection score' in the search bar you get an average score as a
        result.
