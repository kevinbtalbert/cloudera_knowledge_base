Specifying fields for a dataset in NLS
Data Visualization makes it possible to limit Natural Language Search (NLS) to values
        of specified fields of the dataset.

You can restrict the search for a number of reasons, either from operational
                considerations, or for security reasons.


Under Fields, specify which fields may be searched
                    through NLS.

In the example below, most of the fields are selected. If you want to disable
                        search for a specific field in a dataset, simply remove all words and
                        phrases from Matching search terms of that field. In
                        the example below, the terms from Record Count were removed.


Choose an option from the drop-down list under Auto Search
                        Priority.

Higher priority columns are searched first, then medium, and finally low.
note Enabling Auto Search Priority will result in
                        additional queries even if the column is not specifically mentioned in the
                        search and can affect performance. Only enable it for columns from which
                        users want to pull information.
