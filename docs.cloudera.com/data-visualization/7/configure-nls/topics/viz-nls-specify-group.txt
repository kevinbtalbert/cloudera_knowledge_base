Specifying a group for a dataset in NLS
Data Visualization enables you to group datasets for Natural Language Search (NLS).
        You can use a group to more easily combine datasets during search operations.

Under Search Group, add a new name for the group or choose one from the already existing ones.

In the figure below, the dataset is added to the group ‘Inspections’.





Click SAVE.


You can see the datasets grouped in the drop-down list in the
          Search modal window.
