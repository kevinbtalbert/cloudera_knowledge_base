Specifying synonyms for a dataset in NLS
With Data Visualization, you can specify synonyms for dataset fields; these words can
        be used in Natural Language Search (NLS).

To specify alternate words for the dataset fields, you can add them to the
                    column Matching search terms. Separate synonyms by
                    including a single space, and use quotations for phrases.

Under Fields, add synonymous terms that can be searched
                    through NLS.

In the example below the terms 'business name', 'establishment', 'business',
                        'restaurant', and 'cafe' are added for the column ‘Business Name’.
