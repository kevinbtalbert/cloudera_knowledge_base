Specifying word substitutions for a dataset in NLS
Word substitutions enable you to connect common words with valid data specifications
        when using Natural Language Search (NLS) on Data Visualization datasets.

Common words and phrases have specific meaning in each dataset. In this example, you
        can see how to specify the meaning of the phrase 'current year' and the word 'domestic' into
        internal search terms.


Under Word Substitutions, click Add New
                        Item.

In the new row, add a common speech component in the Input word or
                        phrase column.

In the same row, under Internal search term, specify the
                    equivalent term in the dataset.

In this example, the phrase 'current year' was added with the clause 'year:2019',
                        setting the current year to 2019.
