Adding data
You can add data from a flat file into your Cloudera Data Visualization instance. It
    processes this data as a new table, adding it to an existing data repository. You can then use
    it as a source of supplemental information for existing datasets, by creating new table joins.
    You can also create a new dataset that references the imported data as a primary
    table.
importantData Import is available on the following
        connections:
Hive
Impala
MariaDB

Data Visualization supports two forms of data sources: CSV and URL.
You can use the Import Data functionality to supplement existing datasets; and add
      this data by creating joins in the data model. Depending on your business case, you may
      instead choose to create a new dataset based on the data you  imported.
If you must import data stored in Excel format, see Preparing Excel files for data
        import.
