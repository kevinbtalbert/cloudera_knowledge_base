Changing the locale setting of an imported file
When importing a data file, you can specify the localization for the data. This will
        specifically handle differences in specifying floating-point number.

Under Locale Setting, which is the default for your system,
                select one of the common options: United States, United Kingdom,
                    Sweden, Norway, or Other.
Selecting Other brings adds a new text entry box. Clicking on the information
                icon opens a separate menu, where you can select another supported locale. In our
                case, we selected Russian, ru_RU.
