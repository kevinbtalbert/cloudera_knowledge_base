Connecting to a data source in Cloudera Data Visualization
Data Visualization allows you to create connections to many types of external data
    sources.
When using Data Visualization in CDP Public Cloud with Cloudera
      Data Warehouse (CDW), the data connection is automatically set up, but you can connect to
      other data sources as well. In Cloudera Machine Learning (CML), you can connect to an Impala
      or a Hive data warehouse, or tie in data from predictive CML models.
The supported connection types are: 
Hive
Impala
MariaDB
MySQL
PostgreSQL
Spark SQL
SQLite (not supported in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW))
Snowflake (Technical Preview)
