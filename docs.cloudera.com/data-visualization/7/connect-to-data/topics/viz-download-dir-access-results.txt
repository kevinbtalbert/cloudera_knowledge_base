Downloading the results of a Direct Access query
After obtaining query results in the Direct Access interface, you can download the
    records in CSV format.

You can download the results in CSV format, by clicking DOWNLOAD
        CSV. The system saves the CSV file to your default download directory.
If you only want to download a subset of the query results, you can specify the
          Number of rows in CSV. This will limit the number of records in the
        CSV file.



The system saves the CSV file to your default download directory.
