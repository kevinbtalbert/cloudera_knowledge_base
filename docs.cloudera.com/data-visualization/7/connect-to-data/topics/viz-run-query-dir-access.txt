Running a SQL query in Direct Access
Learn how you can run a SQL query in the Direct Access interface of Cloudera Data
    Visualization.

On the main navigation bar, click DATA.

The DATA view appears, open on the
              Datasets tab.





Open the Supplemental menu ( ellipsis icon) and click
            >_ Direct Access.


The Direct Access interface appears, where you can select the
          database you want to access.

Add your SQL data query to the Enter SQL below code-enabled text
          box.

The Autocomplete option is on by default. It validates the syntax of
            the SQL query you enter.
If you want to limit the number of, you have two options:

You can add a limit clause in the SQL query syntax.
You can mark the Add in a "LIMIT 100" clause to any SQL select query that does
                not have a limit clause option. This limitation is on by default. If you set a
              record limit in the SQL query, it will override this default option, even if it is
              checked.






Click RUN to execute the SQL query.

After the query executes, the results area shows the query results.
In this example, the following query has been run: select * from
              main.us_counties limit 5



note
            If there is a error in the query the line number with the error will be displayed if the database returns it.
