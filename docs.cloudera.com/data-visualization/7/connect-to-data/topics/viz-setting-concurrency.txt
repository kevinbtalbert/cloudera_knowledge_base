Setting concurrency for a data connection
You can limit the number of simultaneous connections on certain datasets for better
        resource handling. 

noteThis setting is only applicable to Impala, Hive and SQLite
                connections.


Open the Edit Data Connection modal.
For more information, see Editing a data connection.

Click the DATA tab.

Provide a number in the Concurrency field to set the
                    maximum limit for simultaneous requests.

noteThe default maximum concurrency setting per connection is 100.
                        You can change it to a different value in Site Settings > Advanced Settings. If you change the default value, make sure that the new
                        maximum concurrency is approriate for your data
                        connection.DATACONNECTION_CONCURRENCY_DEFAULT = 100
DATACONNECTION_CONCURRENCY_MAX = 100



Provide a number in the Concurrency Per User field to
                    limit the maximum number of simultaneous requests that a user can send.

noteYou can use this setting to prevent that one user blocks
                        access for a connection. The default concurrency setting per user is 5 and
                        the default maximum concurrency setting per user is 100. You can change it
                        to a different value in Site Settings > Advanced Settings.DATACONNECTION_CONCURRENCY_USER_DEFAULT = 5
