Using the Direct Access interface
The Direct Access interface of Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to run SQL
    queries on data connections directly on the DATA page. You can quickly examine the structure of
    tables that are available on the connection, build a query using standard SQL syntax, preview
    its results, and then create a dataset on the query. You can also download the data, if
    needed.
