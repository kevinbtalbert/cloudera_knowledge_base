User impersonation in CDW
User impersonation allows Cloudera Data Visualization to execute queries in Cloudera
  Data Warehouse (CDW) on behalf of logged in users through a trusted service account.
When setting up a Hive or Impala data connection within the same CDW environment as your Data
   Visualization instance, the domain is considered secure and trusted and a default service account
   can be used for authentication. Impersonation in the Advanced settings is
   turned on by default. During setup, when a trusted connection is selected, the necessary
   information is auto-populated. These are passwordless connections, so only the username field is
   populated with the service user.
As a result of impersonation all incoming queries are evaluated against the data security
   policies of the usersâ€™ setup in Ranger. From the query logs and profiles, you can see the trusted
   service user appears as the Connected User for authentication. The Cloudera Data Visualization
   user appears as the Delegated User for authorization, and their permissions will be evaluated
   before query runtime to ensure they have access to the data they are requesting.
