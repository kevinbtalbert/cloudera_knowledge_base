What is a dashboard?
A dashboard is a collection of multiple visuals with optional filtering applied.
    Cloudera Data Visualization dashboards consolidate related visualizations. They can display and
    link visuals that are based on different datasets across different connections and provide
    run-time filtering on all referenced information. 
The Dashboard Designer interface enables you to build
      visuals and dashboards.
Dashboards can contain one or more sheets for organizing visualizations. This gives
      you the flexibility to place all necessary information about a dataset, a line of inquiry, or
      a business on the same screen, and still have quick access to related or supplemental
      visualizations on other sheets. It all depends on the needs and wants of your enterprise.
After you create a dashboard, you can add visuals and filter controls. You can also
      change your settings and styles, and add custom styles.
