Data joins in Data Visualization 
With Cloudera Data Visualization, you can create joins between different table
    columns.
Data Visualization supports five types of column connections, also known as
      joins.
noteThe types of joins available depend on the underlying database. For example: MySQL
      connections do not support FULL OUTER JOIN operations. SQLite connections do not support FULL
      OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN operations.
Inner join
It is the most common join type. Rows in the result set contain the requested
        columns from both tables for all combinations of rows where the selected columns of the
        tables have identical values.

Left join
The result set contains all rows from the left table and the matching data from
        the right table. Whenever no matching data is available on the right side of the join, the
        corresponding columns in the result set have the value NULL.

Right join
The result set contains all rows from the right table and the matching data from
        the left table. Whenever no matching data is available on the left side of the join, the
        corresponding columns in the result set have the value NULL.

Outer join
An outer join returns all rows from both tables. Whenever no matching data is
        available on one of the sides of the join, the corresponding columns in the result set have
        the value NULL.

Left outer join
It supports join elimination in datasets that contain more than one table. By
        default, this setting is on, but it can be disabled.
