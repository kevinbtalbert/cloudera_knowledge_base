Defining additional derived data


Next, define other derived data in the same shelf set-up and save it as
                                derived data LifeExpXPop.


On the Dimensions shelf, place the
                                        following fields: un_region,
                                                un_subregion, and
                                                country.

Add the derived data Pop to the
                                                Dimensions shelf.
You should do this because fields on the
                                                Measure shelf must be
                                        aggregated, but the definition of Pop
                                        already includes the summation over the
                                                population field.

Place the field life_expectancy on the
                                                Measures shelf and change the
                                        aggregate to avg(life_expectancy).

Place the field year on the
                                                Filters shelf and change the
                                        expression to
                                                [year]=<<year_param:2000>>.






Duplicate Derived data
                                                Pop in place, on the
                                                Dimensions shelf.

Click the Down Arrow icon to the right
                                        of the cloned field and click Enter/Edit
                                                Expression in the dropdown.

In the Enter/Edit Expression modal
                                        window, change the expression to
                                                [life_expectancy]*[Pop] and save
                                        it.






Save the same field as derived data, named
                                                LifeExpXPop.

You can see that in the Data menu,
                                                under Dimensions, you have a
                                                new category Derived Data
                                                that contains LifeExpXPop.





To check the definition of the saved derived data
                                                LifeExpXPop, click the down arrow
                                        to the right of its name and click View
                                                Definition.
The Derived Data Definition modal
                                        window appears. Note that the definition includes a
                                        parametrized filter for year, and the
                                                Pop derived data field.



Replace the field on the Dimensions
                                        shelf with the new derived data field, click
                                                Refresh Visual, and
                                                Save the application.

The visual should look similar to this one. Note that we
                                                aliased the fields and made some changes to display
                                                formats:
