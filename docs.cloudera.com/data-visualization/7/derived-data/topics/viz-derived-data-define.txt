Defining derived data


Inside a visual that generates a subset of data, select a measure field on a
          shelf.

In this case, we are using sum(population).


Click the Right Arrow icon to the right of the field.






In the dropdown, click Save Expression.






In the Save expression to dataset or as derived data modal
          window, under Name, type Pop, and click
            SAVE.




You can see that in the left navigation under Measures, you have
            a new category Derived Data that contains
            Pop.





To check the definition of the saved derived data Pop, click the down
          arrow to the right of its name, and click View Definition.




The Derived Data Definition modal window appears. You can see
            that the definition includes a parameterized filter for year.





Click SAVE to save both the visual and the new derived data
          definitions.


You can now use Pop as any other measure.
