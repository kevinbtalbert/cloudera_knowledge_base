Saving derived data with full context


This is the default option, when the entire context of the derived data expression
                can be captured and re-used. In he earlier example, the definition of derived data
                includes Label, Dimensions, Measures, and Filters:






Saving derived data expression only


When selected the Expression Only option, only the
                        expression of the base field is saved. The advantage here is that a
                        complicated expression may be reused in any context.



In this case, the definition of derived data includes just the Label
                        and the Measures.
