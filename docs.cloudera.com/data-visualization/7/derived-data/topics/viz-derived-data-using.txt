Using derived data


To use the derived data measurements in a calculation, treat it as any other
                measurement. In this example, the derived data LifeExpXPop is used
                to accurately calculate the weighted life expectancy for an aggregation
                dimension, such as UN Region or UN Subregion. You can do this by dividing the sum of
                Life Expectancy X Population by sum(population) at the appropriate
                aggregate level.


Place the following fields on the Dimensions shelf:
                        un_region and un_subregion.

Add the derived data field Pop.

Place the field year on the Filters
                    shelf , and change the expression to
                        [year]=<<year_param:2000>>.

Place the derived data field LifeExpXPop onto the
                        Meausres shelf. Notice that it appears as an
                    aggregation, sum(LifeExpXPop).

Using the Enter/Edit Expression window modal, change the
                    definition of the field as follows,and click Save.
You can see that the field has been
                    aliased.(sum([LifeExpXPop])/sum([population])) as 'Weighted Life Expectancy'
Optional: 
Use the Alias option to change the column names to UN
                        Region, UN Subregion

Click Refresh Visual.

The visual should look similar to this one:





[Optional] To see the correctly calculated Life Expectancy for a UN
                    Region, remove UN Subregion from the Dimensions
                    shelf.
