Cloning events


The following steps demonstrate how to create a new event in the dataset by cloning an
        existing one. You can use the event Start that was set up in Creating
        Events.


On the main navigation bar, click DATA.

Select Campaign dataset. Dataset side navigation appears, open at
            Dataset Detail view.

In the side navigation menu, click Events.

In the Events list, find the event to clone, and click
            Clone.

In this example, we are cloning Start.





A populated Add Event modal window appears.






In the Add Event modal window, update the following
          entries:


Change Event Name from Copy of Start to
              End.
Under Filters, click the filter expression text box that
              contains name='$session_started', to open a Filter
                Expression modal window and edit the expression. 






In the Filter Expression modal window, enter the following
          expression: name='$session_ended'

[Optional] Click Validate Expression to test the
          expression.

Click Apply to save the new filter expression and return to the
            Add Event modal window.






In the Add Event window modal, notice that the Filters field contains the
          specified expression.






Click SAVE.

The new event definition appears in the Events interface.
