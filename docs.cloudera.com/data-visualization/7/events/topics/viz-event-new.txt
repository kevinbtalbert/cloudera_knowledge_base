Creating events
This article demonstrates how to create new events in a dataset.

To demonstrate how to create new events, we used the Campaign dataset, based on data
        previously imported into Data Visualization from a data file.
To create a new event in the dataset Campaign, follow these steps:


On the main navigation bar, click Data.

The Data view appears.


Open on the Datasets tab.

Find the dataset in the list of datasets, either by scrolling or by using search, and
          click on it. Select the Campaign dataset. 

Dataset side navigation appears.


Open at Dataset Detail view.

In the side navigation menu, click Events.




The Events interface appears.


In the Events interface, click New
          Event.




The Add Event modal window appears.


In the Add Event modal window make the following entries:


Under Event Name, enter Start.
Under Event Display, enter name.

Under Filters, click the text box to open the
                  Filter Expression modal window.







In the The Filter Expression modal window, enter the following
          expression: name='$session_started'






Click Apply to save the filter expression and return to the
            Add Event modal window. 

In the Add Event window modal, notice that the Filters field contains the
            specified expression.


Click Save.






The new event definition appears in the Events interface.

Note the actions available for this event: Edit,
              Clone, and Delete.





Repeat the preceding steps to create six additional events for this dataset, as defined
          in the following table.

You already created the event in the first row. Alternatively, you can create new
            events by cloning existing events. See, Cloning Events

            similar to the following:
