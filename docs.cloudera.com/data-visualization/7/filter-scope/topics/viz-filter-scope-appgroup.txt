Setting app scope for filters
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to extend the scope of a filter so that all
        dashboards in the app are automatically filtered by it

All apps that contain the dashboard inherit the selections and behavior of this
                filter. All sheets in a dashboard also inherit the filter behavior. App scope
                dashboard filters appear only in the filter area, either across the top or on the
                left side; you cannot move them into the main grid area.
Follow these steps to set App scope filter in a dashboard:


Open a dashboard in Edit mode that has a filter widget.
If you do not have a dashboard with filters, add a new filter widget. For
                    instructions, see Creating dataset filters on dashboards or
                        Creating custom filters on dashboards.

Hover over the top right corner of the filter widget, and click the
                        Gear icon to configure the filter.




The Settings modal window appears.


Select the Scope tab.

Set the filter visibility to App.

Select the All Datasets option.

After you select the App option for visibility, the
                        filter widget on the dashboard displays a gray triangle on the top left
                        corner of the filter. If you hover over the triangle you can see a tooltip
                        that says 'Has App Scope'.noteApp scope dashboard
