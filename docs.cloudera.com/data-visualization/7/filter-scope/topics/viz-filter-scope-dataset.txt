Setting dataset scope for filters
In Cloudera Data Visualization, you must set the dataset scope in your
        dashboard.

Open a dashboard in Edit mode that has a filter widget.
If you do not have a dashboard with filters, add a new filter widget. For
                    instructions, see Creating dataset filters on dashboards or
                        Creating custom filters on dashboards.

Hover over the top right corner of the filter widget and click the
                        Gear icon to configure the filter.




The Settings modal window appears.


Select the Scope tab.

Set the filter visibility to Sheet.

Set the Scope of parameters by this filter option to
                        All Datasets.

This option ensures that the dashboard filtering is consistent for all
                        visuals that share this filter's dataset.
This is the default for new filters.





Click APPLY.
