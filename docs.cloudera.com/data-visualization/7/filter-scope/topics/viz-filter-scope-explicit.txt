Setting explicit scope for filters


To enable explicit filter scope, which acts on individual visuals, you must set the
                Explicit Scope option.


Open a dashboard in Edit mode that has a filter widget.
If you do not have a dashboard with filters, add a new filter widget. For
                    instructions, see Creating dataset filters on dashboards or
                        Creating custom filters on dashboards.

Hover over the top right corner of the filter widget and click the
                        Gear icon to configure the filter.




The Settings modal window appears.


Select the Scope tab.

Set the Scope of parameters by this filter option to
                        Explicit.

Click APPLY.
