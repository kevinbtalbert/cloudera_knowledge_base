Selecting discrete values on filter shelves


It is very simple to select discrete values on the filter shelf for all data types:
                numerical, string, date, and so on.
For selecting discrete numbers in a filter, the example from building Cross
                    tabulation is used, where several discrete years of the dataset World
                    Life Expectancy are specified.


On the Filters shelf, click the Down
                        Arrow on the year field placed there earlier, then click
                        Select values.






In the Filter for year modal window, under the
                        Values tab, select 1900, 1910, 1920, 1930, 1940,
                        1950, 1960, 1970, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010.

Click APPLY.






Click REFRESH VISUAL.
The cross tabulation visual appears with the years specified in the previous step.

Alternatively, with numerical data, you can specify a range of
                        numerical values. For more information, see Selecting a range of number values on filter shelves. You can also choose the
                        desired combination of filters by specifying an expression. For more
                        information, see Selecting values by using an expression on filter shelves.
