Selecting values by using an expression on filter shelves


The Enter/Edit Expression interfaced may be used on a filter
                shelf to fine-tune value filtering, and to incorporate information about values from
                multiple rows of the dataset. To demonstrate this approach, let's use the example
                from building Cross tabulation, where we specify
                several discrete years of the dataset World Life Expectancy.


On the Filters shelf, click Down
                        Arrow on the year field placed there earlier.

Click [ ] Enter/Edit Expression






In the Enter/Edit Expression modal window, build an
                    expression.

We used the following expression to specify a range of year values:
[year]BETWEEN 1950 AND 2010





Click Validate Expression.

Click Save.

After clicking Refresh Visual, the cross tabulation
                    visual appears.

Note the range of years we specified in the previous step, and that the
                        columns stop reporting life expectancy when it reaches the threshold of 50
                        years for all seven countries in Middle Africa UN sub-region.





Let us change the expression to report only when life expectancy is at 50 years
                    or more for the same year range.

([year]BETWEEN 1950 AND 2010) AND ([life_expectancy]>=50)
Note the following results:

The first row is for year 1960, the first time a country in Middle
                            Africa reported a life expectancy over 50 years.
Only five out of seven countries are reporting; this means that life
                            expectancy for Chad and Congo never reaches 50 years over the period
                            covered by our dataset, through the year 2010.
