Selecting a range of dates on filter shelves


For selecting a range of dates in a filter shelf, let's use a visual built
                
                in Creating joins.


Create a new field crs_dep_timestamp directly on the
                    dataset.

It combines the fl_date and crs_dep_time
                            data into a new timestamp field that has the following
                        definition:

                        concat(substr(cast([fl_date] as string),1,11), 
                        if(length(cast([crs_dep_time] as string))=3,
                        concat('0',substr(cast([crs_dep_time] as string),1,1),':',
                        substr(cast([crs_dep_time] as string),2,2),':00'),
                        concat(' ',substr(cast([crs_dep_time] as string),1,2),':',
                        substr(cast([crs_dep_time] as string),3,2),':00')))
                    


Create a new cross tabulation visual on the dataset Flight Delays with
                    the following configuration:


On the X shelf, add the dimension
                                unique_carrier. Alias the field as
                                Airline.
On the Y shelf, add the dimension
                                fl_date. Click the filed name, and under the
                                    Field Properties, change the
                                    Date/Time Functions to
                                    Date.




On the Measures shelf, add the measure
                                dep_delay, and ensure that it uses the
                                avg(dep_delay) aggregate. Alias the field as
                                Delay.
On the Filters shelf, add
                                crs_dep_timestamp.



Click Refresh Visual. Note that all the date values in
                    the dataset, starting with 2015-01-01 and ending with 2015-02-28.






On the Filters shelf, click the
                        crs_dep_timestamp field.

Click Select values.






In the Filter for crs_dep_timestamp
                    modal window, click the Date Range tab.

Click inside the textbox that contains the text.

Click to select range.

Note the selection options in date range/calendar interface:

Pre-set ranges, such as Today, Yesterday, Last 7 Days, Last Week, Last
                            30 Days, This Month, and Last Month.
Custom Range, that can be configured either through the FROM and TO
                            entry boxes, or by manipulating the calendar widgets
Time of Day control for beginning and end of the time period.






In the calendar widget, select the date range of 24th of January 2015 (10:00
                    AM) through 17th of February 2015 (9:30 PM).

Click Apply.






After clicking Refresh Visual, the updated visual
                    appears. Note the range of dates we specified in the previous step.
