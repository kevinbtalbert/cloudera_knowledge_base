Selecting a string pattern for values on filter shelves 


For selecting a range of numerical values in a filter shelf, let's use the example
                from building Cross tabulation, where we specify several discrete years
                of the dataset World Life Expectancy.


On the Filters shelf, click Down
                        Arrow on the year field placed there earlier, then click
                        Select values.






In the Filter for country modal window, click the
                        Pattern tab, and then enter the necessary
                    information.

The patterns can be matched in the following manner:

Starts With
Ends With
Contains



To select all countries that start with Z, select Starts With, enter Z
                    in the text box, and click Apply.






After clicking Refresh Visual, the cross tabulation
                    visual appears. Note that only two countries, Zambia and Zimbabwe, match the
                    filter conditions.






To select all countries that end with 'stan', select Ends
                        With, enter stan in the text box, and click
                        Apply.
