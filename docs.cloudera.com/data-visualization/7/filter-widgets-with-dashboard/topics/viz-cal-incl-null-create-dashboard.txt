Creating a dashboard with date filters
In Cloudera Data Visualization, the quick date filter enables you to provide a quick
    selection of date ranges for visualizing your data.

This example shows a dashboard with a Scatter visual that plots created and
          resolved issues.


Create a new dashboard and name it 'Issue Completeness'.

In the Dashboard Designer, create a Scatter visual based on the
            Issue Tracker dataset.

Populate the shelves from the available Dimensions and
            Measures fields in the DATA menu.


Under the X shelf, add created from
                Measures.
Under the Y shelf, add resolved from
                Measures.
Click the field to open the Field Properties menu and make
              the following changes:
Select Enter/Edit Expression, enter the following
                  expression, and click SAVE:
if([resolved] IS NOT NULL,datediff([resolved],[created]),datediff(now(),[created]))

Select Alias and name the field 'Days Open'.

Under Colors, add assignee from
                Dimensions.
Under Tooltips, add the following fields:
Description
Issue Key
Assignee
Date Open
Date Closed

Under Filters, add created and
                resolved from Dimensions.



Click REFRESH VISUAL.

Click SAVE.
The visual appears in the main area of the dashboard interface.

Add two date filters, created and
            resolved in the dashboard, with a date range from
            2018-06-25 to 2018-09-12.
For information on how to create date filters in a dashboard, see Using fixed
            dates (date range picker) mode.

Click SAVE.

The following image shows the new dashboard you have created.
      This visual does not include the null values in the dataset.


Proceed to the next section to learn how to include null
      values in a visual.
