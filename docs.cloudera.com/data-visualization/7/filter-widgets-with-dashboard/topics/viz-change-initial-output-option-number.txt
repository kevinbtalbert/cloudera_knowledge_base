Changing number of initial options in dashboard filters
In a dashboard filter, you can control the number of initial options that appear in the
    dashboard filter at loading time. This limits the display of options for datasets with a very
    large variability.

To change the number of options that appear in the dashboard filter at loading time, and
        before you enter a search criteria, follow these steps:


Open a dashboard in Edit mode and hover over a filter that is already added to
          the dashboard until the controls appear on the top right.

Click the Gear icon.
The Settings modal window appears.



In the Settings modal window, click
          Data.

Enter a value in the Maximum default number of values displayed.
          The default is 1000.

Click APPLY.

In the following example, you can compare the difference in number of values displayed
            when we change the Maximum default number of values displayed
            setting from 2 to 10. Notice that the search text box is empty. The number
            of items displayed depends on the setting in this option, not on the search
            criteria.
