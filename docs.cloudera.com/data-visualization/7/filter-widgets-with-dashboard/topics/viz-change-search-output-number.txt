Changing number of options in search output of dashboard filters
In a dashboard filter, you can change the maximum number of options that appear during
    search. This limits the display of options for datasets with a very large
    variability.

To change the number of items that are displayed when you search for options in the filter,
        follow these steps: 


Open a dashboard in Edit mode and hover over a filter that is already added to
          the dashboard until the controls appear on the top right.

Click the Gear icon.
The Settings modal window appears.



In the Settings modal window, click
          Data.

Enter a value in the Maximum number of search results displayed.
          The default is 1000.

Click APPLY.
