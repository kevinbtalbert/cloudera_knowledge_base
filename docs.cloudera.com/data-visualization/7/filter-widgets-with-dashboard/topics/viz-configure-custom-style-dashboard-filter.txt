Configuring custom styles for dashboard filters
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to apply custom styles to a newly created
    filter in a dashboard.

When applying custom styles, there are several approaches: setting custom styles, setting
        custom styles at the dashboard level, setting styles for a visual, see Adding custom
          styles to visuals and Customizing style. Or setting styles for an
        application filter, described here.
note
Prerequisite: By default, the Custom Styling option is turned off. It can be turned
        on by a user with administrative privileges; see Adding custom styles to
          visuals.
Follow these steps to configure custom styles for dashboard filters:


Click the Gear icon on the filter widget.

In the Settings modal window, click the Custom
            Style tab, and examine the available options.
