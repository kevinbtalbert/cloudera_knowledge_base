Configuring ranges on dashboard filters
In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can easily configure real-time filters that enable
    you to navigate across visuals built on time series. Both historical data and ongoing data feeds
    are supported.

This example uses a dashboard with a line visual that plots stock prices and volume of
        sales. The filter added uses a set of previously defined dateranges, as described in
          Managing custom dates.
Follow these steps to add and configure a real-time filter on a dashboard:


Open the dashboard in Edit mode.

Switch to the Filters tab on the Dashboard
            Designer side menu bar.

In the Filters menu, under Dimensions,
          click the Date field.




Data Visualization adds the filter Date to the filters section of the
            dashboard.


Hover over the upper right corner of the filter, and click the
            Gear icon to configure the filter.

The Settings modal window opens on the
              Basic tab.





Select the option Permit selection of time range.

Click the Ranges tab of the Settings
          modal window and select the the appropriate range.

Click APPLY.

On the filter, click the Calendar icon and select the
            Quick filters option from the menu.

The appearance of the filter changes to show the set of custom date ranges.

            filters.
