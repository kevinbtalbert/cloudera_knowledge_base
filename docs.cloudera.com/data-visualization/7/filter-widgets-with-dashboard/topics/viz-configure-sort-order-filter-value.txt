Configuring sort order in filter values
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to select the sort order of filter
    values.

There are different sort order options available on field-based
          filters and custom
          filters. 
Follow these steps to select the sort order of the filter values.


Click the Gear icon on the filter widget.

In the Settings modal window, switch to the
            Data tab, and select the Filter Options Sort
            Order option.

Sort Order of Filter Widget Values on Field-based Filters
For a field-based filter, there are two sort options available under the
              Filter Options Sort Order setting:

Ascending
Descending

By default, filter widget values are displayed in ascending order (image on the left).
            In this example, to see the most recent population of Australia first, select the
              Descending option (image on the right). 



By default, filter widget values are displayed in ascending order. In our example, to
            see the most recent population of Australia first, select the
              Descending option. 


Sort Order of Filter Widget Values on Custom Filters
For a custom filter, there are three sort options available under the Filter
              Options Sort Order setting:

Ascending
Descending
Default




The default setting of the sort order in a custom filter is
              Default. In the following image, notice that the default sort
            order in the filter widget is the same as the lables of the custom filter added in the
              Values tab: Country, Year, Region, and
              GDP.
You can select the Ascending option to change the sort order to
              country, GDP, Region, and Year, or select the
              Descending option to change the sort order to Year, Region,
              GDP, and Country.
