Creating custom filters on dashboards
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to create a custom filter based on any
    parameter.

The following steps demonstrate how to create custom filters in a dashboard.


Open an existing dashboard in Edit mode.

Switch to the Filters tab on the Dashboard
            Designer side menu bar.

Click CREATE CUSTOM FILTER.




You can see a new filter widget named New Filter on the dashboard.


To configure the new dashboard filter, hover over the filter and click the
            Gear icon in the top right of the filter widget.




The Settings modal window opens on the
              Values tab.
Note that the Save selections made in edit mode setting is
            available. You can use it to save text, numeric, or date range selections made in
              Edit mode. When unselected, filter values selected while editing the dashboard
            will not be the default in Edit mode.
