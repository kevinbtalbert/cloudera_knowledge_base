Creating dataset filters on dashboards
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to add a filter widget to the dashboard based
    on any field in the dataset.

Open an existing dashboard in Edit mode.

Switch to the Filters tab on the Dashboard
            Designer side menu bar.

Check that you are using the correct connection for the filter. If not, switch to the
          desired connection.

Select the dataset for the filter.

Click any field of the dataset to add a widget to the dashboard that filters on this
          field.
Alternatively, you can also drag the field that you want to use as a filter and drop
          it into the filter bar on the dashboard.You can see the new filter widget named after
            the field name you have used.

To configure the new dashboard filter, hover over the filter and click the
            Gear icon in the top right of the filter widget.




The Settings modal window opens on the
              Values tab.
Note that the Dataset of the filter is displayed. You can use
            the switch action to quickly change the filter across datasets and connections.
Also, there is a Save selections made in edit mode setting
            available. You can use it to save text, numeric, or date range selections made in
              Edit mode. When unselected, filter values selected while editing the dashboard
            will not be the default in Edit mode.
