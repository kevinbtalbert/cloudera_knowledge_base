Customizing output parameters
In Cloudera Data Visualization, application controls can use custom output parameters.
    You can apply a filter defined in one dataset to control visual presentation based on
    information in another dataset.

In most cases, there is a mismatch between the field names of the driver and target
        datasets. You can correctly specify this mapping by setting the value of the filter to the
        appropriate field in the target dataset.
The following steps show you how to configure a filter based on the US Populations Over
          Time dataset to control the display in a visual based on the US County
          Population dataset.


Open an existing or new application in Edit mode.

Ensure that it has appropriate visuals from both datasets. If not, click the
            Visuals tab on the left navigation and add the visuals to the
          application.

Click the Filters tab, and select the US State Populations
            Over Time dataset.
Under Dimensions, click the field state to add
          the filter to the application.

Hover over a filter that is already added to the application until the controls appear
          on the top right and click the Gear icon.




The Settings modal window appears open on the
              Values tab.


Set the following values:


Set Title to States.
Set Output Parameter to stname.

noteFrom Base Field has the value state and it
            cannot be changed.


Click APPLY.

In the state filter, click Select and
          chose the following:


AK
AL
AR



In the top right corner of the application, hover over the Filter icon control element.

This reports the current filtering parameters, correctly naming the output parameter
            field stname, and correctly identifying the filtering conditions set
            earlier.



If the option to Emit distinct parameters for each item selected
            is selected (under Display Settings tab), the filter reports the
            items as distinct key/value pairs. By default, the label for each key is derived from its
            value. If the labels are specified, such as in the case of optional parameters, they
            appear instead.
