Disabling incremental queries in filters
In the Data menu of a newly created field-based or custom filter
    in a dashboard, Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to disable incremental queries at the
    level of the dashboard filter .

Incremental queries return preliminary results quicker and paints the visuals on the
        dashboard, and then adjusts the level of detail as more results are incorporated into the
        calculations. Disabling this feature delays the painting of the visuals until all results
        are in.
Follow these steps to disable imcremental queries:


Click the Gear icon on the filter widget

In the Settings modal window, switch to the
            Data tab, and select the Disable incremental queries,
            overriding field-based-level setting option
