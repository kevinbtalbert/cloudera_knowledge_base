Displaying distinct parameters
You can use this option to ensure that parameters show a distinct 'key':'value' pair in
    a dashboard filter.

This option ensures that each selection is processed by the filter as a distinct
        'key':'value' pair. By default, the selections are passed as a 'key':'list of values'.
This option enables a single filter to be potentially used for multiple purposes. 


Open a dashboard in Edit mode and hover over a filter that is already added to
          the dashboard until the controls appear on the top right.

Click the Gear icon.
The Settings modal window appears.

Click the Display Settings tab and check the Emit
            distinct parameters for each item selected option.

Click APPLY.
