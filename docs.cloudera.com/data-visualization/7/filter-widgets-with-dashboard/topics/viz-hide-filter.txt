Hiding filters
This option allows you to hide the custom filter in a dashboard.

If no viable selection data exists, this option hides the filter in View mode.


Open a dashboard in Edit mode and hover over a filter that is already added to
          the dashboard until the controls appear on the top right.

Click the Gear icon.
The Settings modal window appears.

Click the Display Settings tab and check the Hide
            filter if no input data option.

Click APPLY.
