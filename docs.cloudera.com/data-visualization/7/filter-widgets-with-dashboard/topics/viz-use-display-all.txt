Selecting all values
This option allows you to ensure that all data may be examined at once in a dashboard
    filter.

For example, in single select mode on a cereal name filter, you can only look at details of
        one cereal. It may be interesting to look at information of all cereals at the same
        time.
Follow these steps to select all options at the same time:


Open a dashboard in Edit mode and hover over a filter that is already added to
          the dashboard until the controls appear on the top right.

Click the Gear icon.
The Settings modal window appears.

Click the Display Settings tab, then check the Allow
            only one item to be selected at a time option and the Include an
            option for '(All)' sub-option.

Click APPLY.

The All option appears in the filter box.
