Using multi-select mode
This option allows you to select multiple options in the dropdown menu in a dashboard
    filter.

This option allows you to select multiple options in the dropdown, then apply all changes
        to the filter together by clicking outside the table. This collapses the list. For
        multi-select list, this is a recommended option as it minimizes the query refresh time.
This is the default mode for application controls.


Open a dashboard in Edit mode and hover over a filter that is already added to
          the dashboard until the controls appear on the top right.

Click the Gear icon.
The Settings modal window appears.

Click the Display Settings tab and select Apply all
            changes to a multi-select list at the same time.

Click APPLY.

                Show All.

              selections.
