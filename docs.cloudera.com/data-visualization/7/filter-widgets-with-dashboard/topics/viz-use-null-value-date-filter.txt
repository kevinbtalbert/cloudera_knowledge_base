Including null values in date filters
In Cloudera Data Visualization, the date filter enables you to select null values for
    visualization.

The following steps use a Scatter visual, which is built on the Issue Tracker
        dataset. This dataset includes issues that are created and resolved and also issues
        that are created but still open. Resolved issues have a timestamp and open issues
        have a 'null' value.
By default, visuals only display values with a timestamp. This feature enables you to
        configure the date filter and display 'null' values in the visuals.
