Using quick filters
In Cloudera Data Visualization, the quick date filter enables you to provide a quick
    selection of date ranges for visualizing your data.

These steps show you how to use the quick filters option for a date and time filter. The
        instructions use a calendar heatmap visual as an example.

 You have created dashboard with quick filters. For
      instructions, see Managing custom dates and Configuring ranges on dashboard
        filters.

Open your dashboard in Edit mode.

Click the Calendar icon on the filter and select
            Quick filters from the menu.

The appearance of the filter changes to show the set of custom date ranges.





To use the quick filter, save the dashboard and switch to
              View mode.

Explore how the visual display changes when you click the different filter
          ranges.


In these examples, you can see how the visual changes when the following filter date ranges
        are applied: none (all data), 3 years, and 1 quarter.
