Using single value mode with radio buttons
This option allows you to select a single value from the menu in a dashboard
    filter.
This mode of dashboard controls uses radio button choices to let the user select a
      single value.

Open a dashboard in Edit mode and hover over a filter that is already added to
          the dashboard until the controls appear on the top right.

Click the Gear icon.
The Settings modal window appears.

Click Display Settings tab and check the Allow only
            one item to be selected at a time option.

Click APPLY.
