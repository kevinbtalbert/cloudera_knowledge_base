Filter scope
Cloudera Data Visualization uses filters and parameters to change the analysis criteria
  at run-time by specifying the data selected for the visuals. Filter scope determines the level at
  which filters are active.
Filter scope has the following three options:
Explicit scope
Explicit scope is defined when a dashboard or visual sends out parameters to other visuals,
    and the visuals accepts these parameters in their Filters shelf. This can
    be enabled at the level of each visual. 
Explicit scope is expected to be used sparingly, for a small number of visuals in each
    dashboard that represent a high-level look at a metric and that should not be filtered by
    visible filters.
noteExplicit scope overrides dataset scope.
The scope of click behavior is explicit. 
tipIf you want visuals to be updated based on selected elements, make sure to
    explicitly place these columns in the filter shelf of the target visuals.

Dataset scope
Dataset scope filter applies to all visuals in a dashboard that do not have explicit scope
    turned on. Filters with dataset scope apply to all visuals in the dashboard that are using the
    same dataset. This is the default for new filters.
tipDataset scope filters continue to use the parameter passing mechanism, and these
    parameters may be used within visuals in many ways, for example in the title, within
    expressions.

App scope
App scope automatically filters all dashboards in the app. For more information, see
     Setting app scope for filters.
