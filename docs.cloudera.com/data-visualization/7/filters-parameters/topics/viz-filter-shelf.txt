Filter shelves
Cloudera Data Visualization uses filters and parameters to change the analysis
        criteria at run-time by specifying the data selected for the visuals. Filters define the
        subsets of data that is examined in a visual. By placing either measures or dimensions on
        the filter shelf of a visual, you can exclude or include specific values or a range of
        values from the data used.
You can specify filters by using one of the following methods:
Select a value or values from a list, or through an interface specific to the
                    data type
Specify an expression that represents the filtering function


For more information on filter expressions, see Syntax for using
            parameters.
