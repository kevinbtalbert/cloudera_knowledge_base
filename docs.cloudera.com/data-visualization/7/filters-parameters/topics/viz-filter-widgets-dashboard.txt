Filter widgets on dashboards
Cloudera Data Visualization uses filters and parameters to change the analysis criteria
        at run-time by specifying the data selected for the visuals. A filter is a control element
        that is tied to underlying column values from a table.
While building a dashboard, you can add filter widgets to the
                Filters area of the dashboard. Alternatively, you can create
            and add a custom filter to the dashboard. After you define a custom filter, you can use
            it on the shelves of the visuals to dynamically update the output.
For instructions on how to create and work with filter widgets, see the articles in
                Using filter widgets on dashboards.
