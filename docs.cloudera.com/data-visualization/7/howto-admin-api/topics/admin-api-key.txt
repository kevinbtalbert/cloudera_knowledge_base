Setting up a session
Cloudera Data Visualization Admin API supports two alternatives
    for setting up a session: standard login access and APIKey access.


Standard login access
To establish a session with username/password login, use the following
          code:username = "" #(user name as obtained from external source)
password = "" #(password as obtained from external source)
session = requests.session()
response = session.get(login_url)
session.headers['referer'] = response.url
payload = {'username':username,'password':password,'csrfmiddlewaretoken': session.cookies['arccsrftoken']}
session.post(login_url, data = payload)

noteThe login URL has the form
              [http|https]:/host:port/arc/apps/login.



APIKey access
To establish a session through the Cloudera API Key system and avoid the login process,
          use the following
          code:apikey = (apikey string)
session = requests.session()
session.headers['AUTHORIZATION'] = 'apikey %s' % apikey
 In this approach, the client code must obtain the DataViz access key through a
          client-controlled mechanism, then add the APIKey to the request header and avoid explicit
          login.


Fetch data from all datasets in the system
After setting up a session, you can fetch the entire data from all datasets in the
          system, by using the following
          code:response = session.get(api_url + 'datasets?detail=1')
datasets = response.json()

noteThe API URL has the form
                [http|htttps]://host:port/arc/adminapi/version.
            Use the URL option 'detail=true' to fetch all information in the GET
            call.
