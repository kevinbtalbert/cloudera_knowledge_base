Creating new API keys

Here is how you can create API keys in Cloudera Data Visualization:

Click the Gear icon on the main navigation bar to open the
                  Administration menu.

Select Manage API Keys.






In the Manage API Keys interface, click New API
                  Key.
New API Key window modal appears.

Make the following selections:

Select the Username from the menu.
Under Expiration Date, either select the date from the
                  calendar drop-down (by default, one year from current date), or check the
                     Never Expire option.
Under Status, select
                  Active.


Click Save

Review API Key window modal appears. There are two keys:
                  API Key, and Secret API Key. This is
               the only time that the second (secret) key appears. Copy both of them from the
               interface, and then click OK to dismiss the modal.
