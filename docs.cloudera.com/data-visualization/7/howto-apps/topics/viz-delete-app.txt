Deleting an application
It is very simple to delete an application in CDP Data Visualization.

Navigate to the app.

In the top navigation bar of App Designer, click the supplemental menu
                    indicated by the (ellipsis) icon, and then select
                        Delete App.




The Delete Confirmation modal window appears.


Type DELETE, and then click Delete.







Data Visualization refreshes to basic Visuals view, showing
                    All, Apps.
The deleted application is not on that list.
