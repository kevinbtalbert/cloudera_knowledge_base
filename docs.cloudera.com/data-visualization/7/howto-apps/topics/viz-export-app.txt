Exporting an application
In CDP Data Visualization, you can export dashboards, apps, and other visual artifacts.
    When you export a whole app, the process captures all the dependencies, such as visuals,
    dashboards, datasets, and custom styles.

Click VISUALS in the main navigation
          bar.

Select the app that contains the visuals or dashboards for export.

This updates the menus at the top, and shows the Suppmental
            menu.
In this example, the Sample App is used.





In the Suppmental menu across the top, click
            Export.

The Export Visual Artifacts modal window appears, with a default
            file name of the type visuals_random-number.




Optional: 
Change the name of the file.

To see what visual artifacts are exported, click Show
            Details.
The export file includes the definition of the app and any subgroups that it may have,
            the visuals and dashboards in the app, and all necessary datasets. When available, the
            export file also includes custom style dependencies.


Click EXPORT.

This starts the download of the export file to your default download folder. You can
            confirm the success of the export by finding the file on your system.
