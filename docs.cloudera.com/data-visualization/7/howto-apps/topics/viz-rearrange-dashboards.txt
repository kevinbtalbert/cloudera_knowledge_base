Rearranging dashboards
You can easily move dashboards in a CDP Data Visualization application, both within the
    same tab, or to a new tab.

Click to select the dashboard that you plan to move. We chose the Maps
          dashboard.

Drag the dashboard to a different tab, and drop it.





Optional: 
You can change the order of dashboards within a tab simply by dragging them within the
          tab container.





Optional: 
You can add the same dashboard to different tabs.



noteYou cannot add a dashboard to the same tab twice. You may move a dashboard
            from a tab into another tab that contains the dashboard; but the duplicate dashboard
            does not persist after saving the app.
