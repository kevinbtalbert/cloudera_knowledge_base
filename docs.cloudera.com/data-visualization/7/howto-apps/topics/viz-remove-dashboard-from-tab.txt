Removing a dashboard from a tab
In the App Designer of CDP Data Visualization, it is very easy
    to remove dashboards.

In the App Navigation interface, hover over a dashboard in a
          tab, and click the (remove) icon on the dashboard.




At this point, the App Navigation interface still has the tab
            you used, but the dashboard has been deleted.


To ensure that the change persists, click Save.
