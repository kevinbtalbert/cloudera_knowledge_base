Removing a tab from an application
In a CDP Data Visualization application, you can easily delete tabs and the dashboards
    they contain.

In the App Navigation interface, hover over the top of a tab,
          and click the (remove) icon.




The App Navigation interface no longer shows the deleted
            tab.


To ensure that the change persists, click Save.

noteRemember that you can use dashboards from any connection or dataset in the same app,
            provided that the creater/owner has the appropriate privileges.
