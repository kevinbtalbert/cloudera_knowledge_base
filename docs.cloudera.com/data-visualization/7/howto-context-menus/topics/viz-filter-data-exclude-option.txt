Filter data using the exclude option in the context menu
You can click on a mark of a visual and add an expression in the filter shelf of the
    visual designer to exclude selected values in a visual.

The Exclude option is enabled by default in all visual types except
          Table and Queries visual types. 
Follow these steps to exclude selected values in a visual.

For Table and Queries visual types, in Edit
          mode, navigate to the Marks menu and select the Show
            Context Menu.



Click any mark of the visual to open the tooltip and the context menu.In the context menu that appears, click Exclude.
The selected values appear in the filter shelf of the visual, excluding year
              not in (1900) and un_region not in ('Europe').



After applying the exclude filter, notice that the visual removes the information
          for year 1900 and region Europe.
