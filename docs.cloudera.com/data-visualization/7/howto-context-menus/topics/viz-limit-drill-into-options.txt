Limiting drill-into options
By default, all dimensions are visible when implementing drill-into data discovery, but
    you can limit the available fields to a smaller subset.

To limit the fields available for drill-into to a smaller subset, you must place these
        fields onto the Drill shelf. When specifying a limit for Choropleth
        Map fields, these fields must be Geo Type fields, or cast to Geo Type.


Open the dashboard in Edit mode and click the
            (pencil/edit) icon of the visual to edit it.





In the visual, add the desired fields to the Drill
          shelf.
In this example, the fields un_region and
              un_subregion have been added.




SAVE and CLOSE the visual.


If you use the drill-into option, the menu shows only the fields you specify. In this
        example these are: un_region and un_subregion.
