In this example, a bar visual World Population is used as the source
    (controlling) visual.
The visual has the following settings:


X Axis shelf: un_region. You can also choose
              to use a dimensional hierarchy that represents the [un_region |
                un_subregion | country] tuple.
YAxis shelf: population, as
                sum(population); alias it as Population.
Filters shelf: year, set to 2010
Under Settings, select the Parameters
              menu, and enable the Send parameters with dataset scope option.
              Do not select other options in this menu.
