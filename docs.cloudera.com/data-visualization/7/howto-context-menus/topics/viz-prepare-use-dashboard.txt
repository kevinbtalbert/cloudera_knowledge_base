Prepare and use the dashboard
In this example, a new dashboard is created that displays both the source and the
    target visuals and filters are also used.
Create a new dashboard, and add the three visuals to it.
In this example,  the source visual is resized so it occupies the left side of the
            dashboard, while the target visuals share the right side of the dashboard.

Switch to View mode.Click one of the bars of the source visual (in this example, Oceania), and select
          the Filter All option.Data Visualization refreshes the dashboard to show the target visuals that
            contain information about the selected un_region only. You can see the
            value of the filters on each visual when you hover the pointer over them, or the value
            of the dashboard parameters when you hover over the  (filter)
            icon.noteAny visual can be both a source and a target when passing filter
            parameters. To examine data outliers in one of the 'target' visuals, click on that element. In
          this example, we can check for more details in the Life Expectancy visual by
          investigating the drop reported for Turkey in 1915.Click that part of the line chart, and select Filter
          All.

Data Visualization refreshes the dashboard to show the effect on the other visuals. For
            example, the Life Expectancy and GDP shows that the GDP per Capita in Turkey for
            1915 was 1.52k.
