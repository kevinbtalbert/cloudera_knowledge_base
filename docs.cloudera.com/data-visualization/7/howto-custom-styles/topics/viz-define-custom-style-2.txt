CSS custom styles

To define styling for the entire site using CSS code, follow these
      steps:

Click the Gear icon on the main navigation bar to open the
            Administration menu.

Select Custom Styles.

In the Manage Custom Styles interface, under
            Name, enter DarkBlueTable.

To add CSS instructions, enter the following code:

.table{
          background-color:#336699;
          }





Click Save.

Notice that the Manage Custom Styles window contains the new
          style. 

For information on how to include the new style in visual, see Adding custom
              styles to visuals.
When selected for a visual that contains a table, the style DarkBlueTable gives
            the table the specified coloring scheme, much like the following image.



Note that the Manage Custom Styles interface keeps track of all
            visuals that use each defined style. In the following image, you can see the reporting
            after applying the style DarkBlueTable to visualization 15. Note also that the
            number 15 is an active link to that visualization.
