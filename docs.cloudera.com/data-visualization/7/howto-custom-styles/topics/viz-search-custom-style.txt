Searching site-wide custom styles
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to search site-wide custom styles by
      Name, Description, Author, and Modified By fields. You can also
    search by the content of CSS and Javascript code.

When you start typing characters in the search text box, the search results display the
        exact match on the top, followed by the closest matches. You must type at least two
        characters to start the search. 
To demonstrate how to search site-wide custom styles, follow these steps:


Click the Gear icon on the main navigation bar to open the
            Administration menu.

Select Custom Styles.

In the Manage Custom Styles interface, create new custom styles
          or use the existing styles.

You can find the search text box on the top right.


To demonstrate how to search the list of custom styles, enter Pie in the
            Search text box.

 In this example, the Pie Chart Legend Label custom style is
            filtered from the list.





To search the list of custom styles by javascript code, follow these steps:


 Click the Pencil icon next to the Pie Chart
                Legend Label to view the javascript code of this style.

In our example, we search by Not Applicable from the
                javascript code.






Enter Not Applicable in the Search text box.

In this example, the Pie Chart Legend Label custom style is
                filtered out of the list of custom styles.
