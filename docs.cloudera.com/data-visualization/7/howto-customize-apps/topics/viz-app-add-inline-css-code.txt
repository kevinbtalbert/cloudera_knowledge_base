Adding inline CSS code to apps


To add simple formatting to all the visuals and dashboards in the app, in the
          App Designer interface, navigate to the Custom
          Style menu of an app, and enter a CSS code snippet in the text box under the
          Inline CSS option.
You can select the Autocomplete option, too.
To apply this operation at the level of a specific visual or dashboard, see Adding
          inline CSS code to visuals and Adding inline CSS code to
        dashboards.
