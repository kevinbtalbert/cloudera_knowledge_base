Changing logo image


To change the logo that appears in the app, navigate to the Logo
        menu of the  Style menu. In the Logo Image URL
        text box, enter the address of an image previously loaded into Data Visualization as a
        static asset.
The entry must have the following form, or you can use an external imag URL address.
http://ip_address:port/arc/reports/staticasset/raw/asset-id.png
Where asset-id is a numerical value that represents the image, and
            ip_address:port is the full
        address of the Data Visualization Server that contains the image. The value depends on the
        order of loading static assets.
In this example, the Wikipedia logo has been added as the app logo using the following URL:
          https://www.wikipedia.org/portal/wikipedia.org/assets/img/Wikipedia-logo-v2@2x.png
