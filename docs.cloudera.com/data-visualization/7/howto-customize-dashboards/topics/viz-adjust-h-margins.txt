Adjusting horizontal margins

You can change the horizontal margins of a dashboard in CDP
      Data Visualization.
To change the horizontal margins of a dashboard,
      navigate to the General menu, and adjust the value in the selector for
      the Horizontal Margins option. The default value is 10.
For example, we increased the horizontal margins from 10 to 35 in the following
        dashboard. Notice that both visuals are shifted to the right, but the filter controls remain
        stationary.
