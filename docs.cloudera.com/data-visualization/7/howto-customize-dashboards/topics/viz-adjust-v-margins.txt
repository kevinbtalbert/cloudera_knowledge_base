Adjusting vertical margins

You can change the vertical margins of a dashboard in CDP Data
      Visualization.
To change the horizontal margins of a dashboard,
      navigate to the General menu, and adjust the value in the selector for
      the Vertical Margins option. The default value is 10.
For example, we increased the vertical margins from 10 to 35 in the following
        dashboard. Notice that the first visual is shifted downwards, and both visuals are
        vertically 'squashed'. The filter controls remain stationary.
