Aligning dashboard filters

You can change the alignment of the dashboard
      filter controls in CDP Data Visualization. To show filters on the left of the dashboard,
      navigate to the dashboard Style menu, select the
        Filters menu, and select the Align filters on the
        left option. By default, the filter controls of a visual appear across the top.
        noteCloudera recommends that you do not use this option with quick filters. For more
        information, see Using quick filters.
