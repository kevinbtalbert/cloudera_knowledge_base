Changing background color for dashboard filter

You can change the background color of the
      dashboard filters in CDP Data Visualization. To change the color of the background in the
      filters of the dashboard, navigate to the dashboard Style menu, select
      the Filters menu, and select a new color in the Background
        Color selector. You can choose from one of the standard system colors, specify a
      hexadecimal or RGB color, or select one in the continuous color palette (you can also adjust
      color opacity).
