Changing container color for dashboard filter

You can change the color of the container in
      dashboard filters in CDP Data Visualization. To change the color of the containers in all
      filters of the dashboard, navigate to the dashboard Style menu, select
      the Filters menu, and select a new color in the Container
        Color  selector. You can choose from one of the standard system colors, specify
      a hexadecimal or RGB color, or select one in the continuous color palette (you can also adjust
      color opacity).
