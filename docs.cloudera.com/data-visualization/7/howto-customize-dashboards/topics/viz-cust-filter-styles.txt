Dashboard filter styles


You can adjust several style options for dashboard filters in CDP Data Visualization.
To get to the options in the Filters menu, follow these steps:
noteThese styling choices affect the filter appearance when it is in the filter area of the
        dashboard. When you choose to place the filter inside the main dashboard area, it takes on
        the default style choices of the visuals in the dashboard.


On the right side of Dashboard Designer, click the
            Style menu.

In the Style menu, click Filters.

Select one of the options.
