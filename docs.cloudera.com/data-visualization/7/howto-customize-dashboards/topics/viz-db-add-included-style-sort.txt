Sorting custom styles in dashboards 
CDP Data Visualization enables you to sort custom styles in dashboards by ID, Name,
    Last Updated, and Modified By fields. You can sort in ascending or descending order.

noteYou cannot sort by the Description field.
To demonstrate how to sort custom styles in dashboards, follow these steps:


Navigate to the Custom Style menu, click the Add
            Style button.
The Pick Custom CSS interface appears.

Click the Name field.
When you hover over a field, notice that a (hand icon) appears
          only on the fields that you can sort.

To sort the field in descending order, click the Name field
          again.
