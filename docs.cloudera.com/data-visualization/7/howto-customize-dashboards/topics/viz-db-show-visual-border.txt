Showing borders around visuals
You can add borders to create a frame around visuals in a dashboard in Cloudera Data
    Visualization.
 To show borders for all visuals, navigate to
      the Style > Visual Borders menu, and select the
        Show borders around visuals option. By default, visuals in a
      dashboard do not show borders. For example, compare the two visuals: one with a
        hidden border, and the other with a border showing.
