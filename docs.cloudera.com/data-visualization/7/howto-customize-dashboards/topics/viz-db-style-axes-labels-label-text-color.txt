Visual label title text color in dashboards

You can change the text color of a trelllis used
      in visuals in CDP Data Visualization dashboards. To change the font size used of a trellis in
      all visuals that appear on this dashboard, navigate to the dashboard
        Style menu, select the Visual Axes and Labels
      sub-menu, and make adjustments in the Label Text Color  selector. You
      can choose from one of the standard system colors, specify a hexadecimal or RGB color, or
      select one in the continuous color palette (you can also adjust color opacity).
noteThis style option overrides the selection at the level of the individual visual. To
          style the visuals individually, de-select the Override visual style
            settings option, and specify the corresponding setting in each
          visual.
