Change visual border color in dashboards

You can change the visual border color in
      dashboards in CDP Data Visualization. To change the color of borders for all visuals that
      appear on this dashboard, navigate to the dashboard Style menu, select
      the Border Color sub-menu, and select a new color in the
        Border Color selector. You can choose from one of the standard system
      colors, specify a hexadecimal or RGB color, or select one in the continuous color palette (you
      can also adjust color opacity).noteThis option is not available if the Show Borders is not
        on. When you turn on the Show Borders option, the color is not specified in the selector.
        However, the default that shows on the dashboard is light grey, or
      #E6E6E6.
