Visual subtitle alignment in dashboards

You can change the alignment of the visual
      subtitle in CDP Data Visualization dashboards. To change the alignment of the text in
      subtitles of all visuals of the dashboard, navigate to the dashboard
        Style menu, select the Visual Subtitle menu,
      and then select the desired Alignment option. By default, the title is
      left-aligned.
