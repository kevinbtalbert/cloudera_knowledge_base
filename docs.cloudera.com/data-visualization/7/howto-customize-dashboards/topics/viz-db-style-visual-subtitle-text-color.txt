Visual subtitle text color in dashboards

You can change the text color of the visual
      subtitle in CDP Data Visualization dashboards. To change the color of the text in subtitles of
      all visuals of the dashboard, navigate to the dashboard Style menu,
      select the Visual Subtitle menu, and then select a new color in the
        Text Color selector. You can choose from one of the standard system
      colors, specify a hexadecimal or RGB color, or select one in the continuous color palette (you
      can also adjust color opacity).
