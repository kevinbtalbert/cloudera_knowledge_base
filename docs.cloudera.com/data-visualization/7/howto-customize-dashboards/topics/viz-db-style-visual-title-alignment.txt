Visual title alignment in dashboards

You can change the alignment of the visual title
      in CDP Data Visualization dashboards. To change the alignment of the text in titles of all
      visuals of the dashboard, navigate to the dashboard Style menu, select
      the Visual Title menu, and then select the desired
        Alignment option. By default, the title is
      left-aligned.
