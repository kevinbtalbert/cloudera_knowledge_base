Visual title background color in dashboards

You can change the background color of the
      visual title in CDP Data Visualization dashboards. To change the color of the background in
      the title of all visuals of the dashboard, navigate to the dashboard
        Style menu, select the Visual Title menu, and
      then select a new color in the Background Color selector. You can
      choose from one of the standard system colors, specify a hexadecimal or RGB color, or select
      one in the continuous color palette (you can also adjust color opacity).
