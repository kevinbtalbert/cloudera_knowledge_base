Visual title text color in dashboards

You can change the text color of the visual
      title in CDP Data Visualization dashboards. To change the color of the text in titles of all
      visuals of the dashboard, navigate to the dashboard Style menu, select
      the Visual Title menu, and then select a new color in the
        Text Color selector. You can choose from one of the standard system
      colors, specify a hexadecimal or RGB color, or select one in the continuous color palette (you
      can also adjust color opacity).
