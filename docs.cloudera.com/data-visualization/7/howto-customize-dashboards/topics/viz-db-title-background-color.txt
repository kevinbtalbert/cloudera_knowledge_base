Dashboard titles background color
You can change the background color of the dashboard title in CDP Data
    Visualization.
To change the color of the background in the
      dashboard title, navigate to the dashboard Style menu, select the
        Dashboard Title menu, and then select a new color in the
        Background Color selector. You can choose from one of the standard
      system colors, specify a hexadecimal or RGB color, or select one in the continuous color
      palette (you can also adjust color opacity). The default is no color.
