Dashboard titles text color
You can change the text color of the dashboard title in CDP Data
    Visualization.
To change the color of the text in the dashboard
      title, navigate to the dashboard Style menu, select the
        Dashboard Title menu, and then select a new color in the
        Text Color selector. You can choose from one of the standard system
      colors, specify a hexadecimal or RGB color, or select one in the continuous color palette (you
      can also adjust color opacity). The default is no color.
