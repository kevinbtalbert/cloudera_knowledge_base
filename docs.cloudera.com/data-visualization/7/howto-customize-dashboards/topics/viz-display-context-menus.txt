Displaying context menus in visuals 


In a dashboard, you can see the context menu within each visual in both Edit and
          View mode.
In Edit mode, you can see context menus by default.


To enable the context menu in View mode, navigate to the
            General menu.

Select the Display context menus within visuals option.

Click the selected part of the graph in View mode, to see
          the context menu.
Notice the three data discovery options in the context menu, Show Detailed
          Data, Filter All, and Drill Into.



Switch to Edit mode, and click the selected part of the
          graph to show the context menus.
In Edit mode, you can see more data discovery options in
          the context menu as compared to View mode. In the
            following image, notice that when you enable context menus at the dashboard level
            through the Display context menus within visuals setting option, the No Action
              on Click context menu appears as Show Context Menu on Click.
