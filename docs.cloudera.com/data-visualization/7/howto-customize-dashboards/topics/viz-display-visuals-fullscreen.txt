Displaying a visual in full screen 

You can display a visual in full screen in CDP Data
      Visualization.
To extend a visual in a dashboard to the full
      width of the page, navigate to the General menu, and select the
        Make full screen for single visual option. This option is available
      if there is only one visual in the dashboard. 
For example, compare the two visuals: one in its original size, and the other in
        full-screen mode.
