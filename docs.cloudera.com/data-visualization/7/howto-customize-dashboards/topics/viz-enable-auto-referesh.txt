Adjusting automatic refresh

Data Visualization can automatically refresh the dashboards at
      a rate set by the user. This is typically necessary when the dashboard includes visuals with
      dynamic information, such as stock tickers.
To enable automatic refresh, navigate to the
        General menu, and adjust the value in the selector for the
        Auto-refresh seconds option. By default, the selector is empty and
      the auto-refresh option is not on.

This example demonstrates how to create a simple dashboard with a refresh rate through
        using a URL link visual to access live information about the 2017 French Presidential
        election.

Start a new dashboard, based on any dataset.
Within the Visual Designer, click New
            Visual.
Hover over the Visual Controls of the new visual, in the top
          right corner, and click the (pencil) icon to edit the new
          visual.
Select the External Link from the Visual Type
            Catalog.
In the URL field, enter https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_presidential_election,_2017.
Name and Save the new visual.In this example, the name is used
              French Election 2017.
In the dashboard Settings, set the Auto-refresh
            seconds option to 300, which is equivalent to an update every 5 minutes.


Name the new dashboard.In this example, the name is used News.
Click Save.
Click View to switch to View mode.Note
            the periodic updates to the dashboard.
