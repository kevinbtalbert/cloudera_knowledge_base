Enabling or disabling case sensitive dashboard filters


By default, Data Visualization processes all parameter data in case-sensitive manner. It
        also has an option for disabling case-sensitive comparison on dashboard settings.
This example demonstrates how to create a simple dashboard with a refresh rate through
        using a URL link visual to access live information about the 2017 French Presidential
        election.


To enable dashboards to use case-sensitive names in output parameters, navigate to the
            General menu, and select the Parameter names are case
            sensitive option.






To disable case-sensitive comparison, de-select this option.
