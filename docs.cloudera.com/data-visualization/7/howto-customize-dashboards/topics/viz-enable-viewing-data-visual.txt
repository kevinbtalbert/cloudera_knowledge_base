Enabling viewing data in dashboard visuals

You can view the detailed data in each visual of a dashboard
      CDP Data Visualization.
To see the detailed data of each visual in the
      dashboard, navigate to the Settings > General menu, and select the option Enable viewing data within each
        visual. By default, this feature is turned off.



In dashboard Edit mode, note the difference between the
        available widgets on a focus visual when the option is disabled, and when it is enabled.
        Clicking the (table) icon opens the Detailed
          Data window modal, which enables you to examine and download this data.

The (table) icon also appears in view-enabled dashboards in
          View mode.
