Enabling manual refresh of visuals in a dashboard


If you have a slow back-end data connection and your dashboard is loading slowly, you can
        choose to load the filters first, specify their settings, and then manually load the
        visuals. This topic describes how to enable manual refresh.
To enable manual refresh of visuals in a dashboard, follow these steps:


Open the dashboard in Edit mode.

In the Dashboard Designer, select the
            Settings menu.

Click the General menu to expand it.

Select the Refresh visuals manually option.

This adds a REFRESH VISUALS button to the
      dashboard.
