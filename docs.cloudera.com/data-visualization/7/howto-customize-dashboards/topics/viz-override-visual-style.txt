Overriding visual style settings 

To achieve consistent styling of all visuals in a dashboard,
      you can override all individual visual styling choices using a single dashboard setting in CDP
      Data Visualization.
To override the settings of the visuals by the
      dashboard settings, navigate to the General menu, and select the
        Override visual style settings option.
To change the styles at dashboard level, see Dashboard Style
        Customization.
