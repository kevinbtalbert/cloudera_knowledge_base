Rendering visuals after filters in dashboards 

You can render the visuals of a dashboard after all filters
      load in CDP Data Visualization.
To load the dashboard visuals after the
      filtering completes, navigate to the Settings > General menu, and select the option Render visuals after loading dashboard
        filters.. By default, this feature is turned off.
