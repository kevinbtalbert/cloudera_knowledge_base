Changing text color for dashboard filter

You can change the text color of the filter in
      dashboards in CDP Data Visualization. To change the color of the text in all filters of the
      dashboard, navigate to the dashboard Style menu, select the
        Filters menu, and select a new color in the Text
        Color selector. You can choose from one of the standard system colors, specify a
      hexadecimal or RGB color, or select one in the continuous color palette (you can also adjust
      color opacity).
