Changing column position
In a table visual, you can change the position of a column for better visualization of
    data in CDP Data Visualization.

By default, measure columns appear after all the dimension columns. In a table with large
        number of dimensions, it may be difficult to analyse the data if measure columns appear
        towards the end of the table.
Let's take an example of the cereal data and demonstrate how changing the position of the
        column improves the analyis of data.
To change the position of a column in a table, follow these steps:
Click the measure that you plan to move to open the Field
            Properties menu.
In this example, we are moving calories.
Under Field Properties, click to expland the
            Column Position menu.

From the list of dimensions in the dropdown menu, select
            cold_or_hot.A green dot appears beside the field indicating a change in the value.Click Refresh Visual to see the changes.
Notice in the first image, calories column appears after all the
            dimension columns. However, if you want to compare the calories in each cereal, by
            moving the calories column before the
              cold_or_hot. column (second image), it becomes easier to view
            that data.
