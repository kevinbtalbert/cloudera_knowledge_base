Customizing calculated display
 Cloudera Data Visualization allows you to display calculated functions in several
    ways: as is, cumulative (ascending or descending), and as difference (ascending and
    descending).
To add the calculated display option for fields on measurement
      shelves, follow these steps:
Click the field you plan to modify to open the FIELD PROPERTIES
          menu.

Click Calculated Display to expand its menu.






From the Calculated Display menu, select one of the following
          options:


Cumulative Sum (Ascending)
Cumulative Sum (Descending)
Cumulative Diff (Ascending)
Cumulative Diff (Descending)
Difference (Ascending)
Difference (Descending)

A check mark precedes the selected calculated display option.


Click REFRESH VISUAL to see the changes.
