Customizing enter/edit expressions
 CDP Data Visualization provides you with an option to manually adjust expressions that
    modify the field values of the visual, the Enter /Edit Expression
    interface.

note

Ensure that column names in the expressions are bracketed, like this:
                [field].
When manually editing expressions, you can apply changes that are equivalent to all
              Field Properties  transformations except Order and Top K  and Display
              Format. Entering these changes causes an error.


To set the customize expressions, follow these steps.
Click the field you plan to modify, to open the Field
            Properties menu.Under Field Properties, click to expand the [ ]
            Enter/Edit Expression menu to open the Expression
            Editor.



In the Enter/Edit Expression editor, change the
          expression.
See Simple Alias expression  and CASE expression examples for
            demonstration of some of the varied expressions you can build using the expression
            editor.


Expression Text: Enter/modify the expression directly in the
                text field.


Autocomplete: Click this field to turn expression
                autocomplete on or off.


Functions: By default, all available functions show. Scroll
                down to find a specific function, and click it to add it to the Expression Text
                field. Note the location of the cursor.
Alternatively, click the All Functions menu to see the function groupings and
                select the functions from these. Available expression groupings include
                  Aggregate, Conditional,
                  Mathematical, Miscellaneous,
                  String, Filter, and Date
                  and Time.
Note that different connections have their own SQL syntax, and therefore a
                different catalog of functions.


All Fields: By default, all available fields show. Scroll
                down to find a specific field, and click it to add it to the Expression Text field.
                Note the location of the cursor.
Alternatively, click the All Fields menu to see the
                  Measures and Dimensions groupings,
                and select the fields from these.


Validate Expression: Validate the expression that you
          build.



Click Save.Click Refresh Visual.
Simple Alias expression
You can add an alias to the expression simply by typing it in the text field: 
sum([population]) as 'Population'
Remember to Validate Expression and click
          Save.



After clicking Refresh Visual, you will see a change similar to the
        one in the following image:


CASE expression
You can add a CASE expression to categorize the values, by selecting
          CASE in the functions area, and using autocomplete. The expression
        in this example follows; if you paste it into the editor, remove hard line returns: 
CASE WHEN sum([population])<1000000 THEN 'very low' 
  WHEN (sum([population])<10000000 and sum([population])>=1000000) THEN 'low' 
  WHEN (sum([population])<20000000 and sum([population])>=30000000) THEN 'medium' 
  WHEN (sum([population])<40000000 and sum([population])>=30000000) THEN 'high' 
  ELSE 'very high' 
END 
as 'Population'
Remember to validate the expression and click Save.
