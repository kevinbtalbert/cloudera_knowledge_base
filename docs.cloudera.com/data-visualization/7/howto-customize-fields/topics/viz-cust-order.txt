Customizing order and top K
Sorting is one of the most common tools for data management. In CDP Data Visualization,
    you can sort your data in ascending or descending order by implementing the 'ORDER BY' clause on
    the query. You can also choose to limit the number of records displayed to examine the most
    significant entries. This can be implemented through the  'LIMIT' clause.
Click the field you want to modify to open the Field Properties
          menu.

Click Order and Top K to expand the menu.






Review the following options and configure the sorting and limiting according to your
          needs:



Sorting
Descending
This option sorts [field] in descending order.
Ascending
This option sorts [field] in ascending order.

You can turn on sorting if  you click Ascending or
                  Descending. A checkmark precedes the selected option. If
                you want to clear the sort, click the selected option again.


Limiting
Top K
You can specify  the number of records that you want to display, starting
                      from the top of the specified sort.noteThis setting
                        overrides the Limit shelf setting. So, if the value
                        of Limit is 100 and Top
                          K is set to 50, the query returns 50
                        rows.
Bottom K
You can specify the number of values that you want to display, starting from
                      the bottom of the specified sort.noteThis setting
                        overrides the Limit shelf setting. If the value of
                          Limit is 100 and Bottom
                          K is set to 50, the query returns 50
                        rows.



Additionally, you can also apply Top K/Bottom K to granular dimensions.
