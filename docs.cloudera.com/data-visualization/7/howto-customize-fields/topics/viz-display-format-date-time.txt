Date/time display format


Data Visualization enables you to specify date/time display formats for a numerical field
        by selecting from a number of common formats, or by specifying a custom format.
You have common notation options for formatting Date/Time fields. Data Visualization also
        offers a simple customization component that transforms date/time information.
By default, data/time records appear in the form [YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]
          [hh]:[mm]:[ss].[sss], in most-to-least significant order. This is consistent with
        the ISO 8601 Date and Time Specification.
The following steps demonstrate how to adjust the display format for date/time fields:
Click the field you plan to modify, to open the Field
            Properties menu.Under Field Properties, click Display
            Format.In the Display Format interface, select Date/Time
          from the Category menu.Make a selection from one of the Basic Formats. These
          include most common forms, such as 2010-01-05, 01/05/2010, 1/5/10,
            Jan 05, 2010, Friday, January 5th, 2010, 10-Jan-05, Q1 2010,
            1:05 pm, 01:05:53 PM, 13:05:53.010, 1/5/10 1:05:53 PM, and
            01/05/2010 13:05:53.
Alternatively, specify select the Custom Date Format option in the Basic
              Formats menu, and then use the Customize Date/Time text
            filed to enter the custom format.

Click Save.Click Refresh Visual.
The following examples demonstrate the use of date/time display formatting interface
            for Basic Formats for Date/Time  and Custom Formats for
              Date/Time. We are using the NYC Taxicab Rides Detail dataset, based on
            the table main.trips-detail.
