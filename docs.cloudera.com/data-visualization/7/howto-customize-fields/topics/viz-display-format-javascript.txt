Customizing display format using Javascript


In Data Visualization, you can customize the display format of fields in visuals using
        Javascript. The Javascript editor includes auto-complete functionality, and checks for valid
        code.
This feature is available with the following conditions:


Site-wide setting for customization are turned on; see Enabling Custom
              Styling.
The user is either an Admin, or has Manage custom styles
            permissions.


In addition to other categories, Data Visualization has a Custom
          Javascript option that enables a wide range of custom display
        configurations.
The following steps outline how to use the Display Format:
Custom Javascript interface.
Click the field you plan to modify, to open the Field
            Properties menu.Under Field Properties, click Display
            Format.In the Display Format interface, select Custom
            Javascript from the Category menu.In the Customize JS Format Function code entry box, enter
          valid JavaScript code.


Click Save.
Specifying text color based on a scalar threshold
In the following example, we adapted the custom JS format to more clearly identify which US
        States have a Hispanic population over or under the national average of 16%.
function myFunc(value) {
    // change display color based on value 
    // being under or over national average of 16%
    // expressed as percentage, with two decimal places
    if (value < .16) {
        // less than 16% is blue
        return `<div style="color: blue">${Number(value * 100).toFixed(2)}%</div>`;
        } 
    else {
        // 16% or greater is green
        return `<div style="color: green">${Number(value * 100).toFixed(2)}%</div>`;
        }
  }
Compare the results in the % Hispanic column (uses percentage display and the
          Rel. to 16 National Average column, that uses custom Javascript code in this
        example.
