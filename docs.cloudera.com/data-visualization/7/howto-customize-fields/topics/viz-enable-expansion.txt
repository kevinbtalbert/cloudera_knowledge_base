Enabling expansion
In cross tabulation visuals, you can enable expansion to display subtotal and combined
    total of the dimensions entered in the Row shelf.
To enable expansion, follow these steps:Click the field you plan to modify to open the Field
            Properties menu.Under Field Properties, click Enable
            Expansion.
A green dot appears to the right of the option.
noteThe Enable Expansion option only appears on the
              Row shelf of cross tabulation visuals, to make the field usable
            in that context.



Click Refresh Visual to see the changes.
To disable expansion from a field, click the Enable Expansion
            option again; that removes the green dot. 
To demonstrate how expansion works, see Displaying totals with data
              expansion.
