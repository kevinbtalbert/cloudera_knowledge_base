Using alias
Cloudera Data Visualization provides you with an option to alias fields to remove
    uninformative field names (or overly informative expressions) from the visual.
To set the alias, follow these steps:

Click the field you plan to modify to open the FIELD PROPERTIES
          menu.

Under FIELD PROPERTIES, click
          Alias.






Enter the alias in the text field.

noteTo improve behavior of dataset fields as filters, parenthesis are not allowed in the
            display name. You can add parenthetical information as a field comment.


Click REFRESH VISUAL to see the changes.

Fields that use an alias have a green dot on the Alias menu.
To remove an alias from a field, repeat the previous steps and clear the text field
            under Alias.
