Setting a default homepage for all users
In Cloudera Data Visualization, administrators can change the usersâ€™ default landing
    page globally.

noteThis feature is only available to users with administrative
        privileges.
The following steps show you how to set the default start page to a specific dashboard for
        all users.


Log in as an admin user.

On the main navigation bar, click the Gear icon to open the
            Settings menu.

Click Set Homepage in the drop-down menu.
The Set Homepage interface appears.

Scroll down to the Admin Only section and select the dashboard
          that you want to use as the new default homepage.

Click SAVE.
A message confirming the success of setting the dashboard as your homepage appears
          briefly.
Optional: 
If you mark Disable user-override of homepage, you can prevent
          users from overriding the default homepage that you have set.

Log out from CDV and log in as a user with simple viewing privileges.

If this user does not have a custom homepage set, clicking HOME
          at the top navigation bar takes you to the new default homepage you have just
          specified.
