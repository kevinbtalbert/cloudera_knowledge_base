Adding custom mapbox style
CDP Data Visualization enables you to add a custom mapbox style in an interactive map
    visual.

To create a choropleth map in an Interactive Map visual, you need a Custom Mapbox style and
        a Layer ID.
When you request for a custom style from Mapbox, make sure that this style has a choropleth
        shape file in it. This shape file has the choropleth Layer ID, which is the name of a unique
        layer within the Custom Mapbox style that identifies the shapes that
        you would like to color by a measure in your data. See Specifying a Choropleth Layer
          ID.


On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click Map
          Style.

To add a custom mapbox style that you got from Mapbox, enter the custom mapbox
          style in the Custom Mapbox style option text box.
