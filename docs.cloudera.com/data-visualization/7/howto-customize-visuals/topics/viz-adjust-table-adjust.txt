Adjusting table width
You can set a Table, a Cross Tabulation or a Queries visual to full width to ensure
    that they fill the entire width of the page.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Style in the VISUAL section of the menu
          bar.






In the Style menu, click Table
          Style.






Select the Full table width option.






In the following example, compare the two visuals and note the
      change in the appearance of the table. The table on the right is set to full width.
      


importantThe Full table width option always uses the current viewport as a reference.
      This means that the result will be different depending on the size of the screen and the visual.
