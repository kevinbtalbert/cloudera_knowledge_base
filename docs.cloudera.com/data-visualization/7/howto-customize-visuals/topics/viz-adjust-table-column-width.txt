Adjusting table column width
In CDP Data Visualization, you can manually adjust, either increase or decrease, the
    width of columns in a table.

In the table header, hover your cursor on the right side of the column border until the
            [cross-hairs] icon appears.

Click column border, drag it the to the desired width, and then release the
          cursor.


In this example the width of a column in a table is increased.



When the column width is smaller than the length of the text in the cell, the text is
        abbreviated, and a series of three dots (ellipsis – …) appear at the end of the line.
        The first column heading text of the left visual is displayed as
        'pickup_neighborh...'. In such cases, you can hover over the table cell to see the
        full text.
