Assigning color to specified values 


Mapping colors to a specific dimension's values enables you to choose and modify a
        meaningful representation of values, such as 'green | red | amber' for 'success | failure |
        soft-fail'.
This feature applies to all visual types that use the Colors
        shelf.

To adjust the colors,  select the option Fix colors for specified
            values.


In the colors that appear for each value, make changes.
You can ensure that these colors are used consistently across all visuals within a
            dashboard by combing this feature with Base colors on dimension values, For
            details, see Consistent colors on dimension values.
If the color you want to use is not in any of the palettes available to you, you can
            define it through the Custom Colors interface.


For example, in a grouped bar visual that shows values for Female and Male segments, we can
        adjust colors in the following manner:

Below the selected option Fix colors for specified values, click on the color you want
          to change. Let's change the color for Females.
In the expanded palette, select the new color. Here, we are changing the color for
          Females from dark turquoise to mauve.

Similarly, change the color for Males from light turquoise to dark turquoise. 

This is how the color indicators appear after your make the changes: 

After refreshing the visual, notice the change to its appearance:
