Changing the scale of a continuous axis on dimensions

You can change the minimum and maximum scale of a continuous axis enabled on a dimension.
A continuous axis scale has an infinite number of possible values, in equal intervals.
      Compare it with a categorical axis scale, which has a finite number of evenly spaced values,
      limited to the values in the dataset. 
To enable continuous dimension axis, see Enabling a continuous axis on
        dimensions.
note

Available only for numerical dimensions on Bars, Grouped bars,
          Line, Area, and Combo visuals.


To change the minimum and maximum scale of a continuous axis on dimensions, navigate to the
        Axes menu, and make adjustments to the two selectors: Min
        Dim Scale and Max Dim Scale options.
The image on the left shows the minimum and maximum scale of the X axis from 50 to 160. You
      can see that that in the right image, the scale changes when you change the values from 0 to
      200. Increasing the scale also gives a clearer visual representation of where the calorie
      levels fall within a range of values.
