Reversing the axis scale

By default, all visuals display horizontal and vertical axes with origin in the bottom left
      of the visual. However, it is possible to reverse both the X and Y Axis, separately and
      together.
To reverse an axis, navigate to the Axes menu, and select the
      appropriate options: Reverse x scale, Reverse y
        scale, or both.
The following image demonstrates the possible scale direction options for a scatter plot:
      original, reversed x axis, reversed y axis, and both x and y axes reversed.
