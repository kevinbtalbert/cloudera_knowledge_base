Starting aggregate scale at zero

By default, the aggregate scale starts at zero. However, you can change this by de-selecting this option.
To disable the zero start for aggregate scale, navigate to the
      Axes menu, and de-select the option Positive aggregate scales start at zero.



Notice that the aggregates with smaller values barely show over the X Axis and are very
      difficult to read: Alaska, Delaware, and especially District of Columbia.
