Changing scale of a continuous X axis

You can change the minimum and maximum scale of a continuous X-axis in a Scatter
      visual.
A continuous axis scale has an infinite number of possible values, in equal intervals.
      Compare it with a categorical axis scale, which has a finite number of evenly spaced values,
      limited to the values in the dataset. 
To enable continuous X-axis, see Enabling a continuous X axis.
To change the minimum and maximum scale of a continuous X-axis, navigate to the
        Axes menu, and make adjustments to the two selectors for the
        Min X Scale and Max X Scaleoptions.
The image on the left shows the minimum and maximum scale of the X axis from
        50 to 350. Notice that in the right image the scale
      changes when we changed the values from 0 to 1000.
      Increasing the scale also gives a clearer visual representation of where the sodium levels
      fall within a range of values.
