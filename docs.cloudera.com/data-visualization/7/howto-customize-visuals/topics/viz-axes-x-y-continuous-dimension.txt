Enabling a continuous axis on dimensions

You can customize your visuals according to their data type. To look at trends and the rate
      of change, use a continuous axis on numerical dimension, which shows data at equal intervals.
      Compare visuals that use a continues dimensional axis to results with a categorical axis,
      which only plots dataset values.

note

Available only for numerical dimensions on Bars, Grouped bars,
              Line, Area, and Combo visuals.



To use regular intervals, navigate to the Axes menu, and select the
        Make Dimension Axis Continuous option.
The image on the left shows a categorical X axis where each label represents a value in the
      dataset, from 50 to 160. The image on the right shows a
      continuous X axis where labels are auto-generated, in equal intervals starting from
        0 to 160. Notice how enabling this feature gives a clearer
      visual representation of where the calorie levels fall within a range of values.
