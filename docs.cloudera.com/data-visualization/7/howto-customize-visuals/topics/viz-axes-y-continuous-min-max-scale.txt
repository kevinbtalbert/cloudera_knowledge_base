Changing scale of a continuous Y axis

You can change the minimum and maximum scale of a continuous Y axis in a Scatter
      visual.
A continuous axis scale has an infinite number of possible values in equal intervals. Compare
      it with a categorical axis scale, which has a finite number of evenly spaced values, limited
      to the values in the dataset. 
To enable continuous Y axis, see Enabling a continuous Y axis. 
To change the minimum and maximum scale of a continuous Y axis of a Scatter visual,
      navigate to the Axes menu, and make adjustments to the two selectors,
        Min Y Scale and Max Y Scale.
The image on the left shows the minimum and maximum scale of the Y axis from
        0 to 24. Notice in the right image, how the scale changes
      when we changed the values from 10 to 30. Increasing the
      scale gives a clearer visual representation of where the carbohydrate levels fall within a
      range of values.
