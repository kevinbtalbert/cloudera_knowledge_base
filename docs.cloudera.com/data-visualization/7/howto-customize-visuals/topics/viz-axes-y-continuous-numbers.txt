Enabling a continuous Y axis

You can customize a Scatter visual according to your data type. To look at trends and
      the rate of change, use the continuous axis that shows data at equal intervals. Compare the
      continuous axis to a categorical axis, which only plots values in the dataset.

note

Available only on Scatter visuals. 
Available only on numeric and non-aggregate fields. 



To use regular intervals on the Y axis, navigate to the Axes menu, and
      select the Make Y axis continuous option. This option is on by
      default.
The image on the left shows a categorical Y axis with each label representing a data point,
      starting from 10 to 23. Image on the right shows a
      continuous Y axis where labels are auto-generated in equal intervals, from 0
      to 24. Notice how enabling this feature gives a clearer visual representation of where the
      carbohydrate levels fall within a range of values.
