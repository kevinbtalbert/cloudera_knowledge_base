Changing the bucket countCloudera DocsChanging the bucket count

The default number of histogram buckets is 10, but you can easily change the
      number of buckets.
To change the number of histogram buckets, click Settings in the
        VISUAL menu, open the Basic section, and
      adjust the selector for the Bucket count option. The default value is
        10.



The following image contrasts the appearance of a histogram with 10 buckets and a histogram
      with 20 buckets. Notice that as the number of buckets doubles, the range of values covered by
      each bucket is reduced by half.
