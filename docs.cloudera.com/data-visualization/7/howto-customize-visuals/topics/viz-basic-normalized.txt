Showing normalized histogramsCloudera DocsShowing normalized histograms

To report the histogram as a percentage of a whole, the histogram count is normalized to add up to 1, and then the bars represent the proportionate frequency.
To normalize a histogram, click Settings in the
        VISUAL menu, open the Basic section, and
      select the Normalized histogram option.



The following image shows the two versions of the histogram. You can see that the change
      appears in the vertical axis and the tooltip, where frequency is reported as a number of
      incidents on the upper graph, and as a percentage on the lower graph.
