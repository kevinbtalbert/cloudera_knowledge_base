Changing the min/max of the aggregate scale
You can configure independent aggregate scales for visuals with primary and secondary
    axes.
The line, combined bar/line, and grouped bar visuals support primary and secondary axes with
      independent minimum and maximum aggregate scales.
By default, the aggregate scale starts at zero, and rises to a number just higher than the
      maximum aggregate value. This can be adjusted, which is useful in dashboards that contain
      side-by-side visuals for different segments, time periods, and so on.
To change the minimum and maximum aggregate scale values, navigate to the
        Axes menu, and make adjustments to the four selectors:

Min Agg Scale - for the Primary Axis
Max Agg Scale - for the Primary Axis
Sec. Min Agg Scale - for the Secondary Axis
Sec. Max Agg Scale - for the Secondary Axis

For example, raising the Minimum aggregate scale value to 250,000 has
      the effect of shrinking the values for the smaller aggregates.



Meanwhile, raising the Maximum aggregate scale value to 26 Million
      adds blank space over the top aggregate, and scales the whole graph down.



Note that the minimum cannot be larger than the smallest aggregate, and the maximum cannot be
      smaller than the largest aggregate.
