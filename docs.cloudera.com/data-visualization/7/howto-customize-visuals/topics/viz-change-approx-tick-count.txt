Changing approximate tick count


At times, the ticks are too dense for your visualization needs, or too sparse.
To change the number of ticks from a default value, navigate to the
          Marks menu, and move the slider in the Approximate tick
          count option.



In the following example, compare the default value of ticks on a bullet visual with the
        appearance of the same visual when the option is set to 5, and then to 15.
