Changing arc gapCloudera DocsChanging arc gap


This task applies to Gauge charts.
By default, the gap between the measurement (inner) and qualitative (outer) arcs is 5
        pixels. To change it, navigate to the Marks menu, and select a new
        value for the Arc Gap option.



Note how adjusting this setting changes the appearance of the visual. The outer
        (qualitative) arc is fixed, while the inner (measurement) arc radius changes to accommodate
        the arc gap setting. When this setting is at 0, a gap does not appear.
