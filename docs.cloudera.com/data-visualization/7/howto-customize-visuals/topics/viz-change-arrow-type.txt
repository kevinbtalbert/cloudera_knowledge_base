Changing arrow type


This setting is specific to KPI visuals.
To change the location arrow type on the KPI display, navigate to the
          Marks menu, and select one of the options in Arrow
          type. Note that the last option is None, which means not to display the
        arrow.



This image illustrates some of the different arrow type options.
