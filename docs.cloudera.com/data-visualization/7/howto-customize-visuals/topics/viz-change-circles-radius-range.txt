Changing circle radius range
 In an interactive map visual, CDP Data Visualization enables you to change the size of
    circles.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
          Circles.



To change the range of sizes for Circles, adjust the minimum and
          maximum values in the Radius Range option. 

The default minimum is 1, and the default maximum is 100. Valid values
            are between these two numbers.

            setting of circles from 24, to the new maximum setting of 5.
