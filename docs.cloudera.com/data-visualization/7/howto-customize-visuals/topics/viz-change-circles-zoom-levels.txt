Changing visible zoom levels in circles
Sometimes, it is not possible to display data legibly at a given zoom level. CDP Data
    Visualization enables you to adjust the visible zoom levels in circles. 

In an interactive map visual on MapBox, it is recommended to adjust the zoom level within
        the minimum and maximum zoom levels. Valid values are 0 through
          22. For example, if the zoom level is set to more than the maximum
        level, heatmap will not be visible. 


On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
          Circles.



To adjust the zoom level of a heatmap, navigate to the Heatmap
          menu under Settings, and adjust the minimum and maximum values in
          the Visible Zoom Levels option.

In the following example, you can see that when the zoom level is set to a value less
            than the maximum level 4.95, circles are visible. However, if the
            zoom level is set to more than the maximum level 5.02, circles
            are not visible.
