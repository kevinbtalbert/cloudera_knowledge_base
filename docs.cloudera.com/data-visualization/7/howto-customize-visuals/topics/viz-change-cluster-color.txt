Changing cluster color
In an interactive map visual, CDP Data Visualization enables you to change the color of
    a cluster.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
          Cluster.


To change the color of Cluster, change the value of the
            Cluster Color option, either by changing the hexadecimal value, or by selecting
          the new color from the color palette.



Note the cluster color change from the default of #ff9900 to custom
              #42a9b9 on the Google map rendering. We turned off the Heatmap
            option.



Similarly, note the color change for cluster layer on the Mapbox map.
