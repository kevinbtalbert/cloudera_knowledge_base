Changing cluster radius
In an interactive map visual, CDP Data Visualization enables you to change the radius
    of a cluster.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
          Cluster.


To change the clustering granularity for the map, you must adjust the cluster
            Radius option. The default value is 80, and the minimum value is
          30.



The default cluster radius value is 80. Compare the results of setting cluster
            radius on Google Map to 30, 60, 90, and 120.



Similarly, note the change for the same cluster radius options on the Mapbox map.
