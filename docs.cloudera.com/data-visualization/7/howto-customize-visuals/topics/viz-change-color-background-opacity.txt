Changing background opacity

This applies to Gauge visuals.
To choose a different opacity (color saturation) for the background of the
          measurement arc in gauge visuals and make changes to the Background
            Opacity selector. The default value is 20.



For example, examine the differences here in the appearance of the background for the
            gauge visual. Note also that because the projection color is semi-transparent, a
            'stronger' background also changes the appearance of the projection color.
