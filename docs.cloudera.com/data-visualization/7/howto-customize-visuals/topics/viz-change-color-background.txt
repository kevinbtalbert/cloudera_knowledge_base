Changing background color

This applies to Gauge and Bullet
      visuals.
To choose a different color for the background of gauge or bullet visuals and make
          changes in the Background Color selector. You can select one of the
          palette colors, or specify a custom color.



Note how the change in background color changes the gauge visual; this option affects
            the inner arc, at the at the maximum end. It does not change the appearance of
            qualitative ranges. To do that, change the color palette.



Note how the change in background color changes the bullet visual: in this visual, it
            controls the appearance of the qualitative ranges.
