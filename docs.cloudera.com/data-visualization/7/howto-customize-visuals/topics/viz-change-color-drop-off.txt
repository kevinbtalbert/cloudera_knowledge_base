Changing drop off color

To choose a different color for the drop off node, such as in funnel visuals, click
          the Drop off Color color selector widget, select one of the palette
          colors or specify a custom color, and click OK.


The following image illustrates how a funnel visual changes when we change the drop off
            color.
