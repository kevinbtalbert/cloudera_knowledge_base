Changing foreground color

This applies to Gauge and Bullet
      visuals.
To choose a different color for the value on the Measurement
          shelf and make changes in the Foreground Color selector. You can
          select one of the palette colors, or specify a custom color.



Note how the change in foreground color changes the gauge visual; the main measurement
            that this option affects is on the inner arc.



Note how the change in foreground color changes the bullet visual; the main measurement
            is the narrow central bar.
