To choose a different opacity (color saturation) for your visual and make changes
          to the Color Opacity selector.



The default value is 80 %. Click the - sign to make the colors more transparent by
            decreasing color opacity by 10% with each click. To increase color saturation, click the
            + sign to increase color opacity by 10%. Edit the number in the center of the selector
            to get a custom value. Valid values range from 1% for the palest through 100% for the
            brightest colors. A value of 0 generates a visual with full saturation.
