Changing custom icon size
In an interactive map visual, you can change the size of the custom icon.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
            Routes/Pins.




To adjust the size of a custom icon, adjust the minimum and maximum values in the
            Custom Icon Size option.

Valid values are 0 through 100.



In this example, a custom icon (truck) is used, and the icon size is set to
          4.



In the following image, you can see the size of the trucks when the custom icon size is
          4.



You can increase the custom icon size to 16.



In the following image, you can see the bigget custom icon (truck) after the custom icon
