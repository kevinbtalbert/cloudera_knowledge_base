Changing intensity magnification

In an interactive map visual, CDP Data Visualization enables
      you to intensity magnification for heatmaps.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
          Heatmap.


To change the intensity magnification of the Heatmap, change
          the value for the Intensity Magnification option. The default value is
          1000.



The default intensity magnification value is 1000. Compare the results of
            setting intensity magnification on Google Map to 10, 100, 1,000,
            and 10,000. In the following figures, the heatmap radius for all cases is
              25.



Similarly, compare the effect of the same heat intensity magnification settings on the
            Mapbox map.
