Changing heatmap radius

In an interactive map visual, CDP Data Visualization enables
      you to change the granularity of the heatmap.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
          Heatmap.


To change the granularity of a Heatmap, change the value for
          the Heatmap Radius option. The default value is 25.



The default value of heatmap radius is 25. Compare the results of setting
            heatmap radius on Google Map to 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
            and 30. In the following figure, the intensity magnification for all cases is
              100.



Similarly, compare the effect of the same heatmap radius settings on the Mapbox
            map.
