Changing visible zoom levels in heatmapCloudera DocsChanging visible zoom levels in heatmap


In an interactive map visual on MapBox, it is recommended to adjust the zoom level within
        the minimum and maximum zoom levels. Valid values are 0 through 22. For
        example, if the zoom level is set to more than the maximum level, heatmap will not be
        visible.
Sometimes, it is not possible to display data legibly at a given zoom level. CDP Data
        Visualization enables you to adjust the visible zoom levels in a heatmap.


On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
          Heatmap.


To adjust the zoom level of a heatmap, navigate to the
            Heatmap menu under Settings, and adjust
          the minimum and maximum values in the Visible Zoom Levels option.
Let's set the minimum level to 1 and maximum level to
              3. 



In the following example, notice when the zoom level is set to a value less than the
            maximum level 2.95, heatmap is visible. However, if the zoom
            level is set to more than the maximum level 3.02, heatmap is not
            visible and the circles are smaller.
