Changing layout gravityCloudera DocsChanging layout gravity


The Layout Gravity models a force that keeps nodes centered in the visible area, and keeps
        the disconnected subgraphs in the visual.
To change the layout gravity, navigate to the Marks menu, and change
        the value for the Layout gravity option. The default setting is
          0.1, the range is between 0 and 1.
If setting the layout gravity to 0, use other constraints.





Compare the appearance of a visuals with layout gravity of 0,
          0.5, and 1. In each of these cases, the
          Layout Theta option is at the default value of 0.8, and all other
        settings remain the same.
