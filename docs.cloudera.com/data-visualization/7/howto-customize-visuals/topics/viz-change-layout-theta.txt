Changing layout thetaCloudera DocsChanging layout theta


The layout theta determines the accuracy of the Barnesâ€“Hut approximation computation;
        larger values increase the speed of the simulation but lower its accuracy. When theta is
          0, the algorithm becomes a direct-sum algorithm.
To change the layout theta setting, navigate to the Marks menu, and
        change value for Layout theta option. The default setting is
          0.8.





Compare the appearance of a visuals with layout theta settings of 0,
          0.8, and 1.
