Adding and removing legend


Legend is on by default. It appears on the right side of the visuals. To add a legend
          below or above a visual, navigate to the Marks menu, and select the
          appropriate Legend Style.






To remove the legend, select Marks > Legend Style > None.







Here is an example of a line chart with a legend showing. The legend represents dimensions
        as distinct colors.


For graphs that map a continuum of values, such as choropleth maps, the legend shows a
        sliding scale of color and values at the minimum, median, and maximum.



For timeline visuals, you can add a legend by adding a dimension to the color shelf. This
        example shows you a timeline where the different latitude values are marked by different
        colors, and the legend is displayed on the right side of the visual.
