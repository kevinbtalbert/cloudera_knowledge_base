Changing line style


In a line visual, you can display a different line style for each measure in the
        visual.
To modify each line of a visual to a different style, navigate to the Marks menu,
        and check the Modify line styles per color option.



In the following image, notice the different line styles for each measure:



If you hover over a line, the line style changes from a dotted (or dashed) line to a solid
        line, and the tooltip appears.
