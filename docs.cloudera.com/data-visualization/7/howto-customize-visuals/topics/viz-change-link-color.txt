Changing link color


To change the color of the links, navigate to the Links menu, and
        change the selection in the Default Link Color menu. These options
        are:

source
target
link width (default)
fixed

Compare the appearance of a network visual with links based on source node, and
        links based on target node.



Here, compare the same dendrogram visual with links based on source, target,
          aggregate, and fixed.
