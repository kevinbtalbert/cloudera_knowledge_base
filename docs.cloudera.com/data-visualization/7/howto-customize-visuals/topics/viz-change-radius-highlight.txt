Changing highlight of radius


For clearer appearance of the highlight in a visual, CDP Data Visualization enables you to
        adjust the highlight of the radius.
It applies to Combined Bar/Line charts.
To change the size of a highlight, navigate to the Marks menu, and
        adjust the selector for the Max Highlight Radius option.



Note how the change of the maximum radius from 20 to 40 changes the appearance of the
        visual.
