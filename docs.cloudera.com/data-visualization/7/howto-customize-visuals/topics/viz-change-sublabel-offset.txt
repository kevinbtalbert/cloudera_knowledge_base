Changing sublabel offsetCloudera DocsChanging sublabel offset


This task applies to Gauge charts.
By default, the offset (vertical position) for the secondary label in gauge charts is 0. To
        change it, navigate to the Marks menu, and select a new value for the
          Sublabel Offset option.



Note how adjusting this setting changes the appearance of the visual: negative values move
        the secondary label upward, and positive values move it downward.
