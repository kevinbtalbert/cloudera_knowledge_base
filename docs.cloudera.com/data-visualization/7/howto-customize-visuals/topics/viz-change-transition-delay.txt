Changing transition delay


This task applies to Scatter visuals. It controls the speed of animation described in
          Showing Autoplay Transition Animation.
To adjust the speed of animation, navigate to the Marks menu, and
        adjust the value for the Transition Delay (ms) option.
Larger numbers specify longer delays, while smaller numbers generate faster animations. The
        default setting is 1,000 milliseconds; to speed up the animation 10-fold, change the value
        to 100.
