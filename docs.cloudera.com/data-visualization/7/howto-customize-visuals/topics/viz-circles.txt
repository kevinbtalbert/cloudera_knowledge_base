Customizing circles


In an interactive map visual, CDP Data Visualization enables you to change circle
        settings.
Circles paint circles that are linearly proportional to the value of the aggregate. When
        using one measure, both the size and color of the circle correspond to the value of the
        aggregate measure. When using two measures, the first measurement specifies the size of the
        circle, and the second measurement specifies its color.
Circles are not on by default.
