Customizing cluster
 

In an interactive map visual, CDP Data Visualization enables you to change cluster
        settings.
Cluster shows aggregate values within a certain cluster radius, so changing the
        radius changes the aggregation grouping. Note that this radius is relative to the
        magnification on the map, so the number of aggregations change as you zoom in and out. The
        cluster color specifies the color of the circle that reports the number of items in each
        aggregate. At sufficiently high magnifications, when individual data points are visible as
        marks, the cluster supports click behavior.
The cluster is on by default, along with heatmap.
