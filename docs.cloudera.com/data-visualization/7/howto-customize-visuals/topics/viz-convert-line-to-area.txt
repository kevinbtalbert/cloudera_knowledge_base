Converting line to area visualCloudera DocsConverting line to area visual


In Combo visuals, for better representation of data, CDP Data Visualization enables you to
        convert the line to a semi-transparent area. 
It applies to Combined Combo charts.
To change the combo visual style for the second dimension display from line (default) to an
        area, navigate to the Marks menu, and select the Convert
          Line To Area Visual option.



Notice how this change alters the combo visual.
