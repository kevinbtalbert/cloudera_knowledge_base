Sorting custom styles in visualsCloudera DocsSorting custom styles in visuals


CDP Data Visualization enables you to sort custom styles in visuals by ID,
          Name, Last Updated, and Modified By fields. You can sort in ascending
        or descending order.
noteYou cannot sort by the Description field.
To demonstrate how to sort custom styles by the Name field, follow these steps:

On the right side of Visual Designer, click the
            Custom Style menu.




Click the Add Style button.
The Pick Custom CSS interface appears.


Click the Name field.
noteWhen you hover over a field, a hand icon appears only on the fields that you can
            sort.

In the following image, the Name field is sorted in ascending
            order and a sort icon appears next to the field.

To sort the field in descending order, click the Name field
          again.
