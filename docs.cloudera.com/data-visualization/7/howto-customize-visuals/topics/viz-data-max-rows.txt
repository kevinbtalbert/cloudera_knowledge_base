Changing maximum number of rows to fetch

You can provide an upper limit on the number of rows in a
      visual request. At the individual visual level, the number of rows in a visual request
      defaults to 5,000. So by default, the system fetches 5,000 rows at a time. At the individual
      visual level, the setting in the Maximum number of rows to fetch option
      overrides this default behaviour.noteFor table visuals
        only, the value on the Limit shelf in the Visual
          Designer overrides this setting.

To change the default setting, navigate to the Data menu, and
          change the value in the text box for Maximum number of rows to
            fetch.




At the dashboard level, you can change this setting on the Data
            tab of a filter widget.noteIn Edit mode, a warning about
              the limit of the fetched rows is shown after opening a visual or dashboard with a
              limit. In View mode, the warning is suppressed.
