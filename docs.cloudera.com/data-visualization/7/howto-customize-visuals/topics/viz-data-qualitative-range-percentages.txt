Specifying qualitative range as percentages 


The Gauge and Bullet visuals use the Qualitative
          Ranges shelf to define the fit of the main value (on the Measure shelf)
        relative the value specified by the Compare To shelf. An alternate
        approach is to specify these ranges as percentages.


To use the percentage option, navigate to the Data menu, and
          select Use percentages of "Compare To" value if no qualitative data
            provided. Then specify the percentage value for the
            Lowest, Middle, and
            Highest ranges. 
By default, these are 60%, 80%, and 100%, respectively. Note that
          the scale accommodates up to 200%, to track outperforming categories.



The visual on the left shows the ranges when they are explicitly defined as scalar
            values 600, 700, and 800. The visual on the right shows the
            qualitative ranges as percentages: 60%, 80%, and 100%.
