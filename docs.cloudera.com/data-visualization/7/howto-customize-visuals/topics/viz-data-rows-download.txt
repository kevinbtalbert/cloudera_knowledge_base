Changing number of rows to download


At the visual level, you can change the limit on the number of rows to download in a CSV
        file.
By default, the setting in the Maximum number of rows to fetch option specifies the
        number of rows to download in a CSV file. For table visuals only, the value of the
          Limit shelf is used first, but if this option does not specify a
        value, then the Maximum number of rows to fetch value applies. See .Changing
          maximum number of rows to fetch


To override the default, you can specify your own limit by navigating to the
            Data menu, and changing the setting in the Number of
            rows downloaded during CSV export and Detailed Data option.




This setting overrides the Maximum number of rows to fetch option in the
              Data menu. For table visuals only, it also overrides the
            value in the Limit shelf.


          Limiting rows downloaded to CSV fileSet the value of this option to
              10. After downloading this visual's data as CSV (see Downloading
              visual data to CSV files), check the number of rows.Note that compared
            to the default download with value of -1 (left side), only 10 rows are
            present in the exported data, to match the number of rows specified earlier.




noteIn Edit mode, a warning about the limit of the fetched
            rows is shown after opening a visual or dashboard with a limit. In View mode, the
            warning is suppressed.
