Displaying axis ticksCloudera DocsDisplaying axis ticks


This task applies to Gauge charts.
By default, the axis wraps around the outer arc of a gauge chart, and shows measurements as
        evenly-spaced tick marks. To hide the tick-marks, navigate to the
          Marks menu, and de-select the Display axis
          ticks option.



Note how hiding axis ticks changes the visual.
