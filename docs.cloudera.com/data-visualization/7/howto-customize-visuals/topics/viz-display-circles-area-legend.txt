Displaying area legend
 In an interactive map visual, CDP Data Visualization enables you to display area
    legend of circles.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
          Circles.



To show the area legend for Circles, select the
            Add Area Legend option. 

This option is off by default.noteThis setting is only
              available if the Measures shelf is populated. Make sure you
              have one aggregate field in the Measures shelf.
