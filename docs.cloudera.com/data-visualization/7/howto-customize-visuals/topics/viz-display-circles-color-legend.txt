Displaying color legend
 In an interactive map visual, CDP Data Visualization enables you to display color
    legend of circles.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
          Circles.



To show the color legend for Circles, select the
            Add Color Legend option.

This option is off by default.
noteThis setting is only available if the
              Colors shelf is populated. Make sure you have one aggregate
            field in the Colors shelf.
The following image shows a Google Map with Circles, plotting two measures:
            elevation and count of features. You can see that the first measure appears as colors
            that you can check in the color legend, while the second measurement displays as size
            that you can see in the area legend.



The following image shows a Mapbox Map with Circles and two measures: elevation
            and count of features. Elevation appears as colors, and feature count is represented by
