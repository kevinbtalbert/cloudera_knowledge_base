Displaying first measure as main indicator


This setting is specific to KPI visuals.
To display the first value on the Measure shelf as the main indicator, navigate to the
          Marks menu, and select the Display the first
          measure option.
If this option is not selected, the visual displays the first value on the Dimensions shelf
        as primary indicator.



This image illustrates the visual with main indicator displayed as Measure (default), or
        Dimension.
