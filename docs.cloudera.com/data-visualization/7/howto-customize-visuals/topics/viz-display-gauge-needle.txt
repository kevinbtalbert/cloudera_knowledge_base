Displaying gauge needle


In a Gauge visual, CDP Data Visualization helps you to display the measure mark as a needle
        or a line from the center to the measure value on the arc of a Gauge visual.
To show a gauge arrow from the center to the measure value on the arc, navigate to the
          Marks menu, and select Needle under the
          Key measure mark option. To remove the gauge needle select
          None. To show a gauge line instead of an arrow, select
          Line.




Note the Gauge needle in the second image after selecting this option.
