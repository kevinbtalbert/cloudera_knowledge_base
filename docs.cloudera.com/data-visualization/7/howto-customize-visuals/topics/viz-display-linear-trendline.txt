Displaying a linear trendline
 

CDP Data Visualization enables you to create a linear trendline. A linear trendline is a
        best-fit straight line that is used with simple linear data sets. The data is linear if the
        system data points resemble a line. A linear trendline usually shows that something is
        increasing or decreasing at a steady rate.
To display a linear trendline for the graph, navigate to the
          Trendline menu, and select Display linear
          trendline.



Note that the trendlines appear on the visual. To see the specific values related to the
        calculation of the trendline, hover your mouse over the trendline and examine the
        information in the Tooltip window.
