Displaying bubbles on mapsCloudera DocsDisplaying bubbles on maps


CDP Data Visualization enables you to display measurements over maps as bubbles. This task
        applies to Maps.
Many map visuals render as choropleths by default. To display measurements over maps as
        bubbles, click the Settings menu, select the
          Marks sub-menu, and select the Always display marks as
          bubbles option.



Compare the appearance of world map as a choropleth map, and as a map with bubble
        marks.
To adjust the size of the bubbles, see Change mark size range.
