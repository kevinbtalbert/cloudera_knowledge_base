Displaying title for subtotal rows 


You can add a title for the subtotal rows. This option is available only on cross
        tabulation visuals when expansion is enabled on at least one of the
          Row shelf dimensions.
Navigate to the Marks menu and enter a title for the subtotal row
        under the Subtotal Title option.



In the following example, compare the visual on the left without a title to the one on the
        right with a title. In our example, we added the title Subtotal.
