Enabling quotation marks in CSV downloadCloudera DocsEnabling quotation marks in CSV download 
If you download a CSV file and open in excel, leading zeros in a numeric string are
    truncated. To see the leading zeros, CDP Data Visualization enables you to add quotes in a
    numeric string.
Before enabling this setting, you must first enable CSV
      download, in the Downloads menu at the visual level. noteThe site
        administrator can override the visual-level setting at the site level. For more information,
        see Downloading maximum number of rows in CSV files.

On the right side of Dashboard Designer, click Settings > Downloads from the VISUAL menu.






Select Quote numeric strings in CSV downloads.




To disable the support of quotation marks in a CSV file, de-select the Quote
              numeric strings in CSV download option.
