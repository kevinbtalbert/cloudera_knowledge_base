Enabling zoom to active areasCloudera DocsEnabling zoom to active areas
In CDP Data Visualization, Map visuals can enable you to zoom to active areas
    in.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
          Zoom.




To enable active area zoom on Maps, select the Zoom to active area option.

The default is on.
If Zoom to active areas is checked, the visual automatically
            focuses on the parts of the map that have plotted dimensions. In the example of the
            world map used here, this includes all the continents except Antarctica.



If this option is de-selected, the visual shows the entire map, including the over-size
            continent of Antarctica.
