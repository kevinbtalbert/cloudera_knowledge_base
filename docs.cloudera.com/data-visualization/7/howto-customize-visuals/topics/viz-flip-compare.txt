Flipping compare indicator


This setting is specific to KPI visuals.
To change the direction of the arrow (and the semantic meaning of the differences between
        the indicators), navigate to the Marks menu, and selection the
          Flip comparison option.



This image illustrates the visual with the default comparison setting, and with the flipped
        comparison. Note that the arrows flipped.
