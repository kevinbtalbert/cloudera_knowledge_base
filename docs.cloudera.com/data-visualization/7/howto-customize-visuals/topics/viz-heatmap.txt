In an interactive map visual, CDP Data Visualization enables you to change Heatmap
        settings.
The Heatmap is on by default, along with Cluster.
The color of the heatmap indicates the value of the aggregate on the Measurements shelf,
        and it is determined by the color palette. The heatmap includes an optional color
          legend, which is in gradient form and is based on the color palette. The
          intensity magnification multiplies the value of the measure by a constant, and
        adjust the color display by pushing it 'higher' up the selected color palette. The
          heatmap radius displays, in pixels, the size of each point.
Make the appropriate changes under the following Heatmap options:
