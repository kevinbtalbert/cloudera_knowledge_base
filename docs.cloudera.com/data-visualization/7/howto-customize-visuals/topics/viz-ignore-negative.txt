Ignoring negative values


If a visual has both negative and postive values, you have an option not to display
        negative values. This task applies to stacked Bars and Area visuals.
To ignore negative values in stacked bar and area visuals, navigate to the
          Marks menu, and select the When both positive and
          negative measure values are present in stacked bars/area, ignore the negative measure
          values option.



The following image shows the stacked bars without the negative values, when this option is
        selected.
