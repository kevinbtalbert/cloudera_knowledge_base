Ensuring consistent colors on dimension values


CDP Data Visualization enables you to make colors consistent on dimension values. In
        dimensions where several visuals include same dimension values, it is helpful if these
        values are colored identically. It also removes the need to add multiple legends on the same
        dashboard. 
This feature applies to bar visuals, line visuals, area visuals, combined bar/line visuals,
        and pie visuals.
For this feature to work properly, you must ensure that the target visuals use the same
        color palette.

To ensure that the colors are consistent across the visuals when they appear in the
          same dashboard and select the option Base colors on dimension
            values. You must do this for each visual in the dashboard.





In the following example, we show how to standardize colors for a US State
          Population dashboard that uses a bar visual and a trellised line visual.
Compare the color values for the two visuals in the top graph. It can be easily seen that
        the legends for the visuals don't match. However, they are identical in the bottom
        dashboard, where we enabled the color consistency feature.
