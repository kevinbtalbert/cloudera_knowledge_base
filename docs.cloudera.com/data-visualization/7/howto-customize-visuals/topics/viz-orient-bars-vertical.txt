Orienting bars vertically


By default, some visual types, such as bullets, have a natural horizontal orientation.
To change the display to show bullets as vertical bars, navigate to the
          Marks menu, select the Orient bars
          vertically option.



In the following example, compare the default horizontal display of a bullet visual with
        the appearance of the same visual when displayed vertically.
