Remembering location of map
In interactive map visuals, CDP Data Visualization enables you to remember the
    location of the map.
In Edit mode, if you save and close the
      visual, and open the same visual again, the map opens at the same location where you closed
      the visual.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
            Choropleth.



To remember the location of the map, select the Remember map location
          option.



To demonstrate how this feature works, follow these steps:
Create a choropleth interactive visual. See Creating Choropleth Interactive
                  Map Visuals.
In Edit
 mode, navigate to a location in the map. In our example, the tooltip shows our
                location as zip_code 94027.
Click Save.
Click Close.
Open the same visual again. The visual opens at the same location,
                  zip_code 94027, where we closed the visual.
