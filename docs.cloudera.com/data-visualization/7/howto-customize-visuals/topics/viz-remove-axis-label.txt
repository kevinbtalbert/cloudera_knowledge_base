Showing or hiding axis labels

CDP Data Visualization  enables you to show or hide axis lables. By default, visuals with
      vertical and horizontal axes have labels on these axes.
To remove the labels on visuals that use X Axis and Y Axis, navigate to the
        Axes menu, and de-select: Include X Axis
      label, or Include Y Axis label, or both.



To remove the labels on visuals that use Dimensions and Measures, navigate to the
        Axes menu, and de-select: Include dimension axis
        label, or Include measure axis label, or both.
