Selecting end pin type
In a map route, you can choose an existing end pin type from a dropdown or add your own
    custom pin. 
In an Interactive Map visual, before you select the
        End Pin Type option, make sure you enable routes. Once enabled, the
      route shows a default route and a default pin at the end of the route. 

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
            Routes/Pins.



To change the end pin type, you can select one of the following pin types from the
            End Pin Type dropdown menu: Default,
            Circle, None, and
            Custom. 



Select Circle from the dropdown menu to display the
              end pin as a circle.





Select Custom from the dropdown menu to display the end pin
              as a truck.

To add a custom icon, see Specifying a Custom Icon.





Select None from the dropdown menu to remove the end
              pin.
