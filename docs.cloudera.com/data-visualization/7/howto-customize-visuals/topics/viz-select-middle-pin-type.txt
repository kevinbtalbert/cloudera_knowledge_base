Selecting middle pin type
In a map route, you can choose an existing middle pin type from a dropdown or add your
    own custom pin.
In an Interactive Map visual, before you select the
        Middle Pin Type option, make sure you enable routes. Once enabled,
      the route shows a default route and a default pin at the end of the route.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
          Circles.



To change the middle pin type, you can select one of the following pin types from
          the Middle Pin Type dropdown menu: Default,
            Circle, None, and
            Custom.



Select Circle from the dropdown menu to display the
              middle pins as circles.




Select Custom from the dropdown menu to display the middle
              pin as trucks.

To add a custom icon, see Specifying a Custom Icon.





Select None from the dropdown menu to remove all
              middle pins.
