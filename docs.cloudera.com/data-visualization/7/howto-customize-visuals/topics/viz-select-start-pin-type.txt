Selecting start pin type
In a map route, you can choose an existing start pin type from a dropdown or add your
    own custom pin.
In an Interactive Map visual, before you select the
        Start Pin Type option, make sure you enable routes. Once enabled, the
      route shows a default route and a default pin at the end of the route.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
            Routes/Pins.



To change the start pin type, you can select one of the following pin types from
          the Start Pin Type dropdown menu: Default,
            Circle, None, and
            Custom.





Select Circle from the dropdown menu to display the start
              pin as a circle.







Select Custom from the dropdown menu to display the start
              pin as a truck.

To add a custom icon, see Specifying a Custome Icon.





Select None from the dropdown menu to remove the
              start pin.
