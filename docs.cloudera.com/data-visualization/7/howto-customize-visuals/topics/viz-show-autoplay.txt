Placing a periodic dimension on the Transition shelf of a scatter visual enables you to
        animate a scatter visual. This is very useful when dimensions represent dates and times.
        This task applies to Scatter visuals.
To turn on this feature, navigate to the Marks menu, select the
          Autoplay transition animation option. 



Note that appearance of controls common to all video animations: 'play' (which changes to
        'pause' when the animation is active), 'back to start', 'back-up', 'advance', and 'to
        end'.
