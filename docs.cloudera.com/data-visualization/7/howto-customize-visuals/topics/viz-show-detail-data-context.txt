Showing detail data button in context menu

You can click on a part of a visual and see the matching rows
      of data, in detail. This setting is available on all visual types.
Use this feature to ensure that the Detail Data
      selector appears in the context menu. In Edit mode, navigate to the
        Marks menu, and select the Show detail data button in
        context menu option. It is on by default.

If this option is selected, notice that the Show Detailed Data
      option appears in the context menu.


To see how this option works, see Discovering detailed data behind a
          visual.

To hide detail data, de-select the Show detail data button in context
              menu option.
