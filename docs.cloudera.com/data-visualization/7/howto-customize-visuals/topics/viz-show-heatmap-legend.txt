Showing heatmap legend

In an interactive map visual, CDP Data Visualization enables
      you to show or hide a legend for heatmaps.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
          Heatmap.


To show the legend for Heatmap, select or unselect Add
            Heatmap Legend option. This option is off by default.



After you enable the legend option, the legend appears in the lower right-corner of the
            Google map.



Similarly, the legend appears on the Mapbox map.
