Showing measure values inside bars


If you adjust the width of the bars, CDP Data Visualization enables you to see measure
        values inside bars.
To show measure values inside bars, navigate to the Marks menu, and
        select the Label measure values for bars option.



Note the measure values inside the bars in the second image.



You may need to adjust the width of the bars to accommodate the value display. See
          Change bar size range.
