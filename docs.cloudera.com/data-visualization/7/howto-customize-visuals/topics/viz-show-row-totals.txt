Showing row totals
In CDP Data Visualization, you can add a totals row to Cross Tabulation
    visuals.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings in the VISUAL section of the
          menu.






Open the Data Summary menu and select the Show row
            totals option.




For information on column totals, see Showing column totals.
In this example, you can see a visual without row totals, and another visual with row
            totals added:



You check the Combine row totals option, if  there are multiple
            measures and at least one dimension in the Column shelf.
In this example, you can see a visual with uncombined totals of the Import and Export
            columns, and another visual that combines them to show the actual trade deficit.
