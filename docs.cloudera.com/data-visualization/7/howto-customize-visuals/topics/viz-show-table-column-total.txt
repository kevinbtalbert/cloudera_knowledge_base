Showing column totals
In CDP Data Visualization, you can add Table, Cross Tabulation, and Queries visuals
    report values in rows by default. But there is an option of adding a totals row to a table and
    use it to present column totals.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings in the VISUAL section of the
          menu.






Open the Data Summary menu and select the Show
            totals option.




noteThe Data Summary menu is different for
            Cross Tabulation visuals. You can configure both column totals and row totals. Use the
              Show column totals options to add column totals.
            

For information on row totals, see Showing row totals.
In this table, you can see the totals reported for numerical measurement columns:
