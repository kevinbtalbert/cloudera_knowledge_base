Showing paginationCloudera DocsShowing pagination
With very long tables, scrolling down can become annoying. CDP Data Visualization
    allows you to display pagination for your tables, but by default, tables do not display page
    numbers.

To turn pagination on for Tables and Queries:

On the right side of the Visual Designer, click
            Style in the VISUAL section of the menu
            bar.


In the Style menu, click Table Style.


Select the Show pagination option. You must also specify the
          number of rows per page. By default, pagination is off. 




Pagination, with 10 rows per pageIn this example, pagination is turned on, and the number of rows per page is set to 10.
        The table shortens, and an interactive page selector appears at the bottom right corner of
        the visual.



Pagination and totalsIf you select both the pagination and totals options, the table reports the same total on each
        page, and that is the overall total.
