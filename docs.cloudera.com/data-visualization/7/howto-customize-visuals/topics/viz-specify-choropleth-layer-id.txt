Specifying choropleth layer ID
To create a choropleth map in an interactive map visual, you must specify a
    choropleth Layer ID.

When you request for a custom style from Mapbox, make sure that this style has a choropleth
        shape file in it. This shape file has the choropleth Layer ID, which
        is the name of a unique layer within the Custom Mapbox style that
        identifies the shapes that you would like to color by a measure in your data. See
          Custom mapbox style.
