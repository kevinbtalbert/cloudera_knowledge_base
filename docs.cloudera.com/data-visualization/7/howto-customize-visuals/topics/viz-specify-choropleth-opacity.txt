Specifying choropleth opacity
In an interactive map visual, CDP Data Visualization enables you to change the
    opacity of choropleth maps.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
            Choropleth.



To change the opacity (color saturation) of choropleths, adjust the selector for
          the Choropleth Opacity. The valid range is from 0 through
            1.


Compare the appearance of the choropleth map when the opacity is set to
              1 and 0.5.
