Specifying a custom icon
In an interactive map visual, you can add a custom icon as a pin.
When using Mapbox, you can use any file type that can be used
      as an image in CSS, as a pin on your map.

On the right side of Visual Designer, click
            Settings.
In the Settings menu, click
            Routes/Pins.



To specify a custom icon for the pin, enter the link in the Custom Icon text
          box.





Follow these steps to display pins as trucks on the entire route from start to end: 
Select Custom in Start Pin Type,
              Middle Pin Type, and End Pin Type
            options.
Enter the following link in the Custom Icon option:
              https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/eldorado-transport/40/truck_1-512.png.




You can see that the image shows trucks on the entire route from start to end.
