Customizing visual colors
The type of color customization available for each visual in CDP Data Visualization
    depends on the visual type.
    

For example:

 Most visuals that support color have the option of changing the color palette, or to
          reverse the color palette.
Visuals with optional color, such as cross tabulation, have an option to enable or
          disable colors.
Visuals that rely on color as a principle method of conveying information, such as a bar
          chart, have an option to customize color opacity.
Most commonly-used visuals support color assignment based on dimension value.
All visuals that use the Color shelf also support specific color
          assignment for dimension values.
Some visuals, such as extension and rich text, do not support color customization at
          all.
