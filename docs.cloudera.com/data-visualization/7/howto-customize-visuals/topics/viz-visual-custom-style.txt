Custom styles enable you to apply styling to a particular element. You can customize
    each CDP Data Visualization visual to use CSS classes, included styles, and in-line CSS
    code.

When applying custom styles in CDP Data Visualization, you can use several approaches:
        setting site-wide custom styles, setting custom styles at the dashboard level, at an app
        level, setting styles for a filter, or setting styles for a visual, described here. Custom
        styles enable the user to isolate the styling to a particular element.
noteBy default, the Custom Styling option is turned off. It can be turned on by a user with
        administrative privileges, see Enabling custom styling.
To get to the options in the Custom Style menu of the visual, follow
        these steps:

On the right side of Visual Designer, click the
            Custom Style menu.
