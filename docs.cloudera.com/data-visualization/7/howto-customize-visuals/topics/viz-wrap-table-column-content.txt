Wrapping column contents
In CDP Data Visualization, you can wrap content in table columns. If the text does not
    wrap, you can hover over the text to view full text.
Wrapping content
To wrap content in the columns of Table and Queries visuals:

On the right side of the Visual Designer, click Style in the
            VISUAL section of the menu bar.


In the Style menu, click Table Style.


Select the Wrap column contents option.



In the following example, compare the two visuals – in the table on the right,  the content
        in the first column wraps after selecting this option.




Viewing full text
If the Wrap column contents option is not selected, and the text
        does not fit the width of the column, the text is displayed with a series of three dots
        (ellipsis – …) at the end of the table cell. Hover over the text to view the full
        text.
In the following example, the highlighted column text is displayed as Battery Park
          City....  If you hover over the text to view the full text, you can see the full text:
          Battery Park City-Lower Manhattan.
