Adding a dashboard to favorites
In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can mark your frequently used dashboards as
    favorites. These bookmarks make it easy to find your most-used content in a subsequent work
    session
When you mark a dashboard as favorite, you can access it
      quickly from the My Favorites list. Favorites are also visible on the
      HOME view.

In the Dashboard Designer top menu bar, click the
            (ellipsis) icon, and select Add to
            Favorites.




A Success message appears.
You can now find this visual in the Favorites list. All dashboards marked as
            favorite appear in the interface.

Optional: 
To view your favorite dashboards, click VISUALS on the main
          navigation bar and click My Favorites in the side menu bar.





Optional: 
If you no longer use a dashboard as often as before, you can unfavorite it.
When you unfavorite content, it is removed from your My
            Favorites list but not from CDV. Favorites is a toggle setting. In the
              Dashboard Designer top menu bar, click the
              (ellipsis) icon and select Remove from
              Favorites.
