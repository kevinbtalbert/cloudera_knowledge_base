Cloning a dashboard
In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can create an identical dashboard that you may
    choose to customize or move to another workspace.

In the Dashboard Designer top menu bar, click the
            (ellipsis) icon and select Clone.




noteUnsaved changes on the parent dashboard are persisted when
            cloning the dashboard.
If the dashboard contains linked visuals, the Clone Dashboard with Linked
              Visuals modal window appears.


By default, Cloudera Data Visualization clones all visuals, both linked and
          dashboard-specific. However, you can choose the Maintain linked
            association option for any of the linked visuals, and click CLONE
            NOW.
