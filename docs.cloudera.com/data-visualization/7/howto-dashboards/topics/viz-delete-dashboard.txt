Deleting a dashboard
CDP Data Visualization makes it very simple to remove dashboards that you no longer
    use.

Find the dashboard you want to delete. Open it either in Edit or View
          mode.

Click the (supplemental) menu in the top menu bar and select
            Delete Dashboard.


The delete confirmation modal window appears.

Click DELETE to confirm deleting this dashboard.
