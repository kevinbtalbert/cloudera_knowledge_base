Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to share dashboards through email. You can send
    them immediately, schedule them at specific times and intervals, or through a triggered response
    when reaching a specific monitored threshold.
Before using the email function, you must enable the feature in
      site settings. For instructions, see Email settings.Complete these
        prerequisites in your system configuration:Enable screenshot and thumbnail downloads. For instructions, see
            Snapshots.Enable email functionality. For instructions, see Email
          settings.Enable scheduled jobs. For instructions, see Enabling scheduled
            jobs.noteThis setting is only available for users with administrative
        privileges.

Find the dashboard that you want to email. Open it either in Edit or in
            View mode.

In the top menu bar, click the (ellipsis) icon  to open the
            supplemental menu, and select Email.




The Email Current Sheet modal window appears.

1. Email now – For instructions on providing email details, see
