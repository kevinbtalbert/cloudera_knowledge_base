Exporting a dashboard
In CDP Data Visualization (CDV), you can export visuals, dashboards and other visual
    artifacts. You can use the export function to port these artifacts from development/testing
    environments to production deployments or for creating back-ups.
Exporting a dashboard from a CDV instance generates a JSON
      file and saves it into your download directory. You can use this file can to import the visual
      artifacts to a new system, and deploy them if the new environment has identical data
        connections.noteYou need the Manage visuals and dashboards privilege to export
        visual artifacts.

Find the dashboard you want to export. Open it  either in Edit or View
          mode.

Open the (supplemental)  menu from the top menu bar and click
            Export.




The Export Visual Artifacts modal window appears.
noteIn addition to the dashboard itself, the utility exports all dashboard elements:
              visuals, datasets, static assets, custom styles, and
              custom color.

Click EXPORT to confirm the export of the dashboard.
