Moving a dashboard
 If you have a dashboard in a development workspace (either private or custom), you can
    move it to a public workspace so that everyone across the organization can use it to access the
    analytical insights that dashboard provides. Depending on your installation, you can also
    designate the public workspace as the collection of customer-facing dashboards.
When the dashboard you are moving contains a
      linked visual that is used by another dashboard in the workspace, you have two options: to
      clone it or to move it. For more information on what happens in each case, see the following
      diagram. In this example, dashboard 2 is moved from
        WORKSPACE I (private) to WORKSPACE II
      (public). visual c is a linked visual, used by both
        dashboard 2 and dashboard 3.
