Moving linked visuals

If you choose to move the linked
        visual c betweeen the workspaces, it remains a linked visual in its
      new location in WORKSPACE II. However, this has an impact on
        dashboard 3 in WORKSPACE I. While
        visual c is still part of the dashboard, it is referenced in an
      external workspace. Because visual c is no longer part of the same
      workspace, users who do not have sufficient permissions for WORKSPACE
        II will not be able to see the visual from WORKSPACE I.
      This is more likely to happen when moving dashboards from the public workspace into a custom
        workspace.
