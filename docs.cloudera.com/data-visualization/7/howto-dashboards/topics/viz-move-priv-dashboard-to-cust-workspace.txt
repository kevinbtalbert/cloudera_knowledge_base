Moving private dashboards to a custom workspace


The following steps demonstrate how to move a dashboard from one workspace into another. In
        this example, the World Life Expectancy dashboard is moved from the private workspace
        to a custom workspace called Rachel's workspace.


Click the name of the workspace on the top menu of the dashboard.

In this example, the dashboard is currently in the PRIVATE
            workspace.





In the drop-down menu, select an alternate workspace for the dashboard, and click
            SAVE.
In this example, Rachel's Workspace is chosen.


Because this dashboard uses linked visuals, you have an extra decision to
          make.





Clone Visual: This creates a new linked visual, but breaks the connection
                between visuals.


Move Visual: This option removes the linked visual from the workspace, and
                all the dashboards that use it start referencing it from its new workspace.
                Depending on the combination of security permissions, users who were able to see the
                visual when it was hosted in the original workspace may loose that visibility.
The dashboard is now tagged as RACHEL'S WORKSPACE.
