Moving private dashboards to public workspace


After creating a dashboard in your own private workspace and testing it, you can 'publish'
        it to the public workspace, where it is available to everyone with (at minimum) viewing
        privileges for the related datasets. 
A dashboard owner can designate a private dashboard as public at any time, simply by
        moving it from the Private workspace to Public workspace.


Click PRIVATE on the top menu of the dashboard.

In the drop-down menu, select an alternate workspace for the dashboard. In this
          example, Public is chosen.

After selecting the new workspace, click SAVE.

noteThe dashboard is now tagged as Public. You can check this by
            navigating to the Visuals interface, and selecting and expanding
            the destination workspace.



This process works for moving dashboards between private, public and custom workspaces,
            in any direction. You just need the adequate privileges to perform the action.
importantA dashboard cannot be reset to Private after it is added to an
            app.
