Accessing Data API request payload
To avoid creating Data API requests from scratch, Cloudera Data Visualization provides access to details of the data requests. 

This task is optional.


Add the following settings in Advanced Site Settings section of
          the Site Settings page:

ENABLE_DSREQ_PERF_DISPLAY = True
COMPRESS_DSREQ = True


Restart the Cloudera Data Visualization service.

Open an existing dashboard.
In this example, we selected Cereals.

Use the keyboard shortcut Shift +
              Control/Cmd +
              G to open the Performance
            Profile interface.

Hover over a line that represents a visual ID, we selected 75,
          and view the duration, type, and details of the query that runs against that visual. 

The query uses the same API and includes the details of the data requests. You can use
            this dataset request as the payload for your Data API call.
