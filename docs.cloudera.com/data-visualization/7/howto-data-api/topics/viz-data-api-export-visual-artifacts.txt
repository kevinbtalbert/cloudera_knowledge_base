Exporting visual artifacts with REST APIs


Authenticate the user using the data API.

After authenticating, submit a GET request to the following address
          for a source
          machine:source_arcviz_ip/arc/migration/api/export/
For instructions on import, see Importing visual artifacts with REST
          APIs.


This is a sample Python code snippet for authenticating and submitting the
          GET request that exports dashboards with IDs 2115 and 2110, and then
        writing the response to the my_app.json file.

export requests
headers = {'AUTHORIZATION':'apikey secret_api_key'}
payload = {'dashboards': '[2115, 2110]', 'filename': 'apitestmigration', 'dry_run':'False'}
r = requests.get('source_arcviz_ip/arc/migration/api/export/', headers=headers, params=payload)
with open('my_app.json', 'w') as f:
        f.write(r.text)
