Importing visual artifacts with REST APIs

Make sure that the *.json file with
      information about exported visual artifacts is on the destination machine.
Authenticate the user using the data API.After authenticating, submit a POST request to the following
          address for a destination machine:
            destination_arcviz_ip/arc/migration/api/import/For
          instructions on export, see Exporting visual artifacts with REST
        APIs.
This is a sample Python code snippet for authenticating and submitting the
        POST request that imports dashboards with IDs 2115 and 2110, which were
      earlier saved (from a metadata perspective) as my_app.json. This file is
      uploaded to the Data Visualization server during the
      import.import requests
headers = {'AUTHORIZATION':'apikey secret_api_key'}
payload = {'dry_run': False, "dataconnection_name":"data_connection"}
files = {'import_file': open('/Users/my_name/Downloads/my_app.json','r')}
r = requests.post('destination_arcviz_ip/arc/migration/api/import/',files=files, data=payload, headers=headers)
print r.status_code # 200 is success
