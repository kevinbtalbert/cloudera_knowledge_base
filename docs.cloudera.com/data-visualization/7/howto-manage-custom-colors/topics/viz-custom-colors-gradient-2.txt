Creating custom colors with gradient percentages
In Cloudera Data Visualization, users with administrative role can define gradient with
    percentage custom color palettes. 

Perform these actions in the New Custom Color interface:


Enter the Name of the new color. In this example,
            Elections is used.

In Color Scale Type, choose Gradient - with
            percentages.

On the color bar, click the color indicator on the left (the red square over the gray
          bar) and select another color from the color menu either by using the color slide bar, the
          color field, the shade field, or the text box for color code. 
In this example, blue color rgb(0, 136, 255)  is used.



Configure the color in the middle of the color gradient.
In this example, white rgb(255, 255, 255) is used.




Configure the color on the right of the color gradient.
In this example, red rgb(255, 42, 0) is used.




Click SAVE.

Click Custom Colors to return to the Custom Colors
          interface.


You can see that the new color, Election appears in the list of colors on the
          Manage Custom Colors interface. Its type is Gradient-with
          percentages, and you have an option to edit and delete it.
