Creating custom colors with gradient values
In Cloudera Data Visualization, users with administrative role can define custom color
    palettes that are gradients, based on a value.

noteNot all of the visual types support gradient value
        palettes.
Perform these actions in the New Custom Color interface:


Enter the Name of the new color. 
In this example, Ocean is used.

In Color Scale Type, choose Gradient - with
            values.

On the color bar, click the color indicator on the left (the red square over the gray
          bar).




The color selection widget appears.


Point to another color and click it.
You can also enter the color as RGB values or in hexadecimal format.



To adjust the color shade, slide indicator on the shade bar to the left.
Values more to the left are progressively more 'Grey'. Placing the indicator on the
          extreme right (default position) generates the most intense color.

Another option for color selection is to manually adjust the color by dragging
            the black dot on the square color selection field to the desired location.



Configure the color on the right side of the color gradient.




Configure the color in the middle of the color gradient.



Optional: 
You can adjust the position of the middle color by sliding its indicator to the left or
          the right of the color gradient.




In the text fields under the color gradient, the three color indicators specify the
            values that correspond to the range and midpoint values in the data you plan to
            represent by the custom color.





Click SAVE.

Click Custom Colors to return to the Custom Colors
          interface.

The new color, Ocean appears in the list of colors on the
      Manage Custom Colors interface. Its type is Gradient-with values, and you have an
      option to edit and delete it.
