Editing custom colors
From time to time, it may become necessary to change the definition of a custom color.
    It is possible to change the name of the color palette, specifications of individual color
    components, and so on. However, after it is defined, a color palette's type cannot change. 
noteThis feature is only available to users with administrative privileges.
To edit a custom color, follow these steps.

Click the Gear icon on the main navigation bar to open the
            Administration menu, and select Custom
            Colors.






 In the Manage Custom Colors interface, select the color to
          edit, and click its Pencil icon.

In this example, the custom color Elections is edited.





In the New Custom Color interface, change the
            Name.
In this example, the name from Elections has been changed to US
              Presidential Elections.




To change the definition of a component color:


For gradient options, both gradient values and gradient percentages, select
              the color indicator, and change the color definition either through the text box, the
              color slider, the shade slider, or the color selection field.





For the distinct color option, edit each color separately. You can either
              click on the color indicator and use the color selection sliders and fields, or change
              the numeric color definition.






To change the position of the middle color on gradients, slide the selector for
          that color to the desired position.




To remove a color from a distinct color grouping, click the
            remove icon.




Click SAVE.

Click the Custom Colors tabe to return to the Custom
            Colors interface.

You can see that Elections is now renamed US
        Presidential Elections in the list of custom colors.
