Managing custom colors

In Cloudera Data Visualization, users with administrative privileges can define custom color
      palettes as another choice for styling visuals and applications.
Anyone can use a custom color in a visual immediately after and administrator creates it. Administrators can also edit and delete custom colors.
Custom color palettes may be defined as a series of
        distinct colors, gradients with
        values, and gradients with
        percentages.
noteThis feature is only available to users with administrative privileges.
