Cloning custom date ranges


To create a new set of custom date ranges based on an existing one, you can make a clone of
        a set, and edit it. In this example it is demonstrated how to create My Date Range Set -
          Fine Control, a subset of My Date Range Set that features dateranges from 3
        minutes to 1 hour.
Follow these steps:


In the Manage Custom Dateranges interface, click
            Pencil icon next to the set of date ranges to clone.






In the Custom Date interface, click the
            Clone button.

Change the Name field. 

In this example, Clone of My Date Range Set is renamed to My Date Range Set -
              Fine Control.





In the list of ranges, delete the elements longer than 1 hour.

Click Save at the top of the interface.






Click Custom Dates at the top of the interface.

In the Manage Custom Dateranges interface, you can see that the
            list contains the new set, My Date Range Set - Fine Control, with a shorter list
            of ranges than the original set.




Optional: 
Create another set based on My Date Range Set, this time with dateranges of 1
          Day or greater. Name it My Date Range Set - Gross Control.
