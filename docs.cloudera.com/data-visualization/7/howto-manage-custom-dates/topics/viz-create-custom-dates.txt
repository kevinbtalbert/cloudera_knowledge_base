Creating new custom date ranges

To create a new set of custom date range, you must define each custom range in turn. 
Here, we demonstrate how to build a set of custom date ranges called My Date Range
          Set. We define the first one date range, 3 min, in detail. Then, we define the
        rest of them in similar manner.
Follow these steps:

Click the Gear icon on the main navigation bar to open the
            Administration menu and select Custom
            Dates.






In the Manage Custom Dateranges interface, click NEW
            CUSTOM DATERANGE.

In the Custom Date interface, enter the
            Name of the custom date. 

In this example, My Date Range  is used.





In the list of ranges, define the first range:


Enter the Name of the new range. 


Under Start Date Anchor, select one of the options:


Anchor to Today (default)
Anchor to Now
Anchor to Date, which is the current date by default. To specify an
                  alternate date, click in the edit field and select from the calendar interface.  
Anchor to Time, which is the current timestamp by default. To specify an
                  alternate timestamp, click in the edit field and select from the calendar and time
                  interface.  

Click APPLY.



Under Start Date Rules, click the
                Plus icon and proceed to specify the first stat date
              rule:



Click the text box with operations (Add) and select the operation for
                    the date rule:
Add (default), Subtract, Startof, or Endof.


Click the text box with numbers, and select the appropriate time offset.


Click the text box with units, and select one of the time units from the
                    menu:
Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks,
                      Months, Years, or Quarters (default). We selected
                      Minutes.


This completes the specification of the first start date rule.



To delete or remove a rule, click the Delete icon beside the
                rule.






Under End Date Anchor, select one of the options:


Anchor to Today (default)
Anchor to Now
Anchor to Date, which is the current date by default. To specify an
                  alternate date, click in the edit field and select from the calendar
                  interface.
Anchor to Time, which is the current timestamp by default. To specify an
                  alternate timestamp, click in the edit field and select from the calendar and time
                  interface.

This works just like the Start Date Anchor.



Click APPLY.



Under End Date Rules, click the Plus
              icon.



Proceed to specify the first rule:


Click the text box with operations (Add), and select the operation for
                    the date rule:
Add (default), Subtract, Startof, or Endof


Click the text box with numbers, and select the appropriate time offset.


Click the text box with units, and select one of the time units from the
                    menu:
Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks,
                      Months, Years, or Quarters (default).


This completes the specification of the first end date rule.
To delete or remove a rule, click the Delete icon beside the
                rule.
To delete or remove a rule, click the Delete icon beside the
                rule.



To remove the entire date range, click Remove icon at the
              end of the row that specifies the date range.






Click SAVE at the top of the interface to save the first date
          range.

Following the earlier steps, create additional dateranges and click
            SAVE.
In this example, the following dateranges have been created: 3 min5
              min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 3 hr, 6
              hr, 9 hr, 12 hr, 1 day, 3 day, 5 day, 1
              wk, 2 wk, 1 month, 2 month, 1 quarter, 2
              quarter, 1 year, 2 year, 3 year






In the Manage Custom Dateranges interface, you can see that the list
        contains the new set, My Date Range, with all defined ranges.
