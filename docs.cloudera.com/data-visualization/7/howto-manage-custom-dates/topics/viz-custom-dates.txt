Managing custom dates

Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to define custom sets of date ranges, and anchor them to
        a specific date and time. For real-time filters, you can anchor the filters to today,
        or to now.
You can then use these custom sets of date ranges on dashboards to filter time-based data,
        and help you analyze streaming input.
noteThis feature is only available to users with administrative privileges.
To use the Manage Custom Dateranges interface, follow these steps: 

Click the Gear icon on the main navigation bar to open the
            Administration menu and select Custom
            Dates.
