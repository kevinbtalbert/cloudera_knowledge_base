Creating new schedules
Cloudera Data Visualization allows you to create custom schedules for your scheduled
    jobs.

note
This feature is only available to users with administrative privileges.

To create a new schedule that can be used by one or more scheduled jobs, follow the below
        steps.
Incidentally, you can also create a custom schedule interval when creating new scheduled
        emails. These intervals appear in the Manage Schedule Intervals
        interface, and may be re-used for other jobs too.


In the Manage Schedule Intervals interface, click
            CREATE NEW SCHEDULE.




A Create New Schedule Interval modal appears.





Specify the parameters of the schedule:


In Interval Name field, enter the name for the new schedule
              interval. In this example, My Custom Interval has been used.

When choosing the date/time of the run, remember that time format is in UTC. For
                reference, the local time format designation is shown. In this example, local time
                is in PDT format, equivalent to UTC-0700.


In the first selectable field, choose the largest time component. By default,
                    this is year.





The second selectable field is for the day of the month. You can choose
                    multiple days by clicking on them, or deselect by clicking a second time.





In the third field, set the hour and the minute components of the schedule. As
                    with previous fields, multiple selections are possible.



noteThe number of selectors depends on the granularity of
                    the time interval specified by the first choice.






Click CREATE to save the new schedule.







A brief success message appears on your screen, and the new interval appears in the
          Manage Schedule Intervals interface.
