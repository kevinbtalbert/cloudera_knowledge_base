On the Set Threshold tab, perform the following actions to
          create a threshold definition and a new table visual that specifies the trigger
          values.

Alternatively, instead of defining a new threshold, you can use an existing
            table visual to specify threshold values, and add the ID of that visual to the
              Visual ID field.





Under Job Name, enter the name of the new trigger.


Click Create Threshold.


This creates a new table visual based on all the fields of the dataset, and the visual
            opens in a new tab of your browser. Note that the ID for the new visual appears in the
            URL address, and has the following format:
              https://ip_address/arc/apps/builder/trigger_id


Make changes to the visual so that the field that contains the triggering measurements
          is the first field on the Measures shelf, and sort/filter results
          to ensure that the triggering measurement is in the first row.

Save the new table visual.

Back on the Email Visual/Email Dashboard
            modal, in the Set Threshold tab, you can see that the
              Visual ID field holds the ID of the new trigger table visual.
            In this example, it is 2148.


Under Trigger, select one of the options:


Threshold met: triggers an email when the first measure of
              the first row in the trigger visual satisfies the conditional expression
Value changed since last assessment: triggers an email when
              the change in the first measure of the first row after the last assessment satisfies
              the conditional expression



For the triggering Value, adjust the logical operand (one of
            <, >, ≤,
            ≥, or =) and the number.

In this example the expression ≥ 1000 is used.
You can add multiple trigger conditions by clicking the + ADD
              CONDITION button.
noteIf you set multiple conditions, all of them need to be true to trigger the
            job.


For Assess Trigger, select an existing schedule interval:


Hourly (default)
Daily
Every Weekday
Weekly
Monthly
Quarterly
or any existing custom schedule

You can also select Create New Schedule. This option is
            available to Admin users only.


The Send Email Limit gives you the option of sending only the
          first email in circumstances when a triggering event occurs multiple times within the
          specified time interval.

In this example, Once a day has been selected. This means that
            if the trigger satisfies the conditional expression, it may not be sent if an earlier
            one was sent in the preceding 24 hours.
The options are:
When trigger occurs (which does not suppress any emails)
Once a half hour (default)
Once an hour
Once a day
Once a week
Every 2 weeks
Once a month



Click SAVE.

The system notifies you that the trigger has been created successfully.
