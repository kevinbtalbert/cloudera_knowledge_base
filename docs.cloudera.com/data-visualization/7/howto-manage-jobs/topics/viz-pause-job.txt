Pausing jobs
Cloudera Data Visualization allows you to suspend scheduled jobs.

In the Scheduled Jobs interface, choose the job, and click the
          corresponding PAUSE button.

To pause more than one job, click the corresponding checkboxes, and then click
              PAUSE at the top of the interface. If you want to pause all
            jobs, click the checkbox on the right side of the list header first.



A notification that the job is paused appears briefly.
Note that the Status of the job changes to paused and the
              PAUSE button is replaced with
            RESUME.
