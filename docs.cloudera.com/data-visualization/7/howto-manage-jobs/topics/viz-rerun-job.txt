Rerunning jobs
Cloudera Data Visualization allows you to rerun previously defined jobs.

In the Jobs interface, select the jobs to rerun. To rerun all
          jobs, click the checkbox on the right side of the list header.

Near the top of the page, click Run Now.





A brief Success message appears, which lists the schedules
            of these jobs. Note that the schedules are distinct from the jobs themselves, and have a
            different ID.
Note that the Jobs Log refreshes to show the new status of the
            selected jobs, either as Running or
              Pending.
Pending jobs do not show Start Time or Total Run
              Time.


Alternatively, you can re-run jobs by clicking the RUN NOW
          button that corresponds to the job in the jobs list.
