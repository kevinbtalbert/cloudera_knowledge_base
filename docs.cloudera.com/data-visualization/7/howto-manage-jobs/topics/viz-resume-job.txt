Resuming paused jobs
Cloudera Data Visualization allows you to resume suspended scheduled jobs.

In the Scheduled Jobs interface, choose the job, and click the
          corresponding RESUME button.

To resume more than one job, click the corresponding checkboxes, and then click
              RESUME at the top of the interface. If you want to resume all
            jobs, click the checkbox on the right side of the list header first.



A notification that the job or jobs are resumed appears briefly.
Note that the Status of the job changes to active and the
              RESUME button is replaced with
            PAUSE.
