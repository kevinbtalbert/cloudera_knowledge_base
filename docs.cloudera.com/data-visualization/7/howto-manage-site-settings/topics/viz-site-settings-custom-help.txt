Help and Support
As an administrator, you can customize the default settings of the
      Help menu in Cloudera Data Visualization (CDV). You can edit or change
    the link for Documentation and Support directly on the CDV UI, or in the
      settings.py file.

Customizing Help on the UI
You can change the default settings of the Help menu in Cloudera
    Data Visualization. You can customize the links for Documentation and Support on the
      Site Settings interface.

In Site Settings > Help and Support, you can change the following:





You can change the Text to display for documentation link from
          the default Documentation to any other title, for example as Customer
            Documentation.

You can change the URL for documentation link from the default
            https://docs.cloudera.com/data-visualization/7/index.html
          to a different URL, such as http://books.mycompany.com.

You can set whether you want to show a webpage link or an email address for Support
          contact information.


You can change the Text to display for Support web page link
              option from the default Cloudera Support Hub and the URL for Support
                web page link from the default
                https://my.cloudera.com/support.html.
You can change the Email address for Support from the default
                support@cloudera.com to another email, such as
              support@mycompany.com.

note
You must save your changes and restart the CDV application for the changed site
              settings to take effect.





Customizing Help through configuration file
You can customize the Help menu on the main navigation bar by
    deleting default links provided by Cloudera Data Visualization, or by adding new
    links.

To customize the Help menu, modify the local configuration file, such
        as settings.py, and restart the server.
Components of the Help Menu
By default, the Help menu contains links to What's New in the
          current release, Documentation, Knowledge Base, YouTube Channel,
          Support Email, licensing status, and the current version of Cloudera
        Data Visualization. 
To modify this menu, you must change the corresponding settings from TRUE
        to FALSE.

              Visualization.

              parameter to FALSE:

HELP_MENU_LINKS
To add custom links that supplement the default Data Visualization help links, use the
                HELP_MENU_LINKS parameter and a list of links in the form of
                type:link, link:url_address, and
                  label:link_label.
You can also insert a divider between these custom links, in the form:
                  type:divider, 
HELP_MENU_LINKS = [
  {
    "type": "link",
    "link": "url_address_1",
    "label": "link_label_1",
  }
  {
    "type": "link",
    "link": "url_address_2",
    "label": "link_label_2",
  }
  ...
  {
    "type": "divider",
  }

    "link": "url_address_n",
    "label": "link_label_n",
  }
