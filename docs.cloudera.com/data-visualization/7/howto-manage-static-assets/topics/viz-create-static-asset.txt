Creating new assets


To create a new asset, follow these steps.


Click the Gear icon on the main navigation bar to open the
            Administration menu.

Click Static Assets.






In the Manage Images, CSS, and JS Assets interface, click
            NEW ASSET.

In the New Asset interface, define the new assets:


Enter the Name of the asset.

In this example, company_logo is used.



Enter the Description of the asset.
In this example,  Cloudera Logo is used. 


Under File, click Choose File and use
              your system interface to add the file into the system.


After you add the file, Cloudera Data Visualization adds the correct information to
              the immutable fields File Type and
              Size.








Click SAVE.

The Asset information interface appears.


You can change the Name and Description
          of the asset, and even replace the file, using Change File. The
          asset also has its assigned ID.

The asset also has a clickable URL for viewing its contents.
            This is equivalent to the linked ID on the Manage
              Images, CSS, and JS Assets interface. Also, note the navigation path to
            the asset; in this case, it is:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/arc/reports/staticasset/raw/1.png
In general, the link has the following form:
[http|https]://ip_address/arc/reports/staticasset/raw/ID.file_extension
Where ID is the ID of the asset as it
            appears on the interface, and file_extension is one of the
            supported file formats: png, jpg,
            css, or js.
