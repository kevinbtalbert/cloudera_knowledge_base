Changing existing assets


To change an existing asset, follow these steps.


Click the Gear icon on the main navigation bar to open the
            Administration menu.

Click Static Assets.






In the Manage Images, CSS, and JS Assets interface, click the
            Pencil icon that corresponds to the asset.

The Asset information interface appears. It contains the
            information about the asset. 





In the Asset interface, you can perform the following
          actions:

Change the Name of the asset.
Change the Description of the asset.

Click URL to view the asset. This is equivalent to the linked
                ID on the Manage Images, CSS, and JS
                Assets interface. Also, note the navigation path to the asset; in our
              case, it is:
              http://127.0.0.1:8000/arc/reports/staticasset/raw/1.png
In general, the link has the following form:
[http|https]://ip_address/arc/reports/staticasset/raw/ID.file_extension
Where ID is the ID of the asset as it
              appears on the interface, and file_extension is one of the
              supported file formats: png, jpg,
                css, or js.

To substitute the file by a newer version, click Change
              File and use the file system to select and upload a replacement.
Click Save after making changes.
