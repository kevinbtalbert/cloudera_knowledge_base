Managing static assets
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to save and manage images (PNG and JPG format),
    CSS files, and JS files as Static Assets. You can subsequently use them across all reports to
    standardize the appearance and behavior of visuals and dashboards.

noteThis feature is only available to users with administrative privileges.
To use the Static Assets interface, follow these steps:


Click the Gear icon on the main navigation bar to open the
            Administration menu.

Click Static Assets.






In the Manage Images, CSS, and JS Assets interface, you have the
          following actions available:

Click NEW ASSET to create a new asset. For more
            information, see Creating new assets.
Click the ID number of a particular asset to view it. For
            more information, see Viewing an existing asset.
Click the Pencil icon to edit the information about a
            particular asset. For more information, see Changing existing
            assets.
Click the Trashcan icon to delete the asset. For more
            information, see Deleting an existing asset.



To use a static asset in a visual, such as Rich-Text visual type, follow the instructions
        in Inserting images.
