There are several options for adding a user to user groups when working in the
      New Group or Edit Group modal
    window.

Choose from the below options:


If you have a long list of groups in the Group Membership
              section, use the Search box to match group names, select groups
              from the sub-list, and then click ADD to move them to the right
              side of the modal window. Click SAVE.





In the Group Membership section, select the group to assign to
              the user and click ADD to move them to the right side of the
              modal window. Click SAVE.





To assign the user to all user groups, select All to get all
              the groups, and then click ADD to move them to the right side
              of the modal window. Click SAVE.





To move the user out of one or more groups, select the groups on the right side
              panel, and then click the Left Arrow. Click
                SAVE.
