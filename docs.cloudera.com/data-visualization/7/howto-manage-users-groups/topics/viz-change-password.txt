Changing user passwords
An administrator may reset the password of any user or of another administrator in
    Cloudera Data Visualization (CDV).
You must have administrative privileges to perform this
      action.

noteThe ‘change password’ option is not available for LDAP and SAML user accounts.
The following steps demonstrate how to change the password for any CDV user account.


Click the Gear icon on the main navigation bar to open the
            Administration menu.

Click Users & Groups.




The Manage Users & Groups  interface appears, open on the
              Users tab.


In the list of registered users, do one of the following:

Click the Username of the account you want to
            change.
Click the Pencil/Edit icon that corresponds to the account
            you want to change.


The Edit User modal window appears.


In the Edit User modal window, click Change
            password.






Enter the new password.

Consider the following when choosing the password:
Ensure that the password meets the minimum security requirements specified for the
                CDV instance. For more information, see Setting user password
                  requirements.
After five failed login attempts, CDV locks out the user. For instructions on how
                to change the account lockout configuration settings or to unlock the user, see
                  Configuring account lockout.

You can check the password you have added if you check the Show
              Password option.





Click SAVE.


The user's password is changed and you get back to the Manage Users &
          Groups interface.
