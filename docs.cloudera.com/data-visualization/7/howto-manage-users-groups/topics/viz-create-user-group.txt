Creating new user groups
You can create new user groups in Cloudera Data Visualiation (CDV).
You must have administrative privileges to perform this
      action.

The following steps demonstrate how to create a new user group.


Click the Gear icon on the main navigation bar to open the
            Administration menu.

Click Users & Groups.




The Manage Users & Groups  interface appears, open on the
              Users tab.


Click New Group.




The New Group modal window appears.


In the New Group modal window:


Enter Group Name.
[Optional] Under Members on the Users
              tab, use the Search box to find users, and assign the new user
              to existing groups by selecting user groups on the left list, and then clicking
                ADD to move them to the right.






Click SAVE.

After the operation succeeds, you can check the
        Users interface and find that the group assignment applies to the
      users just assigned to the new group.
