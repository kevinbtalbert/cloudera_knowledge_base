You can change the profile of any user or administrator account in Cloudera Data
    Visualization (CDV).
You must have administrative privileges to perform this
      action.

The following steps demonstrate how to change the username and permissions for a CDV user
        account. The process is the same for changing the administrative account.


Click the Gear icon on the main navigation bar to open the
            Administration menu.

Click Users & Groups.




The Manage Users & Groups  interface appears, open on the
              Users tab.


In the list of registered users, do one of the following:

Click the Username of the user that you want to
            edit.
Click the Pencil icon next to the account that you want to
            edit.

The Edit User modal window appears.

You can change the following details:


Name & password

Username


First Name and Last Name


Password


Permissions

Normal user and Admin user

Group Membership
Roles

Active or Inactive






Click SAVE.

After the operation succeeds, you can see the Manage
        Users & Groups page, showing the Users tab with the
      updated information.
