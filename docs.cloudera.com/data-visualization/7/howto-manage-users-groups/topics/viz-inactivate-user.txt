Inactivating user accounts
If it is necessary, you can inactivate a user's account without removing it from the
        system in Cloudera Data Visualization (CDV).
You must have administrative privileges to perform this
            action.

The following steps demonstrate how to inactivate a CDV user account.


Click the Gear icon on the main navigation bar to open
                    the Administration menu.

Click Users & Groups.
The Manage Users & Groups  interface appears, open
                    on the Users tab.

In the list of Users, click either the
                        Username of the account you want to inactivate, or
                    the Edit (Pencil) icon.

In the Edit User modal window, select
                        Inactive.

Click SAVE.




After the operation succeeds, you can see the
                Users list on the screen. The inactiveated user is part of
            the list, and the status shown is set to inactive.
