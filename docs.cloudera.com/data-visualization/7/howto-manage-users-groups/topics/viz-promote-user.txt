Promoting a user to administrator
You can promote any user to an administrator in Cloudera Data
    Visualization.
You must have administrative privileges to perform this
      action.

To promote the user to administrator, open the user account in Edit mode and
          change the Permissions by selecting Admin
            user.






To demote an administrator to plain user, select Normal User
          under Permissions.
