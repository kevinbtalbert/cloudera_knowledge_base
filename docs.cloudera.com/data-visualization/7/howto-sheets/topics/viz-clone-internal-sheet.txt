In CDP Data Visualization, you can clone sheets within a dashboard.
Open the dashboard in Edit mode.Select the sheet you want to clone by clicking on its tab, at the bottom left
          corner of the interface.In this example, the sheet Low GDP is chosen.
Click the (up arrow) icon next to the title of the
                    sheet, and choose the Clone option.




Data Vizualization creates a clone of the sheet, and places it on the extreme
                        right.





Rename the sheet, and click SAVE to save the all changes
                    to the dashboard.
