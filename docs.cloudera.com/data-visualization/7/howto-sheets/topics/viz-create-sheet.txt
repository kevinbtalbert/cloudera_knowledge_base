Creating a new sheet
CDP Data Visualization enables you to create new sheets within a dashboard.
Open a dashboard of your choice in Edit mode.By default, each dashboard contains a single sheet. If you create a new dashboard for this
          exercise, its single sheet already contains a default table visual based on the initial
            dataset.noteYou must save the dashboard before adding a new
            sheet.At the bottom left corner of the interface, click the (plus)
          icon next to the existing sheet title.



Data Visualization creates a new blank sheet, titled Sheet 2. The sheet title is
            highlighted, so you can immediately change its name to something more descriptive.

Change the name of the sheet. In this example, Sheet 2 is renamed to High
            GDP.






Click SAVE to save the all changes to the dashboard.

Start building out the new sheet by adding filters and
      visuals.
