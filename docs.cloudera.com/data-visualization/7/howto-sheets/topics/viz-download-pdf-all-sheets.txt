Downloading all sheets as a PDF File
CDP Data Visualization (CDV) enables you to download the entire dashboard as a PDF file
    with each sheet on a separate page.

note

This feature is available only when thumbnails are enabled .
For snapshots of custom JS visuals, we support only ECMA Script 5 for Javascript.


In the following example, you can see how to download Sheet 1 and
          Sheet 2 of the dashboard on separate pages.

Before you download the dashboard as a PDF file, make sure that
      the Enable "Download as Image/PDF" option is enabled. You can find it
      in Site Administration > Site Settings > Snapshots.

Open any dashboard. In this example,  the PDF Export dashboard that has two
          sheets is used.





Click the (ellipsis) icon at the top left corner of the
          interface.
Select Download as... > PDF > One sheet per page.
A Generating the requested file
            screenshot message appears.

After the download is complete, open the default download folder on your computer. CDP
          Data Visualization saves the current sheet to a PDF file.

In this example, the generated filename, PDF Export_20190205142719,
            has the following components:

PDF ExportSame name as the dashboard
20190205
Signifies the date the file is created, in YYYYMMDD format
              
142719
Signifies the time the file is created, in hhmmss format 

noteData Visualization renames sheets with names that contain characters not supported
            by the file system. For example, for the sheet PDF/Export, it generates the file
            as PDF Export_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.pdf, replacing the forward-slash (ASCII
            #47) character with a space.



The filename is the same as the name of the dashboard, and it has a timestamp
            specifying the date and time when the file is created. Each sheet of the dashboard is on
            a separate page.
