Downloading current sheet as a PDF file
CDP Data Visualization (CDV) enables you to download the current sheet of a dashboard
    as a PDF file with all visuals in the current sheet on one page.

note

This feature is available only when thumbnails are enabled .
For snapshots of custom JS visuals, we support only ECMA Script 5 for Javascript.
For filtered visuals, the filter must have app scope.



Before you download the dashboard as a PDF file, make sure that
      the Enable "Download as Image/PDF" option is enabled. You can find it
      in Site Administration > Site Settings > Snapshots.

Open any dashboard.
Click the (ellipsis) icon at the top left corner of the
          interface.
Select Download as... > PDF > Current Sheet.




A Generating the requested file message appears.


After the download is complete, open the default download folder on your computer. Data
          Visualization saves the current sheet to a PDF file.

In this example, the generated filename, PDF Export_20190205135933,
            has the following components:

PDF ExportSame name as the dashboard
20190205
Signifies the date the file is created, in YYYYMMDD format
              
135933
Signifies the time the file is created, in hhmmss format 

noteCDP Data Visualization renames sheets with names that contain characters not
            supported by the file system. For example, for the sheet PDF/Export, it generates
            the file as PDF Export_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.pdf, replacing the forward-slash
            (ASCII #47) character with a space.



The filename is the same as the name of the dashboard, and it has a timestamp
            specifying the date and time when the file is created.

Optional: 
All visuals in the current sheet (Sheet 1) are on one page.
          Repeat the preceding steps to download Sheet 2.
