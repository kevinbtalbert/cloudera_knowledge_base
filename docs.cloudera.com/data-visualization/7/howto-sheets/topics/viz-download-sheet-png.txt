Downloading dashboard sheets as PNG files
CDP Data Visualization (CDV) enables you to save the current sheet of a dashboard as a
    PNG file. The filename is the same as the name of the dashboard, and it has a timestamp
    specifying the date and time when the file is created.
This method is better than using a desktop tool because it
      handles images that are too long or wide to fit the screen.note

This feature is available only when thumbnails are enabled.
For snapshots of custom JS visuals, CDV supports only ECMA Script 5 for
            Javascript.
CDV does not support PNG download on the Windows platform.



In the Dashboard Designer top menu bar, click the
            (ellipsis) icon.
Click Download as..., and select Image
            (png) from the secondary menu.



A Generating the requested file message appears.

After the download is complete, open the default download folder on your
          computer.

Data Visualization saves the current sheet to a PNG file.
In our example, the generated filename, Example close_open
              issue_20190207094420, has the following components:

Example close_open issueSame name as the dashboard
20190207
Signifies the date the file is created, in YYYYMMDD format
              
094420
Signifies the time the file is created, in hhmmss format 

noteData Visualization renames sheets with names that contain characters not supported
            by the file system. For example, for the sheet Example close/open issue, it
            generates the file as Example close_open issue_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.pdf,
            replacing the forward-slash (ASCII #47) character with a space.
