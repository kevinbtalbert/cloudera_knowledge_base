    them immediately, schedule them at specific times and intervals, or through a triggered response
    when reaching a specific monitored threshold.

      site settings. For instructions, see Email settings.Complete these
        prerequisites in your system configuration:Enable screenshot and thumbnail downloads. For instructions, see
            Snapshots.Enable email functionality. For instructions, see Email
          settings.Enable scheduled jobs. For instructions, see Enabling scheduled
            jobs.noteThis setting is only available for users with administrative
        privileges.

Select the sheet you want to share in email by clicking on its tab at the bottom left
          corner of the Dashboard Designer interface.

In the top menu bar, click the (ellipsis) icon  to open the
            supplemental menu, and select Email.




The Email Current Sheet modal window appears.
