Adding filters to a visual
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to add filters to a visual if the visual has a
      Filters shelf available.

Open a visual of your choice in Edit mode.
In this example, a visual called Deficiency date correlation overview is
          used.

Populate the Filters shelf from the available fields
            (Dimensions, Measures) in the
            DATA menu.

In this example, the country field is added to the filter shelf. A modal window
            pops up where you can set the values you want to filter for. You can choose discrete
            values, ranges, patterns, or  use the Select All option for a
            bulk selection of the shown filter values.



You can also create your own custom filter expressions by using the
              Expression tab. In this example, the deficiency_code
            field is added to the filter shelf with a custom filter expression.



You can use the filter with its default settings, or you can open the
              Settings menu from the side menu bar to configure your
            filter.
