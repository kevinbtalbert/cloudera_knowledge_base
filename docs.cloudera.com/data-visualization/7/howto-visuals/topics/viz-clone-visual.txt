Cloning a visualCloudera DocsCloning a visual
In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can create a new visual that is a clone of an
    existing visual.
The following steps demonstrate how to clone an existing
      visual.
In the Dashboard Designer, click the
            (ellipsis) icon at the top of the interface, and select
            Clone.




You should briefly see a green success notification. The main area of the screen now
            has a new visual titled Clone of...[Source Visual].
The SAVE button is not highlighted, because the process adds a
            cloned, unlinked version of the visual to the bottom of the dashboard. This cloned
            visual includes any setting or shelf changes you made before clicking
              Clone.
After working on the visual, you can rename and save it.
