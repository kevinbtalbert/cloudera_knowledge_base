Configuring a cross tabulation visual for expansion
Follow these steps to enable expansion for a Cross Tabulation visual.

This example shows how to enable expansion on the year and
                    state fields.


Start a new Cross Tabulation visual based on the US State Populations Over
                        Time dataset.
For instructions, see Creating a visual.

Populate the shelves from the available Fields
                        (Dimensions, Measures) in the
                        DATA menu.


Add year and state to the
                                Row shelf.


Add population to the Measures
                            shelf. Ensure that the default aggregation is
                                sum(population).


Add year to the Filters shelf,
                            set it to 1990 and 2000, and click
                                APPLY. 


Add state to the Filters shelf,
                            select values AK, AL, AR, and AZ, then click
                                APPLY.



Click REFRESH VISUAL.

When the Cross Tabulation visual appears, it does not have subtotals and the
                        combined total in the rows and columns.





On the Row shelf, click year.

In the FIELD PROPERTIES menu, click Enable
                        Expansion.

A green tick appears to the left of the option and a green dot appears to the
                        right of the option.





Click state on the Row shelf and enable
                    expansion on that field.

Click REFRESH VISUAL to see the changes.

The visual appears with a + icon in the year
                        and state columns. This indicates that you can expand the data.
The sum(population) column shows the combined population for both
                        years.
