Deleting a visual
CDP Data Visualization enables you to delete an unlinked visual.

These instructions show you how you can delete a  visual in CDP Data Visualization. When
        you remove an unlinked visual from the dashboard, you should use the 'delete...' menu
        option. After deletion, the visual no longer exists in the system. 
When you remove a linked visual from a dashboard, you should use the 'remove...'
        menu option. After removal, the visual is still available in CDP Data Visualization and you
        can add it to other dashboards. For more information, see Removing a
        visual.

In Visual Designer, click the  (ellipsis) icon at the top of the
          interface.
Select  Delete Visual.
