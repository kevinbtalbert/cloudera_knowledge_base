Displaying subtotals and totals
You can expand and shrink the data rows, and display only subtotals and combined
        total in a Cross Tabulation visual.

Click the + icon in the year column. 




The visual expands the data to show subtotals of each year, and combined
                        total for both years.





Click the two + (plus) icons in the state
                    column.




The visual expands the data to show population in each state, and the
                        subtotals and combined population for both years. The subtotals and combined
                        total appear at the bottom of expanded rows. To move the subtotals and
                        totals over the rows, see Showing expansion totals above expansion
                            rows.






To disable subtotals and combined totals, make changes in the FIELD
                    PROPERTIES menu by de-selecting the Enable
                    Expansion option.
