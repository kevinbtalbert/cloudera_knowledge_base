Downloading visual data to CSV file
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to save the data used in visualizations as CSV
    files. The filename is the same as the name of the visual, and has a timestamp specifying the
    date and time when the file is created.

Before you begin to download a CSV file, you must first Enable CSV Download.
        The site administrator can override this setting in the Enable "Download as
          CSV/Excel" by default in the Site Settings interface.
        See Downloading maximum number of rows in CSV files. 

Open a visual in Edit mode, click the (ellipsis) icon at
          the top of the interface and select Download as... > CSV.




A Generating the requested file message appears. CDP Data
            Visualization saves the current sheet to a CSV file.


 After the download is complete, open the default download folder on your
          computer.

In this example, the generated file name (Table_Visual_20190207110756) has the
            following components:

Table_Visual

Same name as the dashboard

20190207

Shows the date the file is created, in YYYYMMDD format



110756

Shows the time the file is created, in hhmmss format


CDP Data Visualization renames sheets that have names with characters not supported by
            the file system. For example, for the sheet Table/Visual, it generates the file
            as Table_Visual_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.csv, replacing the forward-slash (ASCII
            #47) character with an underscore (ASCII #95) character.
