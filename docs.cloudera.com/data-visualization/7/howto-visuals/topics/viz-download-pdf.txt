Downloading a visual as PDF file
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to save a screenshot of a visual as a PDF
    file. The filename is the same as the name of the visual, and has a timestamp specifying the
    date and time when the file is created.

note

This feature is available only when thumbnails are enabled. See Enabling
              snapshots and thumbnails.
For snapshots of custom JS visuals, we support only ECMA Script 5 for Javascript.
CDP Data Visualization does not support PDF download on the Windows platform.



 Before you download the visual as a PDF file, navigate to the
        General menu, and select the Enable "Download as PDF" option.
Open a visual in Edit mode, click the (ellipsis) icon at
          the top of the interface and select Download as... > PDF.




A Generating the requested file message appears. CDP Data
            Visualization saves the current sheet to a PDF file.


 After the download is complete, open the default download folder on your
          computer.

In this example, the generated file name, PDF Export_20190207105249,
            has the following components:

PDF Export

Same name as the dashboard

20190207

Shows the date the file is created, in YYYYMMDD format

105249

Shows the time the file is created, in hhmmss format


CDP Data Visualization renames sheets that have names with characters not supported by
            the file system. For example, for the sheet Table/Visual, it generates the file
            as Table_Visual_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.pdf, replacing the forward-slash (ASCII
            #47) character with an underscore (ASCII #95) character.
