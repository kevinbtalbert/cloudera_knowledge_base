Downloading a visual as PNG fileCloudera DocsDownloading a visual as PNG file
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to save a screenshot of a visual as a PNG file.
    The filename is the same as the name of the dashboard, and has a timestamp specifying the date
    and time when the file is created.

Cloudera recommends this method rather than using a desktop tool, because it handles
        visuals that are very long or very wide, and do not fit on the screen.
note

This feature is available only when thumbnails are enabled. See Enabling
              snapshots and thumbnails.
For snapshots of custom JS visuals, we support only ECMA Script 5 for Javascript.
CDP Data Visualization does not support PNG download on the Windows platform.


The following steps demonstrate how to save a visual as a PNG file.

Open a visual in Edit mode, click the (ellipsis) icon at
          the top of the interface and select Download as... > Image (png).




A Generating the requested file message appears. CDP Data
            Visualization saves the current sheet to a PNG file.


After the download is complete, open the default download folder on your
          computer.

In this example, the generated filename (Table_Visual_20190207105500), has the
            following components:

Table_Visual

Same name as the dashboard

20190207

Shows the date the file is created, in YYYYMMDD format

105500

Shows the time the file is created, in hhmmss format


CDP Data Visualization renames sheets that have names with characters not supported by
            the file system. For example, for the sheet Table/Visual, it generates the file
            as Table_Visual_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.png, replacing the forward-slash (ASCII
            #47) character with an underscore (ASCII #95) character.
