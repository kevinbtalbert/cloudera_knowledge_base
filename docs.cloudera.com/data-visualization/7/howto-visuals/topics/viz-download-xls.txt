Downloading visual data to Excel fileCloudera DocsDownloading visual data to Excel file
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to save data in your visuals as an Excel file.
    The filename is the same as the name of the visual, and has a timestamp specifying the date and
    time when the file is created.

Excel download is available on all visuals. In the following example, we demonstrate how to
        download visual data to an Excel file. The resulting Excel worksheet also contains a
        separate sheet showing parameter definitions.
The example uses a table visual with two filters. Year in 1900, 1901 and country in
          Afghanistan and Albania. To show totals in the visual, enable Showing column
          totals.





Before you begin to download a CSV file, you must Enable CSV Download. `The
        site administrator can override this setting in the Enable "Download as
          CSV/Excel" by default in the Site Settings interface.
        See Downloading maximum number of rows in CSV files. 

Open a visual in Edit mode, click the (ellipsis) icon at
          the top of the interface and select Download as... > Excel.




A Generating the requested file message appears. CDP Data
            Visualization saves the current sheet to an Excel file.


After the download is complete, open the default download folder on your
          computer.
In this example, the generated file name (Population by Country_20190207113450) has
            the following components:
Population by Country

Same name as the visual

20190207

Shows the date the file is created, in YYYYMMDD format

113450

Shows the time the file is created, in hhmmss format

Totals appear in the table only if you enable totals, as described in Showing
            column totals.



Click the Params sheet in the Excel file to see the two
          parameters that were defined earlier to create the visual.
