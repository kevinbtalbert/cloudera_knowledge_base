Emailing a visual
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to share visuals in an email. You can send them
    immediately, schedule them at specific times and intervals, or through a triggered response when
    reaching a specific monitored threshold.

Before using the email function, you must enable the feature in site settings. For
        instructions, see Email settings.
Complete these prerequisites in your system configuration:
Enable screenshot and thumbnail downloads. For instructions, see
            Snapshots.Enable email functionality. For instructions, see Email
          settings.Enable scheduled jobs. For instructions, see Enabling scheduled
            jobs.
noteThis setting is only available for users with administrative
        privileges.

Find the visual you want to send in an email and open it in Edit or in
            View mode.

Click the (ellipsis) icon to open the
            supplemental menu in the top right corner of the visual, and
          select Email from the drop-down.


The Email Visual modal window appears.

Choose one of the three options for sending email:

1. Email now – For instructions on providing email details, see
              Immediate email.
2. Schedule Email – For instructions on providing email details,
            see Schedule-based email.
3. Email based on threshold – For instructions on providing
            email details, see Threshold-based email.




Optional: 
After creating emails, you can monitor them in the Jobs interface, review their
          details, rerun, cancel, and so on.
For more information, see Managing jobs.
