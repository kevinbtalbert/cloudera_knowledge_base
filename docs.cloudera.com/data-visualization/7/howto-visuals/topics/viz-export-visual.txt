Exporting a visual
In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can export selected visuals. The export process
    captures all the dependencies, such as datasets and custom styles.

To export a visual, follow these steps.

In the top menu bar of the Dashboard Designer interface, click
          the (ellipsis) icon for the Supplemental
            menu.
Select Export.




The Export Visual Artifacts modal window appears. It contains a
            default Filename of
                visuals_random_number. It also contains
            object information about the visual to be exported.



Optional: 
 You can change the name of the file.

Click EXPORT.

This starts the download of the export file to your default download folder. You can
            confirm the success of the export by locating the file in your system.
