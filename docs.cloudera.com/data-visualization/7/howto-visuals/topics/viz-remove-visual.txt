Removing a visual
CDP Data Visualization enables you to remove a linked visual from a dahsboard in case
    you do not need it any more.

These instructions show you how you can remove a linked visual from a dashboard. When you
        remove a linked visual from the dashboard, you should use the 'remove...' menu
        option. After removal, the visual is still available in CDP Data Visualization and you can
        add it to other dashboards.
When you remove an unlinked visual from the dashboard, you should use the
        'delete...'  menu option. After deletion, the visual no longer exists in the system. For
        more information, see Deleting visuals.

Open the dashboard in Edit mode in the Dashboard
          Designer.

Click the (ellipsis) icon at the top right corner of the linked
          visual.

Select  Remove from Dashboard.
