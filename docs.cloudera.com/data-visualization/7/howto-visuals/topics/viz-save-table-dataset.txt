Saving a table as a dataset based on the queryCloudera DocsSaving a table as a dataset based on the query
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to save a query result as its own dataset. This
    is helpful when working with subsets of data, sections, or building datasets with
    self-joins.
You have a Table visual that you want to save as a
      dataset.
Add the necessary fields on the table shelves, and apply functions, for example sort,
          order, alias, or filters.

 In the Create a materialized table or logical view modal
          window, fill out these fields:


Enter the Name of the new table. In this example,
                SnP is used.


Choose Dataset directly from query for
                Type.


Under Create in database, choose an existing database where
              you want to save the table.


When creating a dataset as part of this operation, select the Create a
                new dataset based on new table/view option, and enter the
                Dataset name.


Click CREATE.






 A success confirmation modal appears, with a link to the new default visual on the new
            dataset.





 Click the link to open a new default visual on the new dataset, in Edit
          mode.
