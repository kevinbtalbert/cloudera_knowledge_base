Saving tables
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to save tabular data as its own table, and
        writes it back to the database. It also enables you to produce a dataset based on data
        exposed in a visual, which may be used for self-referenced application stacking.
This feature is available only when: 
Examining data in either table or query visuals
Using Impala connections
User has Data Import/Load privileges
