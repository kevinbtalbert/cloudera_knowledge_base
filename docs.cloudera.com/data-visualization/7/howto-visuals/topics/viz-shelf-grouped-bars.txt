Overview of shelves for CDP Data Visualization Grouped Bars visuals.
A Grouped Bars visual has the following shelves:

X Axis
This is conceptually the X axis. Use a Dimension for horizontal bars or a
              Measure for vertical bars.
When using multiple fields, the last field defines the axis, while the
            preceding fields trellis the graph in columns.
Y Axis

This is conceptually the Y axis. Use a Measure for horizontal
            bars or a Dimension for vertical bars.
When using multiple fields, the last field defines the axis, while the
            preceding fields trellis the graph in rows.

Colors

To stack bars by category, add a Dimension field to this shelf.
This shelf displays only one field on the graph. Additional fields appear only in the
            Tooltip.

Tooltips

Add Measure fields from the DATA menu for
            additional information in the graph's Tooltip.
This shelf accepts multiple fields.

Drill

Add Dimension fields from the DATA menu to
            this shelf.
When Drill Into context menu is enabled but no fields are
            specified, you can drill into any dimension. Specifying the fields on this shelf limits
            drilling to these dimensions.
This shelf accepts multiple fields.

Labels

Additional data labeling.
This shelf accepts at most one field. 

Filters

Add Dimension or Measure fields from the Data
            menu to include or exclude categorical or value criteria.
This shelf accepts multiple fields.
