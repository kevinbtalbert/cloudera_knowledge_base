Overview of shelves for CDP Data Visualization Interactive Map visuals.
An Interactive Map visual has the following shelves:

Geo
Add a Geo-type field from the DATA menu to determine the location on the
            map. 
This visual supports zipcode or latitude/longitude Geo types . If
            the field is not automatically recognized as a qualified Geo type, select
              Change Type from the FIELD PROPERTIES
            menu.
This shelf accepts multiple fields, but plots a map with the highest possible
            resolution.
This is a mandatory shelf.
Measure

Add a Measure field from the DATA menu to
            compute heatmap intensity across locations, values of cluster aggregations, and the size
            of circle markers.
This shelf accepts a single field, or uses the value of 1 if no measurement is
            specified.

Colors

Add a Dimension or Measure field from the
              DATA menu to specify the color of the circle markers, or
            distinct routes by common identifier. 
This shelf accepts a single field, and uses both numeric and non-numeric values. 

Tooltips

Add Measure fields from the DATA menu for
            additional information in the visual's Tooltip.
This shelf accepts multiple fields.

Filters

Add Dimension or Measure fields from the
              DATA menu to include or exclude categorical or value
            criteria.
This shelf accepts multiple fields.
