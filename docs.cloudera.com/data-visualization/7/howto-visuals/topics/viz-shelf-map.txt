Overview of shelves for CDP Data Visualization Map visuals.
A Map visual has the following shelves:

Geo
Add a Geo-type field from the DATA menu to determine the location on the
            map. 
Geo types include country, state, county, DMA,
              zipcode or postal code, or latitude and longitude. If the
            field is not automatically recognized as a qualified Geo type, select Change
              Type from the FIELD PROPERTIES menu.
This shelf accepts multiple fields, but plots a map with the highest possible
            resolution.
This is mandatory shelf.
