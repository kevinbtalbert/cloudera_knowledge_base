Shelves for row listing visualsCloudera DocsShelves for row listing visuals
CDP Data Visualization Row Listing visuals have the following shelves.
Dimensions
This shelf is required and it accepts multiple fields.
You can add a dimension field from the DATA menu to
        display a specific dimension value. The visual displays all the added dimensions. If several
        fields are added, the visual displays the first value in the dimension as the main
        indicator. If you want to display a dimension sorted by another dimension, place a second
        dimension on the shelf and sort by it.

Measures
This shelf is optional and it accepts multiple fields.
You can add a measure field from the DATA menu to display
        an aggregate.
The measure shelf either provides the main indicator, or it can be used for sorting. To
        display a measure value sorted by a dimension (or a dimension sorted by a measure), place
        the fields on the matching shelves, and sort according to your business case.

Tooltips
This shelf is optional and it accepts multiple fields.
You can add measure fields from the DATA menu to provide
        additional information in the visualâ€™s tooltip.

Filters
This shelf is optional and it accepts multiple fields.
You can add dimension or measure fields from the DATA menu
        to include or exclude categorical or value criteria.
