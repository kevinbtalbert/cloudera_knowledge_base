Overview of shelves for CDP Data Visualization Scatter visuals.
A Scatter visual has the following shelves:

X Axis

This is conceptually the X axis. Use a Dimensions field from the
              DATA menu to plot the scatter horizontally, or a
              Measures field to plot the scatter vertically.
When using multiple fields, the last field defines the axis, while the
            preceding fields trellis the graph in columns.

Y Axis

This is conceptually the Y axis. Use a Measures field from the
              DATA menu to plot the scatter horizontally, or a
              Dimensions field to plot the scatter vertically.
When using multiple fields, the last field defines the axis, while the
            preceding fields trellis the graph in rows.

Colors

To visually differentiate bubbles by category, add a Dimensions
            field to this shelf.
This shelf accepts at most one field.

Size

Add a Measures field from the DATA menu
            to show an additional measurement as a relative size of the bubbles on the scatter
            graph. 
This shelf accepts a single field.

Transition

Add Dimensions or Measures fields from
            the DATA menu to animate the graph based on the sequence defined
            by this field.
A good example would be time fields, such as timestamp, day, month, and so on. Cloudera
            recommends that you apply a sequential sort to ensure a natural transition.
This shelf accepts a single field.

Tooltips

Add Measures fields from the DATA menu
            for additional information in the visual's tooltip.
This shelf accepts multiple fields.

Filters

Add Dimensions or Measures fields from
            the DATA menu to include or exclude categorical or value
            criteria.
This shelf accepts multiple fields.
