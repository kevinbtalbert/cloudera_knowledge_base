Overview of shelves for CDP Data Visualization Sparklines visuals.
A Sparklines visual has the following shelves:

X Axis
This is conceptually the X axis. Use a Dimension for a
            horizontally-oriented plot or a Measure for a vertically-oriented
            plot.
When using multiple fields, the last field defines the axis, while the preceding
            fields trellis the graph in columns.
Y Axis

This is conceptually the Y axis. Use a Measure for a
            horizontally-oriented plot or a Dimension for a
            vertically-oriented plot.
When using multiple fields, the last field defines the axis, while the preceding
            fields trellis the graph in rows.

Filters

Add Dimension or Measure fields from the
              DATA menu to include or exclude categorical or value
            criteria.
This shelf accepts multiple fields.
