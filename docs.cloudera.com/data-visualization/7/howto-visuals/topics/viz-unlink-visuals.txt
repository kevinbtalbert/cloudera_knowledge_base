Unlinking visualsCloudera DocsUnlinking visuals
In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can unlink linked visual to break the sharing
    across dashboards.

The following steps demonstrate how to unlink a visual.

In the Dashboard Desginer interface, hover over the visual until
          its control widgets appear.

Click the (ellipsis) icon at the top of the visual to open the
          supplemental menu.

Select Unlink.






Confirm the operation by clicking UNLINK.

When a visual appears in multiple dashboards, it cannot be unlinked. You can clone it
            instead. Confirm the operation by clicking CLONE.
After you unlinked the visual by cloning it, it no longer has a linked designation. it
            is completely independent of the original visual, and its title is Clone of
              â€¦[Original Name]. 

Optional: 
You can change the title of the visual to the original title, or use something
          different.

At the top left corner of the Dashboard Designer, click
             SAVE.

The visual no longer has the small icon in the lower right
      corner showing the linked designation.
