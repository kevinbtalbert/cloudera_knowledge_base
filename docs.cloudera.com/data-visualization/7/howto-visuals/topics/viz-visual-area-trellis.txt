Using the trellis option with areasCloudera DocsUsing the trellis option with areas
In Areas visuals, CDP Data Visualization enables you to create Trellis charts that
        show different partitions (segments) of the dataset alongside one other.
Create the World Population - Area visual as
            described in Areas.

This example uses the visual World Population - Area from Areas
                to create trellis charts.
The following steps demonstrate how to create a new trellised Area visual on the
                    World Life Expectancy dataset.

Open the World Population - Area visual in Edit mode.

Clone the visual as described in Cloning a visual.

Under Dimensions, select un_region and
                    drag it to the X shelf. If it is not the first
                    (left-most) field on the shelf, drag it to the left of the field
                        Year.

The first element on the shelf controls the category of the trellis.




On the Filters shelf, clear any existing settings.
Click REFRESH VISUAL.

The new trellised area chart appears.





Click the (pencil) icon next to the title of the visual
                    to edit it, and change the title to World Population - Area
                        Trellis.

At the top left corner of the Dashboard Designer, click
                        SAVE.
