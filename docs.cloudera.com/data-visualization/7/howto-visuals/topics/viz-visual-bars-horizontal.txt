Horizontal barsCloudera DocsHorizontal bars
In general, dimensions of the dataset represent categories that are placed on the
    horizontal axis (and therefore the X shelf). The result set is rendered as a vertical bar chart.
    If your business requirements include the use of a horizontal bar chart, Clouodera Data
    Visualization makes it very easy to switch from an existing vertical bar chart to a horizontal
    one.

This example uses the visual previously created in Bars. Clone it, and make the
        changes to the duplicate visual.
To use this visual to create a horizontal bar chart, follow these steps.

Click the (switch) icon between the X
            Axis and Y Axis shelves.






 Click REFRESH VISUAL.

The graph has changed, with country categories on the Y axis and horizontal bars.




Rename the visual.
At the top left corner of the Dashboard Designer, click
            SAVE.
