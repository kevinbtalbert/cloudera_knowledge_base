In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can use the Labels shelf to display the measurement
    value. This way you can improve the comparison of relative measures on Bar visuals.

This example uses the visual previously created in Stacked bars. Clone it and make
        the changes to the duplicate visual.
To add labels to bar charts, follow these steps.
Click inside the Labels shelf.
 In the DATA menu, select the field for the label.

This example uses the population field.

Optional: 
Set the Filter shelf to hold the following fields:


year in (2010)
un_subregion in ('Eastern Europe')


Optional: 
Increase the width of the bars as described in Bar size range.

Your shelf setup should look something like the following:





Click REFRESH VISUAL.

The visual changed. You can see the relative size of total populations for the UN
            Subregion on one bar, and read off the value.




Rename the visual.
At the top left corner of the Dashboard Designer, click
             SAVE.
