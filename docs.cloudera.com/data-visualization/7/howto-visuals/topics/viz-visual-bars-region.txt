Filtering 2: bar chart by regionCloudera DocsFiltering 2: bar chart by region
When working with a very large set of data, it is necessary to quickly access and
    examine a specific subset of information. Cloudera Data Visualization gives you the ability to
    filter information on all fields of the dataset.

This example shows how to use such a filter to limit the result set and visualization to a
        particular geographic region. It uses the visual previously created in Bars. Clone it
        and make the changes to the duplicate visual.
To use this visual to see a bar chart for a region, such as Oceania, follow these
        steps:

Add the field un-region to the Filters shelf,
          and set its value to Oceania.


Click the field on the shelf of the visual to open the FIELD
                PROPERTIES menu.


Click Select values.







In the Filter for un_region modal window, select
                Oceania and click APPLY.








Click REFRESH VISUAL.
The Bars visual changed to show only the countries in the Oceania UN Region.



Remove un_region from the Colors shelf, and
          replace it with the country field.

Click REFRESH VISUAL.





Rename the visual.
At the top left corner of the Dashboard Designer, click
            SAVE.
