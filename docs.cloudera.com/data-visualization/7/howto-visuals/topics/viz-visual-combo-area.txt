CDP Data Visualization allows you to convert the line to a semi-transparent area in
      Combined Bar/Line (Combo) visuals for better representation of data.
The default set-up is a combination of a bar measurement and a line measurement. To convert
         the line to a semi-transparent area that allows you to see the bar chart too, use the
            VISUAL SETTINGS interface, as described in Converting line
            to area visual.
