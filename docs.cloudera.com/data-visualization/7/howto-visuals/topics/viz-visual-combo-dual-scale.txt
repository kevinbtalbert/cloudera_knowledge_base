Assigning a measure to a secondary axisCloudera DocsAssigning a measure to a secondary axis
Sometimes plotting two measures on the same axis does not show the bars because of
    their relative values, or because of their incompatible units of measurement. To be able to
    clearly see both a line and the bars in a Combined Bar/Line (Combo) visual, CDP Data
    Visualization enables you to specify a separate axis for each of the measures in the combined
    visual.
You have a already created a basic Combo visual based on the
        World Life Expectancy dataset.
Follow these steps to specify a different axis for each of the
      measures in your visual:
Assign the 'GDP per Capita' field to the secondary axis:


Click the field to open the FIELD PROPERTIES menu.


Select Axis > Secondary Axis.








Click REFRESH VISUAL.

Both the blue bars and the orange line are now clearly visible.
The graph lists Life Expectancy on the left-hand vertical axis, in the range of
            0 to 70, and the GDP per Capita on the right-hand vertical axis, in the range of
            0 to 14k.





Click the (pencil) icon next to the title of the visual to edit
          it, and change the title to 'World Population - Dual Bar and Line'.

At the top left corner of the Dashboard Designer, click
            SAVE.
