When performing granular data analysis in Cross Tabulation visuals, Cloudera Data
        Visualization enables you to display both subtotals and combined total. These summations
        operate on the dimensions in the Row shelf. When you enable expansion, you can expand rows
        to view details of some of the dimensions.
Check out the instructions below on how to enable expansion and display subtotals and
            totals in Cross Tabulation visuals.
For more information about enabling expansion totals, see Showing expansion totals
                above expansion rows.
