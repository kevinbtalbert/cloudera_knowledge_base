Setting up dynamic external links
You need to perform extra set-up steps if you want to create a visual with dynamic
        links.
To use a visual to see the Wikipedia page for a specific country, follow these
            steps:

Create a new application for the World Life Expectancy dataset.

Add the World Population - Bars Bars visual that you created in
                        Bars.

Add World Population - Country UTL as the title of the
                    application.

Add World Population  as the title of the active menu tab.

At the top left corner of the App Designer, click
                        SAVE.

In the application, click the Bars visual to open it in a new tab.

Click EDIT to open the visual in Edit mode.

Click the visual and select Modify click behavior.






 In the Pick an app modal window, under To
                        set this selection, pick an app below, select World
                        Life Expectancy. 






After the modal window changes, select World Population -
                        Composite.  






At the top left corner of the Dashboard Designer, click
                        SAVE.
Optional: 
While in Edit mode, ensure that the settings work:


Left-click the visual.


Select Test click behavior.



In the World Population - Composite app, when you
            click on the specific bars that represent a country, the Wikipedia page changes to match
            the country.
