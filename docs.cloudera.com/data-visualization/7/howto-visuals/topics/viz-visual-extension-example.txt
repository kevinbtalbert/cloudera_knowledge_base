In the following examples, the definitions for Print dashboard and

      action panel within the dashboard.
Print dashboard

        icon. You can use this button to print the dashboard in View mode.
<div id="extension-print-btn">
  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-primary" 
  onclick="window.print();return false;">
  <span class="fa fa-print"></span> Print</button>
</div>

Download dashboard as PDF

        an icon. You can use this button to save the dashboard in PDF format from View
        mode.

  <span class="fa fa-download"></span> Download PDF</button>
  <div class="image-dropdown-submenu"/>
