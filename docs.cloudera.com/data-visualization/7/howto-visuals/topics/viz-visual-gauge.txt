In CDP Data Visualization, Gauge visuals are powerful tools for communicating
    performance against set targets, projected trends, and a qualitative assessment of the
    measurement.

Gauges show minimum and maximum values on an evenly distributed scale, and qualitative
        ranges for classifying the primary measurement as different colors, which is very useful for
        visually distinguishing them from one another.
Gauges are semi-circular by default, and include many setting adjustments.
You can review the following three examples of gauge charts to see their structure:

Example 1: Measure < Projection < Compare To

In this scenario, both the measurement and its projected future value are less than
              the target value.




Example 2: Measure < Compare To < Projection

In this scenario, the measurement is less than the target value, but its projection
              is expected to exceed the target.




Example 3: Compare To < Measure < Projection

In this scenario, the measurement has already exceeded the target value, and the
              projection is even greater.






The long dark inner arc of the visual represents the value on the
            Measure shelf. It is the feature measurement of the visual. In
          Example 3, the last section appears in dark blue because the value of
            Measure is greater than the Compare To
          value.
The extension of the same arc is the expected value of the measure at a future date,
          supplied by the Projection shelf of the visual. The overlay of
          colors and their opacity leads to different effects depending on the relative values of
            Measure, Projection, and
            Compare To shelves: 
In Example 1, this appears in pale blue and does not terminate the arc. This is
              because the value on the  Projection shelf is less than the
                Compare To value. 
In Example 2, Projection appears in darker grey as extension
              beyond the lower Compare To value (in pale blue).
In Example 3, Projection again appears in darker grey, but
              this time as an extension beyond the darker blue arc that shows by how much the
                Measure exceeds the lower Compare To
              value.

The Compare To shelf shows the target value for the measurement.
          In these examples, it has a value of 800 for all gauges.
The secondary outer arc shows the Qualitative Ranges that form
          the upper limits of the 'goodness' for the current measurement. From the origin to the
          upper value, they specify relative levels of performance success. You may define anywhere
          from 0 to 4 qualitative ranges.
The Label shelf overrides default labeling taken from the
            Measure shelf. This is an opportunity to clarify what is being
          measured, as well as the units of measurement. This shelf accepts a maximum of two
          values.

Like other CDP Data Visualization visuals, the Gauge visual may be trellised using
          X and Y shelves, have additional fields on
        the Tooltips shelf, and use Filters. For more
        information, see Shelves for gauge visuals.
We are working with the District Performance dataset, built on a
        datafile that contains the California School District APIs from 2012 and 2013. The range of
        possible scores varies from a low of 200 to a high of 1000. However, the statewide API
        performance target is 800.


 Start a new visual based on dataset District Performance.

For more information, see Adding data, Creating datasets, and
              Creating a visual.


 In the visuals menu, find and click Gauge.   




The shelves of the visual changed. The Measures shelf is
            mandatory.





 Populate the shelves from the available fields (Dimensions,
            Measures) in the DATA menu. 


For the Measure shelf, add the field
              Api13.


Customize the expression to calculated the waited average of the field, based on
              the number of students tested in each district (field Valid).


Click the (right-arrow) icon to the left of the field,
                  and select the [ ] Enter/Edit Expression option.

In the Enter/Edit Expression modal window, change the
                    expression to the following formula:
floor(sum([Api13]*[Valid])/sum([Valid]))

Click VALIDATE & SAVE to ensure that everything
                  works.




For the Compare To shelf, add the field
                Api13.


Customize the expression to change it to the state-wide target of
                API=800.


Click the (right-arrow) icon to the left of the field,
                  and select the [ ] Enter/Edit Expression option.

In the Enter/Edit Expression modal window, change the
                    expression to the scalar value of 800.

Click VALIDATE & SAVE to ensure that everything
                  works.




For the Qualitative Ranges shelf, add the field
                Api13.


Specify the equation that returns the upper limit of the first qualitative range.
              For this visual, the example uses simple scalar values.


Click the (right-arrow) icon to the left of the field,
                  and select the [ ] Enter/Edit Expression option.

In the Enter/Edit Expression modal window, change the
                    expression to the scalar value of 600.

Click VALIDATE & SAVE to ensure that everything
                  works.



Optional: 
To create other ranges:


Click the (right-arrow) icon to the left of the field,
                  and select the Duplicate option.
Open the Enter/Edit Expression modal window for the
                  duplicate and change the value.
Click VALIDATE & SAVE.

In this example, we defined three ranges: at 600,
                  700. and 800, and we aliased the qualitative
                ranges as Poor, Improving, and
                  Satisfactory, in that order.
An alternative to specifying qualitative ranges through the shelf is to calculate
                them as percentages of the Compare To field. To do that,
                follow the instructions in.Specifying qualitative range as
                percentages.



For the Projection shelf, add the field
                Api13.


Specify the equation that projects the current measurement to some future date by
              clicking the (right-arrow) icon to the left of the field,
              selecting the [ ] Enter/Edit Expression option, and changing
              the expression to the following SQL clause: 

if(  sum([Api13]*[Valid])/sum([Valid])>800,
     sum([Api13]*[Valid])/sum([Valid])+25,
     sum([Api13]*[Valid])/sum([Valid]) + 50)



For the Label shelf, add the field Api13,
              and convert the expression to the following SQL clause:

concat("API: ", cast(floor(sum([Api13]*[Valid])/sum([Valid])) as string))
You can add the field Cname under the first field and change its
                aggregation to max([Cname]).



For the Tooltips shelf, add more fields here to provide
              additional information.

In this example, the following tooltips are used:

floor(sum([Api12]*[Valid])/sum([Valid]))
floor(sum([Api13]*[Valid])/sum([Valid])) -
                    floor(sum([Api12]*[Valid])/sum([Valid])) 
sum([Valid])

It is good practice to apply an alias to these fields. In this example, the
                following aliases are used: 2012 API Score, 2012 -> 2013
                  Growth, and Students.



For the Filters shelf, add the filters youo need.

In this example the following filters are used: Cname for name of
                the County, selecting the values Alameda, Kings, Marin,
                  Mendocino, Sierra, and Siskiyou.



For the Y shelf, add the field Cname
              (county name) to trellis the visual, and lias it as County.







Optional: 
Click the Settings menu, select Trellis,
          and de-select the Show trellis borders option.

Click the Settings menu, select Marks,
          and select the Include a gauge line option. For more information,
          see Displaying the gauge needle.
Optional: 
Click the Colors menu, and select different options for
            Foreground Color, Pointer Color, and
            Background Color from the color palette menu. You may change the
            Projection Opacity and Background Opacity
          options too. In this example, they haven't been changed.
Optional: 
Alias the fields. In this example, the names of the shelves are used for each
          alias.
