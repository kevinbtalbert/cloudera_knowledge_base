Grouped barsCloudera DocsGrouped bars
CDP Data Visualization, enables you to create Grouped Bar visuals. While bar charts
    show comparisons among categories, grouped bar charts show clustered groups of related
    measurements as bars.

The following steps demonstrate how to create a Grouped Bars visual representation of
        ethnic distribution of population in some US counties. The example is based on the US
          Counties dataset . For more information, see Adding data and
          Creating a dataset.
For an overview of shelves that specify this visual, see Shelves for grouped
          bars.

Start a new visual based on dataset US Counties.
For instructions, see Creating a visual.

In the VISUALS menu, find and click Grouped
            Bars.




The shelves of the visual changed.
The mandatory shelves are X Axis and Y
              Axis. The fields placed on these two shelves may be easily swapped by
            switching X and Y. Doing this produces a
            horizontal chart.





 Populate the shelves from the available fields (Dimensions,
            Measures) in the DATA menu. 


Under Dimensions, select the Ctyname field
              and drag it to the X Axis shelf.
At this point, it is recommended that you alias the field as County. For more
              information, see Alias.


 Select the Wa male field and drag it to the Y
                Axis shelf.
This first measurement provides the axis definition.


Add the other measurements to the Colors shelf.

Together with the measurement on the Y Axis, this creates
                the 'group' Cloudera Data Visualization uses to draw grouped bars.
For this example visual, add Ba Male, Ia Male,
                  Aa Male, Na Male, and Tom
                Male.



On the Y Axis shelf, click the field, and from the
                FIELD PROPERTIES menu, select [ ] Enter/Edit
                Expression.


In the Enter/Edit Expression modal window, edit the
              expression to the following:

sum([Wa Male]) + sum([Wa Female])
Click VALIDATE EXPRESSION, and then click
                  SAVE.






Repeat the change in the expression on all the fields placed on the color
              shelves.

sum([Ba Male]) + sum([Ba Female])
sum([Ai Male]) + sum([Ai Female])
sum([Aa Male]) + sum([Aa Female])
sum([Na Male]) + sum([Na Female])
sum([Tom Male]) + sum([Tom Female])



Alias the field on the Y Axis shelf as 'White', and
              alias the fields on the Colors shelf as 'Black or African
                American', 'American Indian and Alaska Native', 'Asian American',
                'Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander', and 'Two or More
              Races'.


Add the field Stname to the  Filters shelf
              and select the value 'Alaska'.








 Click REFRESH VISUAL.
