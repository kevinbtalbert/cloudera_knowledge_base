Specifying the bucket countCloudera DocsSpecifying the bucket count
The default number of histogram buckets is 10, but you can easily change
    this.

On the right side of Dashboard Designer, click
            Settings in the VISUALmenu.

In the Settings menu, click Basic.

 Under Basic, adjust the selector for the Bucket
            count option.







The following image contrasts the appearance of a histogram with 10 buckets and a histogram
        with 20 buckets. Notice that as the number of buckets doubles, the range of values covered
        by each bucket is reduced by half.
