Using the cumulative optionCloudera DocsUsing the cumulative option
By default, the histogram reports each bucket individually. The cumulative option adds
    each bucket's count or frequency to the running total, so that the right-most bucket reports the
    total count or 1 (100%), depending on whether the normalized histogram option is active. You can
    turn on the cumulative option on a histogram.

On the right side of Dashboard Designer, click
            Settings in the VISUAL menu.

In the Settings menu, click Basic.

 Under Basic, select the Cumulative
            histogram option.
