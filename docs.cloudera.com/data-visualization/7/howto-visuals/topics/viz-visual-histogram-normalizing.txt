Normalizing the histogramCloudera DocsNormalizing the histogram
The default vertical axis of a histogram represents the count of values that map to a
    particular bucket. To report the histogram as a percentage of a whole, the histogram count is
    normalized to add up to 1, and then the bars represent the proportionate frequency.

On the right side of Dashboard Designer, click
            Settings in the VISUALmenu.

In the Settings menu, click Basic.

 Under Basic, select the Normalized
            histogram option.







The following image shows the two versions of the histogram. You can see that the change
        appears in the vertical axis and the tooltip, where frequency is reported as a number of
        incidents on the upper graph, and as a percentage on the lower graph.
