Changing layer options for interactive maps
CDP Data Visualization enables you to make adjustments to all layers of an Interactive
    Map visual.

By default, interactive maps render with a simple heatmap and a cluster. However, CDP Data
        Visualization has several adjustments to all the layering options: Heatmap,
          Cluster, and Circles.
noteTo use this feature, an Admin user must specify,
        through the Site Settings interface, the API keys granted to your
        organization. This is described in Enabling API keys for interactive
        maps.
The following steps demonstrate how to make changes to layer specifications in interactive
        maps.

Clone the visual previously built in Interactive maps.
For instructions, see Cloning visuals.

In the Settings interface, select the appropriate option for
          making customizations to interactive visuals:


Heatmap
Cluster
Circles



Make the necessary changes, and click REFRESH VISUAL.

Change the title of the visual, and SAVE it.
