Interactive map with multiple dimensions
CDP Data Visualization enables you to display multiple dimensions in Interactive Map
    visuals.

In Interactive Map visuals you can display two distinct dimensions in the Circle
          Layer by placing the secondary dimension on the Colors shelf.
        The following steps extend the work completed in Interactive maps, and
        demonstrate how to visualize two separate measures on the same map.
noteTo use this feature, an Admin user must specify, through the Site
          Settings interface, the API keys granted to your organization. This is
        described in Enabling API keys for interactive maps.

Clone the visual California Woods, previously built in Interactive
            maps.

For instructions on how to clone visuals, see Cloning a visual.


 Select another dimension to add to the visual, and add it to the
            Colors shelf.
In this example, feature_class is selected, and the
            Alias
Features is applied.

Change the definition of the feature_class filter (already on the
             Filters shelf) to add the Reserve and Woods
          values.

In the Settings menu, turn off the Heatmap and the
            Cluster.

In the Settings menu, enable the Circles, and turn on
          both the Area legend and the Color legend.

Click REFRESH VISUAL to see two measures on the same map.






Click the pencil/edit icon next to the title of the
          visualization to enter a name for the visual.

In this example, the title is changed to 'California Woods - Mapbox'. You can also add
            a brief description of the visual as a subtitle below the title of the
            visualization.


At the top left corner of the Dashboard Designer, click
            SAVE.
