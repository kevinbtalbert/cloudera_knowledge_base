Interactive map with multiple measures
CDP Data Visualization enables you to display multiple measures in Interactive Map
    visuals.

You can display two distinct measurements in the Circle Layer by placing the
        secondary measurement on the Colors shelf. The following steps extend
        the work completed in Interactive maps, and demonstrate how to visualize two
        separate measures on the same map.
noteTo use this feature, an Admin user must specify, through the Site
          Settings interface, the API keys granted to your organization. This is
        described in Enabling API keys for interactive maps.

Clone the California Woods visual, previously built in Interactive
            maps.
For instructions, see Cloning visuals.

Select another measurement to add to the visual, and add it to the
            Colors shelf.

In this example, elev_in_m is selected, the aggregation function is
            changed to max(elev_in_m), and the Elevation alias has
            been applied


In the Settings menu, turn off Heatmap, Cluster,
          and Routes.

In the Settings menu, enable Circles, and turn on both
          the Area legend and the Color legend options.

Click REFRESH VISUAL to see two measures on the same map.






Click the pencil/edit icon next to the title of the
          visualization to enter a name for the visual.

In this example, the title is changed to 'California Woods - Two Dimensions'. You can
            also add a brief description of the visual as a subtitle below the title of the
            visualization.


At the top left corner of the Dashboard Designer, click
            SAVE.
