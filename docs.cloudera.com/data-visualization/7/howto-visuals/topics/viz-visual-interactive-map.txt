Interactive maps
An interactive map paints geographic details over a basic map tile layer provided by a
    third-party provider. CDP Data Visualization offers several overlay layers for data display. It
    is an excellent choice for displaying large amounts of geo-based information in relevant
    detail.

The base Map Servers include either Google Maps or Mapbox.
The overlay layers that display data include the Heatmap, Cluster,
          Circles, and Routes and pins options.

note

To use this feature, an Admin user must first specify, through the Site Settings
          interface, the API keys granted to your organization. This is described in Keys for
            interactive visuals.
This visual type supports zero, one, or two field aggregations on the measures shelf. If
          no measure is supplied, the map will paint with an assumed value of 1. With one measure,
          all options use that measure. With two measures, the Heatmap, Cluster and Routes &
          Pins use the first measure only, while the Circles display both measures.
Remember that to place information onto a map or interactive map visual, the records
          must contain geographical information, such as valid latitude and longitude pairs,
          zipcodes, states, and so on. To learn how to cast dataset fields into usable type, see
            Change type and Geo type.
