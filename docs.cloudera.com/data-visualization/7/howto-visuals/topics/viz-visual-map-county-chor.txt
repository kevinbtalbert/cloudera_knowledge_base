In CDP Data Visualization Map visuals, you can plot measurements as areas over US
    County regions.

A county map of the United States shows a comparison of measurement values across US
        States. The following steps extend the work completed in State map, choropleth,
        and demonstrate how to create a map visual on the dataset US County Populations [data
        source samples.us_counties]. It produces colored regions for the
        measurements that correspond to the county field.
