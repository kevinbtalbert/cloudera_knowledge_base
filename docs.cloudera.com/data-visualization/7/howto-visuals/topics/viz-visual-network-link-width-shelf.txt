Networks: link width shelfCloudera DocsNetworks: link width shelf
By default, the links of the network visual have the same thickness and length. Network
    visual has a data shelf called Link width that produces a chart with link thickness that depends
    on specified values.

To specify the width of the link, follow these steps:

 Add the Score 1 field to the Link Width
          shelf.

Click the Score 1 field on the shelf, to see the FIELD
            PROPERTIES menu.

 In the FIELD PROPERTIES menu, select [ ] Enter/Edit
            Expression.
In the expression editor, specify a new calculation as a max() aggregation
          function, with an alias:

max(abs([Score 1] - [Score 2])) as 'Score Differential'

Click VALIDATE & SAVE.

Click REFRESH VISUAL.
You can see the change to the appearance of the visual:Figure 1. Specifying the Link Width shelf on Network Visual


Optional: 
 If you hover over a specific link, you can see the detail information.

 For example, compare the following two Round 1 games:

Kansas vs. UC Davis that has a 38 point score differential, and the thickest
              link in the chart

Cincinnati vs. Kansas State that has a 14 point score differential, and a
              comparatively thinner link
