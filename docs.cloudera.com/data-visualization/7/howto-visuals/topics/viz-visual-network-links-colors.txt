Network visuals have many color palette options for links.

To get to the link color options, follow these steps:

On the right side of  the Visual Designer, click the
            Style menu.






 Open the Link Colors menu and choose a color palette.



You can select Reverse color palette of visuals if you want
                to change the order of the colors.


You can click on an individual color swatch in the palette to change the first
                color within palette.


You can also change the color of the Direction Arrow.




In this example the links palette is changed so links are more
      clearly distinguished from the nodes. For this visual, all rounds and all regions of the 2017
      season are shown:Figure 1. Changing color palette for links in network visual
