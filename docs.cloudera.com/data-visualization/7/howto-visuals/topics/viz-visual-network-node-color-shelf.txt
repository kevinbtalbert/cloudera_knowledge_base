Networks: node color shelves
By default, the nodes of a Network visual have the same color. This visual has two data
    shelves, Source node color and Target node color, that produce a where all nodes for a category
    have the same color value.

To specify the color of the nodes, follow these steps:

Add the Region Name field to the Source Node
            Color shelf.
Add the Region Name field to the Target Node Color
        shelf.For both shelves, ensure that the aggregation function is max().Optional: 
Alias the fields on the shelves.
In this example, the fields are named as Region Name to hide the necessary aggregation
          information.

Remove the round field from the Filter shelf.
In this example, only one filter (Year in (2017)) is left in
          place.

Click VALIDATE & SAVE.

Click REFRESH VISUAL.
You can see how much easier it is to distinguish between the nodes that represent
          different regions. Here, we show the tooltips for a South and West region: Figure 1. Specifying Node Color on Network Visual
