Networks: node size shelves
Network visuals enable you to change the size of the nodes.

By default, the nodes of  a Network visual have the same size. This visual has two data
        shelves, Source node size and Target node size, that produce a chart with
        nodes that represent values in the dataset.
To specify the size of the nodes, follow these steps:

Add the Seed 1 field to the Source Node Size
          shelf.

Click the Score 1 field on the shelf, to see the FIELD
            PROPERTIES menu.

In the FIELD PROPERTIES menu, select [ ] Enter/Edit
            Expression.
In the expression editor, specify a new calculation as a max() aggregation
          function, with an alias:

max([Seed 1]) as 'Seed'

Click VALIDATE & SAVE.

Add the Seed 2 field to the Target Node Size
          shelf.

Click the Score 2 field on the shelf, to see the FIELD
            PROPERTIES menu.

In the FIELD PROPERTIES menu, select [ ] Enter/Edit
            Expression. 
In the expression editor, specify a new calculation as a max() aggregation
          function, with an alias:

max([Seed 2]) as 'Seed'

Click VALIDATE & SAVE.

Click REFRESH VISUAL.
You can see the change to the appearance of the visual. Here, we show the tooltips for
          the visual to point out the size difference between Baylor (seed 3) and
            Xavier (seed 11):Figure 1. Specifying Node Size on Network Visual
