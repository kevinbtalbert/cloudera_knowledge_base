In CDP Data Visualization, Network visuals can be used to represent many systems and
    structures. The implementation is dynamic, with ongoing optimization adjustments that implement
    a force layout based on the Barnesâ€“Hut approximation. It also includes many manual setting
    adjustments.

In the following example, the NCAA Basketball dataset is used for years 1985 through
        2018.
For an overview of shelves that specify this visual, see Shelves for
        networks.

Start a new visual based on the NCAA Basketball dataset.
For instructions, see Creating a visual.

 In the VISUALS menu, find and click
            Network.


The shelves of the visual changed. They are now Nodes,
            Link Width, Link Color, Source
            Node Size, Target Node Size, Source Node
            Color, Target Node Color,
Tooltips, X Trellis, Y
            Trellis, and Filters. There is only one mandatory
          shelf: Nodes, which adds two dimensions from the data menu to
          specify the start and end of each network connection in the plot.

To learn more about the shelves of this visual, see Shelves for
            networks.

 Populate the shelves from the fields available in the DATA
          menu:


Under Dimensions, select Team 1 and
                Team 2, and add them to the Nodes
              shelf.


Under Measures, select Year and add it to
              the Filters shelf. Select the years 2015,
                2016, and 2017.


Add Round to the Filters shelf, and select
                1.

 To show the years separately, place the Year field on the
            Y Trellis shelf and click REFRESH
