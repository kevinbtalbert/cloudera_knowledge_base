Inserting images from local machine
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to insert an image into a Rich text visual
        from a local directory.

Click the Picture icon in the Rich Text
                        Editor.




This opens the Insert Image modal window.


Under Select from files, click Choose
                        Files and  select an image file from your file system.






Click INSERT IMAGE to add the picture to your
                    visual.

noteCDP Data Visualization automatically converts the
                        image into a static asset and adds it to the set of static assets it
                        manages.
If you click the Code icon, it shows a link to the
                        image inside the staticasset database.



In this example, the link appears as asset_id.image_type, where
                    asset_id is assigned automatically based on the order of
                upload, and image_type is consistent with the format of the
                uploaded file, such as png.
