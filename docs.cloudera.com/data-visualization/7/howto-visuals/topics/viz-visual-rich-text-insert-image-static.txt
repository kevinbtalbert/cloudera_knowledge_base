Inserting images from static assets
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to insert an image that has been previously
        uploaded to the system as a static asset.
Click the Picture icon in the Rich-Text
                        Editor.




This opens the Insert Image modal window.


Provide the address of the image in the Image URL
                    field.

The format for inserting existing static assets is the following:


ip-address:port-address/arc/reports/staticassets/raw/asset-id.asset-type
Where asset_id is the ID of an asset already imported
                        into the system, and asset-type is the file extension.


Click INSERT IMAGE.


In this example, asset 1.png is loaded.
