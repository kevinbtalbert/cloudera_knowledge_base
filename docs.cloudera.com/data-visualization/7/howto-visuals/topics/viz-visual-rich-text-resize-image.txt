Resizing images
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to resize an image inside a rich text
        visual.
Open the Rich text visual in Edit mode.

 Click the image and select one of the magnification controls:
                        100%, 50%, or
                        25%.
You also have the option to delete the image from your visual.
