Rich texts
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to create Rich Text visuals.

You can use markup code to add supporting textual or visual information to your
                dashboard. You can insert styled paragraphs, hyperlinks, tables, images, and other
                elements. These insterted elements do not use any information from the dataset.
noteYou must have system-level Manage styles and settings privilege
                to create Rich text visuals. For more information, see Setting system
                    privileges.
The following steps demonstrate how to create a visual with rich text formatting.


Start a new visual based on the World Life Expectancy dataset.
For instructions, see Creating a visual.

Select Rich Text in the VISUALS
                    menu.


The shelves of the have visual changed. This visual type does not have any
                    shelves associated with it. Instead, it has a single text box for entering and
                    editing text or markup.

Click the (expand) icon to open the Rich Text
                        Editor.


The editor modal window contains a large text box and an editing tool
                        bar.



Paste the following text in the text box.

In the early 1800's, life expectancy at birth began to increase significantly in the countries that industrialized early, but it remained low in the rest of the world. Industrialization levels correlated strongly with life expectancy, and lead to notable inequalities in global health distribution. Good health was prevalent in the rich countries, where improvements in sanitation, infant/maternal care, and food quantity lead to longer life. Meanwhile, poor health persisted in poorer countries.

This global inequality decreased over the last half of the 20th century. Countries that relatively recently suffered from bad health are catching up rapidly. Since 1900, the global average life expectancy more than doubled, increasing from 32.6 years for all reporting countries to 70.0 years.

                    text according to your requirements.

Optional: 
You can also edit your visual in Code view.

Rich text visuals support the Code View option, as a
                        simple toggle between Text view and Code view.
For example, you can override the width settings on a previously inserted
                        image. Editing in Code view enables you to specify the width in terms
                        of
                        percentages:<img src="/arc/reports/staticasset/raw/5.png" style="width: 50%;">or
                        in terms of
                        pixels:<img src="/arc/reports/staticasset/raw/5.png" style="width: 350px;">
You can also remove table borders or format custom email notification
                        templates.


Click APPLY to save your changes and return to the
                    dashboard.
If you do not want to apply your changes, click CANCEL
                    or just close the modal window. 

Change the title to World Population - Rich Text.

[Optional] You can also add a brief description of the visual as a subtitle
                        below the title of the visualization.


Click SAVE at the top left corner of the
                        Dashboard Designer.


In this example, the following changes have been implemented: two tables with images
                in the left column and text in the right column, 2 levels of headings, and links for
                sources. Your visual should look something like this:
