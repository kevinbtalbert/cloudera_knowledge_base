SQL queries
In Cloudera Data Visualization, SQL query visuals enable you to process SQL language
    queries using an enhanced visual editor for SQL authoring, including autocomplete.
Start a new visual based on the US County Population dataset.
For instructions, see Creating a visual.

Select SQL Queries in the VISUALS
          menu.




The shelves of the visual changed.  You can find a link in the shelf area that leads
            you to the visual in full-screen mode, where you can view/edit the SQL statement in the
            SQL editor.


Enter the following text in the Enter/Edit SQL Expression modal
          window: 

SELECT 
    TA_0.`stname` as `State`, 
    TA_0.`ctyname` as `County`, 
    (sum((TA_0.`wa_male`))+sum((TA_0.`wa_female`))) as `White`, 
    (sum((TA_0.`ba_male`))+sum((TA_0.`ba_female`))) as `Black or African American`, 
    (sum((TA_0.`ia_male`))+sum((TA_0.`ia_female`))) as `American Indian and Alaska Native`, 
    (sum((TA_0.`aa_male`))+sum((TA_0.`aa_female`))) as `Asian`, 
    (sum((TA_0.`na_male`))+sum((TA_0.`na_female`))) as `Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander`, 
    (sum((TA_0.`tom_male`))+sum((TA_0.`tom_female`))) as `Two or More Races`, 
    sum((TA_0.`tot_pop`)) as `Total Population`
  FROM `samples`.`us_counties` TA_0
  GROUP BY 1, 2
  LIMIT 5000





 Click VALIDATE & REFRESH.

The visual is updated in the preview area. You can make further edits to the SQL code
            and check the changes by validating and refreshing the expression again.
If you do not need the autocomplete function, uncheck the Autocomplete
              on option.


Click APPLY to save the changes.
If you do not want to apply your changes, click CANCEL or just
          close the modal window.

 Change the title to County Populations, by State /County - Query.

[Optional] You can also add a brief description of the visual below the title of the
            visualization.


Click SAVE at the top left corner of the Dashboard
            Designer.


The table created from the query should look similar to this:



As an example of using this visual, sort on the column Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander
        to see where most people of that ethnicity live. You can notice that there is a very large
        population in Los Angeles, San Diego, and in the Salt Lake area.
