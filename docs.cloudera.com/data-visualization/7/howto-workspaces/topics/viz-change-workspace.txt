Changing workspace properties
You can change the visibility and accessibility of a workspace in CDP Data
    Visualization.

All users can edit the Public workspace, by default. However, administrators can manage the
        public workspace and edit the permissions for all other users. The only things that
        administrators cannot change are the name and description of the Public workspace, and they
        cannot delete it.
For information about the different types of workspaces, see Workspaces in CDP Data
          Visualization.


On the main navigation bar, click Visuals.






On the left side menu, in the Workspaces section, find and
          select the workspace.

Hover over its title until a (pencil) icon appears, and click
          it.






In the Edit Workspace modal window, make the required
          changes.

For example, add a new user by entering her name in the (user)
            menu and clicking Add. 
With the autocomplete functionality, as you enter a user or group name, it is easier to
            find an existing user or group in the system.
Remember to set the correct access level for the new user.



To remove an existing user or user group from the access matrix, click the
              (cross) icon on that row.
