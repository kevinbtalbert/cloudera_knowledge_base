Job log
Cloudera Data Visualization makes it easy to check out and examine the information
    available about your jobs. The Jobs interface has three tabs:
      Job Logs, Scheduled Jobs and Manage
      Schedule Intervals.
By default, the Jobs interface opens on the Job
        Log tab, which provides information on all jobs.





REFRESH updates the log information.


DELETE SELECTED performs a delete on all selected jobs.


RUN NOW reruns all selected jobs. For more information, see
            Rerunning jobs.


Filters for job logs based on Type, Status,
          and Owner.


The Status of a job can be Pending, Running,
            Finished, Error, or Cancelled.





The Job ID on the Job Log tab and the
            Scheduled Jobs tab is the same. This helps to debug performance
          issues.
