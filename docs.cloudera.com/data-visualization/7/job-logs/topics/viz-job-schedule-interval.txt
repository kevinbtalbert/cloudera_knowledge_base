Manage schedule intervals
Cloudera Data Visualization makes it easy to check out and examine the information
    available about your jobs. The Jobs interface has three tabs:
      Job Logs, Scheduled Jobs and Manage
      Schedule Intervals.
The Manage Schedule Intervals tab shows the list of schedule intervals
      and the features and actions associated with intervals.
noteThis feature is only available to users with administrative privileges.

Clicking DELETE SELECTED performs a delete on all selected
