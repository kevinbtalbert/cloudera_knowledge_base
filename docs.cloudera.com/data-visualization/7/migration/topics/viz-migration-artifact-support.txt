Supported visual artifacts
Cloudera Data Visualization allows you to export and import various visual
    artifacts.
Supported visual artifacts include datasets, linked visuals, dashboards, custom
      styles, custom colors (palettes), segments, and static assets.
The Export utility automatically exports any existing thumbnails. When you want to import
      visual artifacts, you have the option of importing the thumbnails into the new installation,
      generating new thumbnails at import, or skipping thumbnail processing.
