Data compatibility during visual artifact migration
The migration utility of Cloudera Data Visualization allows you to export visual
    artifacts and then import them to a new system. It is important to pay attention to data
    compatibility between the two systems to make sure that migration works properly.
The destination system (which imports the visual artifacts) has to have a valid
      connection to the data used in the visual artifacts, and that data must be in a table that
      matches the name. When you import a visual artifact file with the Check data table
        compatibility option enabled, the import stops when it cannot find the needed table on
      the connection.
Some environments use multi-connection architecture for table access. In such
      cases, you must disable the Check data table compatibility option to successfully
      complete the import into a single connection. After the import completes, you can re-route the
      data connections of datasets as necessary.
