Natural language search UI
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to find relevant information in the dataset
  through natural language statements, and renders the result in a graphical format. Using this type
  of search you can type in a sentence, using regular, spoken language, that describes the
  information you are looking for.
To enable Natural Language Search (NLS) modal globally, see Enabling NLS in Site
    Settings. For the required configurations, see Enabling dataset for NLS.noteTo use
    NLS after enabling search in the Menu Bar and configuring datasets for
    searching, click SEARCH in the top right corner or the icon next to
    searchable datasets.

     search.
