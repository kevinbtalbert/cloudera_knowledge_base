Search results
Unless the search phrase explicitly specifies the type of visual representation,
    Cloudera Data Visualization displays Natural Language Search results using a type that best
    matches the number and type of fields included in the search, for every searched
    dataset.
Cloudera Data Visualization displays the results of a Natural Language search directly in the
      search modal window.
The main features of the search results are shown in the figure below:




Search criteria This is identical to your original search. The various components of
          the search statement show colored highlights. If you move your mouse over these parts of
          the statement, the tooltip displays the details of the component.

Result dataset The dataset where a particular search result is found. Note that each
          search result may represent a different dataset.

Result visual The search result itself is a visual. Note that Cloudera Data
          Visualization displays results in a default visual type that best represents the number
          and type of fields in the search phrase.

Order of search results
Cloudera Data Visualization automatically ranks the results of Natural
  Language Search.
When search produces multiple results from different datasets, you can see the most relevant
   visual at the top of the list. The ranking is based on the highest number and accuracy of matched
   search terms.
