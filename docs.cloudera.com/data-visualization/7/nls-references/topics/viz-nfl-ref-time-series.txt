NLS terms for time series
Data Visualization provides Natural Language Search (NLS) support for time series
  concepts.
When the user enters a time-series term in the search box, such as Trends or
    Over Time, Data Visualization automatically recognizes that the user is requesting a
   time-series based visual, and renders a visual with time field on the X-axis.
