Changing dataset search domain
 In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can perform Natural Language
        Search (NLS) across all enabled datasets, or restrict your search to selected datasets. 

When searching across all search-enabled sample datasets, which is the default
                setting, the search population by state returns results from five datasets:
                    US State Populations Over Time, Restaurant Inspection SF, Food
                    Stores Inspection in NYC, US County Population, and World Life
                    Expectancy.



To limit the search:


Select the Datasets menu in the top right corner.

Deselect all the datasets that you do not want to include in the search.

This restricts the search to relevant data.
note You may choose to deselect all datasets, and then selectively add some of
                        them back.


Perform the search again.


In the figure below, the US County Population and US State Populations Over
                    Time datasets are selected, so the results based on the other datasets no
                longer appear in the search results.
