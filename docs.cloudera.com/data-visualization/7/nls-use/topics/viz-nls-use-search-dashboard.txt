Using the search visual in a dashboard
After creating a Search visual, it is available for use from the Dashboard page like
        any other visual.

Before performing this task, you need to create a Search visual. For instructions,
                see Creating a search visual.


Open the dashboard from the Dashboard page.

The Search Box visual appears in the dashboard. Its
                        only element is the search box itself.





Click the search text box and choose one of the following search
                    alternatives:

Type in a new search statement.
Select one of the searches from the drop-down list. They are grouped
                        into the following categories: 
Grouped by Dataset
Favorites
Search History




Select a search.

The visual changes. It shows both the search box with the specified search
                        statement and the visual that reports the results of that statement. In the
                        following example, ‘population by time’ is selected.
