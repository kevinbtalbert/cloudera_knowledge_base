Working with search visuals
The purpose of the search visual is to include search functionality in embedded
  dashboards.
Search visuals enable you to place a data search button directly on your dashboard. This is
   particularly useful in embedded cases. The Enable Search Visual,
    Enable Search in Menu Bar, and Enable Search
    Visual settings need to be enabled in Site Settings to turn
   on the search feature and the datasets need to be enabled separately to add them to the search
   results. See Enabling NLS in Site Settings and Enabling dataset for
   NLS.
