Cloudera Data Visualization homepage
Cloudera Data Visualization (CDV) enables you to explore data and communicate insights
    across the whole data lifecycle by using visual objects.
When you log into CDV, you are taken to the HOME screen, which is the
      starting point to your data visualization journey. It displays recent views, favorites, and
      the applicationâ€™s most-viewed content. You can start exploring sample dashboards or the
      in-tool Get Started guide.
Clicking HOME on the main navigation bar always takes you to the
      homepage.
The default CDV homepage has the following main parts:
