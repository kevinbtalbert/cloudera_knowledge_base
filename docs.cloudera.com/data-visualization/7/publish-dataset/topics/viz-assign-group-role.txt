Assign groups to roles


Now we must correctly assign the membership groups to roles. 


There are three distinct access levels across the organization: Data Admins,
              Analysts, and Visual Consumers.
There are three teams: Marketing, Sales, and Operations.


The following steps demonstrate how to create the necessary user groups in ArcViz. Note
        that depending on your architecture, this definition may happen at the LDAP layer, with
        groups visible to Data Visualization.


On the main navigation bar, click the Gear icon, and select
            Manage Roles.

In the Roles interface, click either the name of the role,
            Marketing Data Admin, or the Edit icon on its role.

In the Role Detail interface, select the
            Members tab.

In Groups section, click Edit
          Group(s).




The Role Assignment modal window appears.


Select the groups Data_Admins and Marketing.

Click Add.

Click Apply.




The Groups list now contains Data_Admins and Marketing. 


Select the Require all groups option.

Click Save.

A confirmation message appears briefly.





Repeat the previous steps to assign groups to the rest of the roles, according to the
          following information. Remember that you must use the Require all groups
          option.
