Assign users to groups


Depending on your installation/migration scenario and security configuration, you may
        already have the required users, and they may already be assigned to the correct groups.
To continue our example, we show how to create new users and assign them to the groups.
        Appropriate group membership automatically endows the user with the required role.
The following steps demonstrate how to create the necessary users and assign them to user
        groups in Data Visualization.


On the main navigation bar, click Gear the icon.

Select Users & Groups

In the Manage Users & Groups interface, click New
            User.

In the New User modal window, enter the following
          information:


Name: John_Marketing
Password: password of your choice.
Permissions: Select Normal user.
Under Groups tab, select Data Admin and
                Marketing. 



Click Add to move these groups to the right column, and then
          click Save.

Note that in this process, we will not assign users to roles directly, but through the
            group membership only.





Repeat the previous steps to create new users and assign groups to them, according to
          the following information. This is a minimal set of users that 'populates' each role. We
          can have multiple users assigned to the same groups.

After completing these steps, check the list of users, and notice that it shows the
        assigned roles. This is because we completed the group-role mapping already, as described in
          Assigning groups to roles.
