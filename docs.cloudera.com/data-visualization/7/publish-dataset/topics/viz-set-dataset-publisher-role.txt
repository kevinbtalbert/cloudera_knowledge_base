Setting the dataset publisher role


note
For more information on possible permissions, see RBAC permissions.

For the sake of this discussion, members of the Dataset Publisher Role have the privileges
        to grant dataset access to other users. This access is available in three forms:


Grant manage dataset
Grant manage dashboards
Grant view dashboards


The granter must have the Grant manage dataset permissions on the target
        dataset.
We already created three (3) dataset publishing roles (data admins) in Setting
          the dataset recipient roles, one each for the three organization groups:
          Marketing, Sales, and Operations. These are Marketing Data
          Admin, Sales Data Admin, and Operations Data Admin, respectively. We
        also created the roles for the recipients of the grants, the analysts and the
          visual consumers.
Here are the steps for specifying the role Marketing Data Admin:


In the Roles interface, click either the name of the role,
            Marketing Data Admin, or the Edit icon on its role.

In the Role Detail interface, click the Add Privilege
          button.




The Add Privilege modal window appears.


Create the following privilege:

Under Component Type, select Role.

From Roles(s), select Marketing Data Admin, a role we
          defined previously.

Note that this enables individuals with the Marketing Data Admin role to grant
            privileges to others with the same role.


Click Create.






Leave this privilege with all options on, and click the Add
            Privilege button to add the next privilege.






Under Component Type, select Role.

From Roles(s), select Marketing Analyst, a role we
          defined previously.

Click Create.






Deselect the Grant manage dataset option for this privilege.

This is because analysts should not be altering the dataset.


Click the Add Privilege button to add the next privilege.






Under Component Type, select Role.

From Roles(s), select Marketing Visual Consumer, a role
          we defined previously.

Click Create.






Unselect the Grant manage dataset and Grant manage dashboards options for
          this privilege. This is because visual consumers can only view dashboards, and should not
          be altering the dataset or creating new dashboards. Therefore, this line contains only the
            Grant view dashboards option.

Click the Add Privilege button to add the next privilege.




This time, let us declare connection-level privileges so that the Marketing Data
              Admin can access connected data, build datasets, and import supplemental data.
            Depending on the operational structure, we may also let the users with this role manage
            analytical views.


In the Add Privilege modal window, create the connection-level
          privileges necessary for the Marketing Data Admin user. This particular privilege
          enables access to all data available through the specified connection:

Under Component Type, select
          Connection.

From Connection(s), select Impala.

Click Create.






Leave this privilege with all options on (Manage analytical views, Import
            data, and Create datasets, explore tables).

Click the Add Privilege button to add the next privilege.




Finally, we declare dataset-level privileges. We can choose previously declared
            connections and limit access to a few of its datasets, or select a new connection, or
            choose all datasets on a connection. Here, we simply let members of the Marketing
              Data Admin role access all existing datasets on the Arcadia Enterprise
            connection.


In the Add Privilege modal window, create the connection-level
          privileges necessary for the Marketing Data Admin user. This particular privilege
          enables access to all data available through the specified connection.

Under Component Type, select
          Dataset.

From Connection(s), select Arcadia Enterprise.

From Dataset(s), select All datasets.

Click Create.






Leave this privilege with all options on (Manage dataset, Manage
            dashboards, and View dashboards)

Click Save at the top of the page to save the new definition of
          the Marketing Data Admin role.






Repeat the previous steps to add privileges to the roles of the Sales Data Admin
          and Operations Data Admin. Each of these roles should have a privilege matrix that
          is similar to privileges assigned to the Marketing Data Admin role.

After completing these steps, the list of roles shows that the number of components on the
        Data Admin roles increased to 6 (six):
