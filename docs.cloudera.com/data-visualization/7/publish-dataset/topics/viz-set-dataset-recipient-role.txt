In this discussion, we demonstrate how to set up Dataset Recipient roles. Members can
        receive dataset access at one or more of the following levels:

Manage dataset
Manage dashboards
View dashboards
Let us create three dataset roles: Data Admin, Analyst, and Visual
          Consumer for each for the three organization groups: Marketing, Sales,
        and Operations.
note
This task is for users with Manage roles and users privileges.

The steps for creating the role Marketing Data Admin.


On the main navigation bar, click the Gear icon, and select
            Manage Roles.

In the Roles interface, start the new role by clicking New
            Role.

In the Role definition interface, enter the following
          information:


Name: Marketing Data Admin
Description: Creates datasets, can grant access to their
                datasets.

At a later time, we plan to define the privileges and the membership of the role.





Click Save.

Cloudera Data Visualization generates a success message.

Repeat the previous steps to generate a total of 9 (nine) new roles, with the following
          names and descriptions:
