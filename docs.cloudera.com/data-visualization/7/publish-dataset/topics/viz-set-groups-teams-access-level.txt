Define groups for teams and access levels


Create the groups of users by organizational team, and by level of required
          access.


There are three distinct access levels across the organization: Data Admins,
                Analysts, and Visual Consumers.
There are three teams: Marketing, Sales, and Operations.

The following steps demonstrate how to create the necessary user groups in Data
            Visualization. Note that depending on your architecture, this definition may happen at
            the LDAP layer, with the groups visible to Data Visualization.


On the main navigation bar, click the Gear, and select
            Users & Groups.

In the Manage Users & Groups  interface, click
            New Group.

In the New Group window modal, create a new group Data_Admins.

[Optional] You may choose to add users to the group at this point, but we plan to do
          this at a later stage.

Click Save.

Repeat these steps to create additional new user groups: Analysts,
            Visual_Consumers, Marketing, Sales, and Operations.
