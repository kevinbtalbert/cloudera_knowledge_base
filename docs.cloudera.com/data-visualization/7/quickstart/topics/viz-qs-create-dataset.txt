Creating a dataset
You can define datasets as a semantic layer on top of your data tables and views in the
    data store. You need to create a dataset before you can create dashboards or apps. Learn how to
    create a dataset in CDP Data Visualization.
On the main navigation bar, click DATA.
Select a connection from the side menu bar.
Click NEW DATASET near the top of the screen.

The New Dataset modal window appears.
Specify the details of the new dataset.

Click CREATE.

You can see the newly created dataset under the Datasets tab in the
          DATA interface.
tipTo find the dataset in the future, you can scroll through the list of
        datasets on the connection, or use Search at the top of the
        page.


You can now start creating visualizations and organize your visual artifacts into
        dashboards and applications.
