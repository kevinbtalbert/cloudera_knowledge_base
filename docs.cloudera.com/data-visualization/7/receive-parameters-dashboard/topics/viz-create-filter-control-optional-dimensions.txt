Creating filters to control optional dimensions

Before starting this work flow, complete the steps in Creating visuals with optional dimensions.

In the dashboard, click the Filters tab.

Click CREATE CUSTOM FILTER.




This creates a new filter in the filter area of the
                        application, and opens the Settings modal window for
                        that filter.


Click the Values tab and enter the following:


Under Title, enter Display Country
                            Details.
Under Output Parameter, enter dim. Note
                            that this is the parameter from Creating visuals with optional dimensions.
Under Specified values, enter
                                Value: country, and
                                Label: Country.






Switch to the Display Settings tab, select
                        Allow only one item to be selected at a time and then
                    select Include an option for 'All'. 

Click APPLY.

Name and save the dashboard.

Switch to dashboard View mode and select World Regional
                        Populations.

In the Display Country Details filter, select
                        Country.






The table now has a new column, country.
