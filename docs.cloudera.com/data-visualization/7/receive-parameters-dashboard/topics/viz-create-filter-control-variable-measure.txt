Creating filters to control variable measures

Before starting this work flow, complete the steps in Creating visuals with variable measures.

In the dashboard, click the Filters tab.

Click CREATE CUSTOM FILTER.






This creates a new filter in the filter area of the application,
          and opens the Settings modal window for that filter.

Switch to Values tab and enter the following:


Under Title, enter Population Type.
Under Output Parameter, enter agg. Note that this is
              the parameter from Creating visuals with variable measures.
Under Specified values, enter the following two rows:
Value: sum(tot_pop),
                    Label: Total Population
Value: sum(tot_male),
                    Label: Total Male Population
Value: sum(tot_female),
                    Label: Total Female Population
Note that these are the original field names in the source table.






Switch to the Display Settings tab and select the options
            Allow only one item to be selected at a time.

Click APPLY.

Save the dashboard.

Switch to dashboard View mode.

In the Population Type filter, select Total Female
            Population.


Note that the title of the graph and the vertical axis changed to include
            sum(tot_female).

To check the parameters of the dashboard, hover the pointer over the
            Filter icon at the top right corner.

They are agg: sum(tot_female), agg.alias: Total Female Population and
              dim: Stname. You can scroll down to see the dim.alias:
              State parameter.






You can now operate the two filters, Dimension Level and Population Type,
        independently. 
You can also navigate between the permutations of filter outputs you create by using filter
        navigation controls at the top right corner.
