              Tot Pop field, chose the Aggregates menu,
              and change the aggregate from Sum to
              Average.

To have an informative title for the visual, you may add the parameter placeholders to
            it. The filter configured in Creating filters to control variable dimensions supplies
            the required value.


Click SAVE.
