CURL Data Format and API Key Examples
Cloudera Data Visualization provides examples of API Key in CURL
                data format.
When you add the APIKey to the request header and avoid explicit login, all
                        interactions become simpler. The examples in this article use an APIKey
                        obtained through the Manage API Keys interface, on the
                                        host:port/arc/apps/apikeys
                        browser page of the DataViz installation The actual APIKey and the method of
                        retrieving the key depends on the user system. 
See Example
                                1 to learn how to get all roles information, and Example
                                2 to change the description of a role.
Example 1: Getting all roles
To use CURL to obtain a full dump of all roles, use the following
                                command. 
Note that the output is piped to the standard python JSON dumper for
                                easier reading; it is not necessary for CURL access.
curl -s \
 -X GET \
 -H "Authorization: apikey ApiKey" \
 api_url/roles?detail=1> | python -m json.tool
Note that the login URL has the form
                                                [http|https]:/host:port/arc/apps/login.
                                For syntax of other parameters, see Admin API syntax
                                        parameters.

Example 2: Changing the role description
To change the description for role ID 3, use the following command.
For CURL to supply data through the POST method, use the
                                        application/x-www-form-urlencoded content
                                type.
curl -s \
 -X POST \
 -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
 -H "Authorization: apikey ApiKey" \
 -d 'data=[{"desc":"Updated description again"}]' \
 api_url/roles/3
