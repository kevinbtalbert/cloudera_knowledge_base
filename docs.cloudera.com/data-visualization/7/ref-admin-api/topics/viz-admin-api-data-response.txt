Python Admin API Data Format and Response
Cloudera Data Visualization provides examples of python Admin API
                data format and response.
The response data for GET operations is a list of JSON items.
                        For POST operations, such as UPDATE and
                                CREATE, the input format is a structure with a data
                        field that contains the JSON list of items. The UPDATE and
                                CREATE operations process one item at a time, so
                        the list is exactly one entry long. 
The response data for POST operations is the updated item,
                        matching a GET with detail=1 for the item,
                        as demonstrated in Example 1: Setting the name for role ID=1 to 'System Admin'.
For item updates, it is only necessary to specify the fields you are updating.
                                Cloudera Data Visualization merges the supplied
                        fields in the input data with the existing item's data, as demonstrated in
                                Example 2: Checking role ID=2; updating by adding a new user.
Example 1: Setting the name for role ID=1 to 'System Admin'
payload = {'name':'System Admin'}
session.post(api_url + '/roles/1', data={'data':json.dumps([payload])})
Note that the API URL has the following form:
[http|htttps]://host:port/arc/adminapi/version
For syntax of other parameters, see Admin API syntax
                                parameters.

Example 2: Checking role ID=2; updating by adding a new user
response = session.get(api_url + '/roles/2?detail=1')
role = response.json()[0]
if 'new_user' not in role['users']:
    payload = {'users':role['users'] + ['new_user']}
    session.post(api_url + '/roles/2', data={'data':json.dumps([payload])})
For the definition of fields for each data type, see Data type
                                        details.
