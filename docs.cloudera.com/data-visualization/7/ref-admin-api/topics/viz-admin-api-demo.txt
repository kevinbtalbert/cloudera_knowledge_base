Admin API Demo
We are including a simple GUI demo to demonstrate how the Cloudera Data Visualization URL-based Admin API can easily
                display the data format for each item type.
note

Use the demo with some caution: the system does not confirm
                                                DELETE operations, and it is not
                                        meant for implementing system configuration changes. It is
                                        simply a working example of the Admin API.
The demo is not enabled by default. It must be enabled, much as
                                        the actual Admin API URL support must be enabled, for each
                                        item. 

Use the following statement to enable the demo:
ADMIN_API_DEMO_LIST  = ['visuals', 'datasets', 'connections', 'users', 'groups', 
  'roles', 'segments', 'filterassociations']
Alternatively, use the wild card to specify all options:
ADMIN_API_DEMO_LIST  =  ['*']
To fully enable all APIs and all demo tabs, use the wild card character in the
                        settings entries for both ADMIN_API_DEMO_LIST and
                                ADMIN_API_URL_LIST:
ADMIN_API_DEMO_LIST = ['*']
ADMIN_API_URL_LIST  = ['*']
After enabling the demo, you can access it through the following URL:
host_path/arc/apps/apidemo
