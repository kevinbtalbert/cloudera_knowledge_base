Groups
Cloudera Data Visualization provides URL access to the ArcViz
                server object, groups. 
Like the users data type, the names for list of
                                groups and roles are supplied for
                        information only. When updating the users's groups or
                                roles, only the ID fields are necessary. 
The JSON fields for group's data type are defined as follows:
