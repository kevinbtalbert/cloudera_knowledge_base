Note that we deliberately chose not to document the details of creating datasets,
                        connections, and visuals. They are all highly complex structures, and should
                        be created directly in the Cloudera Data Visualization
                        application, through the graphical user interface.
For the GET requests, many returned fields are only
                        informational, and cannot be updated through subsequent
                                POST requests.
Some fields are themselves complex structures that contain sub-fields. The update
                        logic that merges the supplied input fields with the existing data applies
                        to the top-level fields only. For example, the
                                        role type contains a
                                privs field, which is a list of individual
                        privilege records. To update the privs field, you must
                        supply the entire list, not merely the individual list element.
