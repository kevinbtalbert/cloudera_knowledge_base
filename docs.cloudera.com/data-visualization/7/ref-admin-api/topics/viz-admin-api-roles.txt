Roles
Cloudera Data Visualization provides URL access to the ArcViz
                server object, roles. 
To support installations that store the users and
                                groups information outside the ArcViz environment
                        (such as LDAP), the role membership lists for users and groups only store
                        names. During role update and create operations, ArcViz accepts the user and
                        group names 'as is', without validating them.
Each entry in the privs list corresponds to a single privilege
                        row in the ArcViz role edit screen. Each row contains fields for the
                        privilege type (ptype), an identifier section, and a list
                        of permissions (perms) for the identified objects, such as
                        datasets or data connections. Each privilege type has a specific identifier,
                        and set of possible permissions. ArcViz stores the dataset IDs and
                        connection IDs within the identifier sections as a STRING,
                        and uses the special value "-1" to indicate "All datasets"
                        or "All connections".

Creating Roles
The following code creates a new role with groups
                                        dataconn_managers and
                                        arcviz_admins. The role has system-level
                                permissions to view logs, and to create new datasets. It also has
                                full permissions on all connections and all datasets. 
The actual API Key and the method of retrieving the key depends on the
                                user system.
curl -s \
 -X POST \
 -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
 -H "Authorization: apikey api_key" \
 -d 'data=[{
      "name": "Connection manager",
      "desc": "Data connection management",
      "groups": ["dataconn_managers", "arcviz_admins"],
      "privs": [
          {"ptype": "system",
           "perms": ["sys_viewlogs", "sys_editconn"]
          },
          {"ptype": "dataconn",
           "dclist": ["-1"],
           "perms": ["dc_aviews", "dc_upload", "dc_explore"]
          },
          {"ptype": "dataset",
           "dcid": "-1",
           "dslist": ["-1"],
           "perms": ["ds_manage", "ds_appedit", "ds_appview"]
          }
       ]
