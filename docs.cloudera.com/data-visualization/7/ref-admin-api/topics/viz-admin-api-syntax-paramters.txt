Admin API Syntax Parameters
The Cloudera Data Visualization Admin API has a consistent
                pattern for each data type.
The Admin API has the following basic access syntax:
[http | https]:/host:port/arc/adminapi/version/data_type[/object_id][?options]

host
The host of the ArcViz instance.
port
The port of the ArcViz instance.
version
The current API version is v1. This increments
                                        if the item data format changes. Whenever possible, we
                                        intend to support older versions for backward
                                        compatibility.
data_type
One of the ArcViz artifacts: users, groups, roles, datasets,
                                        connections, visuals, segments, filter associations, or
                                        workspaces. 
object_id
The id of the individual object, such as a specific user,
                                        visual, or a specific dataset. You can either use the
                                                object_id or the
                                                object_name in the syntax, not
                                        both. 
object_name
The name of the individual object, such as a specific user,
                                        visual, or a specific dataset. You can either use the
                                                object_id or the
                                                object_name in the syntax, not
                                        both.
options
Further request options, such as level of information details
                                        when 'detail=true'.

                                                  [http|htttps]://host:port/arc/adminapi/version.
login_url
To authenticate the end user, address of the login URL, in the
                                        form
                                                [http|https]:/host:port/arc/apps/login.
