Admin API Syntax and General Usage
The Cloudera Data Visualization Admin API has a consistent
                pattern for each data type.
The Admin API has the following basic access syntax:
[http | https]:/host:port/arc/adminapi/version/data_type[/object_id][?options]
The parameters of this line are in Admin API syntax parameters.
HTTP Operations
The HTTP method specifies the following operation types:

GET

List of an item identified through the
                                                  object_id or
                                                  object_name, or all items,
                                                  with default summary information. The URL option
                                                  'detail=true' returns all data
                                                  details. 

POST

Update: The fields in the request data
                                                  update the item with matching object
                                                  _id.
Create: If the URL or request data does
                                                  not specify the object_id,
                                                  ArcViz creates a new data item. 
Validate: To verify that the connection is
                                                  successful, issue the POST
                                                  command two times:

Issue the POST command with the
                                                  validate flag set to
                                                  true.
                                                  [
  {
   "id":18,
   "name": "ArcEngine Dev",
   "type": "arcengine",
   "validate": "true",
   "info": {
   "PARAMS": {
   "HOST": "localhost",
   "PORT": "21051",
   "USERNAME": "admin",
   "SETTINGS": {
   "ANALYTICAL_VIEW_MAX_REFRESH_THREADS": "1",
   "MAX_PARTITIONS_FOR_REFRESH_INSERT": "1"
               }
.....
.....
             }
          }
  }
]
On success, issue the same POST command
                                                  without the validate flag. This step saves the
                                                  data.


DELETE

Delete the specified item.



HTTP Access Through Python
While you can use all standard HTTP access methods, we recommend the python request modules
                                approach for HTTP operations. Note the following common
                                setup:import json
import requests
api_url = [http|htttps]://host:port/arc/adminapi/version
login_url = [http|https]:/host:port/arc/apps/login
