Workspaces
Cloudera Data Visualization provides URL access to the ArcViz
                server object, workspaces. 
In addition to the standard public workspace that all users share, and the single
                        private workspace that each user has, Cloudera Data Visualization users with Create
                                Workspace privilege can create custom workspaces. These
                        workspaces may be shared by specific users and user groups, so they can
                        develop and view dashboards that are inherently useful to their line of
                        business. Within each of these workspaces, each user has a defined access
                        level: View Only, Edit, or Manage.

Access Control List in Workspaces
The workspace ACL is a list of privilege entries. Each entry contains
                                three items. The following acl syntax shows two
                                entries:"acl": [
  [entry_type, access_level, group_name],
  [entry_type, access_level, user_name]]


Entry

entry_type
1 = User,
                                                  2 = Group


access_level
1 = View,
                                                  2 = Edit, 3 =

                                                  entry_type



Creating Workspaces
The following code creates a new workspace Test
                                        workspace and provides View access to
                                a special group Everyone and Manage
                                access to user admin.
The actual APIKey and the method of retrieving the key depends on the
                                user system.
curl -s \
 -X POST \
 -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
 -H "Authorization: apikey apikey" \
 -d 'data=[{
      "name": "Test workspace",
      "desc": "Workspace created via admin api",
      "acl": [[2, 1, "Everyone"], [1, 3, "admin"]]
   }]' \

When viewing this workspace through the ArcViz GUI, it appears on the
                                workspace edit modal window like this:
