Admin API
Cloudera Data Visualization provides URL access to ArcViz server
        objects, such as users, groups, roles, datasets,
        segments, filter associations, connections, and visuals. This
        allows you to automate deployment operations, such as creating and managing roles, without
        logging into the ArcViz server console for access to command-line utilities.
Permissions
When running the Admin API interface, Cloudera Data Visualization
                enforces the same security rules as when using the graphical user interface, ArcViz.
                For example, a user must have Manage roles and users system-level permissions
                to create new users or update existing users.

Admin API is CRUD
We designed the Admin API for simple object access: Create, Read,
                    Update, and Delete. Hence, CRUD. It does not support high-level
                operations, such as adding tables to the dataset.
