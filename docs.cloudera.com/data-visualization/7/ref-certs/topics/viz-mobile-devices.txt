Mobile devices

In addition to desktop use, you may access Arcadia Data (in View mode only) from many
      mobile devices.This allows you to provide access to insightful information at a summary level, and quickly informs the user if there is an issue
        that needs deeper investigation.
We certified the following devices to display visuals and dashboards:

Android OS smartphones
iOS smartphones
iOS tablets

While you cannot manipulate datasets, or edit visuals and dashboards, you can access all
      existing visuals for which you have view permissions in View mode, and use existing filters
      and drill-downs. The URL address syntax is of the following type:
[ip_address]/arc/apps/app/[app_id]
tip
We recommend that dashboards designed for mobile viewing be simple and intuitive, and
        minimize the need for scrolling. The visuals should use a small number of dimensions so as
        not to clutter a small screen, and filters should be minimal.
