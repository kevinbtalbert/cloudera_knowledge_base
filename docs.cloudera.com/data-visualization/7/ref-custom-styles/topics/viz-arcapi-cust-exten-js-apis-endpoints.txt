Extension JS API endpoints

JavaScript module returns an object that may implement one of the endpoints: version(), supported(), settings(), disableDraw(), beforeDraw(), afterDraw(), and afterDataRequest().
version()
This must exist, and reports on the version of the API that this object implements.
        Currently supported version strings is "1". This must be a string, not a
        number.

supported()
If this member exists, it is expected to be an object that contains a member called
          visualType. This member must point to a string with the type of visual
        supported, or an array of strings that contain the types of visuals supported.
For example,
supported: {
  visualType: "trellis-bars"
},

settings()
If a member with this name exists, it is expected to be a function that returns an array.
        Each array element is then expected to be an object with the following members:
settings: function() {
  return [
    {
      id: "Column Name"
    },
    {
      id: "Max bar width",
      defaultValue: "50"
    },
    {
      id: "Color",
      defaultValue: "steelblue"
    }
  ];
},

disableDraw()
If a member with this name exists, and it is a function that returns a
          boolean variable set to true, we disable the drawing of
        the visual.

beforeDraw()
If a member with this name exists, it must be a function that executes after receiving data
        but before the draw event on the visual.

afterDraw()
If a member with this name exists, it must be a function that executes after the draw event
        on the underlying visual.

afterDataRequest()
If a member with this name exists, it must be a function that executes after creating the
        request object, but before the data request call. This function accepts the current request
        object in the arguments, adds your modifications, and returns an updated valid request
        object. If the function does not return a valid request object, the request is not sent, and
        the system returns an error.
