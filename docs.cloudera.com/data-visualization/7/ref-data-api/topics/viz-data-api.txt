Data API
Cloudera Data Visualization provides an interface for applications
        that fetch data through a REST interface.
Typically, users access Cloudera Data Visualization's web server through
            a web browser, and the interface is entirely visual. This visual interface interacts
            directly with Cloudera Data Visualization's data layer, which in turn
            provides seamless access to modeled data, integrated security controls, fast access to
            data in connected systems, and access to advanced analytics.
Sometimes, operational data applications do not need access to Cloudera Data Visualization's visual layer, but require direct access
            to the data layer. For these purposes, Arcadia supports a Data API that provides
            operational data applications with direct access to data.
