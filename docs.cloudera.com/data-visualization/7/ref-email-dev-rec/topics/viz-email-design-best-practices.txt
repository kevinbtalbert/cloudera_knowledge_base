Email design best practices

When planning emails or email campaigns, consider incorporating the following
   recommendations:

The maximum email width should not exceed 600-800 pixels; this works best in the preview pane
    of most email clients.
Design for simplicity: use grid-based layers, and avoid complicated elements that require
    float and positioning settings.
Most email clients block images initially. Design for this by minimizing unnecessary
    graphics, and always use alternate text.
Ensure that images that you add by URL can be accessed by the intended email recipients. In
    other words, if the images are behind a firewall, make sure that all recipients have sufficient
    credentials. Even taking this into account, consider the lifecycle of a typical email message:
    that it may be forwarded, and shared with people outside the immediate distribution circle.
Some images, such as background, fail to load altogether. Design accordingly.
Do not rely on images, or compositions of smaller images into a large one, to communicate
    your message. While large graphic elements may look very attractive in preview, they perform
    poorly.
Use basic, cross-platform fonts such as Roboto, Arial, Verdana,
     Georgia, and Times New Roman. Your custom font may not be loaded on the email
    client where it arrives.
Avoid elements that require Flash or JavaScript, because they may not be supported by the
    recipient's mail client. If you need motion in an email, use *.gif files.
Plan for mobile users: 
Is your email readable at armâ€™s length on a small screen?
Will the images slow its load time on a mobile device?
Are your links easy to press with a thumb?
