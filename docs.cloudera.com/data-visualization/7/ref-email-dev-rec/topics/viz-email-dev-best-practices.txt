Email development best practices

Consider the following suggestions when using HTML in your email:

Code all structures using the table element. For more complicated layouts, you should nest
    tables to build complex structures.
Use element attributes (such as cellpadding, valign, and
     width) to set table dimensions. This forces a box-model structure.
Keep your CSS simple. Avoid the following coding styles: 
Compound style declarations: font:#000 12px Arial, Helvetica,
      sans-serif;
Shorthand code: #000 instead of #000000
CSS layout properties: slot, position, clear, visibility, and so on
Complex selectors: descendant, child or sibling selectors, and pseudo-elements


Inline all CSS before finalizing emails or email templates.
Use only absolute links for images, and host these images on a reliable server.
Do not code with JavaScript or Flash; most email clients do not support these
    technologies.
Plan for mobile users, and make emails as responsive as possible: 
Use media queries to increase text sizes on small screens
Provide thumb-sized hit areas for links, approximately 46 px by 46 px


Test often. Create email accounts across various services, and send emails to yourself to see
    the appearance of emails on various clients.
