Permission levels for Role Based Access

The following table shows the RBAC permissions supported in Cloudera Data Visualization. Administrators specify these permissions when they
      define roles, and subsequently assign the appropriate roles to users or user groups.
Permissions fall into four groups: 
System-level permissions:

Create workspaces
Manage roles and users
Manage site settings
Manage custom styles
View activity logs
Manage jobs, email templates
Manage data connections


Role-level permissions:

Grant manage dataset
Grant manage dashboards
Grant view dashboards


Connection-level permissions:

Manage analytical views
Import data
Create datasets, explore tables


Dataset-level permissions:

Manage dataset
Manage dashboards
View dashboards



Create workspaces
System-level permission.
This enables the user to create new workspaces that may be shared among users and user
        groups.

Manage roles and users
System-level permission.
This enables the user to create users, user groups, and roles.
By default, this permission also enables the user to manage Filter Associations on the
        dataset management interface. Alternatively, you can configure the system to decouple Filter
        Associations from this permission; instead, configure Filter Associations as part of dataset
        management, during individual dataset permission configuration. See Manage dataset to manage the filter association
        configuration for the dataset.

Manage site settings
System-level permission.
This allows the user to mange the global site settings.

Manage custom styles
System-level permission.
This allows the user to create new styles for dashboards and visuals.

Manage jobs, email templates
System-level permission.
This allows the user to manage scheduled jobs and create templates for email messages.

View activity logs
System-level permission.
This allows the user to view usage statistics and monitor the performance of Cloudera Data Visualization.

Manage data connections
System-level permission.
Users with this permission can create and manage connections to various data sources.

Grant manage dataset
Role-level permission.
This permission enables the users to grant manage dataset privileges to specific roles,
        provided the user has the Manage dataset
        privilege for that dataset.

Grant manage dashboards
Role-level permission.
This permission enables the users to grant manage dashboard privileges to specific roles,
        provided the user has the Manage dataset
        privilege for that dataset.

Grant view dashboards
Role-level permission.
This permission enables the users to grant view dashboard privileges to specific roles,
        provided the user has the Manage dataset
        privilege for that dataset.

Manage analytical views
Connection-level permission.
This permission enables users to create and manage analytical views.

Import data
Connection-level permission.
Users with this privilege can import supplemental data into an existing connection.

Create datasets, explore tables
Connection-level permission.
This permission allows users to create new datasets from existing tables, view sample data,
        and explore statistical reports on the data tables.

Manage dataset
Dataset-level permission.
This permission lets the user change the properties of datasets, create datasets over
        joined tables, modify the fields of the dataset, and so on.
To enable FA configuration based on manage dataset permission, instead of Manage roles and users, change the
          settings.py file by adding the following line:
MANAGE_DS_FA = True

Manage dashboards
Dataset-level permission.
This permission enables the user to create and modify visuals and dashboards.

View dashboards
Dataset-level permission.
This is typically used to limit the users to view-only privileges for visuals and
        dashboards, while denying edit privileges.
