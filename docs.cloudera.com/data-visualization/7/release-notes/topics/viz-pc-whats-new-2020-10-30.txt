This marks the General Availability (GA) of the first CDP Data Visualization
      release. Data Visualization, the latest Cloudera feature built into the CDP platform can be
      accessed through Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) and Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) in the
      Public Cloud. It can also be accessed on-prem in CDSW. 
It allows data engineers, data scientists, business analysts, and business users to
      quickly and easily explore data, collaborate, act on, and communicate explainable insights
      across the data lifecycle.
Fully integrated with CDW, CML, and CDSW, CDP Data Visualization (CDV) provides
      self-service and drag-and-drop visualization from both enterprise data and predictive models
      natively in CDP.
CDV enables:


Fast, intelligent reporting – Rapid, out-of-the-box dashboarding and
          application building with built-in visual recommendations


Intuitive workflows, secured by SDX – Easy-to-use visual UI for fast data
          exploration and instant sharing anywhere without moving data or creating silos


Integrated data lifecycle collaboration – Accelerate insight sharing with a
          consistent, integrated data visualization experience across all data and business
          teams
