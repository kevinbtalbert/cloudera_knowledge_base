What's new in Data Visualization 7.0.1

Cloudera Data Visualization (CDV) 7.0.1 was released on June 29, 2022 introducing the following
   changes.
New features and improvements in Cloudera Data Visualization 7.0.1

VIZ-1396
[Tech Preview] Data connections to Snowflake are now available as a technical preview
      feature.
VIZ-1315, VIZ-1427, and VIZ-1441
Introduced a per-user concurrency setting in data connections that allow users to limit the
      number of queries a single user can occupy. This prevents one user from blocking connection
      access for an entire connection. Added a Current Load panel to the Profile Data modal that
      allows users to view and manage ongoing queries.
VIZ-1336 and VIZ-1149
Added dataset switching to filters, so users can quickly change the filter across datasets
      and connections. Users can now also quickly change the dataset for all filters and visuals in
      a sheet.
VIZ-672
The dashboard layout interface now includes names and images of relevant visuals for easier
      visual identification when moving and resizing visuals.
VIZ-1351
When editing a Dashboard’s style in the Dashboard Designer modal, it is now possible to
      reset all styles to original.
