In the Dataset Detail menu, select Filter
            Associations.






In the Filter Associations interface, click New Filter Association.






In the Add Filter Association window modal, perform the following actions:


Under Filter Association Name, enter CA SalesReps.
Under Applied Segments, select is California from
              Geographic Regions.
On the Users tab, select users CArep1 and CArep2,
              and Add them to the filter association.
Click Create.






Note that the new filter association now appears on the Filter
            Associations interface.
