Setting roles


To specify roles that restrict row-level access, we need to define the appropriately
        restrictive roles, and assign individual users or user groups to them.


Follow the instructions covered in our articles Creating Segments from Filter
            Definitions, Role privilages, and Editing role
            assignments.

Define a role with following specifications:


Name
See_Customer_Data
Description
Sales Reps can see customer data

On the Privileges interface, we have:

System Privileges
None
Dataset Privileges
Customer Value Analysis dataset, on the sample connection (this may
                vary depending on where you loaded the data).
Permission
View visuals and apps




On the Members interface, we have:

Users
None
Groups
SalesReps
