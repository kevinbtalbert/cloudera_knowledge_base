Verifying access restriction on a visual


To ensure that we specified the access restrictions correctly, let us view the same visual as
        an Administrative user, and as a user who is linked to each of the three filter associations
        declared in the previous section. 


Log in as a user with Administrative privileges, and navigate to the application.
          Notice that the entire dataset appears in the visual; for example, it shows 4,621
          Four-Door Cars.






Log in as a user associated with the dataset through the CA SalesReps filter
          association. Such a user, in this case CArep1, can only see records available for
          the state of California. For example, when you navigate to the application, you can only
          see 1,593 records for Four-Door Cars.






If you log in as AZrep1, a user associated with the dataset through the
            Mountain SalesReps filter association, you could only see records available for
          the states of Arizona and Nevada. For example, when you login as AZrep1 and
          navigate to the application, you can see only 1,325 records for Four-Door Cars.






Finally, if you log in as WArep1, a user associated with the dataset through the
            North West SalesReps filter association, you would see records available for the
          states of Oregon and Washington, but none of the others. For example, when you login as
            WArep1 and navigate to the application, you see 1,703 records for Four-Door
          Cars.
