RBAC setup for dataset publishing

RBAC gives dataset creators an opportunity to 'publish' or share their datasets through a set
      of grants based role-based privileges. They can grant access to specific roles though the
         Grant manage dataset, Grant manage dashboards, and Grant
        view dashboards permissions.
note

Only users with Manage roles and users role privileges (typically
          system administrators) can set up the roles and permissions, and define users and user
          groups. 


For the purpose of demonstrating how dataset publishing works, consider this relatively
      simple scenario: 


There are three teams: Marketing, Sales, and Operations.
There are three distinct access levels in each team: Data Admins, Analysts, and Visual
          Consumers.


To set up the required permissions, roles, groups, and users, read these topics:

Setting the dataset recipient roles
Setting the dataset publisher role
Define groups for teams and access levels
Assign groups to roles
Assign users to groups

After you complete these steps, Data Admins may publish their datasets, as described in
        Publishing datasets.
