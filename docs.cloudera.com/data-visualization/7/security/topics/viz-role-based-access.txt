Role-based access control
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a mechanism that restricts system access. It
    involves setting permissions and privileges to enable access to authorized users only. Access
    rights and actions are assigned according to a user's role within CDP Data
    Visualization.
noteThis feature is only available to users with administrative privileges.
RBAC enables administrators to exercise fine-grain control over data and feature access
      based on roles. Everyone who holds a certain role has the same set of rights. Those who hold
      different roles have different rights. For more information, see Role
      privileges.
RBAC consists of the following components:
Permissions
Permissions define access to visuals, datasets, data connections, and system-level
            functions. There are four categories of permissions: system, role, connection, and
            dataset. For more information, see the List of permissions.
Privileges
Privileges are sets of permissions of a particular type and the associated components
            on which the permissions are granted. For example, a privilege may consist of the
            permission View visuals and dashboards on component specifier Connection
              default / All datasets.
Members
Members are a list of users and groups that are assigned to a particular role.
Roles
Roles are collections of privileges and associated members who have these
            privileges.
