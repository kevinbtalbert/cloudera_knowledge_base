Security model
Security in CDP Data Visualization means authentication and permission granularity.
    It involves many components, including role-based access control, which enables fine-grain
    control over data and feature access.
As an administrator, you can configure roles, privileges, and members. For more
      information, see Working with user roles. You can manage privileges and members
      of a role witth the help of  Role-based access control. User roles are further
      leveraged to enable dataset creators and managers to share curated datasets with their
      organization, while exercising three levels of access control. For more information, see
        Publishing datasets.  You can also restrict a user's access to defined data
      segments. For more information, see Setting segments. Additionally, you can also
      configure LDAP authentication. For more information, see Enabling LDAP
        authentication.
