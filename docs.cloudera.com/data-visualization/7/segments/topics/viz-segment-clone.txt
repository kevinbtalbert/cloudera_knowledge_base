Cloning segments
CDP Data Visualization lets you clone an existing segment definition.

On the main navigation bar, click DATA.

Select Flight Delays dataset.Dataset side navigation appears, open
          at Dataset Detail view.
In the side navigation menu, click Segments.
In the Segments list, find the segment to clone, and click
            Clone.

In this example, we are cloning Delayed Flights to create a new segment
              On-Time Departure.



A pre-populated Add Segment modal window appears named Copy
              of Delayed Flights.


Edit the Add Segment modal window by changing its entries.


Change Segment Name, to On-Time Departure.
Leave Segment Group as is.
Under Filters, click the text box to open the
                Filter Expression modal window.





Replace the filter expression. In our example, we are adding the following
          expression:

[airtime] IS NOT NULL AND [depdelay] < = 0

Optional: 
Click Validate Expression to verify correctness.






Click Apply to save the filter and return to the Add
            Segment modal window.

Under Filters, notice the new filter expression.

Click Save.





The new segment definition appears in the Segments
          interface.

Note the similarity in the definition of the two filters, Delayed Flights and
              On-Time Departure.
