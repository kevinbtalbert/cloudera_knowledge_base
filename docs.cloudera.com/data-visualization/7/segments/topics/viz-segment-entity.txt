    enables cohort analysis.

On the main navigation bar, click Data.

Select Flight Delays dataset.Dataset side navigation appears, open
          at Dataset Detail view.
In the side navigation menu, click Segments.

In the Segments list, find the segment to clone, and click
            sClone.

To make our task simpler, we are first cloning the Delayed Departure segment
            that was created in Cloning Segments .


A pre-populated Add Segment modal window appears.


Edit the Add Segment modal window by changing its entries.


Change Segment Name to Delayed Airlines.
Leave other fields 'as is'.
Under Entity to extract, click the text box to open the
                Entity Expression modal window.





In the Entity Expression modal window, enter the following
          expression: 

[airlineid]

Optional: 
Click Validate Expression to verify correctness.






Click Apply to save the expression and return to the
            Add Segment modal window.

In the Add Segment modal window, notice the new expression in the
            Entity to extract field. 

Click Save.



The new segment definition appears in the Segments interface.
            The segment Delayed Airlines has an entry in the Entity
            column, airlineid.
