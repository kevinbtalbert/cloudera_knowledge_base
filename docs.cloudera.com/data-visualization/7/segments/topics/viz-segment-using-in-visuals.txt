Using segments in visuals
This article demonstrates how segments work in a visual. 

After creating segments in the Dataset Segments user interface. See,
          Creating Segments. Or creating segments from filter definitions of a visual, you
        can view this segmented data in a visual. See Creating Segments from Filters.


Click Data in the side navigation bar of the visual
          interface.



The segments (and the segment group) that you defined earlier appear in the
              Segments menu.




Select one of the segments, and click Refresh Visual.

We selected North West.
The visual only shows the rows that match the segment criteria. In our case, the states
              WA and OR.
