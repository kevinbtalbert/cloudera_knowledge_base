Starting Data Visualization with ML Runtime
Cloudera Data Visualization (CDV) is integrated with Cloudera Data Science Workbench
    (CDSW) workflows. You can use it in an on-prem environment by running it as a project
    application inside of CDSW. One option for accessing Data Visualization is to set ML Runtime as
    the default engine.

For more information about ML Runtimes, see Managing ML Runtimes.
tipIn CDP Public Cloud, you can also work with Data Visualization in:
Cloudera Machine Learning service
Cloudera Data Warehouse service
