Starting Data Visualization integrated in CDW
Cloudera Data Visualization (CDV) is integrated with Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) for
    creating graphic representations of data. You can build custom dashboards and analytic
    applications to enable users to explore data across the whole CDP data lifecycle.
Data Visualization is not tied to a particular Virtual Warehouse (VW). You can access data
      for your visualization from multiple Data Catalogs using multiple Hive or Impala Virtual
      Warehouses and multiple environments.
Having multiple Data Visualization instances attached to an environment, you can create
      dashboards for different groups. When you delete a Virtual Warehouse, your visuals remain
      intact.
