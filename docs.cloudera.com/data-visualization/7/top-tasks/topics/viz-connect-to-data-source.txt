Connecting to a data source in CDP Data Visualization
Data Visualization allows you to create connections to many types of external data
    sources.
When using Data Visualization in CDP Public Cloud with Cloudera
      Data Warehouse (CDW), the data connection is automatically set up, but you can connect to
      other data sources as well. In Cloudera Machine Learning (CML), you can connect to an Impala
      or a Hive data warehouse, or tie in data from predictive CML models.
The supported connection types are: 
Impala
Hive
Druid
SQLite
MySQL
MariaDB
PostgreSQL


Creating a CML data connection to an Impala data warehouseLearn how to connect natively to data stored in Impala when using CDP Data     Visualization in Cloudera Machine Learning (CML).Creating a CML data connection to a Hive data warehouseLearn how to connect natively to data stored in Hive when using CDP Data Visualization     in Cloudera Machine Learning (CML).Creating a CDW data connection in Data VisualizationLearn how to connect to data when using CDP Data Visualization in Cloudera Data     Warehouse (CDW) data service. You can connect Data Visualization to a Virtual Warehouse to     visualize your data. Similar to using a BI client, you can configure and connect to Virtual     Warehouses from different clusters.Creating a CDSW data connection to a data warehouseLearn how to connect natively to data stored in a data warehouse when using CDP Data     Visualization in Cloudera Data Science Workbench (CDSW).
