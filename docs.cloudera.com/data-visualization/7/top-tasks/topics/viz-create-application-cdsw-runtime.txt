Creating Data Visualization application in CDSW using ML Runtime
Learn how to create a Data Visualization application when using ML Runtime in Cloudera
    Data Science Workbench (CDSW).
Go to a project's Overview page.On the left sidebar, click Applications.Click New Application.

Provide the following details for your new application:

Name – Enter a name for the application.
Subdomain – Enter a subdomain that will be used to construct the URL for the web
              application. Make sure it contains URL friendly characters.
Description – Enter a description for the application.
Script - Select the path to the startup script.note Use the script in the
                location: /opt/vizapps/tools/arcviz/startup_app.py.
Kernel – Select Cloudera Data Visualization for the kernel supported by the Runtime
              variant of the CDSW project.
Edition – Select the edition of the Runtime variant you want to use for your
                application.noteFor Data Visualization, the selected edition
                automatically defines the version of the Runtime variant.

Click Create Application.

In a few minutes, you should see the application status change to Running on the
          Applications page. The running application now has a hosted, fully-functional Data
        Visualization platform.
You can Stop, Restart, or
          Delete a CDSW application from the Actions
        drop-down menu on the Applications page.
If you want to make changes to an existing application,  open Application
          Details and go to the Settings tab to make any changes
        and update the application.
