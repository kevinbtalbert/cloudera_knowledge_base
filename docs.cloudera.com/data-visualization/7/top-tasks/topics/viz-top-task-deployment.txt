Deploying Data Visualization in CDP
The first step to start using Cloudera Data Visualization (CDV) in Cloudera Data
  Platform (CDP) is to deploy it on your chosen platform. CDV provides consistent visualization
  capabilities across hybrid deployments and experiences. Once you have your CDV instance up and
  running, you can start creating visuals, build custom dashboards and analytic applications to
  enable users to explore data across the whole CDP data lifecycle.
Data Visualization is integrated with CDP so you can just log in with your CDP credentials and
   start analyzing data that you have access to. In the Public Cloud, Data Visualization is included
   as a core capability in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) and Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) both
   for Azure and AWS. Data Visualization is available in CDP Private Cloud Data Warehouse, and it
   can also be used in Cloudera Data Science Workbench (CDSW), certified with CDH, HDP and CDP
   Private Cloud Base.

Starting Data Visualization integrated in CDWCloudera Data Visualization (CDV) is integrated with Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) for     creating graphic representations of data. You can build custom dashboards and analytic     applications to enable users to explore data across the whole CDP data lifecycle.Starting Data Visualization with ML RuntimeCloudera Data Visualization (CDV) is integrated with Cloudera Data Science Workbench     (CDSW) workflows. You can use it in an on-prem environment by running it as a project     application inside of CDSW. One option for accessing Data Visualization is to set ML Runtime as     the default engine.
