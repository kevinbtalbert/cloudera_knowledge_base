Setting up a basic visual for aggregates

In this example, a basic line visual is created on the World Life
                Expectancy dataset. In subsequent topics, this visual is used to
            demonstrate how the various analytic functions for aggregates work.

Open a new visual.

In the VISUALS menu, select the
                        Lines visual type.

Populate the shelves of the visual from the fields listed in the Data
                    menu:
