Percentage difference from previous value analytic function
This article describes how to use the Percent Difference from Previous Value
    analytic function in CDP Data Visualization.

Click the field on the measurement shelf.In this example, the
            sum(population) field on the Y Axis
          shelf.
In the FIELD PROPERTIES menu, expand Analytic
            Functions, and select % Difference from
          Previous.






In the Analytic Function: Percentage Difference from Previous
            Value modal window:



In Select aggregate for this measure, leave the default
                  Sum. The other aggregation options are Count, Minimum,
                  Maximum, and Average. In addition, some connection types also
                support Approximate Distinct Count and Exact Distinct Count.


Under Select entities over which to take % difference from previous
                  value, select country. This is the grouping that applies when
                calculating the % difference from previous values.


Under Select the sort order, you can specify the order of
                sorting. This order specifies what the previous row is, and the row where the value
                is taken. If your visual already specifies sorting order, these values appear in the
                modal.
noteYou can add additional sort parameters, by clicking the
                  (Plus) icon.
In this example, edit the sort order to be: country ascending, followed by
                  year ascending.

Under Offset, specify the number of previous rows over which
              the function executes.






Click APPLY.
Optional: 
If you examine the expression in the Enter/Edit Expression
          interface, it shows that the function has the following form:

(sum([population]) - LAG(sum([population]), 1) 
over (partition by [country] order by [country], [year])) / LAG(sum([population]), 1) 
over (partition by [country] order by [country], [year]) 
as 'pct diff from prev(population)'


Click REFRESH VISUAL.

You can see the change in the appearance of the Y axis and the tooltip, from
            displaying the sum(population) in millions to
              population as a percentage difference from previous value.
Hover over any country to view the percentage difference of population from the
            previous year. In the following example, the tooltip shows an increase in the
            population of Libya from previous year 1964 to the current year
              1965 by 3.92%.
