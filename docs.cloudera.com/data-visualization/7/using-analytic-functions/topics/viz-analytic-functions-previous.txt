Previous value analytic function
This article describes how to use the Previous Value analytic function in CDP Data
    Visualization.

Click the field on the measurement shelf.In this example, the
            sum(population) field on the Y Axis
          shelf.
In the FIELD PROPERTIES menu, expand Analytic
            Functions, and select Previous Value.






In the Analytic Function: Previous Value modal window:



In Select aggregate for this measure, leave the default
                  Sum. The other aggregation options are Count, Minimum,
                  Maximum, and Average. In addition, some connection types also
                support Approximate Distinct Count and Exact Distinct Count.


Under Select entities over which to tale previous value,
                select state. This is the grouping that applies when calculating previous
                values.


Under Select the sort order, click the
                  Plus icon, select year, and then set it to
                  ascending sort order. This order specifies what determines what the
                previous row is, and the row where the value is taken.
noteYou can add additional sort parameters, by clicking the
                  (Plus) icon.


Under Offset, specify the number of previous rows over which
                the function executes.







Click APPLY.
Optional: 
If you examine the expression in the Enter/Edit Expression
          interface, it shows that the function has the following form:
            LAG(sum([population]), 1) over (partition by [year] order by [year], [country])
            as 'previous value(population)'

Click REFRESH VISUAL.
You can see the change to the appearance of the visual, and the change in values that
          appear on the tooltip.
