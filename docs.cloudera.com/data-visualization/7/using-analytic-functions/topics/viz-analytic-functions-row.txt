Row number function
This article describes how to use the Row Number analytic function in CDP Data
    Visualization.

Click a field on the dimension shelf. In this case, choose the
            population field.
In the FIELD PROPERTIES menu, select
            Duplicate.

Click the second population field.
In FIELD PROPERTIES, expand Analytic
            Functions, and select Row Number.






In the Analytic Function: Row Number modal window:



Under Select entities over which to calculate row number,
                you can select any of the fields: country, life expectancy, or
                  GDP. This is the grouping that applies when calculating the row number.


Under Select the sort order, you can specify the order of
                sorting. This order specifies what the row is, and the row where the value is taken.
                If your visual already specifies sorting order, these values appear in the modal. 
noteYou can add additional sort parameters, by clicking the
                  (Plus) icon.
In this example, leave the default order: life expectancy descending,
                followed by country and GDP, both ascending.







Click APPLY.
Optional: 
If you examine the expression in the Enter/Edit Expression
          interface, it shows that the function has the following form: 

ROW_NUMBER() over ( order by [life_expectancy], [country], [gdp_per_capita]*[population]) as 'row number'


Click REFRESH VISUAL.

You can see that initially, the row number numbers are descending, following the
            order of the primary sorting column, life expectancy. If you sort the table on
            another column, such as population, the row number numbers appear
            disordered.
