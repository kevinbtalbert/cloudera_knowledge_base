Filtering on an element


A line chart display can become very crowded, making it difficult to discern which
                line models a particular series. For example, the World Life Expectancy
                dataset models data for over 200 countries. In View mode, you can click on a
                particular element of a legend, and filter data for just that element.


Find the World Population - Lines visual.

Make sure that the visual displays the legend.
If the legend is not displayed, follow the steps outlined in Adding and
                        removing legend to add it.

 Switch to Dashboard View mode.

 Click one of the options in the legend for the visual, to see only the data
                    for that country.
 In this example, Albania is shown.

The new chart displays the line for Albania only. Additionally, the
                        horizontal axis adjusts for the dimension range. Albania reports data
                        starting in year 1934.CDP Data Visualization lists all applicable
                        filters at the top of the vertical axis. Hovering over them shows the values
                        of the filters.
