Adding field comments in dataset
When working with large datasets data, it can be useful to have access to comprehensive
    field-level descriptions. In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can use field comments to provide
    the context and meaning of each dataset field.

The following steps demonstrate how to add description to a column of a dataset, as a
        'comment'. In this example, the column iso_cc (the ISO-compliant country
        code) is used from the dataset World Life Expectancy [data source
          samples.world_life_expectancy].


On the main navigation bar, click DATA.

The Data view appears, open on the Datasets tab.


In the left navigation menu, click samples.

In the Datasets area, select World Life
            Expectancy
(samples.world_life_expectancy).

In the Dataset Detail menu, select
          Fields.






In the Fields interface, select EDIT
            FIELDS.






Under Dimensions, find the field iso_cc, and
          click the down arrow icon on the right.

Click the Edit (pencil) icon.




The Edit Field Parameters window modal appears.


Under Field Comment, add the following text:

ISO 3166 Country Code Standard, Numeric, described in
            http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes. Mappings are at
            https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search.


Click APPLY.






Click SAVE in the top row.

Click Show Comments to display the field comment.






To hide field comments, click Hide Comments.
