Automatically renaming dataset fields
Quite often, the column names of the base data tables are not very human-friendly.
    Cloudera Data Visualization gives you the option to automatically adjust field names at the
    level of the dataset.

The following steps demonstrate how to prevent data fields from appearing in visualizations
        and applications of dataset World Life Expectancy [data source
          samples.world_life_expectancy]. The fields comments,
          lat, and lng are empty, so they are good candidates for
        this operation.


On the main navigation bar, click DATA.

The Data view appears, open on the Datasets tab.


In the left navigation menu, click samples.

In the Datasets area, select World Life
            Expectancy
(samples.world_life_expectancy).

In the Dataset Detail menu, select
          Fields.






In the Fields interface, select EDIT
            FIELDS.






Near the top of the page, click TITLE CASE.




The field titles change. For example, the Measure
gdp_per_captia appears as GDP Per Capita.
noteThe Title Case option does not affect fields that are calculated over table fields,
            such as gdp.


Click SAVE.
