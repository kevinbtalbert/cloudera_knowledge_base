Changing custom field display format
In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can Set currency display options for numerical
    fields across all visuals of a dataset.

Follow these steps to continue configuring a field at the dataset level for custom format.
        See Changing the field display format for the initial navigation steps.


In the Edit Field Parameters window modal, under the
            Display Format tab, select Custom Format from the
            Category menu.

Under Customize Format, enter $S.


$ appends the dollar currency symbol to the left of the
              number.
S simplifies the number by minimizing the significant numbers
              (which on the axes appear with a large number of trailing zeros) and appending the
              appropriate non-scientific (currency) suffix to the right of the number.

note
Display Format Examples demonstrate some of the available
              options for defining custom format.






Click APPLY.

Save the changes to the dataset.

[Optional] To verify that the format applies to all new visuals that use the field,
          create a new visual by repeating the steps in  Testing the calculated
          field..


When we use the $S custom format on the gdp field, the
        visual still uses the dollar currency sign, but also simplifies/abbreviates the number and
        shows the corresponding currency suffix. In the case of this visual,
          T for trillion; this custom format transforms the representation
          $2,500,000,000,000.00 into $2.5T.
