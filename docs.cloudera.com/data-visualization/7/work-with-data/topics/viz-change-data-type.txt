Changing data type
Cloudera Data Visualization allows you to change the effective data type of a column in
    the dataset model without changing the source data. This is useful in many business environments
    to ensure correct processing of numerical codes, catalog numbers, event IDs, dates, and so
    on.

The following steps demonstrate how to change the type of a column. The column
          iso_cc (the ISO-compliant country code) in the dataset World Life
        Expectancy [data source samples.world_life_expectancy] is used.


On the main navigation bar, click DATA.

In the left navigation menu, click samples.

In the Datasets area, select World Life
            Expectancy
(samples.world_life_expectancy).

In the Dataset Detail menu, select
          Fields.






In the Fields interface, select EDIT
            FIELDS.






Under Dimensions, find the field fips_code, and
          click the down arrow icon, immediately following the
            # icon.

In the menu, select String.






Under Dataset: World Life Expectancy, click
            Save.


All new visuals created from this dataset will automatically use the new type.
noteUse this functionality carefully, as it may break the visuals that already use the
        column in aggregations or custom expressions.
