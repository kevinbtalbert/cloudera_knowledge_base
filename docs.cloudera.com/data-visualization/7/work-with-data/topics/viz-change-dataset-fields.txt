Changing dataset fields
It is easy to make changes to the fields of a dataset in Cloudera Data
    Visualization.
Editing dataset fieldsYou can edit the fields of a dataset by using the Edit button on the dataset field     tile, next to the drop-down icon.Hiding dataset fields from applicationsYou may find it useful to hide dataset fields that are not typically used for     visualizations to prevent unintended bias in BI and analytics, or even to obscure confidential     data. In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can do this by turning off the default visibility     option of a particular dataset field.Changing field aggregationYou can change the basic fields defaults in your dataset.Creating calculated fieldsIn Cloudera Data Visualization, you can easily create a new calculated field in the     dataset, and subsequently use it in dashboards and visuals.Changing the field display formatCloudera Data Visualization lets you configure the display format of each field at the     dataset level.Changing data typeCloudera Data Visualization allows you to change the effective data type of a column in     the dataset model without changing the source data. This is useful in many business environments     to ensure correct processing of numerical codes, catalog numbers, event IDs, dates, and so     on.Specifying geographic fieldsIn Cloudera Data Visualization, you can explicitly specify a dataset field as one of     the many supported geographical types. Adding field commentsWhen working with big data, it can be very helpful to have access to comprehensive     field-level descriptions. In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can use field comments to provide     the context and meaning of each dataset field.Automatically renaming dataset fieldsQuite often, the column names of the base data tables are not very human-friendly.     Cloudera Data Visualization gives you the option to automatically adjust field names at the     level of the dataset.Custom renaming dataset fieldsOften, we find it useful to rename a frequently-used field directly in the dataset,     instead of using an alias in each visual. Cloudera Visualization makes it very easy to change     the display name of a dataset field.Refreshing a datasetYou can refresh an existing dataset if the underlying tables change or if you update     the associated extract with new or changed fields.
