Changing field aggregation
You can change the basic fields defaults in your dataset.

The following steps demonstrate how to change the default aggregation function from
          Sum to Average for the field life_expectancy  in the
        dataset World Life Expectancy [data source:
        main.world_life_expectancy].


On the main navigation bar, click DATA.

The Data view appears, open on the Datasets tab.


In the left navigation menu, click samples.

In the Datasets area, select World Life
            Expectancy
(samples.world_life_expectancy).

In the Dataset Detail menu, select
          Fields.






In the Fields interface, select EDIT
            FIELDS.






Under Measures, find the field life_expectancy
          and click the (down arrow) icon on its right side.

Click the Edit (pencil) icon.




The Edit Field Parameters window modal appears.


Change Default Aggregation from Sum to Average,
          and click APPLY.






Under Dataset: World Life Expectancy, click
            SAVE.


As a result of this change, all new visuals created from this dataset will
        automatically use the new aggregation.
