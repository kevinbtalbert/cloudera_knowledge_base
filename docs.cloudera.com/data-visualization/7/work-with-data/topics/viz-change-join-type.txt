Changing join types
Learn how you can change the join type in a table in CDP Data
    Visualization.

The following steps demonstrate how to change the join type in the
          airport_codes table from the default Left
        join to the Right join.

Navigate to the Data Model page of the dataset.Click Edit Data Model to edit the data model.

Click the (link) icon that represents the connection that
          must be changed.
In our example, we clicked the join with the table
            airport_codes.

The Join Details modal window appears.
In the Join Details modal window, select an alternate join
          type.
For example, instead of the default Left join, select
              Right join.

Click outside the Join Details modal window, or click
            Edit Join Details.Click Save.
