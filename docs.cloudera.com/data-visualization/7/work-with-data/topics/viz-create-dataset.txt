Creating a dataset
Cloudera Data Visualization allows you to create datasets based on your
    data.
There are three options for creating datasets:
Creating datasets in the Data interface
Creating datasets from a query
Creating datasets in the Connection Explorer

Creating datasets in the Data interface


On the main navigation bar, click DATA.
The Data view appears, open on the Datasets tab.

Click NEW DATASET near the top of the screen.






In the New Dataset modal window, specify the following
            values:


Dataset title

Specify here the name of the new dataset.



Dataset Source

In the menu, you can choose either the From Tables (default) or From
                    SQL option. Leave the selection as From Tables.



Select Database.

Scroll the list of connected databases to select the correct database.



Select Table

Scroll the list of tables to select the correct table.









Click CREATE.
You can now see the new dataset under the Datasets tab.

noteTo find the dataset in the future, you can scroll through the list of
              datasets on the connection, or use Search at the top of the
              page.




Creating datasets from a query
Data Visualization lets you specify a dataset from a SQL Query. This feature makes it
      easy to restrict access to specific table columns or rows for all users, either for security
      or for relevancy reasons. It also enables you to specify complex joins and analytic functions
      at the dataset level.

On the main navigation bar, click DATA.
The Data view appears, open on the Datasets tab.

Click NEW DATASET near the top of the screen.

In the New Dataset modal window, specify the following
            values:


Dataset title

Specify here the name of the new dataset.



Dataset Source

In the menu, you can choose either the From Tables (default) or From
                    SQL option. Choose From SQL.



Enter SQL

Enter the SQL query; its results from the dataset.









Click CREATE.
You can now see the new dataset under the Datasets tab.tipTo find the dataset in the future, you can scroll through the list of
              datasets on the connection, or use Search at the top of the
              page.




Creating datasets in the Connection Explorer
The following steps demonstrate how to create a new dataset directly on a table in
      the Connection Explorer. 

On the main navigation bar, click DATA.
The Data view appears, open on the Datasets tab.

Click New Dataset on the same line as the primary table.






In the New Dataset modal window, specify the Dataset
              title.






Click CREATE.
You can now see the new dataset under the Datasets tab.tipTo find the
              dataset in the future, you can scroll through the list of datasets on the connection,
              or use Search at the top of the page.
