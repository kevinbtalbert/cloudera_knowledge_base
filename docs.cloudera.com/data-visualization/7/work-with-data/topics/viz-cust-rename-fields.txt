Custom renaming dataset fields
Often, we find it useful to rename a frequently-used field directly in the dataset,
    instead of using an alias in each visual. Cloudera Visualization makes it very easy to change
    the display name of a dataset field.

The following steps demonstrate how to rename a field. We are using the column
          iso_cc (the ISO-compliant country code) in the dataset World Life
            Expectancy [data source: samples.world_life_expectancy].


On the main navigation bar, click DATA.

The Data view appears, open on the Datasets tab.


In the left navigation menu, click samples.

In the Datasets area, select World Life
            Expectancy
(samples.world_life_expectancy).

In the Dataset Detail menu, select
          Fields.






In the Fields interface, select EDIT
            FIELDS.






Under Dimensions, find the field iso_cc, and
          click the (down arrow) icon on the right.

Click the Edit (pencil) icon.




The Edit Field Parameters window modal appears.
noteThe Base Column name cannot be edited, but you can change the
              Display Name of the column.


Change the Display Name from iso_cc to
            ISO Country Code.

Click APPLY.

Under Dataset: World Life Expectancy, click
            SAVE.


All new visuals created from this dataset use the new name automatically.
