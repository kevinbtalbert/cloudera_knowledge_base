Join elimination 
Join elimination improves query execution and visual rendering in CDP Data
    Visualization.

Join elimination is available both for left outer and inner
        joins. It is turned on by default. 
When a visual uses fields and expressions that reference only a subset of the joined tables
        that form the dataset, this feature eliminates the unnecessary joins and access only the
        necessary subset of the joined tables. This improves query execution speeds, and renders the
        visuals faster.
