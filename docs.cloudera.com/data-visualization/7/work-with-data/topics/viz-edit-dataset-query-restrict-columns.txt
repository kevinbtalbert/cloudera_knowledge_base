Restricting columns in datasets based on SQL query
In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can easily restrict the table columns in the
    dataset by changing the SQL definition of that dataset. SQL-defined datasets make it easy to
    limit their content to specific columns.

Switch to Data Model interface, and click Show
            Data.






There is a large number of columns in the query result, and many of them are not
            necessary when it comes to answering most common questions.





Find the fields that you would like to keep in the dataset definition.

Switch back to Dataset Detail interface, and edit
            SQL text window by applying the following statement:
select county, stname, ctyname, tot_pop, tot_male, tot_female from main.us_counties

In this example we keep the columns county, stname,
              ctyname, tot_pop, tot_male, and
              tot_female.


Click Save.






In the Refresh dataset table column information modal window,
          click Close.






Switch back to the Data Model interface, click Show
            Data, and check that the dataset only has the explicitly specified
          columns:




In this example we have kept the columns county,
              stname, ctyname, tot_pop,
              tot_male, and tot_female.
