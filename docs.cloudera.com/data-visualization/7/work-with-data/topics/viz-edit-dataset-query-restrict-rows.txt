Restricting rows in datasets based on SQL query
In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can easily restrict the table rows in the dataset
    by changing the SQL definition of that dataset. SQL-defined datasets make it easy to limit their
    content to specific rows.
Switch to Dataset Detail interface, and edit
            SQL text window by applying the following statement:
select county, stname, ctyname, tot_pop, tot_male, tot_female from main.us_counties
  where stname in ('Arizona','New Mexico', 'California','Nevada','Colorado','Utah')
Click Save.

In the Refresh dataset table column information modal
          window, click Close.

Switch back to the Data Model interface, click
            Show Data, and notice that the dataset is limited to the states
          specified in the SQL statement.

If you were to test it by creating a simple map visual on the dataset, it would
          look something like this:
