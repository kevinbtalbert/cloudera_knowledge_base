Finding a dataset
Cloudera Data Visualization makes it easy to find your datasets. You can browse the
    list of Datasets, check out the Connection
      Explorer, or use Search.

On the main navigation bar, click DATA.




The Data view appears, open on the Datasets tab.


On the left-side panel, select the connection on which the dataset is defined. 

Use Search on the main navigation bar. Type the search string
          that matches all or part of the dataset you are looking for.




Some examples of search criteria are for example data connection names, data table
            names, dataset names, visualization names, or application names.


Select the correct dataset from the abbreviated list of datasets.
