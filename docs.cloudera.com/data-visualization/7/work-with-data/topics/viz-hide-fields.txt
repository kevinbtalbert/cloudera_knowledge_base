Hiding dataset fields from applications
You may find it useful to hide dataset fields that are not typically used for
    visualizations to prevent unintended bias in BI and analytics, or even to obscure confidential
    data. In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can do this by turning off the default visibility
    option of a particular dataset field.

The following steps demonstrate how to prevent data fields from appearing in visualizations
        and applications of dataset World Life Expectancy [data source
          samples.world_life_expectancy]. The fields comments,
          lat, and lng are empty, so they are good candidates for
        this operation.


On the main navigation bar, click DATA.

The Data view appears, open on the Datasets tab.


In the left navigation menu, click Samples.

In the Datasets area, select World Life
            Expectancy
(main.world_life_expectancy).

In the Dataset Detail menu, select
          Fields.






In the Fields interface, select EDIT
            FIELDS.






Under Dimensions, find the field
          comments.

Click the (eye) icon on the comments
          line.




The icon next to the comment field changes to (slashed
              eye).





Under Measures, find the fields
              lat and
            lng, and hide them.






Click Save.


In the updated Fields interface, Dimensions
        table has a total of 11 fields and Measures table
        lists a total of 7 fields, as before.




The number of Dimensions is 11. This is calculated as All
          Dimensions (11) - Hidden Dimensions (1) + Segment (1).
The number of Measures is 6. This is calculated as All Measures
          (7) - Hidden Measures (2) + Record Count (1).

However, when using Visual Designer, the hidden fields do not
        show.



tip
The field visibility can be changed in the Edit Field Parameters
          window modal.
