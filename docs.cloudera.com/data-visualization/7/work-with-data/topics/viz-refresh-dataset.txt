Refreshing a dataset
You can refresh an existing dataset if the underlying tables change or if you update
    the associated extract with new or changed fields.

Click DATA on the main navigation bar.
The Data view appears, open on the
            Datasets tab.

Click the dataset you want to refresh.
The Detail view appears.

Select Fields in the Dataset Detail
          menu.






In the Fields interface, click EDIT FIELDS > REFRESH




Data Visualization scans the table for changed fields. If no changes are detected,
          no refresh is done and a notification is displayed. If changes are detected, the table
          columns are updated and a notification is displayed about the change.

Close the notification.
