Specifying geographic fields 
In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can explicitly specify a dataset field as one of
    the many supported geographical types. 

In this example the dataset Canadian Census is used,
        constructed from example datasets, and joined of the fields fsa and
          Postal Code, respectively.
The following steps demonstrate how to assign Geo Types to a dataset field. We are using
        the two fields from the join of the Canadian Census dataset: fsa from
          canada_census_population_dwellings, and Postal Code from
          ca_postal_codes.
noteBefore creating visuals that use geographic data, specify the appropriate information as
        Geo Types.


Navigate to the dataset that you must modify. In this example, the Food Stores
            Inspection in NYC dataset is used.

In the Dataset Detail menu, select
          Fields.

In the Fields interface, select EDIT
            FIELDS.






Click the Edit (pencil) icon on the right side of the
          field.






In the Edit Field Parameters window modal, under Geo
            Type, select the appropriate option from the menu.

Click APPLY. For zip_code, we also changed the
            Display Name to Postal Code in the
          example.






Under Dataset: Food Stores Inspection in NYC.

Click SAVE.


The dataset can now be successfully used for map and interactive map visuals, without
        further adjustments at the level of the visual.
