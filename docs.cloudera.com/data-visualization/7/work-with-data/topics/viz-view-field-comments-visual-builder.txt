Viewing field comments in Visual Builder
When working with big data, it can be very helpful to have access to comprehensive
    field-level descriptions. In Cloudera Data Visualization, you can use field comments to provide
    the context and meaning of each dataset field.

To view field comments in the Visual Builder, create a new visual using the World Life
        Expectancy dataset [data source samples.world_life_expectancy]. See
          Creating visuals..
The fields iso-cc and gdp-per-capita display a gray
        triangle on the top right corner of the field. Hover over the triangle to view the field
        comments defined in the dataset.
