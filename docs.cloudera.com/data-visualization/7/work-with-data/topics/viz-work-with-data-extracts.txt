Working with data extracts in Data Visualization
Data extracts are saved subsets of data that you can use for data discovery and
    analytics.
You create an extract to reduce the total amount of data you work
      with by selecting certain dimensions and measures. With the help of data extracts you can
      manage the analytical capabilities, performance, concurrency and security of data access in
      your system.
The following diagram shows you the workflow of building visualizations on top of data
      extracts:
