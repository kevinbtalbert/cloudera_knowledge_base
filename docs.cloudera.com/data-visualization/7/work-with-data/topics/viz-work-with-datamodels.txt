Working with data models in Data Visualization
You can expand the basic one-table dataset by creating joins with other relevant tables
    from the same or other data stores. Combining data across multiple tables enriches the dataset
    considerably. It enables you to conduct much more meaningful research and produce insightful
    visual analytics.
There are two distinct approaches for creating data joins for the purpose of
        visualization:

Defining in UI is ideal for datasets that include star-type
            schemas.


Defining on back end ETL is preferable for fact-fact joins, so they
            may be pre-materialized.
