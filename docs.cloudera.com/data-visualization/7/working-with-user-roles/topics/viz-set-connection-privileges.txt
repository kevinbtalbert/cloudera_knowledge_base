Setting connection privileges
Connection privileges are separate components of the Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
    system in Data Visualization. Depending on the parameters of the business case, they may be
    specified identically (and at the same time) for a number of connections, or set separately for
    each connection. For more information on possible permissions, see RBAC
    permissions.

The following steps demonstrate how to add connection-level privileges to a role. In this
        example Test Role 1 is used.


Add another privilege by clicking the ADD PRIVILEGE
          button.




The Add Privilege modal window appears.


From Connection(s), select either All connections or one
          of the individual connections.
In this example, access to the samples connection is selected. You can repeat
          the previous step to add more connections to this privilege.

Click CREATE.




The connection privilege for the samples connection appears on the list of
            privileges for the role.
By default, all possible privileges for a connection component are selected:

Manage analytical views
Import data
Create datasets, explore tables




Note the following:

The privilege type appears with the Connection icon.
Manage analytical views and Import data are independent of one
              another, and they include the Create datasets, explore tables permission. If
              you uncheck both of these 'greater' permissions, Create datasets, explore
                tables becomes mutable, and can be unselected. But then you will no longer have
              any connection-level access components.
This privilege may be deleted by clicking the Delete
              icon.



Click SAVE at the top of the interface to save the latest
          changes to the role definition.


Proceed to Setting dataset privileges.
