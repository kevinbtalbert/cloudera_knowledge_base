Setting system privileges
System-level privileges are key components of the Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
    system in Data Visualization. For more information on possible permissions, see RBAC
      permissions.

The following steps demonstrate how to add system privileges to a role. In this example,
          Test Role 1 is used.


On the System component line, click the Select all
          checkbox, the one closest the name of the System category
          name.

This activates the next four checkboxes, granting the permissions for the following
            actions:

Create workspaces
Manage roles and users
Manage site settings
Manage custom styles
Manage jobs, email templates
View activity logs
Manage data connections




To grant only some of these System permissions, deselect the
            ones not permitted by the new role.





Click SAVE at the top of the interface to save the changes to
          the role.


Proceed to Setting role privileges.
