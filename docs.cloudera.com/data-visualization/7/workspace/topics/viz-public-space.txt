Public workspace
When you use Cloudera Data Visualization you work and save your visuals in a workspace.
    There are three types of workspaces: private, public, and custom.

There is only one public workspace in a CDP Data Visualization instance, which
      cannot be deleted. Visual artifacts in the public workspace are visible to any user who has
      minimal viewing permissions to the relevant dataset.
Moving dashboards from private or custom workspaces into the public workspace is
      equivalent to publishing them to the entire organization.
noteOnly administrators have the ability to change permissions for the public
      workspace.
