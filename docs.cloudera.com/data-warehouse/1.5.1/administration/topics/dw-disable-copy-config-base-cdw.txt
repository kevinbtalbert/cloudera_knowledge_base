Disabling copy configuration from base cluster to CDW option on Private Cloud
When you activate an environment, configurations such as default file format,
        compression type, and transactional type are copied from the base cluster to Cloudera Data
        Warehouse (CDW) by default; this can ease workload migrations. You must disable this feature
        from the Advanced Settings page before activating an environment in CDW.

Log in to the Data Warehouse service as DWAdmin.

Go to Advanced Configurations > Advanced Settings page.

Deselect the Copy configurations from base cluster to
                        CDW option.

Click Update.
