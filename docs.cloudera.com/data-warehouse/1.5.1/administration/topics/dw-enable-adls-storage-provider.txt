Enabling ADLS storage providers in CDW
You can enable Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) data service on CDP Private Cloud to
        access Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen1 and Gen2) object storage if the CDP Private Cloud
        base cluster is configured to access it.

importantADLS object storage support is in technical
                preview and is not recommended for production deployments. Cloudera recommends that
                you try this feature in test and development environments.

If you have installed the Private Cloud Data Services,
            including CDW, before fine-tuning the base cluster configurations, then you must upload
            the Azure server certificates referenced in the fs.azure endpoint
            configuration on the Management Console > Administration > CA Certificates tab. Select Miscellaneous as the certificate type
            from the CA Certificate Type drop-down menu.

Log in to the Data Warehouse service as DWAdmin.

Go to the Advanced Configurations > Advanced Settings page.

Select the Enable ADLS as a storage provider
                    option.

Click Update.
