Enabling S3 and S3-compatible storage providers in CDW
You can enable Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) data service on CDP Private Cloud to
        access S3 and S3-compatible object storage if the CDP Private Cloud base cluster is
        configured to access it.

noteS3 and S3-compatible object storage support is in technical
                preview and is not recommended for production deployments. Cloudera recommends that
                you try this feature in test and development environments.

If you have installed the Private Cloud Data Services,
            including CDW, before fine-tuning the base cluster configurations, then you must upload
            the Amazon server certificates referenced in the fs.s3a endpoint configuration on the Management Console > Administration > CA Certificates tab. Select Miscellaneous as the certificate type
            from the CA Certificate Type drop-down menu.

Log in to the Data Warehouse service as DWAdmin.

Go to Advanced Configurations > Advanced Settings page.

Select the Enable S3 and S3-compatible object store
                        providers option.

Click Update.

importantIf you have upgraded to CDW 1.5.0
                        and you have enabled the option to use S3, then you need to recreate the
                        environment in CDW.
