Analyze Cloudera Data Warehouse Private Cloud logs stored on Ozone
This topic describes how to analyze Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Private Cloud logs
    that are stored on Ozone using Hue. 
You can use Hue to analyze Impala logs or Hive logs.noteYou must use the Hue
        instance that corresponds to the Virtual Warehouse whose logs are saved on
      Ozone.

Using Hue, create an external table that points to the log data on Ozone:

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE <table-name> LIKE sys.logs LOCATION
              'ofs://<ozone.service.id>/s3v/<bucket-name>/<warehouse-prefix>/warehouse/tablespace/external/hive/sys.db/logs';


Run the MSCK REPAIR TABLE command on the table you created in Step 1:

MSCK REPAIR TABLE <table-name>;


After completing the above steps, you can use SQL queries to analyze the log data.
