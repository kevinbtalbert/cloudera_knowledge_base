Configuring the Database Catalog to access the Ozone filesystem
After adding and configuring the Ozone service on the base cluster, creating buckets,
    and granting Ranger KMS policies to the users, you must configure the Hive MetaStore warehouse
    directories in the Database Catalog to point to the Ozone filesystem.

noteIf you have activated an environment in CDW before installing the
        Ozone service on the base cluster, then you must recreate the CDW environment so that Ozone
        configurations can be imported into CDW.
By default, the Hive MetaStore (HMS) for Database Catalogs on CDW Private Cloud points to
          HDFS.
If you plan to make Ozone as the default FS, you must configure the Database Catalog
            to point to the Ozone storage system, as described in this topic.
Alternatively, you can create a database with an Ozone bucket as the base directory so
            that all tables are created in that directory. Following is a sample
            command:CREATE DATABASE ozone_db
[LOCATION ofs://ozone1/bucket1/ozone_db/managed]
[MANAGEDLOCATION ofs://ozone1/bucket1/ozone_db/external]
[WITH DBPROPERTIES (property_name=property_value, ...)];

Before you re-configure the Database Catalog settings, make sure there are no running
            Virtual Warehouses associated with it. Either the Database Catalog has
            no associated Virtual Warehouses or you have suspended all the Virtual Warehouses
            associated with it.


Log in to the Data Warehouse service as a DWAdmin.

Activate an environment in CDW.

In the Database Catalog tile, click  > Edit > CONFIGURATIONS > Metastore and select hive-site from the
            Configuration files drop-down menu.

Search for the following configuration properties and update them to Ozone filesystem
          paths, which start with ofs:


hive.metastore.warehouse.dir
hive.metastore.warehouse.external.dir

Following is an example of these properties set for a Database Catalog:





Click Apply Changes and wait for the Database Catalog to finish
          applying changes.

After configuring the Database Catalog's Hive metastore to point to Ozone, create a
      Hive or an Impala Virtual Warehouse, or restart an existing Virtual Warehouse. You can then
      create databases and table using Hue or other SQL clients with your Virtual
      Warehouse.
