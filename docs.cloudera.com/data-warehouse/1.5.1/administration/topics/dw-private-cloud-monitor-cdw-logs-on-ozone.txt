Monitor Cloudera Data Warehouse Private Cloud logs on Ozone storage
This topic describes how to monitor Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Private Cloud logs
      that are stored on Ozone.
    

You can use either the Ozone S3 Gateway Web UI in Cloudera Manager or run commands in
            a terminal window to monitor CDW logs.
noteBecause fluentd buffers the logs and then pushes them to the
            configured endpoint, Ozone might take up to 15 minutes to display the CDW logs.


Use one of the following methods to monitor CDW logs in Ozone:


Ozone S3 Gateway Web UI in Cloudera Manager:
Navigate to the following URL:
https://<s3-gateway-endpoint>/<bucket-name>?browser=true
Where: 
<s3-gateway-endpoint> indicates the
                    endpoint of the Ozone S3 Gateway, which you can get from the Ozone S3 Gateway
                    Web UI
<bucket-name> indicates the Ozone
                    bucket where you are storing the CDW logs.



Run the following command from the Ozone shell:
ozone sh key list
                  o3://<ozone.service.id>/s3v/<bucket-name>/
                  --prefix=<warehouse-prefix>
Where: 
<ozone.service.id> indicates the
                    identifier used for your implementation of Ozone.
<bucket-name> indicates the name of
                    the Ozone bucket where the CDW logs are stored.
<warehouse-prefix> indicates the
                    Virtual Warehouse identifier.
