Setting up Ozone on the CDP Base clusterCloudera Docs
Setting up Ozone on the CDP Base cluster
To access and use Ozone from Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) data service on Private
        Cloud, you must add and configure the Ozone service on the base cluster.

Provision an Ozone cluster based on your desired storage capacity.


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Add and configure the Ozone service on the base cluster.

Enable Kerberos on the base cluster before you install the CDW data
                    service.
Enabling Kerberos on the base cluster automatically enables the Ozone service
                    to use Kerberos. To verify this, go to Ozone service > Configuration. The ozone.security.enabled parameter should be
                    set to true and the
                        hadoop.security.authentication parameter should be set to
                        kerberos. 

SSH into the Ozone host on the base cluster as an Administrator.

Obtain the tickets for the Hive or Impala user by using the Kerberos CLI
                        kinit command.

Verify the Ozone Service ID for your cluster from the
                        Configuration tab of the Ozone service in Cloudera
                    Manager.

Verify that at least one volume and a bucket is available in Ozone by using the
                    service ID you just verified. If a volume and a bucket does not exist, then run
                    the following commands to create a volume in Ozone using the service ID:

ozone sh volume create --quota=[***VOLUME-CAPACITY***] --user=[***USERNAME***] URI

where,
-q, --quota: Used to specify the maximum size that a volume can occupy
                            in the cluster. This is an optional parameter.
-u, --user: Used to specify the name of the user who can use the volume.
                            The designated user can create buckets and keys inside the particular
                            volume. This is a mandatory parameter.
URI: Used to specify the name of the volume to be created. Specify the
                            URI in the following format:
                            [***PREFIX***]://[***SERVICE-ID]/[***VOLUME-NAME***]


ozone sh volume create --quota=100GB --user=hrt_1 o3://vvslab/testvol


Create an encrypted or a non-encrypted bucket using the service ID that you
                    just verified by running the following commands:
To create encrypted
                    buckets:ozone sh bucket create -k [***ENCRYPTION-KEY***] [***PREFIX***]://[***SERVICE-ID]/[***VOLUME-NAME***]/[***BUCKET-NAME***]

ozone sh bucket create -k key1 o3://vvslab/testvol/testbucketencrypted


importantYou must have the
                            GET_METADATA and GENERATE_EEK
                        permissions on the encryption key to create encrupted buckets on Ozone. The
                        user who needs to read from the encrypted bucket must have the
                            DECRYPT_EEK permission. These permissions are defined
                        in the Ranger KMS policies on the base cluster.

To create non-encrypted
                    buckets:ozone sh bucket create [***PREFIX***]://[***SERVICE-ID]/[***VOLUME-NAME***]/[***BUCKET-NAME***]
ozone sh bucket create o3://vvslab/testvol/testbucket22/08/10
                        10:25:10 INFO rpc.RpcClient: Creating Bucket: testvol/testbucket, with
                        Versioning false and Storage Type set to DISK and Encryption set to
                        false

Verify that the bucket is created by listing the bucket as follows:

ozone sh bucket list [***PREFIX***]://[***SERVICE-ID]/[***VOLUME-NAME***] --length=[***NUMBER-OF-BUCKETS] --prefix=[***BUCKET-PREFIX] --start=[***STARTING-BUCKET***]

where,
-l, --length: Used to specify the maximum number of results to return.
                            The default is 100.
-p, --prefix: Used to list the bucket names that match the specified
                            prefix.
 -s, --start: Used to return results starting with the bucket after the
                            specified value.


noteAll the existing buckets in Ozone are automatically
                        available to query from Hive and Impala Virtual Warehouses in CDW.To set
                            Ozone as the default file system, you must configure OFS and add
                            specific properties for the Ozone bucket you created.


 After setting up Ozone storage on the base cluster, configure CDW to use Hive or
            Impala to query data residing on the Apache Ozone object store.
