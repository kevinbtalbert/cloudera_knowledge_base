Specify or create an Ozone bucket for Cloudera Data Warehouse Private Cloud logs
This topic describes how to specify an Ozone bucket to store Cloudera Data Warehouse
      (CDW) Private Cloud Hive and Impala logs.
    

You can either re-use the Ozone bucket that is automatically configured for storing
              Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) Private Cloud logs or create a new bucket to store CDW
            logs separately. The Ozone bucket used to store CML logs usually has a cdplogs-
            prefix.


Use one of the following two methods depending on whether you want to use the
                  existing CML log bucket or create a new one for CDW:



To select an existing Ozone bucket, use the ozone sh bucket
                        list command from the Ozone shell on your Private Cloud Base
                        cluster. The following example shows how you can list buckets by the
                        cdplogs- prefix:
ozone sh bucket list o3://ozone1/s3v --prefix=cdplogs
{
   "metadata" : { },
   "volumeName" : "s3v",
   "name" : "cdplogs-av-dwx-env-96c47aa9",
   "storageType" : "DISK",
   "versioning" : false,
   "creationTime" : "2020-08-01T18:29:08.686z",
   "modificationTime" : "2020-08-03T18:29:08.686z",
   "encryptionKeyName" : null,
   "sourceVolume" : null,
   "sourceBucket" : null
}


To create a new bucket on Ozone, use the ozone sh bucket
                  create command from the Ozone shell on your Private Cloud Base cluster.
                The following example shows how to create a new Ozone bucket named
                  cdw-logs-bucket:
ozone sh bucket create 03://ozone1/s3v/cdw-logs-bucket
importantCloudera recommends that you use the
                        hive user because this user automatically has
                        create/read/write permissions on buckets that you create.
