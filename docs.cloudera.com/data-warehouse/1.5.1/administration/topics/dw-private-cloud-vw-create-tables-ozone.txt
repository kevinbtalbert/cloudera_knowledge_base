Creating a Virtual Warehouse and creating tables on Ozone
After you configure the Database Catalog to point to the Ozone filesystem, verify
        that the Hive and Impala Virtual Warehouses in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) carry the right
        configurations, and then you can managing databases and tables residing in Ozone using Hue
        or other SQL clients.
Ensure that the Hive MetaStore warehouse directories in the
            Database Catalog point to the Ozone filesystem on the CDP Private Cloud Base
            cluster.

Log in to the Data Warehouse service as a DWAdmin.

Create an Impala or Hive Virtual Warehouse.
Since you have already added Ozone in your base cluster, the required
                    configuration are made available in CDW when you create a Virtual
                    Warehouse.

Verify that the Ozone configurations are present in CDW. From your Virtual
                    Warehouse tile, click  > Edit > CONFIGURATIONS > Impala catalogd and select ozone-site from the
                        Configuration files drop-down menu.
For Hive, click  > Edit > CONFIGURATIONS > Hiveserver2 and select ozone-site from the
                        Configuration files drop-down menu.

Use Hue or any other SQL clients to start managing databases, managed and
                    external tables.
Following is a sample command to create an external table:
                    create external table
[***TABLE-NAME***] (id int, name string)
location 'ofs://ozone1/s3v/cdw-logs/compute-schal-pvc111-env-1-hive5/warehouse/tablespace/[***TABLE-NAME***]';

Verify that the required keys are created in the bucket by running the
                    following command:

ozone sh bucket ls [***VOLUME***] -p warehouses/tablespace
