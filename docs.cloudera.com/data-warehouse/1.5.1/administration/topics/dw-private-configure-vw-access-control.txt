Enabling warehouse-level access control for Impala in CDW Private Cloud
By default, Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) enables you to specify one or more user
        groups to access an Impala Virtual Warehouse while creating it. As a result, only those
        users can connect to that Virtual Warehouse, from all supported connection channels such as
        Hue, JDBC, or other Business Intelligence tools. You can disable this option from the CDW
        UI.

If you do not specify a user group while creating a Virtual Warehouse, then the
                access is not restricted. Any user can access the Virtual Warehouse.
The group-level access control feature is available only for Impala Virtual
                Warehouses. Hive LLAP and Unified Analytics Virtual Warehouses do not have this
                feature.
importantIf you want to enable access control, you
                must have the user groups created in the Management Console. If you are using
                Kerberos for authentication, then ensure that the users for whom you are enabling
                access are present in LDAP as well.


Log in to the Data Warehouse service as DWAdmin.

Go to Advanced Configuration > Advanced Settings page.

To disable the access control feature, deselect the Enable
                        warehouse-level access control for Impala option.

Click Update.

The User Groups drop-down menu will
            no longer be available on the New Virtual Warehouse creation
            tile.
