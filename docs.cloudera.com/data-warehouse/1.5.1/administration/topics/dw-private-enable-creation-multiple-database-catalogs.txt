Enabling the option to create additional Database Catalogs in CDW Private Cloud
Starting with the Private Cloud 1.5.0 release, you cannot create additional
        non-default Database Catalogs without enabling the “Create multiple Database Catalogs”
        option on the Advanced Settings page.

In Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Private Cloud, a default Database Catalog is created
                when you activate an environment and is specific to that environment. The default
                Database Catalog uses a CDW-managed database. If you create additional Database
                Catalogs, then custom Database Catalogs are created which require a separate,
                external database that CDW does not manage.
noteCustom Database Catalogs have been deprecated and will be
                completely removed in future releases. Cloudera does not support custom Database
                Catalogs. Cloudera recommends that you use the default Database Catalog in your
                production deployments.
To enable creating custom Database Catalogs:


Log in to the Data Warehouse service as DWAdmin.

Go to the Advanced Configuration > Advanced Settings page.

Select the Create multiple Database Catalogs
                    option.

Click Update.
