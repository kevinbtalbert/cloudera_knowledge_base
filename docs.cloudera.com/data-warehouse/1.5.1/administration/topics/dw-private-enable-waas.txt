Enabling workload-aware autoscaling for Impala in CDW on Private Cloud
Using workload-aware autoscaling, you can configure multiple executor groups within a
        single Virtual Warehouse that can independently autoscale to allow handling of different
        workloads in the same Virtual Warehouse. To use workload-aware autoscaling, you must enable
        it from the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) UI before creating a Virtual
        Warehouse.
