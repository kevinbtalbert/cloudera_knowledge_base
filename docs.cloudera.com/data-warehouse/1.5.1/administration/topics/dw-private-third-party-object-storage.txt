Supported object storage services for Cloudera Data Warehouse Private
    Cloud
HDFS is the default storage system for Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW). However, you can
    enable CDW to access object storage such as AWS S3 and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen1 and
    Gen2) if the CDP Private Cloud base cluster is configured to access it. You can query Hive and
    Impala tables stored on object stores using Hue.
importantS3, S3-compatible, and ADLS object storage support
      is in technical preview and is not recommended for production deployments. Cloudera recommends
      that you try this feature in test and development environments.
When you activate an environment in CDW, all the hadoop
      configurations files (fs.s3a.*/fs.azure.*) are copied from
      the core-site.xml file present on the base cluster to the
        hadoop-core-site.xml file of the Hive and Impala metastore pods,
      enabling CDW to establish a connection to S3/ADLS.
Following are the key configurations that must be present in the base cluster
        core-site.xml file for connecting to S3 or S3-compatible storage
        providers:
fs.s3a.access.key
fs.s3a.secret.key
fs.s3a.endpoint
fs.s3a.connection.ssl.enabled

Following are the key configurations that must be present in the base cluster
        core-site.xml file for connecting to ADLS storage provider:
fs.azure.account.oauth.provider.type
fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.id
fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.secret
fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.endpoint

important
Because CDW uses all the base cluster configurations, it is important that you fine-tune
        and debug these configurations on the base cluster before creating the CDW environment.
If you have installed the Private Cloud Data Services, including CDW, before fine-tuning
        the base cluster configurations, then you must upload the Amazon/Azure server certificates
        referenced in the fs.s3a/fs.azure endpoint configuration on the Management Console > Administration > CA Certificates tab. Select Miscellaneous as the certificate type from
        the CA Certificate Type drop-down menu.

The fs.s3a.*/fs.azure configurations are read-only. You can
      view these configurations from the CONFIGURATION tab on the Database
      Catalog and Virtual Warehouse details page by selecting the
        hadoop-core-site.xml option from the Configuration
        files drop-down menu.
noteDisabling CDWâ€™s access to the third-party S3 providers from the
        Advanced Settings page does not affect the previously created Database
      Catalogs and Virtual Warehouses. To disable access, you must delete and recreate the Database
      Catalog and Virtual Warehouse.

Enabling S3 and S3-compatible storage providers in CDWYou can enable Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) data service on CDP Private Cloud to         access S3 and S3-compatible object storage if the CDP Private Cloud base cluster is         configured to access it.Enabling ADLS storage providers in CDWYou can enable Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) data service on CDP Private Cloud to         access Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen1 and Gen2) object storage if the CDP Private Cloud         base cluster is configured to access it.
