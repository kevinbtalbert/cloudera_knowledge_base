Advanced configurations in CDW Private Cloud
You can access advanced configurations in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Private Cloud
    from the left navigation pane on the CDW web interface. Some of these configurations must be
    enabled before you activate an environment and some can be applied by refreshing the
    environment, Database Catalog, and Virtual Warehouses. 


Configuration
Description
Enabled by default?
Condition for applying the configuration



Create databases for Virtual Warehouses
Enables the automatic creation of databases for Hue and HMS. For external tables,
              CDW requires permission for CREATE and DROP DATABASE operations. If disabled, you need
              to create the databases before creating Database Catalogs.**
No
Enable before activating an environment in CDW.


Use deterministic namespace names
Makes the namespace names deterministic, that is, given the same input, a client
              can get to the same name every time. Enable this option if you need to create
              Kerberos principals and keytabs.
Yes
Enable before activating an environment in CDW.


Enable ADLS as a storage provider
Enables you to use Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen1 and Gen2) for storing tables. 
Yes

Copy configurations from base cluster to CDW
Configurations such as default file format, compression type, and transactional
              type are copied from the base cluster to CDW to aid cluster setup and workload
              migration.

Enable workload-aware autoscaling for Impala
Enables you to create multiple executor group sets of different sizes that can

This option is available only if you are upgrading CDP Private Cloud Data
                  Services from a previous release.
If you enable this option, then you must specify the external database name on
                  the Activate Environment page.

                and Virtual Warehouses, in this order.
