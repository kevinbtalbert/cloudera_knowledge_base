Downloading the Beeline CLI tarball
Download the Beeline CLI tarball from Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) to your local
            system and use the Beeline client to connect to a Hive Virtual Warehouse and run queries.
            The archive file contains all the dependent JARs and libraries that are required to run the
            Beeline script.
From the Cloudera Management Console user profile, note the Workload User Name and
                Workload Password.

Log in to the CDP web interface and navigate to the Data Warehouse
                        service.

In the Data Warehouse service, click Virtual Warehouses in the left navigation panel.

For the required Virtual Warehouse, click  and select Download Beeline CLI.






Save the apache-hive-beeline-x.x.xxxx.tar.gz file in your
                        local system and extract the tarball.

Click  again and select
                        Copy JDBC URL.

Paste the copied JDBC URL in a text file, to be used in later steps.

jdbc:hive2://<your-virtual-warehouse>.<your-environment>.<dwx.company.com>/default;transportMode=http;httpPath=cliservice;ssl=true;retries=3


Open a terminal window and go to the folder where the tarball is extracted to
                        start Beeline.
bin/beeline
This starts an interactive Beeline shell where you can connect to Hive and
                    run SQL queries.

Run the connect command to connect to Hive using the JDBC URL
                        that you copied earlier.

beeline> !connect {***JDBC URL***}


Connecting to jdbc:hive2://<your-virtual-warehouse>.<your-environment>.<dwx.company.com>/default;transportMode=http;httpPath=cliservice;ssl=true;retries=3


Enter the Workload User Name and Workload Password when you are prompted for
                        the user credentials.

Enter username for jdbc:hive2://<your-virtual-warehouse>.<your-environment>.<dwx.company.com>/default: {***Workload User Name***}
Enter password for jdbc:hive2://<your-virtual-warehouse>.<your-environment>.<dwx.company.com>/default: {***Workload Password***}
