Uploading additional JARs to CDWCloudera Docs
Uploading additional JARs to CDW
You add additional Java Archive (JAR) files to the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Hive
        classpath that might be required to support dependency JARs, third-party Serde, or any Hive
        extensions.


The JARs are added to the end of the Hive classpath and do not override the Hive
                    JARs.
Cloudera recommends that you do not use this procedure to add User-Defined
                    Function (UDF) JARs. If you do, then you must restart HiveServer2 or reload the
                    UDF. For more information about reloading functions, see the Hive Data
                    Definition Language (DDL) manual.


You have the EnvironmentAdmin role permissions to upload the JAR to your object
            storage.

Build the archive file.
The archive file can be either a .jar file or a
                        tar.gz file. For a tar.gz archive
                    file, only JARs present in the top level are considered.For example, if the
                            tar.gz file contains these files â€”
                            test1.jar, test2.jar, and
                            deps\test3.jar, only test1.jar
                        and test2.jar are considered;
                            deps\test3.jar is excluded.

Upload the archive file to the Hive Virtual Warehouse on CDW object storage,
                    such as HDFS.

Log in to the CDW service and from the Overview page,
                    locate the Hive Virtual Warehouse that uses the bucket or container where you
                    placed the archive file, and click 

 > Edit.

In Details, click Configurations > Hiveserver2.

From the Configuration files drop-down list, select
                        env.

Search for CDW_HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH and add the archive file to
                    the environment variable.



If you add a directory, the .jar or
                        tar.gz files within the directory are copied and
                    extracted. For a tar.gz file, only the JARs present in the
                    top level are copied.
Consider the following JAR path -
                        /common-jars/common-jars.tar.gz:/common-jars/single-jar.jar:/serde-specific-jar/serde.jar.
                    In this example, common-jars.tar.gz is extracted and
                        single-jar.jar and serde.jar files are
                    copied.

Repeat the previous step and add the archive file or directory for
                        Query coordinator and Query
                        executor.
If the CDW_HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH environment variable is not
                    present, click  and add the following custom
                    configuration:CDW_HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH={***VALUE***}

On applying the configuration changes, Hive Virtual Warehouse restarts and the
            archive files are available and added to the end of the Hive classpath.
