Built-in BI clients and drivers in CDW
You can connect BI tools and SQL clients such as Beeline, impala-shell, impyla, Tableau,
  and so on to Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) and use them to explore and query data in the Data
  Lakehouse.
CDW provides built-in downloadables such as Hive JDBC driver for connecting JDBC-compliant
   tools to the Virtual Warehouses, Beeline CLI, Impala JDBC and ODBC drivers for connecting to
   Impala Virtual Warehouses, and a JDBC driver for using with Unified Analytics. You can download
   these from the Resources and Downloads tile present on the
    Overview page.
