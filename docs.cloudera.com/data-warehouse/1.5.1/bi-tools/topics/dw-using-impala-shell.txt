Using Impala shell
This topic describes how to download and install the Impala shell to query Impala
      Virtual Warehouses in the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service.
    

Required role: DWUser
        You can install the Impala shell on a local computer and use it as a client to
        connect with an Impala Virtual Warehouse instance. If you are connecting from a node that is
        already a part of a CDH or CDP cluster, you already have Impala shell and do not need to
        install it.

Make sure that you have the latest stable version of Python 2.7 and a
              pip installer associated with that build of Python installed on the
              computer where you want to run the Impala shell.
noteThe following procedure cannot be used on a Windows computer.


Open a terminal window on the computer where you want to install the Impala
                  shell, and run the following pip installer command to install the
                shell on your local computer:

pip install impala-shell
After you run this command, if your installation was successful, you receive
                    success messages that are similar to the following messages:
Successfully built impala-shell bitarray prettytable sasl sqlparse thrift thrift-sasl
Installing collected packages: bitarray, prettytable, six, sasl, sqlparse, thrift, thrift-sasl, impala-shell
Successfully installed bitarray-1.0.1 impala-shell-3.3.0.dev20190730101121
prettytable-0.7.1 sasl-0.2.1 six-1.11.0 sqlparse-0.1.19 thrift-0.11.0 thrift-sasl-0.2.1


To confirm that the Impala shell has installed correctly, run the following command
            which displays the help for the tool:

impala-shell --help
If the tool help displays, the Impala shell is installed properly on your computer.


To connect to your Impala Virtual Warehouse instance using this installation of
              Impala shell:


Log in to the CDP web interface and navigate to the Data Warehouse service.


In the Data Warehouse service, navigate to the Virtual Warehouses page.
                  In the upper right corner of the tile for the Impala Virtual
                  Warehouse you want to connect to, click the options menu, and
                select Copy Impala shell command.

This copies the shell command to your computer's clipboard. This command
                    enables you to connect to the Virtual Warehouse instance in Cloudera Data
                    Warehouse service using the Impala shell that is installed on your local
                    computer.




In the terminal window on your local computer, at the command prompt, paste the
              command you just copied from your clipboard. The command might look something like
              this:

impala-shell --protocol='hs2-http' --ssl -i "tpcds-impala.your_company.com:443"


Press return and you are connected to the Impala Virtual Warehouse instance. A
              "Starting Impala Shell..." message similar to the following displays:

Starting Impala Shell without Kerberos authentication
SSL is enabled. Impala server certificates will NOT be verified (set --ca_cert to change)
Warning: --connect_timeout_ms is currently ignored with HTTP transport.

Run the following SQL command to confirm that you are connected properly to the
              Impala Virtual Warehouse instance:

SHOW DATABASES;
If you are connected properly, this SQL command should return the following
                type of information:
Query: show databases

If you see a listing of databases similar to the above example, your installation
                is successful and you can use the shell to query the Impala Virtual Warehouse
                instance from your local computer.
