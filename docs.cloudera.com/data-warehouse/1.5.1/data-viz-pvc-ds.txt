Visualizing data with CDV on Private Cloud


Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) integrates Data Visualization for building graphic 
representations of data, dashboards, and visual applications based on CDW data, 
or other data sources you connect to. You, and authorized users, can explore data 
across the entire CDP data lifecycle using graphics, such as pie charts and histograms. 
You can also arrange visuals on a dashboard for collaborative analysis.
