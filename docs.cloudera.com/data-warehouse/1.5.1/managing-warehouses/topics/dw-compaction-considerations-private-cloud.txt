Considerations for using compaction on CDW Private Cloud
The first Hive Virtual Warehouse you create in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Private
   Cloud for a Database Catalog (not including the default Database Catalog) is automatically set as
 the compactor and performs all compaction work for subsequent Virtual Warehouses (Hive or Impala)
 created under that Database Catalog.
Consequently, you must take into account the query workload for compaction when you create the
    first Hive Virtual Warehouse. You must make sure that the warehouse has adequate resources to
    handle the compaction workload in addition to any other workloads you might run in that
    warehouse.
important

In the case of the default Database Catalog, all compaction takes place on CDP Base so
         you do not need to consider compaction queries for the Virtual Warehouses that use the
         default Database Catalog.
Impala Virtual Warehouses cannot be designated as the compactor Virtual Warehouse for a
         Database Catalog. Compaction tasks can only be assigned to a Hive Virtual Warehouse.
