How compaction interacts with CDP Base
In CDP Base, the initiator and cleaner processes also run in the metastore
    as they do in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Private Cloud. However, the worker process runs in
    HiveServer2 as a MapReduce task so its progress can be viewed in YARN.
In CDW, the initiator and cleaner processes run in the Database Catalog, which is the CDW UI
    construct that equates to the metastore. The default Database Catalog, which is created by the
    system when you activate an environment in CDW, maintains a connection with CDP Base and all
    compaction jobs for the default Database Catalog run on CDP Base. However, subsequent Database
    Catalogs that are created do not maintain a connection to CDP Base and compaction runs entirely
    in CDW. Also in CDW, the worker process that performs the compaction work runs in HiveServer2,
    which equates to a Hive Virtual Warehouse. However, compaction performed by the worker process
    in Hive Virtual Warehouses consists of queries instead of MapReduce tasks.
