Learn how to access Grafana dashboards from Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) to view
        compaction alerts and take necessary actions to keep your cluster healthy. Alternatively, you can also access Grafana from the
            Management Console.
You
                must have an activated CDW environment to view dashboards for CDW service resources
                in Grafana.

You can also access the Grafana dashboards from
                the Management Console by going to the Dashboard page and
                clicking Monitoring Dashboard.
Perform the following steps to access Grafana from CDW:


In the Data Warehouse service, click Overview and expand
                    the Environments column.

Click  and locate an environment having a Database Catalog
                    you activated for Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW).

Click the environment options  and select Open
                        Grafana.






In the Grafana web interface, click  and then select
                        Dashboards.
A list of dashboard groups is displayed.

Locate and click the <Environment Name>- Data Warehouse - Hive - Compaction
                        observability dashboard group to view all the dashboards related
                    to Hive compactions.
