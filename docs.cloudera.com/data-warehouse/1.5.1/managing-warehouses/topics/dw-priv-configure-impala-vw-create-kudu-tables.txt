Creating Impala tables in Kudu in CDW Private Cloud
Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) allows you to create Impala tables in Kudu. You can
        configure an Impala Virtual Warehouse to connect to Kudu and create Impala tables in Kudu
        using Hue. Or, you can create tables on the fly by specifying the Kudu master host in the
        TBLPROPERTIES statement while running the query from the Hue query editor.

noteThis feature is in technical preview and not recommended for use
                in production environments. Cloudera recommends that you try this feature in test or
                development environments.


Obtain the hostname of the Kudu master home by going to Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Kudu service > Instances from the CDP Management Console.

Creating Imapla tables in Kudu on the fly
To create Impala tables in Kudu without updating a Virtual Warehouseâ€™s Impala
                coordinator configuration, you must specify the Kudu master host in the
                TBLPROPERTIES statement as follows while running the query from Hue:
                TBLPROPERTIES ('kudu.master_addresses'='[***host.example.com***]')

Configuring the Virtual Warehouse to create Impala tables in Kudu
By reconfiguring an existing Impala Virtual Warehouse as follows, any tables you
                create will be created in Kudu.


Log in to the Cloudera Data Warehouse service as a DWAdmin.

Go to an Impala Virtual Warehouse and click  > Edit > CONFIGURATIONS > Impala coordinator and select flagfile from the drop-down
                    list.

Click  and enter the following key and value:


Key
Value

kudu_master_hosts
[***HOSTNAME-OF-KUDU-MASTER***]



Click Apply Changes.

Restart the Virtual Warehouse.

Open Hue from the same Virtual Warehouse.

Enter the following lines in the query editor and click the run button:

# Create a new table
# Use the kudu.num_tablet_replicas if the Kudu cluster is too small
CREATE TABLE my_first_table
(
  id BIGINT,
  name STRING,
  PRIMARY KEY(id)
)
PARTITION BY HASH PARTITIONS 16
STORED AS KUDU
TBLPROPERTIES ('kudu.num_tablet_replicas' = '1');

# Insert into Kudu table
INSERT INTO my_first_table VALUES (99, "sarah");

# Verify if the data was inserted
SELECT * FROM my_first_table;

The above commands create an Impala table in Kudu and insert a sample
                    record. The following is a screenshot showing the SQL commands and their output
                    in Hue:
