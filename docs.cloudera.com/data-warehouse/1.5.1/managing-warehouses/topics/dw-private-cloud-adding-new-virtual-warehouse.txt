Adding a new Virtual Warehouse
A Virtual Warehouse is an instance of compute resources that is equivalent to a
    cluster. It provides access to the data in tables and views in the data lake that correlates to
    a specific Database Catalog. Learn how to create a Virtual Warehouse in Cloudera Data Warehouse
    (CDW) on Private Cloud.
Virtual Warehouses can only lookup the Database Catalog that they have been
      configured to access. If you are evaluating CDW or just learning, you can accept the
        default values. This task shows you how to create a Virtual Warehouse with the bare minimum
        configurations. You can create Virtual Warehouses with the following SQL engines in CDW:
Hive
Impala
Impala with Unified Analytics


Log in to the Data Warehouse service as DWAdmin.

Go to Virtual Warehouses page and click Add
            New.

Specify a Virtual Warehouse name, the Type (Hive or Impala),
          which Database Catalog it queries, and the size.

If you are creating a Hive Virtual Warehouse, then you must also select the
            authentication mode (either LDAP or Kerberos).
If you are creating an Impala Virtual Warehouse, then you can also specify user
              groups.noteIf you do not specify a user group while creating a
              Virtual Warehouse, then the access is not restricted. Any user can access the Virtual
                Warehouse.The group-level access control feature is available only for Impala
                Virtual Warehouses. Hive LLAP and Unified Analytics Virtual Warehouses do not have
                this feature.
To create Impala Virtual Warehouse with Unified Analytics mode, turn on the
              Enable Unified Analytics option.
