  receivers
As an Administrator, you need to learn how to configure alert notifications that appear
  in the user notification system. The notifications supplement alert information in charts on the
  Hive Compaction Observability dashboard in Grafana. Learn how you can use the Management Console
  for this configuration.
You can configure alert receivers in the Management Console to trigger automated
   system-specific event notifications through external services such as emails, Slack channel
   messages, webhook notifications, PagerDuty messages, or SNMP traps. By configuring an alert
   receiver, you specify the details of an external service through which Management Console
   forwards the notification to the specified destination.
For more information, see Configuring alert receivers using Management Console.
