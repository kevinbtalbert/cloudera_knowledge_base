Configuring compaction alert rules
You can use the Management Console to define and manage compaction alert rules for your
  Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) deployment based on Prometheus expressions. The alerts are
  automatically triggered when specific events occur in your deployment.
You can create custom alert rules based on your requirements. Further, you can edit, delete,
   enable, or disable an alert. Ensure that you have administrator privileges to configure alert
   rules.
For information about defining a new alert rule, see Configuring alert rules.
For information about managing alert rules, see Additional operations on the alert rules.
