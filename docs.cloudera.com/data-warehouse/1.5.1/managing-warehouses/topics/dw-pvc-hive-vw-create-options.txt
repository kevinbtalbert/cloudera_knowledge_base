Hive warehouse configuration options
While creating Hive Virtual Warehouses, you can set auto-suspend time, disable
        automatic suspension of the Virtual Warehouse, configure concurrency auto-scaling, and
        enable query isolation. These configurations help you in provisioning a high-performance and
        scalable Hive Virtual Warehouse.
Auto-suspend Virtual WarehousesAutoSuspend Timeout is an option you can set while creating a Virtual Warehouse.   Understand how the auto-suspend timeout option works along with the auto-scaling settings on a   Virtual Warehouse.Concurrency autoscalingConcurrency autoscaling is an option you can set while creating a Hive Virtual   Warehouse. Understand how concurrency autoscaling works and when to use it.Query isolationQuery isolation is an option you can set while creating a Hive Virtual Warehouse.     Understand how you can enable query isolation to configure the SQL engine to isolate queries     that involve lengthy scanning, how to determine the default scan size threshold, and the queries     types that benefit from query isolation.
