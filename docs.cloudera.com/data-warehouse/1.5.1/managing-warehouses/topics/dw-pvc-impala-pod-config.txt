Impala pod configuration option in CDW Private Cloud
Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) allocates standard resources to the warehouses that are
  suitable for most workloads. You can control the size of the Virtual Warehouse at the time of
  creation by choosing the number of nodes to be used. You can either select a default option or a
  custom option that you may have created.
What custom pod configuration is in CDW
Pod config is a drop-down menu that you see when you are creating an
    Impala Virtual Warehouse. It displays a default Cdw defaults option and any custom pod
    configurations that you may have created for Impala.
By using custom pod configurations, you can also change the resources used by the critical
    Impala components, such as the coordinators, executors, and catalog daemons to pack a particular
    number of pods into a Kubernetes node or to create extra-large daemons to handle specific
    workloads.

Resource allocation for Impala coordinator, executor, and catalog when you select the "Cdw
    defaults" option
The following table lists the default values for memory, CPUs, maximum and initial memory
    allocation pools for a Java Virtual Machine, AC Slots (admission_control_slots flag), cache
    size, scratch size, and overhead size for Impala coordinators, executors, and catalogs when you
    select Cdw defaults from the Pod config drop-down
     menu:Table 1. Cdw default: resource allocation for Impala coordinator, executor, and catalog
