Spill Impala queries to external storage
Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) on Private Cloud enables you to write intermediate files
  during large sorts, joins, aggregations, or analytic function operations to a remote scratch space
  on HDFS or Ozone.
What is spill to external storage
Spill to external storage is an option in CDW where you can specify an
    HDFS or Ozone URI while creating an Impala Virtual Warehouse. This is where Impala writes
    intermediate files during large sorts, joins, aggregations, or analytic function operations.

How spilling to external storage works
To use this feature, you first configure the Impala daemon to use the specified locations for
    writing the intermediate files as described in Configuring Impala daemon to spill to HDFS. Then specify
    the HDFS or Ozone URI in the following format:
HDFS:
      hdfs://[***HOSTNAME***]:[***PORT***]/[***PATH***]:[***LIMIT***]
Ozone:
      ofs://[***SERVICE-NAME***]/[***PATH***]:[***LIMIT***]
Hostname and port are mandatory arguments that you must specify in the HDFS URI.
noteWhen a valid HDFS URI is passed by the client, the 300G of local
    storage is used as a local disk buffer for spilling to HDFS.
