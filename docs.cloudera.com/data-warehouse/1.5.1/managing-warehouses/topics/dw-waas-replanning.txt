How workload-aware autoscaling works
The Impala planner traverses successively larger executor groups iteratively to find one
    to run the query efficiently. Traversal stops when the planner finds an acceptable executor
    group set. In Workload Aware Auto-Scaling, this process is called replanning.
The replan is based on memory and CPU estimates. If the query will not fit into the
   estimated memory, or if the query needs more cores to run efficiently, the planner looks for an
   executor group set with sufficient memory. If none is found, the query is queued to the next
   pool.
The following diagram shows an example of the replan: 
The query enters the panner and generates the conventional query plan. If the
   resources arenâ€™t available for the query, another replan occurs. The process continues
   iteratively, and if all executor groups sets fail to meet the criteria for running the query,
   Workload Aware Auto-Scaling assigns the last group to try to run the query. 
After replanning and establishing an executor group set able to run the query, the
   query enters the admission queue for a pool. The query will get admitted when the resources are
   available in the pool. The query may or may not succeed, depending on the resource settings and
   size of the executor group. 
The size of the request pool and corresponding executor group set affects what queries can run
   there. No extra tuning is required. You can perform complex tuning of request pools using
   admission control by editing raw files. Do so only if you are an expert. For more information,
   see the following documentation:
