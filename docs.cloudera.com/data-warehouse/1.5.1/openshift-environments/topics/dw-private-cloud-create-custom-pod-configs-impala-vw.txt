Creating custom pod configurations for Impala Virtual Warehouses
You can configure the resources used by Impala Virtual Warehouses in Cloudera Data
        Warehouse (CDW) Private Cloud environments to optimize Impala performance or to control
        resource usage in the environment.
When you create a Virtual Warehouse, CDW allocates standard resources to the
            Warehouses that are suitable for most workloads. You can control the size of the Virtual
            Warehouse at the time of creation by choosing the number of nodes to be used. By using
            custom pod configurations, you can also change the resources used by the critical Impala
            components, such as the coordinators, executors, and catalog daemons to pack a
            particular number of pods into a Kubernetes node or to create extra-large daemons to
            handle specific workloads.
Ensure that the Customize pod sizes
            option is selected on the Advanced Configuration > Advanced Settings page. 

Log in to the Data Warehouse service as a DWAdmin.

Go to your environment and click  > Edit.
The Environment Details page is displayed.

Click the POD CONFIGURATIONS tab.
The following two read-only options are displayed: Cdw
                        Defaults and 1 x Node. You can create a
                    copy of these options and customize them.






The Cdw Defaults option is selected by default.
                        CDW uses default values for the pods if a specific pod configuration is not
                        used.
The 1 x Node option calculates and shows the
                        resources based on the attributes of a random node from a cluster, assuming
                        all of them are the same.

A pod configuration is a named resource that is configured at the environment
                    level.

Click Actions corresponding to the configuration you
                    want to copy and customize and click Make A Copy.

Specify a name for the new configuration in the Cloned Config
                        Name field. Optionally, specify a description and click
                        Create New Config.





A new pod configuration is created, which you can now
                    customize.

Specify the values for the following parameters under the
                        Coordinator section:


Memory
CPUs
Xmx (maximum memory allocation pool for a Java Virtual
                            Machine)
Xms (initial memory allocation pool for a Java Virtual
                            Machine)
AC Slots (admission_control_slots flag)
Cache size (size of the data cache)
Scratch size (limit of Impala scratch space)
Overhead size (size for resources used by tools run by the
                            containers)








importantBy default, the total space
                        allocated for scratch, cache, and overhead is 600 GiB, with scratch=280GiB,
                        cache=280GiB, and overhead=40GiB. You can allocate space for these
                        components in the following format: [***QUANTITY***][***UNIT***]. The
                            quantity can be a decimal number, separated by a period (.). For
                            example, 240.5GiB. The unit must be in GiB (gibibytes).1 GiB
                            (gibibyte) equals 1.074 GB (gigabytes).


Specify the values for the following parameters under the
                        Executor section:


Memory
CPUS
Xmx (maximum memory allocation pool for a Java Virtual
                            Machine)
Xms (initial memory allocation pool for a Java Virtual
                            Machine)
AC Slots (admission_control_slots flag)
Cache size (size of the data cache)
Scratch size (limit of Impala scratch space)
Overhead size (size for resources used by tools run by the
                            containers)








noteBy default, the total space allocated for scratch,
                        cache, and overhead is 600 GiB, with scratch=280GiB, cache=280GiB, and
                        overhead=40GiB. You can allocate space for these components in the following
                        format: [***QUANTITY***][***UNIT***]. The quantity can be a decimal
                            number, separated by a period (.). For example, 240.5GiB. The unit must
                            be in GiB (gibibytes).1 GiB (gibibyte) equals 1.074 GB
                            (gigabytes).


Specify the values for the following parameters under the
                        Catalog section:


Memory
CPUS
Xmx (maximum memory allocation pool for a Java Virtual
                            Machine)
Xms (initial memory allocation pool for a Java Virtual
                            Machine)








Specify the values for the following parameters under the Default
                        Settings section:


MaxQueryMemLimit
MinQueryMemLimit
mt_dop







Optional: 
Make the configuration default by selecting the Set As
                        Default option.
This makes a pod configuration the default configuration at the environment
                    level.

Click Apply Changes under the POD
                        CONFIGURATION tab to save the custom settings.
The Configuration update initiated message is
                    displayed.
The new pod configuration becomes available in the Pod
                        Config drop-down menu as shown in the following image. You can
                    select this Impala pod configuration while creating a new Impala Virtual
                    Warehouse. 



While adding a new Impala Virtual Warehouse, you can select
            the Pod Configuration to be used for resource allocation. The default value is "Cdw
            Defaults", but you can select other configurations available in your environment that
            you created using these steps.
