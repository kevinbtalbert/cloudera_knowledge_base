Creating your first Virtual Warehouse
After you activate an environment in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), a default
    Database Catalog is automatically created. After the Database Catalog is in the running state,
    you can create Virtual Warehouses.
You can create Hive, Impala, or Impala Virtual Warehouses with
      Unified Analytics mode enabled.

important(On OpenShift environments) To activate an environment for the
        CDW service, someone with adequate permissions must use the Red Hat OpenShift Local Storage
        Operator to create a local file system on an SSD/NVMe for each OpenShift worker node and
        then mount it to a known location on the worker node. This creates space for local caching.
        The process is documented in Activating OpenShift environments.On ECS
          clusters, CDW automatically creates the local file system. No additional steps are
          needed.


Log in to the data Warehouse service as DWAdmin.

On the Overview page, click Create Virtual
            Warehouse.
The New Virtual Warehouse modal screen is displayed.

Specify a name for your Virtual Warehouse, select the type, specify a size and click
            Create.
To create a first test Virtual Warehouse, you can proceed with the default values. For
          fine-tuning, sizing, configuring, creating, and upgrading Virtual Warehouses, see Managing
          Virtual Warehouses.

You can submit workloads and run queries using Hue. You can also
      use SQL clients such as beeline, impala-shell, and so on to submit workloads after you connect
      them to your Virtual Warehouses.
