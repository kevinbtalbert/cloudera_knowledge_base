Standard resource mode requirements
Review the memory, storage, and hardware requirements for getting started with the
    Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service in standard resource mode on Red Hat OpenShift and Embedded Container Service.
To get started with the CDW service on standard resource mode, make sure you have fulfilled
      the following requirements:

CDP Cloudera Manager must be installed and running.
CDP Private Cloud must be installed and running. See Installing on OpenShift and Installing on ECS for more details.
An environment must have been registered with Management Console on the private
         cloud. See CDP Private Cloud Environments for more details.
In addition to the general requirements, CDW also has the following minimum memory,
          storage, and hardware requirements for each worker node using the standard resource
          mode:

Depending on the number of executors you
        want to run on each physical node, the per-node requirements change proportionally. For
        example, if you are running 3 executor pods per physical node, you require 384 GB of memory
        and approximately 1.8 TB of locally attached SSD/NVMe storage.
The following table lists the minimum and recommended compute
        (processor), memory, storage, and network bandwidth required for each OpenShift or ECS
        worker node using the Standard Resource Mode for production use case. Note that the actual
        node still needs some extra resources to run the operating system, Kubernetes engine, and
        Cloudera Manager agent on ECS.

CPU per worker
16 cores [or 8 cores or 16 threads that have Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)
                enabled]
32+ cores (can also be achieved by enabling SMT)

FAST (Fully Automated Storage Tiering) Cache - Locally attached SCSI device(s) on
                  every worker.
Preferred: NVMe and SSD.
OCP uses Local Storage Operator. ECS uses Local Path Provisioner.

1.2 TB* SATA, SSD per host
1.2 TB* NVMe/SSD per host


Network Bandwidth
1 GB/s guaranteed bandwidth to every CDP Private Cloud Base node
10 GB/s guaranteed bandwidth to every CDP Private Cloud Base node


importantWhen you add memory and storage, it is
        very important that you add it in the increments as follows:
Increments of 128 GB of memory
Increments of 600 GB of locally attached SSD/NVMe storage
If you add memory or storage that is not in the above increments, the memory and
          storage that exceeds these increments is not used for executor pods. Instead, the extra
          memory and storage can be used by other pods that require fewer resources.For
          example, if you add 200 GB of memory, only 128 GB is used by the executor pods. If you add
          2 TB of locally attached storage, only 1.8 TB is used by the executor pods.
