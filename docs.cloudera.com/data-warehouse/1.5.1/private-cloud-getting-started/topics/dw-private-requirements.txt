Requirements for deploying Cloudera Data Warehouse on Private Cloud
Review the hardware requiremetns for deploying Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) in low and
  starndard resource modes, security and database requirements, user roles required to access and
  administer CDW.
Low resource mode requirementsReview the memory, storage, and hardware requirements for getting started with the     Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service in low resource mode on Red Hat OpenShift and Embedded Container Service (ECS). This mode reduces the minimum amount of hardware     needed.Standard resource mode requirementsReview the memory, storage, and hardware requirements for getting started with the     Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service in standard resource mode on Red Hat OpenShift and Embedded Container Service.Security requirements for Cloudera Data Warehouse Private CloudThis topic describes security requirements needed to install and run Cloudera Data     Warehouse (CDW) Private Cloud service on Red Hat OpenShift and Embedded Container Service (ECS) clusters.Base cluster database requirements for Cloudera Data Warehouse Private CloudYou must be aware of the requirements for the database that is used for the Hive     Metastore on the base cluster (Cloudera Manager side) for Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Private     Cloud.CDP resource roles and other prerequisites To get started in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), your data must       conform to supported compression codecs, and you must obtain CDP resource roles to grant users       access to a private cloud environment. Users can then get started on CDW tasks, such as     activating the environment from CDW.
