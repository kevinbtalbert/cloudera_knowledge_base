Setting up an Impala Virtual Warehouse 
You learn how to set up a Unified Analytics Virtual Warehouse for Business
        Intelligence (BI), or ad-hoc querying. An Impala Virtual Warehouse can read full ACID tables
        in the Hive metastore, and can write insert-only ACID tables because you select the Impala
        engine type.
 First you create a Virtual Warehouse of SQL engine type Impala, and then you
            enable Unified Analytics.


Required role: DW Admin



Create a Virtual Warehouse as described in "Creating a Virtual Warehouse",
                    selecting the Impala engine type.






Select a database catalog, or accept the default. 

Select a size for the Virtual Warehouse.

Click Enable Unified Analytics.

Turn off Disable AutoSuspend if you intend to use Impala
                    coordinator shutdown, which you enable in the next step.
The Impala coordinator does not automatically shutdown unless the Impala
                    executors are suspended. 

Configure Impala coordinator shutdown by turning on Allow Shutdown
                        Of Coordinator and accept the default value Enabled
                        Active-Passive in High Availability (HA).

For the benefits and other information about Coordinator shutdown, see configure Impala coordinator shutdown. 

Configure other options.
