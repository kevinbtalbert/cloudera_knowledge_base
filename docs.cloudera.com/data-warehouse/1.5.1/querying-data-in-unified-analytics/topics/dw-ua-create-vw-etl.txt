Setting up a Hive Virtual Warehouse
You learn how to set up a Hive Unified Analytics Virtual Warehouse. If you have
        extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs, you need to learn how to enable query isolation
        mode. 
When you create a Hive Virtual Warehouse, Unified Analytics is automatically
            enabled. This type of Virtual Warehouse can read and write full ACID tables in the Hive
            metastore. ETL jobs, identified by their size, run in query isolation mode if
            enabled.


Required role: DW Admin
