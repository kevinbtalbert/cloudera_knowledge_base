Handling ETL jobs
 Unified Analytics provides DML support for extract, transform, and load tasks. ETL
  jobs, identified by their size, run in query isolation mode if enabled.
 Unified Analytics supports insert, update, merge, and delete statements for performing ETL
   tasks.
noteQuery isolation feature for Unified Analytics
    is in Technical Preview in 1.5.0 and not recommended for use in production deployments. Cloudera
    recommends that you try this feature in test or development environments.
