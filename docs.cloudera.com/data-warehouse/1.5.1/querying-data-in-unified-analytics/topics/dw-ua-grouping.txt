Using roll ups and grouping sets
If your work involves heavy OLAP queries, you need to know about grouping sets and roll ups. Unified Analytics supports
 grouping sets with rollups and grouping functions. 
You created a Unified Analytics Virtual Warehouse based on a Database Catalog that loads
      the sample data to run queries of airline data.

Click  > Open Hue on the Virtual Warehouse tile. 

Select a database.

In Hue, select either the Impala or Hive editor. 

Run a query that determines the number of flights per country and state.

SELECT
  a.country,
  a.state,
  grouping(a.country)
  grouping(a.state)
  SUM(f.Distance),
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  flights f,
  airports a
WHERE
  f.origin = a.iata
GROUP BY
  a.country,
  a.state
WITH ROLLUP;

Per the SQL standard, you see the grouping function 0 if youâ€™re using the code
          for the group itself; otherwise, the function is 1. If you group only by country the
          grouping function is 1.

Run a query that defines custom grouping sets: country and country/state.

SELECT
  a.country,
  a.state,
  grouping(a.country)
  grouping(a.state)
  SUM(f.Distance),
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  flights f,
  airports a
WHERE
  f.origin = a.iata
GROUP BY
  a.country,
  a.state
GROUPING SETS (
  (a.country),
  (a.country, a.state)
);
