Connecting an Impala shell client
You need to provide the commands to your client users for installing and launching
        the Impala shell to connect to your Unified Analytics. Client users can then query your
        tables. You learn how to obtain the command for installing the Impala shell on a client and
        other information to provide to clients. 

To access Unified Analytics from the Impala Shell, clients need to connect to
                HiveServer (HS2), which is available in the same CDP cluster as Impala. The JDBC URL
                for the HS2 endpoint uses the strict HS2 protocol option to access Unified Analytics
                from the Impala Shell. Windows clients are not supported.

                    connection string your client needs to connect to Unified Analytics in your
