Connecting a JDBC client
You see how to establish the connection between your JDBC client and Unified Analytics.
 In this task, you connect to a Unified Analytics Virtual Warehouse. First, you
            download the JDBC driver to give to your client. Next, you obtain the Unified Analytics
            endpoint for the connection. Finally, you provide necessary information to your client. 
 Log in to the CDP web interface and navigate to the Data Warehouse service.Click Data Warehouse > Overview.
Click  on the Virtual Warehouse tile.

Click Download JDBC Jar or Download Unified
                        Analytics JDBC Driver, depending on your Virtual Warehouse SQL
                    engine type.
This action downloads the JAR (driver) file to your local
                    system.

Provide the JAR file you downloaded to your JDBC client. For most of the
                    clients, the JAR file should be added under the Libraries folder. Refer to your
                    client documentation for information about the correct location.

Click the options  again. 

Click Copy JDBC URL.

Paste the copied JDBC URL into a text file. It looks something like this:

jdbc:hive2://<your-virtual-warehouse>.<your-environment>.<your-domain.com>/default;transportMode=http;httpPath=cliservice;ssl=true;retries=3


Provide the Unified Analytics JDBC URL to your client.

<your-virtual-warehouse>.<your-environment>.<domain.company.com>


On the JDBC client end, check that the user can set the authentication
                    credentials:
Authentication: Username and Password
Username: Username you use to connect to the CDP Data Warehouse
                    service.
Password: Password you use to connect to the CDP Data Warehouse
                    service.
