DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW
You can avoid making a table name unusable by dropping a dependent materialized view
    before dropping a table.
Syntax
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW [db_name.]materialized_view_name;

db_name.materialized_view_name
The database name followed by a name for the materialized view in dot notation. 


Description
Dropping a table that is used by a materialized view is not allowed and prevents you from creating another table of the same name. You must drop the materialized view before dropping the tables.

Example
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW mydb.mv1;
