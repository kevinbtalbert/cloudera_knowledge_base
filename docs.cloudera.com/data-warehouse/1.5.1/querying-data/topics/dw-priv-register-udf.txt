Registering the UDF
In Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), you run a command from Hue to make the UDF
        functional in Hive queries. The UDF persists between HiveServer restarts.
You need to set up UDF access using a Ranger policy as follows:
Log in to the Data Warehouse service and open Ranger from  the Database Catalog
                    associated with your Hive Virtual Warehouse.
On the Service Manager page, under the HADOOP
                        SQL section, select the Database Catalog associated with the
                    Hive Virtual Warehouse in which you want to run the UDFs.The list of policies
                        is displayed.
Select the all - database, udf policy and add the users needing
                    access to Hue. To add all users, you can specify
                    {USER}.

In this task, the registration command differs depending
            on the method you choose to configure the cluster for finding the JAR. If you use the
            Hive aux library directory method that involves a symbolic link, you need to restart the
            HiveServer pod after registration. If you use the direct JAR reference method, you do
            not need to restart HiveServer. You must recreate the symbolic link after any patch or
            maintenance upgrades that deploy a new version of Hive.

Open Hue from the Hive Virtual Warehouse in CDW.

Run the registration command by including the JAR location in the command as
                    follows:

CREATE FUNCTION udftypeof AS 'com.mycompany.hiveudf.TypeOf01' USING JAR 'hdfs:///warehouse/tablespace/managed/TypeOf01-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar';

Optional: 
Restart the HiveServer.
You can either delete the hiveserver2-0 pod using Kubernetes, or, you can edit
                    an HS2 related configuration, and CDP restarts the HiveServer pod.noteIf you plan to run UDFs on LLAP, you must restart the
                        query executor and query coordinator pods after registering the
                    UDF.

Verify whether the UDF is registered.

You scroll through the output and find
                    default.typeof.
