Querying data in Cloudera Data Warehouse
This topic describes how to query data in your Virtual Warehouse on Cloudera Data
      Warehouse (CDW).

The CDW service includes the Hue SQL editor that you can use to submit queries to Virtual
        Warehouses. For example, you can use Hue to submit queries to an Impala Virtual Warehouse.
