Viewing query history in Cloudera Data Warehouse
In Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), you can view all queries that were run against a
    Database Catalog from Hue, Beeline, Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC), Tableau, Impala-shell,
    Impyla, and so on.
You need to set up Query Processor administrators to view the list of all queries from
      all users, or to restrict viewing of queries.  

Log in to the CDP web interface and navigate to the Data Warehouse service.

In the Data Warehouse service, navigate to the Overview
      page.

From a Virtual Warehouse, launch Hue.

Click on the Jobs icon on the left-assist panel.
The Job Browser page is displayed.

Go to the Queries tab to view query history and query
          details.
