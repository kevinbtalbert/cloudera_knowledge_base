Known issues in Hue
This topic describes the Hue known issues for Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Private
    Cloud.
Known issues identified in 1.5.1


CDPD-54376: Clicking the home button on the File Browser page
            redirects to HDFS user directory
When you are previewing a file on any supported filesystem, such
            as S3, ABFS, or Ozone and you click on the Home button, you are
            redirected to the HDFS user home directory instead of the user home directory on the
            said filesystem.
None.


DWX-15090: Intermittently see the CSRF error in the Hue Job
            Browser
You may intermittently see the “403 - CSRF” error on the Hue web
            interface as well as in the Hue logs after running Hive queries from Hue.
Reload the page or start a new Hue session.


DWX-14911: Export operation failing in a partitioned Hive
            table
You may see the following error in the Hive server logs when
            running the EXPORT TABLE query in Hive: Execution Error, return code 1
              from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.ExportTask. Distcp operation
            failed. This issue occurs when the number of files and the size of files
            exceeds the limits specified in the hive.exec.copyfile.maxsize and
              hive.exec.copyfile.maxnumfiles properties respectively, and the
            EXPORT TABLE query launches the distributed copy (distcp) job to copy
            files of HDFS. 
Increase the limit of following properties in HiveServer2:
              
hive.exec.copyfile.maxsize to maximum size of files in
                a directory in bytes
hive.exec.copyfile.maxnumfiles to maximum number of
                files in a directory

DWX-12616: Hue limitation in CDW Private Cloud
Following are the known limitations in Hue in CDW Private Cloud
              1.5.0:
Hue Importer does not support importing files more than 200 KB in
                size
Hue File Browser does not work if the HDFS service on the base cluster
                is configured for high availability

None.


DWX-13865: Hue File Browser does not work with HDFS HA
Hue File Browser is not accessible or displays a 403 error when
            you click on File Browser from the left assist panel in CDW Private Cloud if HDFS is
            configured for High Availability on the base cluster. Currently, Hue in CDW cannot
            obtain the hostname and the port from the HttpFS service on the base cluster. This is a
            known limitation.
You must manually build and specify the WebHDFS URL for
            Hue in CDW to connect to the HttpFS service on the base cluster.
Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.
Go to Clusters > Hive > Configuration and note the value present in the Kerberos
                  Principal field.This is the Hive service account name.
Go to Clusters > HDFS > HttpFS Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                    httpfs-site.xml and click  to add the following
                    lines:Name:
httpfs.proxyuser.hive.hosts, Value:
*Name: httpfs.proxyuser.hive.groups, Value: *Replace
                  hive with the actual Hive service account name.
Click Save Changes and restart the HDFS service or the
                HttpFS role.
Go to the Instances tab and note the hostname of the HttpFS
                role.
Go to the Configuration tab and note the port for the
                  hdfs.httpfs.http.port configuration from the
                  RESTPort field.The default value of the
                    hdfs.httpfs.http.port configuration is 14000.
Use the hostname and the port to construct the WebHDFS URL as
                follows:https://[***HOSTNAME***]:[***PORT***]/webhdfs/v1
Log in to the Data Warehouse service as a DWAdmin.
Go to the Virtual Warehouse from which you want to connect Hue to the base
                cluster’s HDFS service and click  > Edit. 
Go to CONFIGURATIONS > Hue, select hue-safety-valve from the
                  Configuration files drop-down list and add the following
                  lines:[hadoop]
[[hdfs_clusters]]
[[[default]]]
webhdfs_url=https://[***HOSTNAME***]:[***PORT***]/webhdfs/v1Specify
                  the WebHDFS URL that you constructed earlier.
Click Apply changes.Update the
                    hue-safety-valve configuration for any Hive or Impala
                  Virtual Warehouses from which you want to connect to the base cluster
                HDFS.

DWX-9373: Unable to log into Hue as a local administrator
If you have logged into the CDP Management Console as a local administrator, then you
            may not be able to log into Hue and you may see the following error: “User is not

            organization’s LDAP tree or log into the CDP Management Console using your LDAP
            credentials and then access Hue.
