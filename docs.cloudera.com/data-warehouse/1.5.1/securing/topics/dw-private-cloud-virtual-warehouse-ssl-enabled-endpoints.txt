SSL-enabled endpoints for Virtual Warehouse clients in CDW on Private Cloud
In Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Private Cloud, all client endpoints have been
    SSL-enabled. This requires that you configure the SSL certificates for client
    endpoints.
The client endpoints for web applications and Virtual Warehouse client URLs are SSL-enabled.
      The following endpoints use the OpenShift/Embedded Container Service cluster
      default certificate: 
Hue
Impala coordinator
HiveServer2


Domain name changes
To use the OpenShift/Embedded Container Service cluster wildcard certificate,
        the DNS names have been changed. The environment ID sub domain from the
        domain name has been removed. This creates a flat DNA structure so the cluster wildcard
        certificate can be applied to the endpoints. 

Generating a truststore for a self-signed certificate
You can query the service certificate and convert it to a JKS truststore using the following
     steps:

Retrieve the certificate:
          $ openssl s_client -showcerts -connect hs2-my-cwh1.apps.cdw.mycloud.myfirm.com:443 -servername
hs2-my-cwh1.apps.cdw.mycloud.myfirm.com </dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM > <mycertfile>.pem

Convert the PEM file to a truststore. You will be prompted for a password.
          $ keytool -import -alias hs2-my-cw1.apps.cdw.mycloud.myfirm.com -file <mycertfile>.pem -keystore <mycert>.jks



Opening SSL-enabled connections with Database Catalog clients
The CDW Virtual Warehouse clients like beeline and impala-shell can open SSL-enabled
        connections as described in this section.
Beeline
A beeline connection can be created using a JDBC connection string. Specifying the username
       and password with the '-n' and the '-p' options returns an
       error. The beeline CLI prompts for credentials:
$ beeline
beeline> !connect
jdbc:hive2://hs2-my-cwh1.apps.cdw.mycloud.myfirm.com:443/default;transportMode=http;httpPath=cliservice;
     ssl=true;retries=3;sslTrustStore=<JKS-path>;trustStorePassword=<***password***>
Enter username for jdbc:hive2://hs2-my-cwh1.apps.cdw.mycloud.myfirm.com:443/default:<my-user-name
Enter password for jdbc:hive2://hs2-my-cwh1.apps.cdw.mycloud.myfirm.com:443/default:<********>
importantThe value for <JKS-path> is
       generated in the above section "Generating a truststore for a self-signed certificate."
impala-shell
The impala-shell CLI opens a TLS/SSL-enabled connection when you use the
       `--ssl` option. If `--ca_cert` is not set, impala-shell
       enables TLS/SSL, but does not validate the server certificate. Set the `--ca_cert`
       CLI option to the local path name that points to the third-party CA certificate, or to a copy
     of the server certificate in the case you have a self-signed server certificate:
$ impala-shell --protocol='hs2-http' -i "coordinator-my-iwh2.apps.cdw.mycloud.myfirm.com:443" --ssl

OpenShift routes
OpenShift routes are used to expose the user-facing services in the CDW Private Cloud
       deployment. Route objects can perform edge TLS termination using the cluster-deployed
       certificate for the endpoints. If the cluster certificate must be rotated, the routes can
       pick up the new certificate automatically. It is not necessary to re-deploy or to manually
       configure the service in order to pick up the changes.
