Configuring Impala Virtual Warehouses to encrypt spilled data in CDW on Private
        Cloud
If you have encrypted HDFS on the base CDP cluster, then Cloudera recommends that you
        configure an Impala Virtual Warehouse to write temporary data to disk during query
        processing in an encrypted format using the AES-256-CFB encryption for complete
        security.

In CDP Private Cloud, the temporary data is spilled to the local storage, the
                location of which is hard coded by the system.
importantImpala does not selectively encrypt data based on whether the
                source data is already encrypted in HDFS. This results in at most 15 percent
                performance degradation when data is spilled.


Log in to the Data Warehouse service as an administrator.

Go to Impala Virtual Warehouse >  > Edit > CONFIGURATIONS > Impala coordinator and select flagfile from the
                        Configuration files drop-down list.

Set the value of the disk_spill_encryption property to
                        true.

Click APPLY.

Go to the Impala executor tab and select
                        flagfile from the Configuration
                        files drop-down list.

Set the value of the disk_spill_encryption property to
                        true.

Click APPLY.

Restart the Impala Virtual Warehouse.
