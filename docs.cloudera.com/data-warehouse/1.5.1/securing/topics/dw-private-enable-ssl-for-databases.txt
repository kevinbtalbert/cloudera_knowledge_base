How to enable SSL for MariaDB, MySQL, and Oracle databases
Cloudera requires that you secure the network connection between the default Database
    Catalog Hive MetaStore (HMS) in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) and the relational database
    hosting the base clusterâ€™s HMS using SSL encryption.
You must provide the SSL certificate of the database either by:
Providing the SSL certificate while installing the Data Services on the Install Private Cloud Data Services on Existing Container Cloud > Configure Kubernetes step under the Additional Certificates section. See Installing in an internet environment. 
Importing the SSL certificate to the trust store on the base cluster before installing CDP
     Private Cloud.


Configuring MySQL database to use SSL for Data WarehouseSSL encrypts the connection between the MySQL server and the Hive MetaStore (HMS) on         the base cluster. You must enable SSL for the MySQL database before setting up the CDP         Private Cloud Data Services and add the MySQL root Certificate Authorities (CA) to the         Cloudera Manager truststore.Configuring MariaDB database to use SSL for Data WarehouseSSL encrypts the connection between the MariaDB server and the Hive MetaStore (HMS)         on the base cluster. You must enable SSL for the MariaDB database before setting up the CDP         Private Cloud Data Services.Configuring Oracle database to use SSL for Data WarehouseYou must enable SSL for the Oracle database before setting up the CDP Private Cloud         Data Services. Enabling SSL establishes a secure channel between the client (CDP-side) and         the server (Oracle database server).
