Configuring Oracle database to use SSL for Data Warehouse
You must enable SSL for the Oracle database before setting up the CDP Private Cloud
        Data Services. Enabling SSL establishes a secure channel between the client (CDP-side) and
        the server (Oracle database server).

To enable SSL, you need to configure SSL only on the server side. The client-side
                configurations are present in CDP.


SSH into the Oracle database server host.

Change to the "oracle" user as follows:

sudo -su oracle


Append the location of ORACLE_HOME to the
                        PATH environment variable by running the following
                    commands:

export ORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1
export PATH=${PATH}:${ORACLE_HOME}/bin


Create an auto-login wallet by running the following command:

orapki wallet create -wallet /opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/wallet -auto_login

An auto-login wallet uses SSL's single sign-on functionality. The users do not
                    need to specify password each time they open the wallet.

Add a self-signed certificate to this wallet by running the following
                    command:

orapki wallet add -wallet /opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/wallet -dn "CN=server" -keysize 4096 -self_signed -validity 365


Export the certificate from the Oracle wallet by running the following
                    command:

orapki wallet export -wallet /opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/wallet -dn "CN=server" -cert server_ca.cert

This exports a certificate with the subject's distinguished name
                        (-dn) (CN=server) from a wallet to the file that is
                    specified by -cert (server_ca.cert).

Add the following lines to the
                        /opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/network/admin/listener.ora
                    configuration file:

SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
WALLET_LOCATION =
  (SOURCE =
    (METHOD = FILE)
    (METHOD_DATA =
      (DIRECTORY = /opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/wallet)
    )
  )
Register a new address in LISTENER:
(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCPS)(HOST = [***HOST***])(PORT = 2484))


Add the following lines to the
                        /opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/network/admin/sqlnet.ora
                    profile configuration file:

SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
WALLET_LOCATION =
  (SOURCE =
    (METHOD = FILE)
    (METHOD_DATA =
      (DIRECTORY = /opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/wallet)
    )
  )


Add the following lines to the
                        /opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora
                    configuration file:

ORCLPDB1_SSL =
    (DESCRIPTION =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCPS)(HOST = [***HOST***])(PORT = 2484))
      (CONNECT_DATA =
        (SERVER = DEDICATED)
        (SERVICE_NAME = ORCLPDB1)
      )
      (SECURITY =
        (MY_WALLET_DIRECTORY = /opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/wallet)
      )
    )


Restart the listener by running the following commands:

lsnrctl stop
lsnrctl start


Copy the content of the certificate that you exported earlier and add it to the
                    keystore on the base cluster instances.
Paste the copied content to the ca-cert.pem file.

Fetch the keystore password from the
                        /etc/hadoop/conf/ssl-client.xml file by running the
                    following command:

/usr/java/default/bin/keytool -importcert -alias oracle -file ca-cert.pem -keystore /var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks -storetype jks -noprompt -storepass [***PASSWORD***]


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hive service > Configuration > Hive Metastore Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                            Valve) for hive-site.xml and click  to add the following:


Name:
                                javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL
Value:
                                jdbc:oracle:thin:@tcps://[***BASE_CLUSTER_HOSTNAME***]:2484/ORCLPDB1?javax.net.ssl.trustStore=/var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks&javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=[***PASSWORD***]&oracle.net.ssl_server_dn_match=false



Change the port to 2484 in the Hive Metastore
                        Database Port field.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hive service.
