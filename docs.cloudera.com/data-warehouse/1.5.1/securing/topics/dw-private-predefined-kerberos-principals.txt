How predefined Kerberos principals are used in CDW Private Cloud
By default, Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) creates Kerberos principal names for Database
  Catalogs and Environments using the service hostname and the deterministic namespace name based on
  the name of the Database Catalog or Environment when you create a Database Catalog or an
  Environment. However, you can generate and provide the keytabs, if needed.
The service principals for CDW need to be the same as on the base cluster. For more
   information, see Customizing Kerberos principals in the CDP Private Base documentation.
By default, the host principals are generated programmatically. You can generate and provide
   the keytabs, but the hostnames in the Kerberos principals are fixed. CDW uses a deterministic
   namespace and environment IDs for the Kerberos principals.
When you specify an Environment or Database Catalog name, CDW appends a prefix as shown in the
   following table, as well as the Kerberos principal name based on them:

CDW entity
User-specified name
Namespace IDs with CDW-assigned prefix
Hive Kerberos principal name



Environment
my-test-env
env-my-test-env-default
hive/dwx-env-my-test-env.cdp.local@REALM.EXAMPLE.COM


Database Catalog
my-test-catalog
warehouse-my-test-catalog
hive/metastore-service.warehouse-warehouse-my-test-catalog.svc.cluster.local@REALM.EXAMPLE.COM


Virtual Warehouse
my-impala-warehouse
impala-my-impala-warehouse
NA


noteThe length of the namespace ID after CDW applies a prefix to the
   Environment or Database Catalog name, including the hyphen (-), should not exceed 63 characters.
   You can specify an Environment name 35 characters long and Database Catalog 53 characters
    long.When using FreeIPA, the environment name can be maximum 17 characters long.
