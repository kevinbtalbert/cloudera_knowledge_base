What is delegation username in CDW Private Clouds
You must specify a delegation username and password to impersonate authorization
  requests from Hue to the Impala engine during environment activation. The delegation user and
  password can authenticate users through an LDAP service account.
The ability to specify an LDAP delegation user also allows you to freely use special characters
   in your LDAP Bind DN, as CDW no longer has to inherit and process the delegation user from the
   LDAP Bind DN.
noteCDW supports only the following characters for specifying
    the Delegation Password:
lowercase and uppercase alphabets
numbers
whitespace
! “ # $ % & ‘ ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~

You can change the delegation username and password even after activating the environment.
The following image shows the CDW Activation Settings page containing the
    Delegation Username and Delegation Password
   fields:
