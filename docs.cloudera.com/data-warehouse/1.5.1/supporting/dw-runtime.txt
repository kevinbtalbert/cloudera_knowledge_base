Runtime documentation for Data Warehouse
Data Warehouse Runtime provides tightly integrated Apache Hive, Apache Impala, and Hue
  services for Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW). In this section, you can read about how to use Apache
  Hive and Apache Impala SQL from clients that connect to your Virtual Warehouse in CDP Private
  Cloud and how to use Iceberg. Also covered is the Hue interactive query editor, which you can open
  from a Virtual Warehouse to run SQL queries.
