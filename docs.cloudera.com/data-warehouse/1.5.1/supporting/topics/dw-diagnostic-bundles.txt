Generating and downloading diagnostic bundles
Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) collects diagnostic data on workload logs, such as
        Impala Coordinator, Statefulset, CatalogD logs and stores it in the tmp directory on HDFS.
        You can download the logs using the Hue File Browser from the base cluster.

During the lifetime of a cluster, logs are continously written to the following
                directory on HDFS:
                    [**WAREHOUSE-DIR**]/warehouse/tablespace/external/hive/sys.db/.
                When you click Collect Diagnostic Bundle from the CDW web
                interface, CDW collects the logs for the specified time interval and for the
                services that you select. These logs are compressed in a ZIP file format and stored
                in the tmp directory.


Log in to the Data Warehouse service as a DWAdmin.

Click  > Collect Diagnostic Bundle on the Virtual Warehouse for which you want to collect the logs
                    .

On the Diagnostic Bundle Options dialog box, select the
                    time interval and the type of logs you want to collect and click
                        COLLECT.






To view the status of the job and to obtain the HDFS location where the logs
                    are stored, select Edit from the Virtual Warehouse
                    options menu and go to the DIAGNOSTIC BUNDLE tab.
The logs are collected and bundled under the
                        /tmp/[***VIRTUAL-WAREHOUSE-ID-TIMESTAMP***].zip
                    directory.

To access and download the logs, open the Hue service from the base
                    cluster.

Go to the Hue File Browser and click the forward slash
                        (/) before the user directory as
                    shown in the following image:





The tmp directory is displayed. You can access and
                    download the logs to your computer by clicking
                    Download.
