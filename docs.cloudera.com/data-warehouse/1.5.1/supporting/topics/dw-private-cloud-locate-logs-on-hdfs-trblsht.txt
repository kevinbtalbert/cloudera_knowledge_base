Locating Cloudera Data Warehouse Private Cloud logs
Learn how you can access logs for Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Private Cloud.
  

When you generate logs using the Collect Diagnostic Bundles
        option from the environment, they are written to a partition on the Hive
          sys.logs table and are stored in the following location on
          HDFS:/warehouse/[***ENVIRONMENT-NAMEabcde***]/[***DATABASE-CATALOG***]/warehouse/tablespace/external/hive/sys.db/logsabcde
        is a random 5-character string that is appended to the environment name.
These partitions are retained for 7 days by default.


Log in to the OpenShift or Experiences Compute Service (ECS) cluster and determine the
          location of the sys.logs table by running the following query:

DESCRIBE FORMATTED sys.logs;
This SQL statement returns information about the location of the table which contains
            the logs.


Use the location obtained in Step 1 to locate the CDW Private Cloud logs on the
          OpenShift or ECS clusters.
