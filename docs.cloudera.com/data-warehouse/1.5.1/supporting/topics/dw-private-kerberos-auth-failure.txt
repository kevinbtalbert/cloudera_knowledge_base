Resolving Kerberos authentication failure

Condition
When you use impala-shell or a JDBC connection with Kerberos as the authentication
                mechanism, an unauthorized response is received from Impala Virtual Warehouse and
                the following warning message is visible in the logs of the impala coordinator pod:
                    W0530 12:08:09.118422 21760 authentication.cc:783] Failed to
                    authenticate request from <ip-address>:57978 via SPNEGO: Not authorized:
                    Unspecified GSS failure. Minor code may provide more information: Request ticket
                    server hive/dwx-env-<env-name>.cdp.local@ROOT.HWX.SITE kvno 2 found in keytab
                    but not with enctype des3-hmac-sh.


Cause
DES and DES3 encryption types are deprecated. This error occurs when these
                    deprecated encryption types are in the list of enabled Kerberos encryption
                    types, but the Impala Virtual Warehouse pods are running on a cluster where
                    these insecure encryption types are not supported by the operating system
                    running on the cluster nodes.

Solution

To resolve this problem, you can disable using DES and DES3 encryption types
                        in the Kerberos configuration. On test or development environments, you can
                        include and use deprecated encryption types such as rc4-hmac, but you
                        must omit DES and DES3 from the list of the allowed encryption types. Modify
                        the Kerberos configuration of the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster by setting
                        appropriate values for the default_tgs_enctypes,
                            default_tkt_enctypes, and permitted_enctypes
                        parameters in the libdefaults block of the
                            /etc/krb5.conf file.
For
                            example:default_tgs_enctypes = rc4-hmac aes256-cts aes128-cts
default_tkt_enctypes = rc4-hmac aes256-cts aes128-cts
permitted_enctypes = rc4-hmac aes256-cts aes128-cts
allow_weak_crypto = truenoteThe
                                allow_weak_crypto setting is also required to use
                            the deprecated encryption types. 
Cloudera recommends that you do not use deprecated encryption types in
                        production environments. Use stronger encryption types such as AES 256 and
                        AES 128. For
                        example:default_tgs_enctypes = aes256-cts aes128-cts
default_tkt_enctypes = aes256-cts aes128-cts
permitted_enctypes = aes256-cts aes128-cts
After modifying the Kerberos configuration of the CDP Private Cloud Base
                        cluster, go to the CDW web interface and refresh the Dtabase Catalog and the
                        Virtual Warehouse by clicking  > Refresh. This copies configurations from the base cluster to CDW.
