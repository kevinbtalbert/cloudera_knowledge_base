Visualizing data using Cloudera Data Visualization
Data Visualization is a dashboarding and application building service that enables
        you to explore data through the common language of visuals. You create a Cloudera Data
        Visualization (CDV) instance from the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) UI, link your data sets
        to CDV, and build visuals.

Create a CDV instance from the CDW UI by going to Data Visualization > Create. Specify a name, select an environment, select user groups and admin
                groups, and select a size for the CDV instance.




Create a CDW data connection as described in Creating a CDW data connection in Data
                        Visualization.

Create a visual as described in Creating a visual.
