Exploring a Data Lake
In Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Private Cloud, a default Database Catalog is linked
        to the Hive MetaStore (HMS) on the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster. As soon as you activate
        an environment in CDW, you can explore and query databases and tables that are present on
        your base cluster. If you are new to CDP, then you can also import data using Hue and run
        queries.


You must have the DWAdmin role.
Your must have activated an environment in CDW.
You must have a default Database Catalog running.


You set up a Virtual Warehouse with the minimum, default configurations for learning
            how to explore a Data Lake. You do not need to configure auto-scaling and other features
            to explore a Data Lake. Ensure you delete the Virtual Warehouse after your
            exploration.

Log in to the Data Warehouse service as DWAdmin.
