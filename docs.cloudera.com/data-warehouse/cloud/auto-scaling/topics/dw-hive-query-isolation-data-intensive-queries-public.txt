Hive VW isolation auto-scaling
The Hive Virtual Warehouse in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Public Cloud bases its
    auto-scaling on the size of data scanned for a query. Queries that scan amounts of data
    that exceed the hive.query.isolation.scan.size.threshold setting use the query
    isolation method of auto-scaling.
To run ETL-type queries, you turn on query isolation when you configure the Hive Virtual
      Warehouse. Scaling occurs as follows:
If the query does not exceed the hive.query.isolation.scan.size.threshold, concurrency
          scaling occurs. 
If the query does exceed the hive.query.isolation.scan.size.threshold, query isolation
          scaling occurs. 

HiveServer generates a preliminary query execution plan. 
   
The Hive Virtual Warehouse adds a new dedicated executor group with the right number of
      executors to handle the query instead of using the number associated with the T-shirt size you
      configured. This isolated executor group is used only under the following conditions:
You run a single ETL-type query.
The query exceeds the hive.query.isolation.scan.size.threshold.

Otherwise, the concurrency method of auto-scaling is used.
The following diagram shows the isolation method of  auto-scaling:



The variable-sized, ephemeral executor groups for ETL terminate after the query completes.
