Impala VW auto-scaling
The Impala Virtual Warehouse, like the Hive Virtual Warehouse does concurrency
    auto-scaling, but in a different way. Learning how the auto-scaling works helps you choose the
    type of Virtual Warehouse and correctly configure the auto-scaling to handle your
    jobs.
The Impala Virtual Warehouse auto-scaling works with coordinators and executors to make resources available for queued queries, as shown in the following diagram:



An auto-scaler process (a Kubernetes pod), shown at the bottom of the diagram,
      monitors Impala running in the Virtual Warehouse to determine the necessary resources. When
      the auto-scaler detects an imbalance in resources, it sends a request to Kubernetes to
      increase or decrease the number of executor groups in the Virtual Warehouse.
Executor groups execute queries. By default Impala Virtual Warehouses can run 3
      large queries per executor group. For most read-only queries the default setting of 3 queries
      per executor group is sufficient. Executors can handle more queries that are simpler and that
      do not utilize concurrency on the executor.
      
    


Executor processes execute query fragments. Executor processes run on executor
      nodes, the unit of sizing for Virtual Warehouses. Each executor node runs one executor.
