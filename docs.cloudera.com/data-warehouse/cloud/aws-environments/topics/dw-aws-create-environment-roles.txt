Creating the CDP environment and IAM roles
You follows steps to register and activate a new environment to enable RAZ in
        CDW.
You need to register and activate a new environment to enable RAZ in CDW.

Register an environment with
                        RAZ using the CDP web interface.
In the web interface, in Fine-grained access control on S3, select Enable
                    Ranger Authorization for AWS S3.



In Cloudera Data Warehouse Overview, locate and select the RAZ-enabled
                    environment, and click Activate to activate the environment for CDW.
This action disables the standard default Database Catalog that is
                    automatically created after activation. The UMS machine user is created and
                    attached to the environment when you activate the CDW environment. Later, you
                    see how to add this same UMS machine user to a different UMS group for each
                    tenant.

In Activate Environment, select Enable Storage
                    Roles.





Unchecking Enable Storage Roles disables the metadata
                    proxy associated with managed storage access.
Repeat the following steps for each tenant:
In AWS, manually create one or more S3 buckets for the tenant, or use existing buckets.
                    Use bucket-level encryption and a key that is accessible by the IAM role of the tenant.

In AWS, create an IAM role that has
                    significant privileges to read/write to a tenant-specific buckets as well as
                    across all tenants' shared SDX Data Lake bucket.
For example, create a role named role-tenant-1 and a
                    bucket called s3-tenant-1.

In the IAM role, configure a trust relationship with the IDBROKER_ROLE.
 For example:
                    {
                        "Version": "2012-10-17",
                        "Statement": [
                        {
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Principal": {
                        "Service": [
                        "s3.amazonaws.com",
                        "ec2.amazonaws.com"
                        ],
                        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:IDBROKER_ROLE"
                        },
                        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                        }
                        ]
                        }

The IDBROKER_ROLE needs the trust relationship to assume the role
                    role-tenant-1. 

Make a note of the IAM role ARN.

Attach the following AWS policies to the IAM role: AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy,
                    AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy, AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly.
The AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy is shown in the next topic.

Give the AWS Instance Profile (idbroker assume role), the
                    permission to assume role of role-tenant-1. 

{
                        "Version": "2012-10-17",
                        "Statement": [
                        {
                        "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
                        "Resource": [
                        "arn:aws:iam::<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/idbroker-data-access-role",
                        "arn:aws:iam::<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/mock-idbroker-admin-role",
                        "arn:aws:iam::<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/role-tenant-1"
                        ]
                        }
                        ]
                        }
