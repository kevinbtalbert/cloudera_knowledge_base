Custom tags in AWS environmentsCloudera Docs
Custom tags in AWS environments
You can apply Virtual Warehouse-level tags and tenant-level custom tags
    to
    monitor, search, or filter on the key tag or key value in your AWS account.
Use the Virtual Warehouse-level tags to search and monitor the Virtual Warehouses within your
      environment. You can apply Virtual Warehouse-level tags even after creating the CDP
      environment. The tenant-level tags can only be applied while creating a new CDP environment.
      The CDP environment custom tags are propagated to the compute instances within CDW. 
You can identify and monitor the following resources within the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW)
      service for AWS environments:

Compute instances in Hive and Impala Virtual Warehouses with tenant-level and
            Virtual Warehouse tags


Compute instances in Druid cluster with tenant-level tags


AWS S3 buckets

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes for EC2 instances used for compute pods with
          Virtual Warehouse tags. You cannot tag EBS volumes for EC2 instances used for shared
          service pods.
