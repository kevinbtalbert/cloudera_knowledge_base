Adding access to external S3 buckets for Cloudera Data Warehouse clusters on AWS
You can add and query data in S3 buckets you add to Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW)
    service clusters running on AWS environments.
Access to these two buckets is controlled by AWS instance profiles. To access S3 buckets you add to
      your CDW service cluster, you must edit the instance profile to add read/write permissions to
      the additional buckets.

Adding Cloudera Data Warehouse cluster access to S3 buckets in the same AWS accountIn certain scenarios, you might need to interact with data that resides outside of the     data lake S3 buckets. You can add a bucket to S3, and then, using Hue define external tables     based on the data, such as a CSV file, you put into the bucket. Adding Cloudera Data Warehouse cluster access to external S3 buckets in a different AWS accountYou might need to know how to add read/write access to S3 buckets under AWS accounts     that are different from the account for the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service cluster.
