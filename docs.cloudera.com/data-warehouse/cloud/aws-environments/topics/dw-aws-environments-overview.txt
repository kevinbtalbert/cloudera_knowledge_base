AWS environments overview
Learn about environments on AWS in CDP Public Cloud, including requirements you must
    meet before activating your environment in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW).
The CDP environment is closely related to the virtual private network in your cloud provider
      account. Registering an environment with Management Console provides CDP with access to your
      cloud provider account and identifies resources in your account that CDP services can access,
      including Cloudera Data Warehouse. A single environment is contained within a single cloud
      provider region, so all resources deployed by CDP are deployed within that region within one
      specific virtual network. After you have registered an environment with Management Console,
      you can activate the environment in CDW.  Next, you create Database Catalogs, which enables
      CDW to access the associated Data Lake. Finally, you create Virtual Warehouses in CDW that use
      the Database Catalog and its underlying environment.
 By default, Ranger Authorization is enabled in AWS environments. For an introduction to
      enabling RAZ, see the Management Console documentation.
