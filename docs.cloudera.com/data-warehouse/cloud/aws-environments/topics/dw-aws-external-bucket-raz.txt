Accessing buckets in a RAZ environment
In a RAZ (Ranger Authorized) environment, you must configure permissions to access an
        S3 bucket. The procedures for configuring the permissions differ depending on the AWS
        account that owns the bucket. If you have enabled RAZ in your environment, policies attached to the Ranger RAZ Service role
            control access to external S3 buckets. 
Prerequisites
You must meet the following prerequisites before adding access permissions to buckets
                to the RAZ environment within the same AWS account or in a different account:

Obtain the DWAdmin role.
Follow steps similar to the minimum setup for cloud storage to
                    create the Ranger RAZ role.
Register an environment with
                    RAZ using the CDP web interface.
                
                In the web interface, in Fine-grained access control on S3, select Enable
                    Ranger Authorization for AWS S3.





Accessing a bucket in the same AWS account under RAZIn a Ranger Authorized (RAZ) environment, to access an S3 external bucket in the same         AWS account as the cluster, you must configure a policy that manages access to the CDP data         lake. You modify a JSON file that defines the IAM policy to do this.Accessing a bucket in a different AWS account under RAZIn a Ranger Authorized (RAZ) environment, to access an S3 external bucket in a         different AWS account from the CDW cluster, you must configure the bucket policy of the         other account. You use the AWS Management Console to do this.
