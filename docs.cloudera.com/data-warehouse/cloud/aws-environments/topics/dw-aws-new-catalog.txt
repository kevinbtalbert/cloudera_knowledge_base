Creating a new Database Catalog
You repeat a step-by-step procedure to set up a Database Catalog for each tenant,
        taking care to correctly enter your IAM Role ARN.
Repeat the following steps for each tenant.
Click Data Warehouse > Database Catalog > ADD NEW.

In Tenant Storage Role, enter the Iam Role ARN you copied earlier.
Take care to enter the ARN correctly because CDW does not validate your
                    ARN.

In Tenant Storage Location, enter the tenant bucket name, for example
                        s3-tenant-1, and click CREATE.

Select the RAZ-enabled environment.

In Data Lake, SDX is the required value. The backend Data Lake and Database
                        Catalog database must be the same.
