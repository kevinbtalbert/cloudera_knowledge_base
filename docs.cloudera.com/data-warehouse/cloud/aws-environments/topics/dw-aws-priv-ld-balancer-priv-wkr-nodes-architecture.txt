Architecture for Private Load Balancer, Private Worker Nodes deployment on AWS
You can configure a depolyment of Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) to use private
    networking in an AWS environment. An architecture diagram depicts this depolyment
    mode.
You specify the Private Load Balancer, Private Worker Nodes deployment
      mode during environment activation in the CDW service to use private networking. Only the
      Network Address Translation (NAT) gateways reside in public subnets. Network administrators
      must make sure there is outbound internet access from private subnets though a transit
      gateway, for example.
