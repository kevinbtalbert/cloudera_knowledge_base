Supported deployment modes for private networking in AWS
This topic describes the different types of private networking that you can configure
   Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) to use on AWS.
The CDW service can be deployed in three different modes on AWS
     cloud resources. These supported deployment modes determine whether your cluster nodes can
     receive direct connections from the internet.
The supported deployment modes in AWS are:


Public Load Balancer, Public Worker Nodes
Requires that you specify 3 public subnets in the virtual private cloud (VPC) that is
         registered with the Management Console in CDP. In this mode, all AWS network components
         have a publicly visible IP address assigned to them. However, all traffic flows through the
       Kubernetes ingress controller so services and ports are not directly accessible.


Public Load Balancer, Private Worker Nodes
Requires that you specify 3 public subnets and 3 private subnets in the VPC that is
         registered with the Management Console in CDP. In this mode, the Amazon EKS nodes are not
         assigned public IP addresses. All traffic is routed from the load balancer (Amazon ELB),
         which is located in a public subnet, to the ingress controller and the private subnet
         containing the private worker nodes.


Private Load Balancer, Private Worker Nodes
Requires that you specify 3 private subnets in the VPC that is registered with the
         Management Console in CDP. This mode also requires that you set up
         network routing by way of a VPN between your on-premises network and
         the VPC. Both the load balancer and worker nodes reside in private subnets so no Data
         Warehouse services have publicly visible IP addresses assigned to them.
