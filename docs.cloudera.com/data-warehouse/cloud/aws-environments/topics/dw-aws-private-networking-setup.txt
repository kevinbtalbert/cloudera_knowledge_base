Setting up private networking in AWS environments
The topics in this section describe how to enable private subnets in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) on
   AWS.
Required role: DWAdmin
In AWS, a public subnet is connected to an internet gateway which can send
     and receive traffic directly to and from the internet. Private subnets send
     outbound traffic from nodes to the internet by using a network address translation (NAT)
     gateway, and then forwards the traffic to an internet gateway. Private subnets receive no
     direct inbound connections from the internet. This provides private network connectivity for
     workload endpoints in CDW service.
