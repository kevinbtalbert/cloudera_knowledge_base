Minimum set of IAM permissions required for reduced permissions mode
Review a list of the minimum IAM permissions required to activate
   AWS environments for Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) in reduced permissions mode.
The following is a list of the minimum permissions that are required for your IAM policy to
      activate environments for CDW in reduced permissions mode. In this mode you must manually
      create your CloudFormation stack from a template that CDW pre-populates in the AWS console for
      you. When you are finished using the stack, you must manually delete its resources in your AWS
      account.

       reduced permissions mode

Description



Certificate Manager
              (acm)
DescribeCertificate
Created by Cloud Formation to check the certification status during
              activation.


ListCertificates
ACM validation adds DNS records.


CloudFormation
                (cloudformation)
DescribeStackEvents
Get Cloud Formation stack events, identify cause of failed CF stack creation failure


DescribeStacks
Check the status of stack--error or
             completed, then install helm charts


UpdateStack
Update Custom AMI, upgrade EKS


CloudWatch (logs)
CreateLogGroup
Create/name cloudwatch log group


CreateLogStream
Create log stream of log group that
              originates from monitored application
              or resource


DescribeLogStreams
List log streams for log groups


PutLogEvents
Upload log events to log stream


PutRetentionPolicy
Change number of days Cloudwatch retains


EC2 (ec2)
CreateKeyPair

Create ssh Public key pair, pass to ec2 instances. Not required if
                passed/set/reused via CloudBreak



CreateTags
Tag subnets and eks security group. Amazon EKS security group requirements and
                considerations


DeleteKeyPair
Delete keypair while deactivating CDW
              // needed if CB env ssh is not reused


DeleteTags



DescribeDhcpOptions
See points 2-3 in AWS Requirements Checklist


DescribeKeyPairs
Validate CloudBreak env ssh key pair exists, not
              deleted inbetween; check for duplicate
              keypair in case of CDW created keypair


DescribeRouteTables



DescribeSubNets
See Point 4 in AWS Requirements Checklist


DescribeVpcAttribute
Validate enableDnsHostnames and
              enableDnsSupport VPC attributes;
              see 1 and 3 points in Footnote 3 URL


DescribeVpcs
Validate ID of set of DHCP options
              associated with the VPC


EC2 Auto Scaling
                (autoscaling)
DescribeAutoScalingGroups
Get shared services/compute ASGs, update
              as part of AZRebalance


SuspendProcesses
Suspend AZRebalance for autoscaling group;
              include AZRebalance; cannot suspend 
              AZRebalance in cloudformation; edit/update
              ASGs with AWS API to avoid AWS re-balancing
              nodes for AZ (most nodes run in 
              stateful/critical pods)


UpdateAutoScalingGroup
Calico overlaynetwork option requires no EKS
              nodes up on installation; with CF stack
              creation 3 nodes start up, autoscaling group
              updates desired capacity to Zero via AWS API;
              need latest SSH key from CloudBreak for EKS
              node updates; new Launch template passes
              SSH key and updates in ASG


EKS (eks)
DescribeCluster
Calico overlaynetwork option requires no EKS
              nodes up on installation; with CF stack
              creation 3 nodes start up, autoscaling group
              updates desired capacity to Zero via AWS API;
              need latest SSH key from CloudBreak for EKS
              node updates; new Launch template passes
              SSH key and updates in ASG


DescribeUpdate
Check status of Updates--enable
              Private EKS and Cloudwatch on EKS 


TagResource
Tag eks cluster, e.g.: clusterId,
              envId, clustername, accountId...


UpdateClusterConfig
Update EKScluster config Enable
              Private EKS and Cloudwatch on EKS 


UpdateClusterVersion
Updates an Amazon EKS cluster to
              the specified Kubernetes version


IAM (iam)
DeleteRolePolicy



GetRolePolicy
Delete inline policies like efs, ebs,
              cluster-autoscaler etc created/attached
              to Node instance role at deactivation


ListAttachedRolePolicies*
List policies attached to Ranger RAZ
              role; attach to NodeInstanceRole for
              S3 access if RAZ enabled


PutRolePolicy
Add inline policies like efs, ebs,
              cluster-autoscaler to Node Instance Role


SimulatePrincipalPolicy
Simulate Cloud Formation stack formation policies


S3 (s3)
GetBucketLocation
Needed for external bucket feature
              via UI, where we validate the VPC
              and bucket region are the same


GetObject

              not be needed for reduced mode
