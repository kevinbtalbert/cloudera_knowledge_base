Setting up managed storage access
You learn the consequences of setting up RAZ control, which cannot be removed, and
        requirements you must meet to enable managed storage access.
 The RAZ-controlled warehouse supports only multiple Shared Data Experience (SDX)
            Database Catalogs instead of CDW-specific, isolated database catalogs. In a
            RAZ-controlled environment, the Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) ec2 executor will not
            have read/write permissions to the S3 bucket. Consequently, after activating the CDW
            environment, you cannot remove RAZ control. RAZ-control of CDW continues during upgrades
            of the Database Catalog and Virtual Warehouse. 


Request activation of the following entitlements:
CDW_ALLOW_MULTI_DEFAULT_DBC
CDW_STORAGE_ROLES 

You meet the requirements described in the AWS requirements documentation.

Creating the CDP environment and IAM rolesYou follows steps to register and activate a new environment to enable RAZ in         CDW.Creating a UMS group and machine usersThis procedure ensures that the CDP machine user gets permission to access the         tenant bucket.Creating a new Database CatalogYou repeat a step-by-step procedure to set up a Database Catalog for each tenant,         taking care to correctly enter your IAM Role ARN.Creating a tenant-specific Virtual WarehouseYou follow a step-by-step procedure to create a Virtual Warehouse based on the         Database Catalog and SDX Data Lake you created in the RAZ-enabled environment.Tenant IAM role policyThe JSON code for the EKS worker node policy describes the policy. The policy is         representative of one of the three policies you add to the IAM role.Parent topic: Managed storage access
