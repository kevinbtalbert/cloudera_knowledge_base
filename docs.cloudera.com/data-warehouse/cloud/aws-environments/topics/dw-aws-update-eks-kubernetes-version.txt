Upgrading Amazon Kubernetes Service (EKS)
Amazon Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster requires regular updates to the Kubernetes
    versions. Using the latest EKS version supported by Cloudera avoids compatibility
    issues between Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) and AWS resources.  
Through the environment activation from CDW process you can automatically get and use the
      latest supported EKS version in your CDW cluster. EKS 1.26 is provisioned automatically when
      you activate your environment from CDW using release
      1.7.1-b755 (released August 30, 2023) and later. 
To upgrade to EKS 1.26 or earlier, you must backup and restore CDW. Cloudera
      recommends using the backup-restore functionality. For more information, see Backing up and restoring CDW. To avoid compatibility
      issues between CDW and EKS, upgrade to version 1.26.
