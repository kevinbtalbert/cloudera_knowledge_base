Upgrading
    Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) can prevent incompatibilities issues between Cloudera
    Data Warehouse (CDW) and AWS resources. 
Upgrading PostgreSQL 9.6 before EOLYou need to plan for the end-of-life (EOL) of PostgresSQL 9.6, announced by Amazon.         As an AWS environment user, you need to check the version of PostgreSQL you use for Cloudera         Data Warehouse environments. If your database version is still PostgreSQL 9.6, you need to         upgrade to PostgreSQL 11.12. Upgrading Amazon Kubernetes Service (EKS)Amazon Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster requires regular updates to the Kubernetes     versions. Using the latest EKS version supported by Cloudera avoids compatibility     issues between Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) and AWS resources.  Upgrading to EKS 1.23 using reduced permissions Using reduced permissions mode, you must manually update the AWS CloudFormation     template and update the stack before upgrading to EKS 1.23. Upgrading EKS 1.23 to 1.24Using reduced permissions mode, you must manually delete some entries in the AWS         CloudFormation template during the EKS 1.23 to 1.24 upgrade.Upgrading using your own AMI or reduced permissions You learn the prerequisite for using your own AMI, the risks of using your own AMI,         and the steps involved in upgrading.Dynamically updating the Amazon Machine ImageYou need the capability to update the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to prevent potential         problems running workloads on an old AMI. You can update the AMI of the Cloudformation stack         while keeping the current Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) version.
