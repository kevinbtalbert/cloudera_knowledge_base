Use a non-transparent proxy with Cloudera Data Warehouse on AWS environments
You can configure CDP environments to use a network proxy in Management Console. Then
   when you activate the environment for Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), if you can only use
   non-transparent proxies with clients that must connect to the Virtual Warehouse that uses the
   environment, you can configure them.
Difference between transparent and non-transparent network proxies
Transparent proxies are unknown to clients and require no additional client configuration.
      Usually connections by way of transparent proxies are configured in route tables on your AWS
      VPC. However, clients are aware of non-transparent proxies and each client must be
      specifically configured to use the non-transparent proxy connection. There are benefits to
      using non-transparent proxies because doing so permits you to pass connection or security
      information along with the connection request sent by clients. Some organizations' security
      policies require the use of non-transparent proxies and CDW can support that requirement.
