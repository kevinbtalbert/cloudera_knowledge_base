Configure Impala Virtual Warehouses on AWS environments to spill to S3
 You can configure an Impala Virtual Warehouse on an AWS environment to write
        temporary data to S3. This capability requires an entitlement. You simply follow steps to
        specify an S3 URI when you are creating the Virtual Warehouse in Cloudera Data Warehouse
        (CDW). 

            After you have created the Virtual Warehouse configured to spill to a specific S3 location, you cannot change the S3 URI. The field becomes uneditable.
        


To use an external S3 bucket for spilled data, add an external S3 bucket to CDW with
                    the correct read/write permissions; otherwise, skip configuration and just use
                    the default S3 bucket created automatically for the environment.
Get the URI for the S3 bucket to use for spilled data. For example,
                        S3://mybucket/scratch/path.



Click Data Warehouse > Virtual Warehouses > Add New

In New Virtual Warehouse, specify a Name, its Type (Impala), its Database
                    Catalog, whether to Enable SSO, User Groups that can access endpoints, keys and
                    values for Tagging the Virtual Warehouse, and the Size.

In Spill to S3, specify the S3 URI for the spilled data location.



importantIf you specify an S3 URI for the Spill to S3 field, you cannot select
                        additional storage in Scratch Space Limit per node. The default 300 instance
                        storage is used.
