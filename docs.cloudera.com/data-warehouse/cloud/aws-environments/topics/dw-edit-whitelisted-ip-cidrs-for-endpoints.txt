Editing the IP CIDRs in the trusted list for endpoints in AWS environments
This topic describes how to change access to Hive, Impala, or Hue service endpoints
    in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Public Cloud. 

After you have added IP CIDRs to the trusted list so they have access to Kubernetes
        endpoints and the load balancer endpoints of services such as Hive, Impala, or Hue, you can
        edit the lists of IP addresses to change access to the endpoints.
Required role: DWAdmin


You must activate an environment before you can view its details or edit the
              IP CIDRs that have been added to the trusted list. See "Activating
              environments" in the "Related information" section at the bottom of this page.


In the Data Warehouse service, expand the Environments
              column by clicking the Moreâ€¦ menu on left side of the page.

In the Environments column, click the search icon and locate the
          environment where you want to edit the IP CIDRs that have been specified as part of a
          trusted list.

When you locate the environment, click the edit icon in the upper right corner of
              the tile. This launches the Environment Details page.

In the Environment Details page, edit the comma-separated list
          of IP CIDRs: IP CIDR(s) for Kubernetes cluster and IP CIDR(s) for
            the load balancer

Click Apply to save your changes.
