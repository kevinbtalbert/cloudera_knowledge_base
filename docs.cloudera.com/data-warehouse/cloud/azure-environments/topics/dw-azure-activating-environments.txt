Activating Azure environments
To use an Azure environment for Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Public Cloud you must
    first activate it. 

When you activate an environment, CDP creates an AKS cluster to host Kubernetes-based
        resources. The underlying compute, network resources are managed by Azure, including the
        following ones:
Resource group
Compute instances, which are virtual machine scale sets
Load balancer(s)
Public IP address(es)
Network security group
Disk(s)


      
      
      
      CDP supports the following Azure virtual machines and their corresponding compute instance
      types (Hive and Impala executors), which you select during environment activation:Table 1. Compute Instance Types

Three instances are added to the cluster as needed for shared services (always on
      components).  Three shared nodes are dStandard_E2s_v3 MemoryOptimized using flexserver, for
      the Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). These shared nodes are used for Hue and Data
      Visualization user metadata. For more information, see Always active, shared services. 


Obtain the DWAdmin
          role.
Review the Azure environments requirements checklist.



In the CDW service, in Environments, locate the environment that
          you want to activate.

Click Activate.

In Activate Environment, configure the environment or accept the
          defaults:







Select the Compute VM Size based on your workload. 
Select a Subnet inside the virtual network (VNet) that you
              want to use for CDW.The VNet that you select must have a sufficient number of free
                IP addresses.
Select Enable internal load balancer (ingress) to distribute
              traffic inside a virtual network.For information about load balancers, see "Azure load balancers".
Optionally, select Enable availability zones for AKS.
Specify a user-assigned, managed identity for
              the AKS cluster.
Select Enable AKS monitoring and then select the workspace
              from the adjacent drop-down list.
Add trusted endpoint IP CIDRs for your load balancer in a comma-separated list to
              the Enable IP CIDR for the load balancer text box.
Select Use kubenet networking if IP address exhaustion is a
              concern for your deployment.



Click Activate.

Now, you can create a Database Catalog to use in a Virtual Warehouse.
