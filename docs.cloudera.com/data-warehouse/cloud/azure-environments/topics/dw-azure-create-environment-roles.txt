Creating the CDP environment
You follows steps to register and activate a new environment to enable RAZ in
        CDW.

Register an environment with
                        RAZ using the CDP web interface.
In the web interface, in Fine-grained access control, select Enable Ranger
                    Authorization. 



In Cloudera Data Warehouse Overview, locate the RAZ-enabled environment, and
                    click Activate to activate the environment for CDW.
This action disables the standard default Database Catalog that is
                    automatically created after activation. The UMS machine user is created and
                    attached to the environment when you activate the CDW environment. Later, you
                    see how to add this same UMS machine user to a different UMS group for each
                    tenant.

In Activate Environmnet, select Enable Storage
                    Roles.
Unchecking Enable Storage Roles disables the metadata
                    proxy associated with managed storage access.
Repeat the following steps for each tenant:
In Azure, manually create a one or more storage locations for the tenant, or
                    use existing storage locations.
                    

In Azure, create a managed identity that has the
                    role Storage Blob Data Owner to access tenant specific container and
                    across all tenants shared, Storage Location Base in the SDX Data Lake.
For example, create a managed identity named tenant-1 and
                    a container called container-tenant-1.
