Custom tags in Azure environments
Adding tenant-level custom tags help you to search or filter resources  the key tag or
  key value in your Azure account. 
Tenant-level tags apply to Cloudera-created resources across your organization's entire cloud
   provider account. The tenant-level tags can only be applied while creating a new CDP environment.
   The CDP environment custom tags propagated to the compute instances within the Cloudera Data
   Warehouse (CDW) service. You can use these enant-level tags to identify and monitor the following
   resources within the CDW service for Azure environments:
Compute instances in Hive and Impala Virtual Warehouses
Compute instances in Druid cluster
Azure virtual machine agent pools

note If you are activating a private CDW environment, ensure you do not have more than 15 tags
   total; otherwise, use a custom DNS zone or public DNS for the AKS cluster. In Azure, the maximum
   number of tags for the private DNS zones are limited to 15.
