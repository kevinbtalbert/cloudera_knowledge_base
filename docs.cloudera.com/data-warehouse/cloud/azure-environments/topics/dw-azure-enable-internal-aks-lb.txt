Enabling internal load balancer 
To use an internal load balancer for Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), you must select
        the option to enable an internal load balancer while activating the Azure environment from
        the CDW UI. Otherwise, CDW uses the Standard public load balancer that is enabled by default
        when you provision an AKS cluster.

In the CDW service, expand the Environments column by
                    clicking the Moreâ€¦ menu on the left side of the
                    page.

In the Environments column, click the search icon and
                    locate the environment that you want to activate.

When you locate the environment, click the activation icon to launch the
                        Activation Settings dialog box:






In the Activation Settings dialog box, select
                        Enable internal load balancer (ingress).

Click Activate.
