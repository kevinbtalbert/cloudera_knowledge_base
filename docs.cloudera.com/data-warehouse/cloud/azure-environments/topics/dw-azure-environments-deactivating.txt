Required role: EnvironmentAdmin or PowerUser


In the CDW service, expand the Environments column by
                clicking the Moreâ€¦ menu at the left side of the page.

In the Environments column, click the search icon and locate
              the environment that you want to deactivate.

When you locate the environment, click the deactivation icon to launch the
              Action dialog box.

In the Action dialog box, you can select environment
              deactivation options:


Choose Drop Data to remove the managed buckets that were
              created by CDW during environment activation. The underlying data in the data lake is
              untouched. Only the default Database Catalog is retained because it resides in the
              data lake. Non-default Database Catalogs and Virtual Warehouses are deleted. importantAll metadata and the Ranger policies for non-default Database
                Catalogs are deleted.

Choose Force Delete to drop the data and to remove the
                  Database Catalogs and Virtual Warehouses that are associated with the environment.



Click OK to deactivate the environment.
