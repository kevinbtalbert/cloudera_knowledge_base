Using AKS monitoring with Cloudera Data Warehouse in Azure environments
Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) provides an option to enable and leverage AKS
    monitoring in Azure environments. When you enable AKS monitoring from the CDW UI and select a
    Log Analytics workspace, CDW sends the log data to Azure Monitor Logs.

      You can use the Log Analytics tool to edit and run log
      queries, and create dashboards and alerts from the log queries.
    Required role: EnvironmentAdmin or PowerUser

Before you enable AKS monitoring on CDW Public Cloud, you must configure a log
        analytics workspace in your Azure account. See the link to Microsoft Azure documentation for
        this task at the bottom of this page.


In the CDW UI, expand the Environments column by
                clicking the Moreâ€¦ menu on the left side of the page.

In the Environments column, click the search icon and locate the
          environment for which you want to configure the AKS monitoring workspace.

Click the activation icon to launch the Activation Settings
          dialog box where you can configure the environment to use an AKS monitoring
          workspace:






In the Activation Settings dialog box, select Enable
            AKS monitoring. 

Click the drop-down list to select a workspace.
