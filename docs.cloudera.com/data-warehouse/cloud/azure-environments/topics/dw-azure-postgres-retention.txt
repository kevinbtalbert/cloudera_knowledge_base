Retaining PostgreSQL backups in Azure Environments
When you create a Cloudera Data Warehouse cluster using the CDP CLI create-cluster
        command, any PostgreSQL backup retention period you set on your Cloud Provider side, is
        observed by CDP.  

In Azure, configure backupRetentionDays.

Create a DW cluster using the CDP CLI create-cluster command.
The DW cluster will
                    retain the PostgreSQL backups according to your configuration.
