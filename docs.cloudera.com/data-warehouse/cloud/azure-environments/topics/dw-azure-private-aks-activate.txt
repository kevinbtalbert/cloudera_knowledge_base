Activating a private AKS in CDW
 You see how to activate a CDP environment in CDW, learn how to configure the
        environmental options.

      Activating an environment with the CDW service sets up the Kubernetes cluster, which provides the compute resources for the Database Catalog. In addition, activating an environment enables the CDW service to use the existing Data Lake that was set up for the environment, including all data, metadata, and security policies.
