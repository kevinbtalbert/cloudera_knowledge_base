Creating and registering the Azure environment
 In CDP, you perform a step-by-step procedure to create the environment, and select
        options for the database, virtual machines, and CCM during registration.



Create a CDP Azure environment in the
                      VNET that you created earlier.

Select private environment options for the PostgreSQL database, virtual machines, and CCM (v2) while registering the Azure environment in CDP.
On the environment registration screen, the Enable Cluster Connectivity Manager option is enabled by default. It ensures that all traffic from Cloudera Control Plane to your cloud resources travels through a secured HTTPS tunnel. 
              CDW Private AKS only works with CCM (v2).
          
Do not create public IPs so that Azure VMs have private IP addresses only.
              

Enable the Create Private Endpoints option.
By default, the PostgreSQL Azure database provisioned for your Data Lake is
                    reachable through a service endpoint (public IP address). To increase security,
                    you must select to have it reachable through a private endpoint instead of a
                    service endpoint. You can create a new private DNS zone for the database or you
                    can use your own. CDW will also use the zone specified here.
