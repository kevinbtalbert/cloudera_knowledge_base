Setting scratch space limit for spilling Impala queries in Azure environments
Certain memory-intensive SQL operations write temporary data to disk (known as
        spilling to disk) when Impala is close to exceeding its memory limit on a particular host.
        Consequently, a query can complete successfully instead of failing with an out-of-memory
        error. You must set the scratch space limit carefully because you cannot change the limit later.

The compute nodes on Azure environments use the STANDARD_E16DS_v4 or
                STANDARD_E16DS_V5 memory-optimized Virtual Machines by default. These nodes have a
                temporary SSD storage of 2 * 300 GiB (600 GiB). This space is utilized for both
                cached data and scratch space. The scratch space available is insufficient for the
                spilling Impala queries.
Spilling queries to disk require a scratch space in multiples of several 100 GiBs or
                TiBs, without which the queries may fail. To prevent failure, you can configure the
                scratch space between 300 GiB and 16 TiB per executor node while creating an Impala
                Virtual Warehouse. In addition to the local SSD, you can use managed disks (Standard
                SSD and Premium disks) for extra space.
In CDW, the range of options for scratch space using the combination of the local
                SSDs and managed disks has been tailored to optimize the cost-to-space ratio. The
                following table shows the pricing and throughput information for the available
                scratch space options:Table 1.

You can select the scratch space limit only while creating a new Impala Virtual
                Warehouse. 



Obtain the CDW_IMPALA_EBS_SCRATCH_SPACE entitlement.
Activate the environment in CDW using the E16ds_v4 or
                        E16ds_v5. 
Disable Availability Zones for AKS during the environment activation; otherwise,
                    you cannot set the scratch space limit.



Log in to Cloudera Data Warehouse.

In the Data Warehouse service, click Virtual Warehouses
                    in the left navigation panel.

On the Virtual Warehouses page, click Add
                        New.

Specify a Name.

Select Virtual Warehouse type as IMPALA.

Select the Database Catalog that it queries.

Select a Size.
Additional configuration options are displayed along with Scratch
                        Space Limit per node (in GiBs).




Select the scratch space from the Scratch Space Limit per node (in
                        GiBs) dropdown.




Click CREATE.
