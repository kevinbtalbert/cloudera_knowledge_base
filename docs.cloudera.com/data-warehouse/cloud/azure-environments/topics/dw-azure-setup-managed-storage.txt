Setting up managed storage access
You learn the consequences of setting up RAZ control, which cannot be removed, and
        requirements you must meet to enable managed storage access.
 The RAZ-controlled warehouse supports only multiple Shared Data Experience (SDX)
            Database Catalogs instead of CDW-specific, isolated database catalogs. In a
            RAZ-controlled environment, the Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) ec2 executor will not
            have read/write permissions to the storage location. Consequently, after activating the
            CDW environment, you cannot remove RAZ control. RAZ-control of CDW continues during
            upgrades of the Database Catalog and Virtual Warehouse. 


Request activation of the following entitlements:

You must correctly enter your managed identity regular expression. You see how to recognize         a discrepancy in your entry and your actual managed identity.Creating a tenant-specific Virtual WarehouseYou follow a step-by-step procedure to create a Virtual Warehouse based on the         Database Catalog and SDX Data Lake you created in the RAZ-enabled environment.Parent topic: Managed storage access
