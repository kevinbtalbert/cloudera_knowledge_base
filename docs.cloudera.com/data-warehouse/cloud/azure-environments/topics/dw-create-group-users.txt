Creating a UMS group and machine users
This procedure ensures that the CDP machine user gets permission to access the
        tenant bucket.
Repeat the following steps for each tenant:
In Management Console, User Management > Groups, click CREATE GROUP and create a User Management Service (UMS)
                    group, for example group-tenant-1.






In Groups > Members, search for and select your srv_machine_<env
                    id>_storage_role to  add this UMS machine user to
                    group-tenant-1.






 In Management Console > Environments, select an environment, and click Actions > Manage Access > IDBroker Mappings > Edit.

Click + to add a mapping, select the Group-tenant-1 and
                        Role-tenant-1, and specify the complete managed
                    identity. For example:
                        /subscriptions/<subsciption_id>/resourcegroups/<resource_group>providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<managed-identity-name>

Synchronize your group changes with FreeIPA by performing a user sync per
                    environment: In the RAZ-enabled environment, click Actions > Synchronize Users to FreeIPA.
The UMS machine user gets the permission to access the tenant-specific
                    container.
