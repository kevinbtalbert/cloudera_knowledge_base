Creating a tenant-specific Virtual Warehouse
You follow a step-by-step procedure to create a Virtual Warehouse based on the
        Database Catalog and SDX Data Lake you created in the RAZ-enabled environment.
 The Database Catalog and Data Lake point to the same backend database. In the
            tenant-specific Virtual Warehouse, you create a tenant-specific Hive or Impala database
            that points to tenant-specific buckets. As the metadata is shared across all tenants,
            Ranger grants access to tenant data at the table level. One or more tenant-specific
            databases alongside databases for shared data can run in the same HMS
            instance.
Repeat the following steps for each tenant.
In the Data Warehouse service, click Virtual Warehouses > Add New.
                

Specify a name, select either the Hive or Impala type, and select the
                    Database Catalog you created for the tenant. 

In Overview, find your Virtual Warehouse, click options 
                    , and open Hue.

Create a tenant-specific Hive or Impala database where the location for
                    external and managed tables are pointing to the tenant-specific buckets. 

CREATE (DATABASE|SCHEMA) [IF NOT EXISTS] database_name
[COMMENT database_comment]
[LOCATION external_table_path]
[MANAGEDLOCATION managed_table_directory_path]
[WITH DBPROPERTIES (property_name=property_value, ...)];                   

Do not set LOCATION and MANAGEDLOCATION to the same path.
                    For more information, see Create a default directory for managed tables.

In Ranger, grant the tenant users access to the tenant-specific Hive or
                    Impala database.
