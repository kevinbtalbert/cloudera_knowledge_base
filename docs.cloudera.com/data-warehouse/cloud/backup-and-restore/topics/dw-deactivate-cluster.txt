Deactivating the environment
Assuming you have already deleted your Virtual Warehouses, you need to delete your
        non-default (custom) Database Catalog and Virtual Warehouses, and then deactivate the
        environment.
You cannot delete default Database Catalogs created during environment activation.
            Default catalogs are deleted when the environment is deactivated.

Log in to the CDP web interface, navigate to Data Warehouse > Database Catalogs, and locate your Database Catalog.

Click Actions, and select Delete.

Search and locate the environment that you want to deactivate.

Click Deactivate .

Click OK to deactivate the environment.
