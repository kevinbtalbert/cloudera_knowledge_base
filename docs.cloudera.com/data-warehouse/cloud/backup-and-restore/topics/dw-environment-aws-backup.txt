Backing up AWS environment activation parameters
You back up AWS environment activation parameters using the CDW UI , AWS CLI, and
        kubectl.
AWS environment activation settings that need
            to be available in the new environment may include IP-CIDRs for the Kubernetes cluster
            and load balancer, the deployment mode setting, reduced permissions mode, and overlay
            networks. It is required that you gather and document these settings to have the
            environment behave the same after the back-up/restore process as before. The activation
            parameter values are available in the CDW UI. Additionally, some parameters may be
            fetched using AWS CLI and kubectl.The following steps gather and document the
                environment parameters.
Deployment Mode (Network selection)
Get subnet information in one of the following ways:

Use the CDW UINavigate to Environment Details > General Details, and note the settings for Public Subnets or Private Subnets.
Use the AWS
                        CLIaws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name env-q4tzxd-dwx-stack --output json --query "Stacks[].{StackName:StackName, PublicSubnetIds:Outputs[?OutputKey=='PublicSubnetIds'].OutputValue, PrivateSubnetIds:Outputs[?OutputKey=='PrivateSubnetIds'].OutputValue}"

IP-CIDR for kubernetes cluster and load balancer
In the CDW UI, navigate to Environment Details > Configurations, and note the settings of Enable IP-CIDR for Kubernetes cluster and Enable IP-CIDR for the load balancer.
Overprovision nodes
Document the value of Overprovision nodes.

Stored behind the CDW_CLUSTER_OVERPROVISIONER entitlement.
Use Custom ECR repository
Document the value of Use Custom ECR repository.
Stored behind the CDP_CUSTOM_REPO entitlement.
Use Overlay Network
Using kubectl, get the value of Use Overlay Network.

kubectl get daemonsets -n kube-system


noteIf the daemonSet aws-node is not present, the overlay network is
                        enabled.

Attach Managed policy ARN to Node Role
Using the AWS CLI, fetch the nodeInstanceRole.
export nodeInstanceRole=$(aws iam list-roles --query "Roles[].{RoleName:RoleName}" | grep "env-q4tzxd-dwx-stack-NodeInstanceRole-*" | tr -d '"'| cut -f 2 -d ':'| awk '{$1=$1};1')

List the policies attached to this nodeInstanceRole.
aws iam list-role-policies --role-name $nodeInstanceRole

Check for customized policies, which are not included in the following policies: 
"PolicyNames": [
  "cluster-autoscaler",
  "dynamodb",
  "ebs",
  "efs",
  "kms",
  "limits-monitoring",
  "s3-list-all-buckets",
  "s3-read-only-buckets",
  "s3-read-write-own-buckets"
]
AMI ID
Using one of the following ways, get the value of the AMI ID only if you need
                    to use a custom AMI:

Use the CDW UI:Navigate to Environment Details > Configurations, and note the setting of AMI
                            ID.
Use AWS CLI:
                        aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name env-q4tzxd-dwx-stack --output json --query "Stacks[].{StackName:StackName, AMI:Parameters[?ParameterKey=='EksAmi'].ParameterValue}"

Reduced Permissions Mode
Using the CDW UI, determine whether or not your current policy has standard
                    activation permission.
If the current policy does not have the standard activation permission, when
                    you reactivate the environment you see a
                    prompt to use the Reduced Permissions Mode. In Reduced
                        Permissions Mode, you deploy the cluster manually. A Cloudformation template
                        is generated and the you must deploy the cluster and apply some role-based
                        access control roles to the Kubernetes cluster.

Enable CloudWatch logs
Using the CDW UI, navigate to Environment Details > Configurations > Enable CloudWatch Logs to get the value of Enable CloudWatch logs..
CloudWatch logs provide better visibility into cluster operations in addition to the diagnostic bundles within CDW. Enabling this option will not impact the restore procedure, even if it was not previously configured in the old environment.
Additional External Buckets
Using the CDW UI, gather values of the Additional External Buckets parameter. Navigate to Environment Details > Configurations > Bucket Name.
