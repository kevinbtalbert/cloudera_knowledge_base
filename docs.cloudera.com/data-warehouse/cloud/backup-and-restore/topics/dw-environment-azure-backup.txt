Backing up Azure activation parameters
You configure almost all (99%) of Azure cloud resources using environment activation
        parameters. These parameters are available by querying Azure resource providers in the old
        environment. You use these parameters, which you manually document, during the activation of
        the new environment. 
The Azure environment activation settings you want
            to carry over to the new environment include the compute VM size (E16ds_v4 or E16_v3),
            any user-assigned, managed identity, subnets, private CDW and IP CIDRS, kubenet
            networking, and minimum permissions.

Obtain a managed identity for Azure activations.
The new, required managed identity parameter provides privileges to deploy the
                    AKS cluster. For more information about required minimal privileges, see "Setting up minimum
                        permissions".

Query the environment to get the Azure environment activation settings you want
                    to carry over to the new environment.
Query the environment to get the activation parameters.
                        az aks show -n <AKS_CLUSTER_NAME> -g <CDW_RESOURCE_GROUP> --query '{Agentpools:agentPoolProfiles[].{Name:name, Version:orchestratorVersion, State:provisioningState, AZ: availabilityZones, SKU:vmSize, VnetSubnet:vnetSubnetId, PodSubnet: podSubnetId, CDW_Timestamp:tags.timestamp, PowerState: powerState}, Api: apiServerAccessProfile, NetworkType:networkProfile.networkPlugin, DockerCIDR: networkProfile.dockerBridgeCidr, outboundType:networkProfile.outboundType,privateFQDN:privaFqdn, Identity:identity, FQDN: fqdn, AKSVersion:kubernetesVersion, Location:location, SKU: sku, OMS: addonProfiles.omsagent}' -o jsonc
                        The query output maps to the following activation parameters:
Compute VM Size: Agentpoolc.SKU
Subnet: Agentpoolc.VnetSubnet
Private CDW: api.enablePrivateCluster
Managed identity: Identity
Availability Zones: agentpoolss.AZ
AKS Monitoring: oms
K8s CIDR: api.authorizedIpRanges
Kubenet: NetworkType
Docker CIDR: dockerCidr
AKS DNS Zone: api.privateDnsZone
OutboundType: outboundType


Get the internal load balancer settings in one of the following ways.

Use a query.
                        az resource list -g  MC_<AKS_CLUSTER_NAME>_<REGION> --query "[?type == 'Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers'].{Name: name, Type: type}" -o jsoncIf
                        the output lists an internal load balancer, the environment has been
                        activated with the Enable internal load balancers
                        option. 
Use the CDW UI described in the following steps.

Using the CDW UI to get internal load balancer
                settings
Using the CDW UI, in the Data Warehouse service, expand
                        Environments by clicking the
                        Moreâ€¦.

In Environments, click the search icon and locate the
                    environment that you want to view.

Click Edit > Configurations

Note the IP range for the load balancer.
