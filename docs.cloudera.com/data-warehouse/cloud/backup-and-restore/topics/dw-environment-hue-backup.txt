Backing up HueCloudera Docs
Backing up Hue
Backing up Hue is an automated process that saves the Hue database content. The
        process places the content in configured logs or data folders based on availability. If, for any reason, you want to
        manually back up the database, you can choose to do so. 
Automatic backup
Automatic backup and restoration for Hue extracts the saved query and query history
                and loads the information onto the new cluster.

Monitoring backup execution
The backup starts a job to create the database dump file, but it does not wait for
            the job to complete. If you have a large database, the job can take up to 20 minutes to
            complete. Ensure you allow enough time for the job to succeed. To monitor execution, you
            can log into the cluster and monitor the job status under the database catalog namespace
            using the following command:kubectl get jobs -n <database catalog id>
The output that shows the status of the Hue backup job looks something like
            this:$ kubectl get jobs -n warehouse-1692037411-96hk
NAME                                              COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
hue-backup-ede2b8bd-1d53-4d23-a0f9-87d8ec658f74   1/1           11s        113s
hue-query-processor-db-create-job                 1/1           8s         42h
The job logs contain the upload path where the file have been placed.

Optional manual backup
If anything goes wrong with the automatic backup of Hue, or if you just prefer a
                manual process, you can back up Hue manually. You can choose to manually save and
                restore the Hue data to keep the Hue saved queries and query history for your
                Virtual Warehouses on the new cluster.

One Hue database is shared between all Virtual Warehouses, so you execute the following steps only once.

Find Hue pods and namespaces.
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --field-selector metadata.name=huebackend-0

Use SSH to access the Hue pod on the virtual warehouse cluster.
$ kubectl exec -it huebackend-0 -n <virtual warehouse ID> -c hue – /bin/bashFor
                    example:$ kubectl exec -it huebackend-0 -n compute-1668714083-8ms4 -c hue – /bin/bash

Back up Hue data to the /tmp directory on the Hue pod. In the container, your current directory should be /opt/hive.
$ ./build/env/bin/hue dumpdata -o /tmp/data.json

Copy the backup from the Hue pod to the local machine.
$ kubectl cp <virtual warehouse ID>/huebackend-0:/tmp/data.json -c hue /tmp/data.json
