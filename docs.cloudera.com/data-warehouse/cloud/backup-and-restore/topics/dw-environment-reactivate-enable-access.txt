Enabling end user access
If you disabled end user access before recreating your Virtual Warehouse, you must
        enable access afterward. 
 Perform this task only if you disabled end user access.

In the Data Warehouse service, click Overview and expand
                    the Environments column.

Click  and locate an environment having a Database Catalog
                    you activated for CDW.

Click the environment options  and select
                        Edit.

Click Configurations and set the value of
                        Enable-IP_CIDR load balancer to the setting you noted
                    when disabling end user access.

Apply changes.
