Reactivating the environment
You learn how to reactive the AWS or Azure environment.
 Follow this procedure to reactivate the AWS environment or reactivate the Azure environment, and then
      ensure the reactivated environment is configured the same as the deactivated one. You must add
      the activated parameters that were backed-up and documented in the previous steps to the new
      reactivated environment. 

Using the CDP CLI
You parameterize the CLI
        create-cluster command to activate the cluster, as described in the CLI documentation. 

Activate the cluster by passing the options you retrieved backing up AWS or activating
              Azure.To see all options run the following command.
              cdp dw create-cluster –helpExamples for shorthand and JSON
              syntax are available. For example, an Azure CLI activation option looks
              something like this:
              cdp dw create-cluster --environment-crn <crn:cdp:environments:us-west-1:abc:environment:123> \
--use-overlay-network --no-use-private-load-balancer \
--azure-options \
userAssignedManagedIdentity="<full managed identity identifier>",subnetId="<full subnet identifier>",enableSpotInstances=false,logAnalyticsWorkspaceId="<full log analytics workspace identifier>" \
--profile <customer profile> An AWS CLI activation option looks
            something like
            this:cdp dw create-cluster --environment-crn <crn:cdp:environments:us-west-1:abc:environment:123> \
--use-overlay-network --use-private-load-balancer \
--aws-options \
lbSubnetIds=<list of subnet identifiers>,workerSubnetIds=<list of subnet identifiers>,enableSpotInstances=false --profile <customer profile>
(Optional) If you need to preserve the old environment URL, specify the custom
            subdomain in the dw create-cluster
            command.--custom-subdomain (string)For
            example:
            --custom-subdomain env-qwertyu.dw

        information about the CLI, see CDP CLI documentation.  
Using the CDW UI


In the CDW service, expand the Environments column by clicking
            More….

In Environments, search for and locate the environment that you
            want to activate.

Click the start icon 
            to activate the environment.
The default SDX Database Catalog (represented by the tile on the right) is
            created.When the CDW cluster is restored, the IDs of the environment
          (represented by the tile on the left) and Database Catalog change.

In the Activation Settings, configure the environment using the
          information you gathered when you backed up activation parameters.

(Optional) If you need to preserve the old environment URL, specify the custom
          subdomain. 
In Custom Environment Subdomain,
          if the environment is env-qwertyu.dw, for example, specify the custom subdomain in the
          following
          format:<old environment identifier>.dw
