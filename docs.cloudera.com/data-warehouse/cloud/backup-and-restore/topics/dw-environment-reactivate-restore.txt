Restoring the environment
To restore the environment, you reactivate the environment, modify configurations,
  recreate Virtual Warehouses, and restore Hue and Data Visualization.
Reactivating the environmentYou learn how to reactive the AWS or Azure environment.Modifying configurations after activationFrom the CDW UI, you configure alert and observability settings you had in the old environment.Disabling end user accessIf your business cannot tolerate downtime, you can prevent end user access to your clusters by disabling end user access.          Disabling end user access is recommended only when bringing down your clusters is not feasible.Recreating the Virtual WarehousesYou recreate the Virtual Warehouses in a few steps.Restoring HueThe backup procedure automatically saved the Hue database content and placed the         content into the configured logs or data folders based on availability. Using the saved         content, the restore process loads the data for the new Hue deployments.Restoring Data VisualizationYou can restore the Data Visualization instance that you backed up. Enabling end user accessIf you disabled end user access before recreating your Virtual Warehouse, you must         enable access afterward. Parent topic: Backing up and restoring CDW
