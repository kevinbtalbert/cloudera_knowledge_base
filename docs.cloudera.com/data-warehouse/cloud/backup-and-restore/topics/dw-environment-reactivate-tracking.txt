Monitoring environment restoration
Restoring the CDW environment is an unvaried process; no configuration update or settings change are applied to existing Virtual Warehouses or Data Visualization applications by the process. 
 After restoration, a Virtual Warehouse has exactly the same settings as the
            original Virtual Warehouse according to the following principles. 
Configurations are not copied as is; rather a new configuration is
                    created. All the changes made to the Virtual Warehouse configuration throughout
                    its lifecycle are applied on top of the new configuration.
Values that were undefined or not present in earlier versions are set to the
                    default.
Configurations are mapped 1-to-1 during restoration.
Track the progress of the cluster restoration using the operationID from the
            cluster-restore response.Due to the unvaried nature of the restore process, if any
                Virtual Warehouse is missing because you deleted it accidentally, or it failed to
                come up, you can choose to try again.

Check that there are no errors after running the cluster-restore command.
Example: A cluster-restore command response free of errors looks like
                    this:{
   "clusterId": "env-npk886",
   "operationId": "acbe40f4-560b-485c-833c-451a64bb76c4",
   # truncated output
}

Navigate to the CDP Management Console > Audit.




In Audit Events, in Request ID, enter the value of the operationId from step 1.
                
For example:



Click Expand  to see information about progress of, or possibly about errors in, the request to restore the cluster. 




Alternatively, to see information about progress of, or possibly about errors,
                    in the request to restore the cluster use the CDP CLI.
Using list-events in the audit command section can return the restore
                    operation events. Passing the operationId to the requestId filter parameter
                    returns the output shown below.
For example:cdp \
  --profile ${CDP_PROFILE} \
  audit list-events \
    --from-timestamp $(TZ=UTC date -v -1d '+%FT%T') \
    --to-timestamp $(TZ=UTC date -v -0M '+%FT%T') \
    --request-id acbe40f4-560b-485c-833c-451a64bb76c4
