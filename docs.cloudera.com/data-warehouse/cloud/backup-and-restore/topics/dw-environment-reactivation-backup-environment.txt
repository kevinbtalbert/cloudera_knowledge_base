Backing up the environment
Backing up the environment consists of capturing environment activation parameters,
  observability configurations, Virtual Warehouse parameters, the Hue data, and Data Visualization
  applications.


Backing up AWS environment activation parametersYou back up AWS environment activation parameters using the CDW UI , AWS CLI, and         kubectl.Backing up Azure activation parametersYou configure almost all (99%) of Azure cloud resources using environment activation         parameters. These parameters are available by querying Azure resource providers in the old         environment. You use these parameters, which you manually document, during the activation of         the new environment. Backing up observability configurationsEnvironment configurations are used to monitor and observe an          environment. Backing up Virtual Warehouse parametersYou use the CDP CLI version 0.9.88 or later. Backing up HueBacking up Hue is an automated process that saves the Hue database content. The         process places the content in configured logs or data folders based on availability. If, for any reason, you want to         manually back up the database, you can choose to do so. Backing up Data Visualization applicationsYou can use kubectl or k9s to back up Data Visualization (DataViz) applications in an         AWS environment.Parent topic: Backing up and restoring CDW
