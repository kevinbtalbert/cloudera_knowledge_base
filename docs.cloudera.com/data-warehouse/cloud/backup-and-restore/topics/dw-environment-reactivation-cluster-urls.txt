Cluster URLs after reactivation
It is important to understand the difference between cluster URLs before and after
  activation.
Current URL format
New CDW environments deploy a URL in a new format that will be preserved even after
    environment reactivation. The new format is:
<vw name>.<dw environment name>.<tenant id>.cloudera.site New format example:
    Hue-cli-update-vw-config-hive.dw-dwx-qr2j9b.xcu2-8y8x.cloudera.site
The new URL consists of the following components:
Virtual Warehouse name
CDW environment name
Static tenant identifier 

If this format is already in use, the current URLs will be preserved for both Hue and JDBC.
   

Old URL format
Old CDW environments use a different format. Old format example:
Hue-cli-update-vw-config-hive.env-qwertyu.dw.xcu2-8y8x.cloudera.site
The old URL consists of the following components:
Virtual Warehouse name
A random generated environment identifier
A .dw separator
Tenant ID


URL actions and recommendations
If a new environment is being activated, the old format will change to the new
    format. It is highly recommended to move to the new format to simplify the environment backup
    and restore in the future. 
This recommendation is because the old format has a dynamic environment id that
    changes upon reactivation which changes the URL endpoints. Whereas, the new format has a static
    environment ID that does not change upon reactivation and maintains the URL endpoints.
    Additionally, Cloudera may deprecate the old format in a future release.
Should there be a need to preserve the old URL format in old CDW environments, a
    workaround is available and documented as an <OPTIONAL> step in the "Reactivating the environment" section below. To be able
    to preserve the old URL format, contact support to enable the CDW_CUSTOM_CLUSTER_ID entitlement.
