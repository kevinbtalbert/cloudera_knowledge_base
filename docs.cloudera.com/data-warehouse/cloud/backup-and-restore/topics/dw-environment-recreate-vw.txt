Recreating the Virtual Warehouses
You recreate the Virtual Warehouses in a few steps.
To recreate the Virtual Warehouses, you use the dw restore-cluster command. This
            command also restores Data Visualization apps, but additional steps are required as
            described in section “Restoring Data Visualization”.

Create a CLI skeleton file to serve the base file for the restore command.
For example, replace <your new cluster id> placeholder with the ID of the
                    newly activated cluster (for example env-npk886 shown step 4 of Reactivating the
                    environment).export NEW_CLUSTER_ID="<your new cluster id>"
cdp \
  --profile ${CDP_PROFILE} \
  dw restore-cluster \
   --generate-cli-skeleton \ file://restore_${NEW_CLUSTER_ID}_cli_input.json

Open restore_<new-cluster-id>_cli_input.json for editing, and fill in the
                        clusterId and the data fields.
For example:{
   "clusterId": "env-npk886",
   "data": "UEsDBBQ…AAAAAAAAAAABkYXRhUEsFBgAAAAABAAEAMgAAAKuBAQAAAA==",
}

Use the dw restore-cluster command with the CLI input JSON
                    file created in the previous step.

cdp \
  --profile ${CDP_PROFILE} \
  dw restore-cluster \
   --cli-input-json file://restore_${NEW_CLUSTER_ID}_cli_input.json

Example output: {
    "clusterId": "env-npk886",
    "operationId": "e279bc25-6eb2-45d5-b2a5-ebdaf8d9c809",
    "dbcRestorePlans": [],
    "hiveRestorePlans": [
        {
            "ref": "org-master-prd-hive",
            "action": "Create",
            "message": "the org-master-prd-hive Hive Virtual Warehouse will be crated and attached to the warehouse-1676473680-986m DB Catalog"
        }
    ],
    "impalaRestorePlans": [
        {
            "ref": "impala-master-prd-impala",
            "action": "Create",
            "message": "the impala-master-prd-impala Impala Virtual Warehouse will be crated and attached to the warehouse-1676473680-986m DB Catalog"
        }
    ],
    "vizRestorePlans": [
        {
            "ref": "viz-analyst",
            "action": "Create",
            "message": "the viz-analyst Data Visualization will be created"
        },
        {
            "ref": "viz-scientist",
            "id": "viz-1678182673-jzxs",
            "action": "Skip",
            "message": "the Data Visualization viz-scientist exist with id viz-1678182673-jzxs, no change will be applied"
        }
    ]
}
              After several minutes the Virtual Warehouses will be
                    created in the given cluster and attached to the Database Catalog. The Virtual
                    Warehouse and Data Visualization ids have changed.

You must use the new Virtual Warehouse and Data Visualization ids to restore the HUE or DataViz databases as described in the next section.
