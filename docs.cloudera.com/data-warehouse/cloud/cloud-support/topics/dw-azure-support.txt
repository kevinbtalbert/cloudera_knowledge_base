This topic provides an overview of Azure support in Cloudera Data
    Warehouse (CDW) Public Cloud.
importantEnsure your Azure environment satisfies the items listed in the Azure environments requirements checklist.
Like Amazon Web Services support, Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) environments
     are closely related to the virtual private network concept in your Azure
     account as well. Also registering an environment provides CDP access to
     resources in your Azure account and a single CDP environment is contained
     within a single region in Azure. All resources that are deployed by CDP are
     deployed within that region and within one specific virtual network. After
     you have registered an environment in CDP, you can start provisioning CDP
     resources such as clusters, which run on the physical infrastructure in an
     Azure data center.
The following diagram shows the components of a CDP environment on Azure:



The diagram illustrates all major user-created and CDP-created components of an environment:

The items in dark blue boxes with orange outlines can either be
       automatically provisioned by CDP on your Azure account, or you can optionally pre-create
       them and specify them when registering an environment.
The items in dark blue boxes must be pre-created by your CDP
       administrator prior to environment registration and then specified when registering an
       environment.
The items in orange boxes are automatically provisioned on Azure
       by CDP as part of environment provisioning.

noteThe items that are user-created are not terminated during environment
     deletion.
Information that describes how to register an Azure environment with CDP is linked to at the
     end of this page.
