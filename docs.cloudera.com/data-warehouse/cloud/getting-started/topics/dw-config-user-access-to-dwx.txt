Prerequisites
To get started in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), your
      data must conform to supported compression codecs, and you must obtain CDP resource roles to
      grant users access to a public cloud environment.
     Users can then get started on CDW tasks, such as
    activating the environment from CDW. 
Unsupported compression
CDW does not support LZO compression due to licensing of the LZO library. You cannot query
        tables having LZO compression in Virtual Warehouses, which use CDW Impala or Hive LLAP
        engines.

CDP resource roles
Required role: PowerUser
The following CDP resource roles are associated with
        the CDW service. A CDP PowerUser must assign these roles to users who require access to the
        Database Catalogs and Virtual Warehouses that are associated with specific environments. After granting these roles to users and groups, they then have
          Single Sign-On (SSO) access to the Data Catalogs and Virtual Warehouses that are
          associated with the environment.

DWAdmin: This role enables users or groups to grant a
            CDP user or group the ability to activate, terminate, launch, stop, or update services
            in Database Catalogs and Virtual Warehouses.
DWUser: This role enables users or groups to view and
            use CDW clusters (Virtual Warehouses) that are associated with specific
            environments.
