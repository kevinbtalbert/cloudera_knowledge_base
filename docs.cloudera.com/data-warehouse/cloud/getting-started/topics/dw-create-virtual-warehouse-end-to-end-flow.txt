Creating your first Virtual Warehouse
After meeting prerequisites, you learn how to activate the environment from Cloudera
    Data Warehouse (CDW). You then follow a procedure to add a new Database Catalog and create a
    Virtual Warehouse.

Before you can create a Virtual Warehouse in CDW service, you must have completed the
            following tasks:

Register an environment with Management Console. This sets up your Data Lake.
          Depending on which cloud platform you are using, see Register an AWS environment or Register an Azure environment.
Grant the DWAdmin role to the user or group that needs to create a Virtual
          Warehouse. This user or group determines which environment and Data Lake your Virtual
          Warehouse uses. See Granting CDP users access to Cloudera Data Warehouse
            service.



Activate the environment that uses the Data Lake. See Activating AWS environments or Activating Azure environments.

Create a Database Catalog. See the previous topic Creating a Database Catalog.

Add a new Virtual Warehouse. See Adding a new Virtual Warehouse.

You can start executing workloads in the new Virtual Warehouse.
