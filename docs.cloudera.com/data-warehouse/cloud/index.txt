Data Warehouse is a CDP Public Cloud data service for creating
independent, self-service data warehouses and data marts that autoscale
up and down to meet your varying workload demands. The Data Warehouse
service provides isolated compute instances for each data
warehouse/mart, automatic optimization, and enables you to save costs
while meeting SLAs.
Data Warehouse has a dedicated runtime
for clients connecting to your Virtual Warehouse in CDP Public Cloud.
Documentation describes techniques for using Apache Hive and Apache
Impala SQL as well as the Hue interactive SQL editor, which you can use
to test queries and sample data.
