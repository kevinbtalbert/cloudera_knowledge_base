Checking an alert notification configuration
You learn how to ensure your alert notification configuration is in effect. You fetch
        the configuration directly from the alertmanager and check that it is reachable. 

Port-forward the prometheus service.
$ kubectl \
    -n istio-system \
    port-forward \
    service/prometheus \
    9093:9093

From another terminal the configuration is reachable by using the following curl command.
$ curl http://localhost:9093/api/v2/status

Check that the output shows your configuration.
Alternatively, to check the output, you can use the alertmanager WebUI by
                    navigating to http://localhost:9093/#/status.
