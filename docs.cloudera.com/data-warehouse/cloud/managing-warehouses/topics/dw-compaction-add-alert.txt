Adding a compaction alert
You can define compaction alert rules for your Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW)
        deployment based on Prometheus expressions. The alerts are automatically triggered when
        specific events occur in your deployment.
You use PromQL expressions to express the
            conditions that trigger the alert, as shown in the following procedure.

In the Data Warehouse service, click Overview and expand
                    the Environments column.

Click  and locate an environment having a Database Catalog
                    you activated for CDW.

Click the environment options  and select
                        Edit.

In the Environment Details page, click the
                        ALERT SETTINGS tab and then click Add
                        New.






Enter the following information for the new alert:


ID and Name of the alert
An error or warning message to display when the alert is triggered
The Prometheus expression to specify conditions that trigger the
                            alert
Duration to specify how long the conditions last before the alert is
                            triggered
Severity of the alert â€” Error or Warning



Click Create.
