Automating metadata invalidation after compaction
 As you insert or delete data from Hive ACID tables, Hive generates delta files. The compaction process consolidates the delta files and keeps the system healthy. If you query Hive ACID tables from an Impala Virtual Warehouse, you need to learn how to automatically invalidate metadata after compaction to prevent a possible query failure.
 After compaction of ACID tables, metadata in Impala coordinator local caches might
            be stale. You might experience a failure (FileNotFoundException) when you query these
            tables. Invalidation refreshes the metadata and prevents the problem. You can configure
            automatic metadata invalidation as described in the following procedure.

            You must upgrade your Database Catalog to the compatible version for DWX-1.1.2-b2008 or later to use this feature.
