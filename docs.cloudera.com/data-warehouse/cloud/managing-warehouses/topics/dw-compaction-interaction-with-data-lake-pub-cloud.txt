How compaction interacts with the Data Lake
In the Data Lake on CDP, the initiator and cleaner processes also run in the metastore
    as they do in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Public Cloud. However, the worker process runs in
    HiveServer (HS2), which equates to a Hive Virtual
    Warehouse..
In CDW, the initiator and cleaner processes run in the Database Catalog, which equates to the
   metastore. The Database
   Catalog
   maintains a connection with the Data Lake and compaction jobs run in parallel with it.
   
   The worker process in Hive Virtual Warehouses executes queries to perform compaction.
