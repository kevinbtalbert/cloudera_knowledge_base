Managing a compaction alert
You can manage compaction alerts in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) by modifying alert
        details, such as the alert name, message, expression that defines threshold conditions for
        the alert, frequency, and severity of the alert.

In the Data Warehouse service, click Overview and expand
                    the Environments column.

Click  and locate an environment having a Database Catalog
                    you activated for CDW.

Click the environment options  and select
                        Edit.

In the Environment Details page, click the
                        ALERT SETTINGS tab and then click  >  Edit for the alert that you want to modify.






In the Edit Alert Details page, modify the required
                    properties to redefine the alert.






Click Update.
