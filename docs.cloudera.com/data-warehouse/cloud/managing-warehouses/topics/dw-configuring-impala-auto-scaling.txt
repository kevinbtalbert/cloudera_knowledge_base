Configuring Impala VW auto-scaling
Configuring the Impala Virtual Warehouse to use concurrency auto-scaling is critical
        for controlling cloud expenses.


You are familiar with the auto-scaling process.
You are creating a Virtual Warehouse for running BI-type queries.
In Cloudera Data Warehouse, you added an Impala Virtual Warehouse, configured
                    the size of the Impala Virtual Warehouse, and configured auto-suspend as
                    described in previous topics. 
You obtained the DWAdmin role.


 In this task, you configure the following properties: 
Scale Up Delay: Sets the length of time in seconds to wait before adding more
                    executors if queries wait in the queue. 
Scale Down Delay: Sets the length of time in seconds to wait before removing
                    executors if executor groups are idle.
The time to auto-scale up or down is affected by the underlying Kubernetes
                configuration. By default Impala Virtual Warehouses can run 3 large queries
                per executor group. Executors can handle more queries that are simpler and that do
                not utilize concurrency on the
                executor.. 

In Scale Up Delay, set the seconds to wait before adding more
                    executors if queries wait in the queue. 






In Scale Down Delay, set the seconds to wait before removing executors when
                    executor groups are idle.
