Configuring Iceberg manifest caching in Impala Virtual Warehouse
 Apache Iceberg provides a mechanism to cache the contents of Iceberg manifest files in
  memory. In Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), you can enable or disable Iceberg manifest caching for
  Impala Coordinators and Catalogd, and set a few other properties, in your Impala Virtual
  Warehouse. 

The manifest caching feature helps to reduce repeated
   reads of small Iceberg manifest files from remote storage by Impala Coordinators and Catalogd.
    The following default properties are set in CDW for manifest caching:
   
  iceberg.io.manifest.cache-enabled=true;
  iceberg.io.manifest.cache.max-total-bytes=104857600;
  iceberg.io.manifest.cache.expiration-interval-ms=3600000;
  iceberg.io.manifest.cache.max-content-length=8388608;  The following list describes
   each property: 

iceberg.io.manifest.cache-enabled: enable/disable the manifest caching
     feature. 

iceberg.io.manifest.cache.max-total-bytes: maximum total amount of bytes to
     cache in the manifest cache. Must be a positive value. 

iceberg.io.manifest.cache.expiration-interval-ms: maximum duration for which
     an entry stays in the manifest cache. Must be a non-negative value. Setting zero means cache
     entries expire only if it gets evicted due to memory pressure from
      iceberg.io.manifest.cache.max-total-bytes. 

iceberg.io.manifest.cache.max-content-length: maximum length of a manifest
     file to be considered for caching in bytes. Manifest files with a length exceeding this
     property value will not be cached. Must be set with a positive value and lower than
      iceberg.io.manifest.cache.max-total-bytes. 
Generally, you set a different value for the expiration interval in catalogd and the
    coordinator. The expiration time is later in catalogd, for example, 1 week. Catalogd needs
    caching for a longer period of time because the catalogd service serves table metadata.Changing configuration parameters in Cloudera Data Warehouse is recommended only when
    following Cloudera instructions.
Obtain the DWAdmin role.

In CDW, click Overview, and find your Impala Virtual
     Warehouse.

Click Options  > Edit > Configurations > Impala catalogd

Search for the following string: iceberg.io.
