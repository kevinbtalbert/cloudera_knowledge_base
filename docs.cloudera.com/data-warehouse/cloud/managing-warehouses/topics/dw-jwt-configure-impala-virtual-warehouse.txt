Configuring the Impala Virtual Warehouse for authentication
You need to enable platform JWT authentication for your Impala Virtual Warehouse during creation or editing of the Virtual Warehouse. This action automatically configures the Impala Virtual Warehouse to support authentication using JWT tokens issued by the CDP JWT authentication provider.
In this task, you see how to enable platform JWT authentication when you create a
            new Virtual Warehouse. 
Do not enable Unified Analytics if you want to configure JWT access to your Impala
            Virtual Warehouse for clients.

Follow instructions for "Creating a Virtual Warehouse".

Select Enable Platform JWT.
