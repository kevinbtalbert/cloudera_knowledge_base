Configuring Impyla for authentication
You can connect Impyla to the Impala Virtual Warehouse using the HTTP transport
        protocol and JWT as the authentication mechanism. 

In a terminal window, as a client, you run the command provided by the Impala
                    Virtual Warehouse owner to update Impyla to the version compatible with the
                    Impala Virtual Warehouse. 

 pip install impyla==0.18.0 


Connect Impyla to the Impala Virtual Warehouse using a connection string as
                    described below:


host=Name of your Virtual Warehouse host 
port=Virtual Warehouse port
use ssl=trueCDW only provides a TLS endpoint, it does not provide an
                                unencrypted endpoint. Also, not using TLS will expose the JWT in
                                plain text.
 http_transport=True The http transport is required by Impala
                                for JWT authentication. 
 jwt=<JWT token> Substitute your JWT token, which you
                                copied earlier, for <JWT Token>.
http_path="cliservice"Required.



self.connection = connect(<ENV>.host, <ENV>.http_port, use_http_transport=True,
http_path="cliservice", 
auth_mechanism="JWT",
timeout=5, jwt=<JWT Token>)

On the client side, you can now run queries from Impyla on the Impala
                    Virtual Warehouse.
