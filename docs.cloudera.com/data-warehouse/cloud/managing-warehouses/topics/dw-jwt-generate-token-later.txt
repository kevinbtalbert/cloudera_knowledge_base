Generating a JWT token from the CDP side
To give client users access to your Virtual Warehouse, you can generate a token in
        Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) and provide the token to your client.
You can navigate to the Apache Knox UI in CDP, or click Options  in the Impala Virtual
            Warehouse tile. From an Impala Virtual Warehouse tile, skip steps 1 and 2 below, and
            just click Options JWT Auth Token Generator shown in the
            following screenshot. 

Apache Knox in CDP appears. Follow steps 3-5 below to generate the token. To
            navigate to the Knox UI instead of using the CDW UI, follow the steps below:

Log into CDP, and in the Cloudera Management Console, select 
                   Environments > Data Lake.




Scroll down to Services, and click Token Integration.



Apache Knox in CDP appears.



Click Token Generation.




In Token Generation, choose the lifespan of the token, and click Generate Token.

Copy the JWT token to provide to your client user.
For security reasons, after you close Token Generation, you cannot see the
                    token again.
