Configuring Impala coordinator shutdown
To cut cloud expenses, you need to know how to configure Impala
        coordinators to automatically shutdown during idle periods. You
        need to know how to
        prevent unnecessary restarts. Monitoring programs that periodically connect to Impala can
        cause unnecessary restarts.
When you create a Virtual Warehouse, you can configure Impala coordinators to
            automatically shutdown during idle periods. The coordinator start up can last several
            minutes, so clients connected to the Virtual Warehouse can time out.
            
        
Update impyla, jdbc, impala shell clients if used to connect to Impala.

Follow instructions for "Adding a new Virtual Warehouse".

Select a size for the Virtual Warehouse. 

Turn off Disable AutoSuspend.
The Impala coordinator does not automatically shutdown unless the Impala
                    executors are suspended. 

Turn on Allow Shutdown of Coordinator.





After Impala executors have been suspended, the Impala coordinator waits for
                    the time period specified by the Trigger Shutdown Delay before
                    shutting down. For example, if AutoSuspend Timeout = 300
                        seconds and Trigger Shutdown Delay=150 seconds, after 300
                        seconds of inactivity Impala executors suspend, and then 150 seconds later,
                        the Impala coordinator shuts down.
