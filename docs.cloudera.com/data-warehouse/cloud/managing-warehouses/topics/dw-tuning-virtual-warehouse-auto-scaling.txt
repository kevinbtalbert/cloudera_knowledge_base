Configuring auto-scaling
When you create a Virtual Warehouse, you set auto-scaling to increase and decrease
      resources according to demand. Auto-scaling relinquishes resources when demand decreases to
      limit unnecessary cloud expenses. Auto-scaling increases resources to speed performance. 
Auto-scaling is designed for huge workloads in production, so if you are evaluating CDW, or
         just learning, simply accept the default values. Later, you can edit the Virtual Warehouse
         to tune auto-scaling. 
Before configuring or tuning auto-scaling, you need to understand the auto-scaling process to make good configuration
         decisions. As a Hive Virtual Warehouse user, choose the method of auto-scaling and see the
         relevant configuration subtopic (below):
Concurrency for BI-type queries
Isolation for ETL-type queries

To configure auto-scaling in a Hive or Impala Virtual Warehouse, see the topics below: 

Configuring Hive VW concurrency auto-scalingConfiguring the Hive Virtual Warehouse to use concurrency auto-scaling is critical     for controlling cloud expenses.Configuring Hive query isolation auto-scalingYou can configure your Hive Virtual Warehouse to add dedicated executors to         run scan-heavy, data-intensive queries, also known as ETL queries. You learn how to enable a         Virtual Warehouse auto-scaling feature and set a query isolation parameter in the Hive         configuration.
