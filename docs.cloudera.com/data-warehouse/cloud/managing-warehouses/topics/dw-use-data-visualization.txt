Data Visualization in Cloudera Data Warehouse
Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) integrates Data Visualization for building graphic
  representations of data, dashboards, and visual applications based on CDW data, or other data
  sources you connect to. You, and authorized users, can explore data across the entire CDP data
  lifecycle using graphics, such as pie charts and histograms. You arrange visuals on a dashboard
  for collaborative analysis.
You connect Data Visualization to a Virtual Warehouse as described in Starting Data Visualization integrated in CDW. Similar to
   using a BI client, you can configure and connect to Virtual Warehouses from different clusters.
   You configure the connection in a familiar way, providing an IP address or host name. Data
   Visualization is not tied to a particular Virtual Warehouse (VW). You can access data for your
   visualization from multiple Data Catalogs using multiple Hive or Impala Virtual Warehouses and
   multiple environments.



Having multiple Data Visualization instances attached to an environment, you can create
   dashboards for different groups. For example, Marketing and Sales can have their own private
   dashboards. When you delete a Virtual Warehouse, your visuals remain intact.
