Configuring a time zone
Cloudera Data Warehouse by default is configured for the UTC time zone. If you want
        time-related queries in your Virtual Warehouse to return results in your local time zone
        instead of UTC, you need learn how to change the configuration.

The way you configure the time zone in the Hive Virtual Warehouse versus the Impala
                Virtual Warehouse differs. In this task, you configure both. 
First you configure a Hive Virtual Warehouse to return Dubai time when you
                        enter a time-related query, such as SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP. 
Next, you configure an Impala Virtual Warehouse to return Budapest time when
                        you enter a query such as SELECT NOW().



In CDW, click Overview, find your Hive Virtual
                    Warehouse, click , and click Edit.

Cick CONFIGURATIONS > HiveServer2.



Select hive-site from the drop-down list, and search for
                        hive.local.time.zone. 

If the hive.local.time.zone key does not appear, click + to add it.

In Value, enter your local time zone.
Refer to https://timezonedb.com/time-zones? to find the name of your time zone. For example, in
                    Value, select Asia/Dubai:



Apply the change.

Click Overview, locate the Impala Virtual
                    Warehouse, click , and click Edit.

In Details, click CONFIGURATIONS > Impala coordinator.

Select flagfile from the drop-down list, and to the
                        default.query.options key, add your local time
                    zone.
For example, in Value, add
                        timezone="Europe/Budapest",:



Apply the change.
