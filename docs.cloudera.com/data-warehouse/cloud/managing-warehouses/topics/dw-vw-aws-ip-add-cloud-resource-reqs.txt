IP address and cloud resource requirements for Virtual Warehouses running on AWS
    environments
Learn about the estimated number of IP addresses and cloud resources required to run
    Virtual Warehouses on AWS environments for Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Public Cloud.

importantThese requirements are estimated. Your particular workloads and
       configurations can affect the number of IP addresses and cloud resources required to run CDW
       Virtual Warehouses efficiently. In addition, these requirements are for AWS environments that
     use the default AWS VPC Container Networking Interface (CNI) plugin. To reduce the number of
     required IP addresses, you can enable the overlay networking feature for AWS environments in
     CDW. For further details, see the link to "Overlay networks for AWS environments in CDW" at the
     bottom of this page.
Virtual Warehouse requirements:
Each compute node in a Virtual Warehouse that runs on AWS environments requires 8 IP
       addresses. Each executor needs one compute node, so the size of your Virtual Warehouse
       contributes to the number of IP addresses required. To calculate the number of IP addresses
       required for custom sizes, multiply the number of executors by 8 and add for the shared
       services as specified in the following sections.
Shared services requirements for Database Catalogs:
Virtual Warehouses also require shared services for the Database Catalog. 
Additional shared services requirements:
The usage for other shared services is different for Hive Virtual Warehouses and Impala
       Virtual Warehouses. Here are the different requirements for Hive versus Impala Virtual
       Warehouses:

Hive Virtual Warehouses add 1 compute node for each executor and 1 shared services
       node for the HiveServer for each Virtual Warehouse.
Impala Virtual Warehouses add 1 compute node for each executor, 1 or 2 compute
         nodes for the coordinator, depending on the HA configuration, and 1 shared services node
         per Virtual Warehouse for Impala catalogd.

The following tables summarize the approximate number of IP addresses and cloud resources
       you should plan for Virtual Warehouses on AWS environments.
