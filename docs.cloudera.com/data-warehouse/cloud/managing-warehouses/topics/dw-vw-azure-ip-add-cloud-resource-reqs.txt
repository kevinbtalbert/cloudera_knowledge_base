IP address and cloud resource requirements for Virtual Warehouses running on Azure
    environments
Learn about the estimated number of IP addresses and cloud resources required to run
    Virtual Warehouses on Azure environments for Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Public Cloud.

importantThese requirements are estimated. Your particular workloads and
        configurations can affect the number of IP addresses and cloud resources required to run CDW
        Virtual Warehouses efficiently. In addition, these requirements are for Azure environments
        that use the default Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) plugin. To reduce the number
        of required IP addresses, you can enable the kubenet networking feature for Azure
        environments in CDW. 
Virtual Warehouse requirements:
Each compute node in a Virtual Warehouse that runs on Azure environments requires 16 IP
        addresses (for pods and for the node itself). Each executor needs one compute node, so the
        size of your Virtual Warehouse contributes to the number of IP addresses required. To
        calculate the number of IP addresses required for custom sizes, multiply the number of
        executors by 16 and add for the shared services as specified in the following sections.
Shared services requirements for Database Catalogs:
Virtual Warehouses also require shared services for Database Catalogs.
        
Additional shared services requirements:
The usage for other shared services is different for Hive Virtual Warehouses and Impala
       Virtual Warehouses. Here are the different requirements for Hive versus Impala Virtual
       Warehouses:

Hive Virtual Warehouses add 1 compute node for each executor and 1 shared services
         node for the HiveServer for each Virtual Warehouse.
Impala Virtual Warehouses add 1 compute node for each executor, 1 or 2 compute
         nodes for the coordinator, depending on the HA configuration, and 1 shared services node
         per Virtual Warehouse for Impala catalogd.

The following tables summarize the approximate number of IP addresses and cloud resources
       you should plan for Virtual Warehouses on Azure environments.
