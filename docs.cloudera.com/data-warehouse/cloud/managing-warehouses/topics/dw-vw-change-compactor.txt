Change compactor configuration for Hive Virtual Warehouses on Cloudera Data Warehouse
      Public Cloud
To enhance performance, the compactor is a set of background processes that compact
      delta files, which are created as a by-product of data modifications. When it runs, it
    incurs additional load on the Hive Virtual Warehouse assigned as the compactor in Cloudera Data
      Warehouse (CDW) Public Cloud. You can change which Hive warehouse performs compaction to load-balance
    this workload as necessary.

One Hive Virtual Warehouse must be the compactor for all the Virtual Warehouses
              associated with a particular Database Catalog. This Hive Virtual Warehouse compactor runs
              all of the compaction queries for all Virtual Warehouses that use one particular Database
              Catalog, including Impala Virtual Warehouses. However, Impala Virtual Warehouses cannot
              be designated as the compactor Virtual Warehouse for a Database Catalog. Compaction tasks
              can only be assigned to a Hive Virtual Warehouse. The first Hive Virtual Warehouse you
              create against a Database Catalog is automatically set as the compactor. If you decide you
              do not want that particular warehouse to take on the compaction workload, you can set
              another Hive Virtual Warehouse to perform the compaction workload by following these steps:


Log in to the CDP web interface and navigate to the Data Warehouse service.

On the Overview page, select the Hive Virtual Warehouse that you want to set as the
            compactor, and click the options menu .

In the options menu, select Set Compactor.
