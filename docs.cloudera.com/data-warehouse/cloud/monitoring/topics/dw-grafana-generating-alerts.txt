Meeting prerequisites to set up alerts
Before you can set up an alert triggered by a dashboard event, you must configure an
        SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server, an alert recipient, and a notification policy. 

Configure grafana using kubectl.
kubectl edit configmap grafana -n istio-system
For more information, see "Granting remote access to
                    Kubernetes".

Update the grafana.ini to configure SMTP, setting user to the altert account
                    email id and the password to the app password generated in your gmail
                    account.

...
[smtp]
enabled = true
host = smtp.gmail.com:465
user = youremail@gmail.com
password = substitute_your_password
;cert_file=
;key_file=
skip_verify = true
from_address = alertgrafan@gmail.com
from_name = Grafana
* EHLO identity in SMTP dialog (defaults to instance_name)
;ehlo_identity = dashboard.example.com
;startTLS_policy = NoStartTLS



Refresh the grafana pod.

kubectl get pod -A grep -i grafana
kubectl delete pod grafana-9bcb5d5c-w8r6c -n istio-system

                    type.
