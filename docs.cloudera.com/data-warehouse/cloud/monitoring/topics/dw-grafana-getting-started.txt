Learn how to log into Grafana in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Public Cloud. 


To access Grafana, your CDP administrator must use Management Console to assign
                    the environment to you as a resource. 
You must obtain the DWAdmin role.



In Data Warehouse > Overview, expand the Environment column.
               

Search for the environment that is associated with the Virtual Warehouse, click more
                   options  in the
                   environment tile, and select Open Grafana. 







Enter your LDAP user name, or the name provided by your Administrator for
                    logging into Grafana.

Go back to the environment tile, and select Copy Kubeconf.

Open a terminal window, paste the contents of your clipboard into a text file,
                    and save the file by the name kubeconf (no extension).

Export the KUBECONFIG variable equal to the file name.
export KUBECONFIG=kubeconf

Get the password for Grafana.

                    kubectl get secret grafana -n istio-system -o jsonpath="{.data.passphrase}" | base64 -D | pbcopy
