Monitoring Kubernetes resources
As a Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) administrator, you can monitor Kubernetes resources
  in your CDW cluster. On the K8S dashboard, you can view the state of the resources, such as CPU
  and memory usage, see the status of pods, and download logs.
The dashboard can provide insights into the performance and health of a CDW cluster.
   From the dashboard, if authorized, you can monitor the environments of any CDW cluster
   efficiently. You do not need to copy/paste kubeconfig files to switch to monitoring another
   environment, Monitoring the dashboard can help keep your cluster running smoothly and
   efficiently.
By default, the dashboard is disabled. You follow instructions in the next topic to activate
      and use the dashboard. Using the dashboard incurs some cloud cost, and is designed to time out
      automatically after 4 hours to prevent wasting resources. Cloudera recommends deactivating the
      dashboard when not in use to reduce cloud expenses.
This feature is available as a technical preview.
