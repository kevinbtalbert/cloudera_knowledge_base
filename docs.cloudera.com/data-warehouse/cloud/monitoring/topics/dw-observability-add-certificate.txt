Providing proxy CA certificates
If you use a TLS-terminating proxy server to inspect outbound internet traffic, you
        need to provide the proxy server's CA certificates bundle in PEM bundle format when you
        configure log forwarding. 
You learn how to use the Observability tab in
            CDW Environment Details to configure the Proxy CA Certificates (PEM Bundle) field. 
 Before you apply the proxy CA certificate to a configuration of log forwarding, you
            must provide a configuration in the Logs Forwarding Configuration section of the
            Observability tab.

In the Data Warehouse service, expand the Environments column by
                clicking Moreâ€¦.

In Environments, locate your environment, and click Options  > Edit > Observability tab.
Environment details include a UI for configuring log forwarding.



Obtain and copy your proxy server's CA certificates PEM bundle. 

In Proxy CA Certificates, paste the copy of the PEM bundle.

Click Apply.
If the certificate and log forwarding configuration are valid, log forwarding
                    begins. If the certificates are invalid, an error message occurs.


The log forwarding configuration and certificates are not
                    saved.
