Speeding up queries using BI mode
You can use BI mode to automatically rewrite incoming queries to be answered
        approximately using Apache DataSketches. BI mode can be useful when using data visualization
        BI tools such as Tableau. 

Queries of very large data sets with a number of distinct values often take too long
                to return results. If you can accept approximate results, using DataSketch
                algorithms can save significant time. BI mode integrated with DataSketches
                accelerates query execution while decreasing resource utilization. BI mode can
                rewrite a wide range of SQL analytical queries, including COUNT(DISTINCT),
                CUME_DIST, RANK, and NTILE.
When you enable BI mode to use Apache DataSketches approximations, a materialized view automatically calls DataSketches for some types of operations. 
                You can pre-compute data sketches using materialized views, and then rely on Unified
                Analytics BI mode to rewrite algorithms to answer queries directly from those
                materialized views. This accelerates query execution by orders of magnitude without
                any change to your original queries.



Choose an authorization model. 
Configure authenticated users for querying Hive through JDBC or ODBC driver. For
                    example, set up a Ranger policy.



Get the JDBC driverTo query, analyze, and visualize data stored in CDW Unified Analytics, you must         download the Unified Analytics JDBC driver to your cluster and provide it to your client.         You can use the latest version of drivers provided by Cloudera to connect Unified Analytics         to Business Intelligence (BI) tools.Connect to Unified Analytics with a BI toolAfter you downloaded the JDBC driver, you must set up a BI tool such as Tableau to         connect with the Unified Analytics engine. Enable BI mode to rewrite queries automaticallyYou must enable BI mode to combine the BI capability with the power of transparent         materialized view rewritings.
