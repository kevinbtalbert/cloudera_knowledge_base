Client access to Unified AnalyticsCloudera Docs
Client access to Unified Analytics 
You learn which interfaces Unified Analytics supports for connecting a client. Procedures for using the JDBC and Impala shell interfaces include step-by-step instructions.
To connect to Unified Analytics you can download the JDBC driver from the Unified
                Analytics to give to your client. Also, provide the Unified Analytics endpoint to
                your client to establish the connection.
You can connect and submit requests using the following interfaces: 

JDBC/ODBC
Beeline
Impala shell
Impyla Python client
Hue web-based user interface


Connecting a JDBC clientYou see how to establish the connection between your JDBC client and Unified Analytics.Connecting an Impala shell clientYou need to provide the commands to your client users for installing and launching         the Impala shell to connect to your Unified Analytics. Client users can then query your         tables. You learn how to obtain the command for installing the Impala shell on a client and         other information to provide to clients. Using the Impala shell clientYou obtain the commands from the Impala Virtual Warehouse owner for installing and         launching the Impala shell to connect to the Impala Virtual Warehouse. You learn how to         install and launch the Impala shell that connects to the Impala Virtual Warehouse UI. You         then query tables in the Impala Virtual Warehouse, assuming you have authentication         credentials. Windows clients are not supported.
