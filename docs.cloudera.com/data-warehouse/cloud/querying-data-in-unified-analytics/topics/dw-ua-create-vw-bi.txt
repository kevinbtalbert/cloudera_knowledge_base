Setting up an Impala Virtual Warehouse 
You learn how to set up a Unified Analytics Virtual Warehouse for Business
        Intelligence (BI), or ad-hoc querying. An Impala Virtual Warehouse can read full ACID tables
        in the Hive metastore, and can write insert-only ACID tables because you select the Impala
        engine type.
 First you create a VW of SQL engine type Impala, and then you enable Unified
                Analytics.
