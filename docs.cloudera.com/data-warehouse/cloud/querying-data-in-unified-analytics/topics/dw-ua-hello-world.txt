Running the Hello world example
You use the minimum set of required parameters, and get a result that is not interesting. From this example, you learn what to expect in the output when you use the minimum set of required parameters.  

In
                the input directory workload-insights/demo/queries, a file named queryA.sql contains
                a single query. 


Go to the workload-insights directory
The Workload Insights (wi) script is located in this directory.

Run the script using the -i option to specify file queryA.sql as the input to
                    the recommender.

./wi -i queries/queryA.sql -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000                 

Output looks something like this: 2021-06-10 15:17:37,461 INFO c.c.i.a.m.t.JdbcWorkloadReader Computing plan for queryA from JDBC connection

The result is identical to the input query. The output contains a list of
                        recommendations followed by the queries in the workload. By default, for
                        each query, the materialized views matching the query appear.
