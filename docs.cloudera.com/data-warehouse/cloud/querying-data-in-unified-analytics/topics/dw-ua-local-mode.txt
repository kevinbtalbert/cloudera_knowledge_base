Using the recommender in local mode
You can use the recommender on a local computer for learning and testing. You can use a
  Mac laptop, for example. First, from  a Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) Virtual Warehouse that
  enables Unified Analytics, you download software that runs a mini HiveServer in local mode. Next,
  you provide a set of queries or explain plans to the recommender. Finally, you execute the
  Workload Insights (wi) script to get pseudo-recommendations.


Setting up a mini HiveServerYou follow a step-by-step procedure to get a docker image of HiveServer (HS2) and   example files to simulate working with HiveServer in a cluster. In local mode, you do not get   actual recommendations, but you experiment with and understand recommendations using this mode   without incurring any cloud costs.Getting wi script helpTo get pseudo-recommendations for learning, or testing purposes, you need to know the         Workload Insights (wi) script options. You run your first wi script to get online         help.Running Recommender examplesThe workload-insights archive includes sample queries and explain plans that demonstrate the recommender. You gain an understanding of the recommender by running examples.Parent topic: Materialized views
