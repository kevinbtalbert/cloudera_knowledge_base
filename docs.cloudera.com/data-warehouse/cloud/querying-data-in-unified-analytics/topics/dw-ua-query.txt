Running a query
You simply open Hue and submit your query. You do not need to manually start beeline or any other shell.
As a DW User, you open Hue from a Virtual Warehouse that you set up, and run the
            query. The SQL engine reads from and writes to the same metastore, regardless of the
            type Virtual Warehouse.




Required role: DW User
You obtained permission to run SQL queries from the Env Admin, who added you to
                    a Hadoop SQL policy. 



On the Overview page under Virtual
                        Warehouses, click options , and select Open Hue.






Select a database.
For example, select database airline_ontime_parquet.

In Hue, enter a query.
                    
SELECT dest, origin
FROM flights
GROUP BY dest, origin;

Click  to run the query.
