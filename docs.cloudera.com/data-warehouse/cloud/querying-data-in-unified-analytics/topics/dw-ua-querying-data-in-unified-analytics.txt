Unified Analytics basics
 A brief description of Unified Analytics engines and query editors prepares you to
        run a query. You learn how to select the SQL engine that best suits your needs.
Before using Unified Analytics, understand the concepts behind it. In Cloudera
            Data Warehouse (CDW), Unified Analytics integrates essential warehouse
            software: 
SQL engines: Hive and Impala
Query editors: Hue and the Impala shell

As DW Admin, you use a one- or two-step procedure to create a Virtual Warehouse
            (VW) for querying your data, as shown in the following diagram: 


When you create a Hive Virtual Warehouse, Unified Analytics is enabled. When you create an Impala Virtual Warehouse, you need to perform an extra step to enable Unified Analytics.
