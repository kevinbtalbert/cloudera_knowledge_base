Running Recommender examples
The workload-insights archive includes sample queries and explain plans that demonstrate the recommender. You gain an understanding of the recommender by running examples.

In local mode, you do not get actual recommendations, but you experiment with and
        understand recommendations using this mode without incurring any cloud costs.The recommender
        examples you can run use one or both of the following queries as input:
QueryA
SELECT sr_item_sk, sum(sr_net_loss) AS net_loss
FROM store_returns
INNER JOIN reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
WHERE r_reason_desc = 'Found a better price in a store'
GROUP BY sr_item_sk   
Query A asks these questions: 
Which items were returned because the customer found a better price?
How much money did the company lose on each returned item?

QueryB
SELECT sr_item_sk, sum(sr_net_loss) as net_loss, avg(ss_sales_price) as price
FROM store_sales
INNER JOIN store_returns
  ON ss_item_sk=sr_item_sk AND ss_ticket_number=sr_ticket_number
INNER JOIN reason
  ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
WHERE r_reason_desc = 'Found a better price in a store'
GROUP BY sr_item_sk
ORDER BY net_loss DESC NULLS LAST, price DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 10  
QueryB asks these questions:
Which items were returned because the customer found a better price? 
How much money did the company lose on each returned item?
What was the average selling price of return items? 
What are the top ten items causing the biggest loss?




The mini-hs2 docker image is running.
You downloaded and unpacked the workload-insights archive, and it includes the following
          sample queries that you need to provide as input to the Workload Insights (wi) script:
Directories containing select and aggregation queries in .sql filesA .sql file
                name suffix is required.
Directories containing explain plans in .json filesA .json file name suffix
                 is required.




Running the Hello world exampleYou use the minimum set of required parameters, and get a result that is not interesting. From this example, you learn what to expect in the output when you use the minimum set of required parameters.  Running the exclude aggregations exampleIf you are knowledgeable about your workload and want to exclude views with         aggregations for maintenance reasons, you need to know about the SPJ (select-project-join)         recommendation mode. Running the level of detail examples         You see what the level of detail options, -l MINIMAL, -l DEFAULT, and -l FULL do byy running these examples. The recommended materialized view is identical to the input query regardless of the level of detail option you use.     Running the JSON output exampleYou see the example JSON output when you run the Workload Insights command with the -f JSON option.    Running the multiple query input exampleTypically, you want the recommender to base recommendations on multiple queries. You see how to run the wi script on a directory containing multiple queries and how to interact with the recommender.Running the repetitive queries exampleYou see how the recommender cost model takes repetitive queries into account when generating final recommendations.    Cleaning up materialized viewsYou can delete materialized views, not used by your workload. You provide JDBC information about the queries associated with the materialized views using Workload Insights (wi) script and then use command-line JSON processor jq to delete the unused materialized views.     Analyzing JSON recordsYou can use a jq command to extract information about recommendations in JSON. Then, you can rerun the query, take a look at the plan, and see which materialized view was used, and other information.    Parent topic: Using the recommender in local mode
