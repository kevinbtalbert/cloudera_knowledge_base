Setting up a mini HiveServerCloudera Docs
Setting up a mini HiveServer
You follow a step-by-step procedure to get a docker image of HiveServer (HS2) and
  example files to simulate working with HiveServer in a cluster. In local mode, you do not get
  actual recommendations, but you experiment with and understand recommendations using this mode
  without incurring any cloud costs.

You download the workload-insights archive and unpack it. You run one docker command to start
    HiveServer and another to load the TPC-DS schema. Example query files, based on the TPC-DS
    Benchmark DDL queries, are included in the package. No actual data is needed.  



Check that Java 8 or later is installed.
Install Docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
Check that Docker is working: docker run hello-world



On the Overview page under Virtual Warehouses,
     click options  in a
     Virtual Warehouse that enables Unified Analytics. 






Click Download Workload Insights to download the workload-insights archive.

On your file system, unpack the archive.

Set environment variable WI_HOME="$PWD".
For example, on the command line of a
     terminal:export WI_HOME="$PWD"


Set environment variable WI_HOME to a value of $PWD.
      WI_CLASSPATH="*:./lib/*:$WI_HOME/target/*:$WI_HOME/target/lib/*"

Start up a HiveServer (HS2) container named mini-hs2 that listens on port 10000.

docker run -p "10000:10000" -d --name mini-hs2 zabetak/hs2-embedded:1.0.2.7.2.3.0-220     


Load the TPC-DS schema required for running examples.

docker exec mini-hs2 schema-load tpcds

Ignore any log4j warning messages.

Run the recommender.
