Getting wi script help
To get pseudo-recommendations for learning, or testing purposes, you need to know the
        Workload Insights (wi) script options. You run your first wi script to get online
        help.

Go to the github directory where you downloaded and built the project.

Run the wi script with no options to get online help about script usage and
                    options:

$ ./wi

Output looks something like this:
usage: wi -i <file_1,...,file_N> [-o <directory>] [-c <configfile>] [-u <url>] [-n <username>] [-p
 <password>] [-t <threshold>] [-f <format>] [-r <recommendation>] [-l <level>][-d]


-i,--input <file_1,...,file_N>
                                        

one or more .sql/.json files or a
                                                directory (version Y)

-u,--url <url>
JDBC url to connect to


-n,--username
                                        <username>
username to connect as

password to connect as


-t,--tables-threshold
                                            <threshold>

the threshold controlling above which a table subset is considered interesting
if it is estimated to contribute to total workload cost above this threshold
(between 0 and 1). The default is 0.1 (10% of total workload
cost)



-f,--format
                                        <format>
output format

-r,--recommendation
                                            <recommendation>


the kind of recommendations to include in the report:                
- SPJ for SELECT-PROJECT-JOIN recommendations      
- SPJA for SELECT-PROJECT-JOIN-AGGREGATE recommendations                      
- ALL for both SPJ and SPJA recommendations
(DEFAULT)




-l,--level <level> 


the level of detail to display in the report:                     
- MINIMAL displays only the view recommendations      
- DEFAULT displays recommendations along with basic information about the query workload      
- FULL displays all information available in the report (useful for debugging purposes)




-d, --delete

suggest which materialized views, not used by a given workload could be
deleted. Requires JDBC information to be provided. Available in version
Y.

Try the recommender examples.
A text report that has the following information appears:

View recommendations for the workload.


Queries in the workload, along with the recommendations for each
                                query (if available), and other information.
