Escaping an invalid
    identifier
When you need to use reserved words, special characters, or a space in a column or
    partition name, enclose it in backticks (`).

An identifier in SQL is a sequence of alphanumeric and underscore (_) characters enclosed
        in backtick characters. In Hive, these identifiers are called quoted identifiers and are
        case-insensitive. You can use the identifier instead of a column or table partition
        name.

You have set the following parameter to column in the hive-site.xml file
      to enable quoted identifiers: Set the hive.support.quoted.identifiers
        configuration parameter to column in the hive-site.xml
        file to enable quoted identifiers in column names. Valid values are none
        and column. For example, in Hive execute the following command: SET
          hive.support.quoted.identifiers = column.


Create a table named test that has two columns of strings specified by quoted
          identifiers:
CREATE TABLE test (`x+y` String, `a?b` String);

Create a table that defines a partition using a quoted identifier and a region
          number:
CREATE TABLE partition_date-1 (key string, value string) PARTITIONED BY (`dt+x`
          date, region int);

Create a table that defines clustering using a quoted identifier:
CREATE TABLE bucket_test(`key?1` string, value string) CLUSTERED BY (`key?1`) into
          5 buckets;
