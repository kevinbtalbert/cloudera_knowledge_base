Showing materialized views
You can list all materialized views in the current database or in another
    database. You can filter a list of materialized views in a specified database using regular expression wildcards.

You can use regular expression wildcards to filter the list of materialized views you
        want to see. The following wildcards are supported:
        
Asterisk (*)Represents one or more characters.
Pipe symbol (|)Represents a choice.

For example, mv_q* and *mv|q1* match the materialized view mv_q1. 
        Finding no match does not cause an error.
