Updating data in a
      table
The syntax describes the UPDATE statement you use to modify data already stored in a
      table. An example shows how to apply the syntax.You construct an UPDATE statement using the following syntax:
UPDATE tablename SET column = value [, column = value ...] [WHERE
               expression];Depending on the condition specified in the optional
            WHERE clause, an UPDATE statement might affect every row in a table. The expression in
            the WHERE clause must be an expression supported by a SELECT clause. Subqueries are not
            allowed on the right side of the SET statement. Partition columns cannot be
         updated.
You must have SELECT and UPDATE
            privileges to use the UPDATE statement.

Create a statement that changes the values in the name column of all rows where the gpa column has the value of 1.0.
UPDATE students SET name = null WHERE gpa <= 1.0;
