Creating a user-defined function in Cloudera Data Warehouse Public Cloud
You can call a built-in Hive function to run one of a wide-range of operations
        instead of performing multiple steps. You can create a user-defined function (UDF) when a
        built-in is not available to do what you need. 
Assuming you have installed Java and a Java integrated development environment (IDE)
            tool, such as IntelliJ, you can create the UDF offline. For example, you can create the
            UDF on your laptop. You export a user-defined function (UDF) to a JAR from a Hadoop- and
            Hive-compatible Java project and store the JAR on the object store. Using Hive commands,
            you register the UDF based on the JAR, and call the UDF from a Hive query. 

Setting up the development environmentYou can create a Hive UDF in a development environment using IntelliJ, for example,         and build the UDF. You define the Cloudera Maven Repository in your POM, which accesses         necessary JARS hadoop-common-<version>.jar and hive-exec-<version>.jar.Create the UDF classYou define the UDF logic in a new class that returns the data type of a selected column     in a table.Building the project and uploading the JARFirst, you compile the UDF code into a JAR, and then you add the JAR to Cloudera Data         Warehouse object storage.Configuring Hive Virtual Warehouses to cache UDF JARsAfter you write and compile your User Defined Function (UDF) code into a Java Archive     (JAR) file, you can configure a Hive Virtual Warehouse to cache the UDF JAR in HiveServer (HS2)     in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW). Registering the UDFIn Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), you run a command from a client interface to your         Virtual Warehouse, such as Hue, to call the UDF from Hive queries. The UDF persists between         HiveServer restarts.
