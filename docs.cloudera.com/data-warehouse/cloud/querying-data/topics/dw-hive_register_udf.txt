Registering the UDF
In Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), you run a command from a client interface to your
        Virtual Warehouse, such as Hue, to call the UDF from Hive queries. The UDF persists between
        HiveServer restarts.
You need to set up UDF access using a Ranger policy as follows:
Log in to the Data Warehouse service and open Ranger from  the Database Catalog
                associated with your Hive Virtual Warehouse.
On the Service Manager page, under the HADOOP
                        SQL section, select the Database Catalog associated with the
                    Hive Virtual Warehouse in which you want to run the UDFs.
Select the all - database, udf policy and add the users needing
                access to Hue. To add all users, you can specify
                {USER}.



Open Hue from the Hive Virtual Warehouse in CDW.

Run the registration command by including the JAR location on your object store.
For example, on AWS:
                    CREATE FUNCTION udftypeof AS 'com.mycompany.hiveudf.TypeOf01' USING JAR 's3a://mybucket/mypath/TypeOf01-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar';
                    On Azure:
                    CREATE FUNCTION udftypeof AS 'com.mycompany.hiveudf.TypeOf01' USING JAR 'abfs://mybucket/mypath/TypeOf01-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar';


Restart the Virtual Warehouse.

Check that the UDF is registered.

SHOW FUNCTIONS;

You scroll through the output and find
                    default.typeof.

Run a query that calls the UDF.
SELECT students.name, udftypeof(students.name) AS type FROM students WHERE age=35;
