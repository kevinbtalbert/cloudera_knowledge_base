Creating tables by importing CSV files from ABFSCloudera Docs
Creating tables by importing CSV files from ABFS
You can create tables in Hue by importing CSV files stored in ABFS. Hue automatically
        detects the schema and the column types, thus helping you to create tables without using the
        CREATE TABLE syntax. 

Only Hue Superusers can access ABFS and import files to create tables.
The maximum file size supported is three gigabytes.
            




Create a storage account from the Microsoft Azure portal.
                        On
                        the Create storage account > Advanced page of the Azure portal, enable Data Lake Storage
                            Gen2 so that the objects and files within your account can
                        be organized into a hierarchy of directories and nested subdirectories in
                        the same way that the file system on your computer is organized.
While registering an Azure environment in CDP Management Console, set the
                            Storage Location Base in the Data
                            Access section as follows:
                            abfs://storage-fs@[***AZURE-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-NAME***].dfs.core.windows.netThis
                            location is used to read and store data.
Enable the ABFS file browser in Hue.
Sign in to Cloudera Data Warehouse.
Go to the Virtual Warehouse from which you want to access the ABFS
                                containers and click its edit icon.
On the Virtual Warehouses detail page, go to
                                the Hue tab and select hue-safety-valve from
                                the drop-down menu.
Add the following configuration for Hive or Impala Virtual Warehouse

                                    sure that the container name and the Azure storage account name
                                    that you specify under the abfs_clusters
                                    section is same as what you specified under Data Access > Storage Location Base while activating the Azure environment, so that
                                    Hive or Impala has permission to access the uploaded
                                files.
Click Apply in the upper right corner of the
                                    page.The ABFS File Browser icon appears on the left Assist
                                    panel on the Hue web UI after the Virtual Warehouse
                                    restarts.





In the CDW service Overview page, select the Virtual
                    Warehouse in which you want to create the table, click the options menu in the
                    upper right corner and click Open Hue.

From the left assist panel, click on Importer.

On the Importer screen, click .. at the end of the
                        Path field:





Choose a file pop-up is displayed.

Type abfs://[***CONTAINER-NAME***] in the address text box and
                    press enter.
The ABFS containers created under the Azure storage account are
                    displayed.
You can narrow down the list of results using the search option. 
If the file is present on your computer, then you can upload it to ABFS by
                    clicking Upload a file.

Select the CSV file that you want to import into Hue.
Hue displays the preview of the table along with the format.
Hue automatically detects the field separator, record separator, and the quote
                    character from the CSV file. If you want to override a specific setting, then
                    you can change it by selecting a different value from the drop-down menu.
                

Click Next.
On this page, you can set the table destination, partitions, and change the
                    column data types.

Verify the settings and click Submit to create the
                    table.
The CREATE TABLE query is triggered.
Hue displays the logs and opens the Table Browser from
                    which you can view the newly created table when the operation completes
                    successfully.
