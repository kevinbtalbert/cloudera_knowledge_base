Creating tables by importing CSV files from AWS S3Cloudera Docs
Creating tables by importing CSV files from AWS S3
You can create tables in Hue by importing CSV files stored in S3 buckets. Hue
        automatically detects the schema and the column types, thus helping you to create tables
        without using the CREATE TABLE syntax.

Only Hue Superusers can access S3 buckets and import files to create tables. To
                create tables by importing files from S3, you must assign and authorize use of a
                specific bucket on S3 bucket for your environment. The bucket then appears like a
                home directory on the Hue web interface.
The maximum file size supported is three gigabytes.




Create roles and synchronize users to FreeIPA.Make sure that the
                            users who want to create tables by importing CSV files have
                            EnvironmentAdmin or EnvironmentUser roles, and that you have
                            synchronized users to FreeIPA. This is required for users accessing the
                            data lake. Ranger will allow these users to access the additional
                            bucket.  To assign roles to users, see Assigning resources to
                            users in the Management Console documentation.To synchronize
                            users to FreeIPA, see Performing user sync in the Management Console
                            documentation. 
Add an S3 bucket to your CDW environment.If you add an S3 bucket
                            and then try to access it from the Hue web interface without adding it
                            to the CDW environment, then Impala or Hive may display the
                            “AccessDeniedException 403” exception. Make sure that your Cloudera Data
                            Warehouse (CDW) environment has access to the S3 buckets that you want
                            to access from Hue. When you create a Virtual Warehouse in the
                            CDW service, a cluster is created in your AWS account. Two buckets are
                                generated:
One bucket is used for managed data
The other bucket is used for external data. 
Access to these buckets is controlled by AWS instance profiles. To add
                            read/write access to S3 buckets under the same AWS account as the CDW
                            service cluster, or under a different account, see the corresponding
                            links at the bottom of the page.To add an S3 bucket to your CDW
                                environment:
In the Data Warehouse service, expand the
                                        Environments column by clicking the
                                        More… menu on the left side of the
                                    page.
In the Environments column, click the
                                    search icon and locate the environment in which you want to add
                                    the S3 bucket.
Click the edit icon in the tile. This launches the
                                        Environment Details page.
In the Environment Details page, toward the
                                    bottom of the page, type the name of the AWS bucket you want to
                                    configure access to in the Add External S3
                                        Bucket text box.If the bucket belongs to
                                        another AWS account, then select the Bucket
                                            belongs to different AWS account
                                    option.
Select the access mode.Read-only access is sufficient to
                                        import data in Hue.
Click Add Bucket to save the
                                    configuration. A success message displays at the top of the
                                    page.
Click Apply to update the CDW
                                        environment.noteIf you configure read only access to an S3
                                        bucket you add, there is no need to restart Virtual
                                        Warehouses. However, if you configure read/write access to
                                        an external S3 bucket, you must restart Virtual Warehouses
                                        by suspending them and starting them again.

Enable the S3 file browser in Hue.To enable access to S3 buckets
                            from the Hue web UI, you must add the AWS environment details in the
                            hue-safety-valve configuration from your Virtual Warehouse. After
                            enabling the S3 file browser, you can browse the S3 buckets, create
                            folders, and upload files from your computer, and import files to create
                            tables.
Sign in to Cloudera Data Warehouse.
Go to the Virtual Warehouse from which you want to access the S3
                                buckets and click its edit icon.
On the Virtual Warehouses detail page, click the
                                    Hue tab and select
                                    hue-safety-valve from the drop-down
                                menu.

Click Apply in the upper right corner of the
                                    page.The S3 File Browser icon appears on the left Assist
                                    panel on the Hue web UI after the Virtual Warehouse
                                    restarts.



To import the CSV file and create the table:


In the CDW service Overview page, select the Virtual
                    Warehouse in which you want to create the table, click the options menu in the
                    upper right corner and click Open Hue.

From the left assist panel, click on Importer. 

On the Importer screen, click .. at the end of the
                        Path field:





Choose a file pop-up is displayed.

Type s3a:// in the address text box and press
                    enter.
The S3 buckets associated with the CDW environment are displayed. You can
                    narrow down the list of results using the search option.





If the file is present on your computer, then you can upload it to S3 by
                    clicking Upload a file. To do this, you must have enabled
                    read/write access to the S3 bucket from the CDW environment.

Select the CSV file that you want to import into Hue.
Hue displays the preview of the table along with the format:





Hue automatically detects the field separator, record separator, and the quote
                    character from the CSV file. If you want to override a specific setting, then
                    you can change it by selecting a different value from the dropdown menu. 

Click Next.
On this page, you can set the table destination, partitions, and change the
                    column data types.






Verify the settings and click Submit to create the
                    table.
The CREATE TABLE query is triggered:


Hue displays the logs and opens the Table Browser from
                    which you can view the newly created table when the operation completes
                    successfully.
