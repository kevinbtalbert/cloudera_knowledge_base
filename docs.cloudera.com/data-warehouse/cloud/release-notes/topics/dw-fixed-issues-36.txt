CDPD-35041 Security Vulnerability with SSO for Hive Virtual Warehouses in CDW Public Cloud
This release fixes the SSO-related problem that occurred only in Hive Virtual Warehouses in
     Cloudera Data Warehouse version 2021.0.6-b96 released on March 8, 2022. This problem affected
     tenants who had the CDW_ALLOW_SSO_FOR_LLAP entitlement. In a misconfigured Hive Virtual
     Warehouse, unauthorized users who knew the JDBC connection string and had a valid userid, could
     execute arbitrary SQL queries on a Hive Virtual Warehouse. This security vulnerability no
     longer exists. Hive now properly handles the situation by using LDAP authentication as follows:
     If SSO authentication is enabled for a Hive Virtual Warehouse and a user bypasses
     authentication altogether by removing the auth=browser option from the JDBC
     connection string, Hive uses LDAP authentication.
