DWX-13094 Diagnostic bundle job fails with missing service account
In Cloudera Data Warehouse 1.4.3 (released September 15, 2022), the diagnostic bundle job no longer fails if it was used before with any previous versions of CDW. Jobs from the latest version run with the correct name of the service account installed after the upgrade.
