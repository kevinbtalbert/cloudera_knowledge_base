Learn about the general known issues in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on public
    clouds, the impact or changes to the functionality, and the workaround.

DWX-6619 Browser auto-close not working on some browsers after token-Based
            authentication for accessing CDW 
 The Firefox and Edge browser window does not close automatically after successful
          authentication. 
DWX-9774 Database Catalog or Virtual Warehouse image version problem
Background: In Cloudera Data Warehouse 2021.0.3-b27 - 2021.0.5-b36, you can choose
          any supported image version when you create a Database Catalog or Virtual Warehouse,
          assuming you have the CDW_VERSIONED_DEPLOY entitlement.
Problem: In Cloudera Data Warehouse 2021.0.6-b96, you can choose an image version
          other than 2021.0.6-b96 when you create a Database Catalog or Virtual Warehouse only if
          you use an existing environment. An existing environment is one you created in
          2021.0.3-b27 - 2021.0.5-b36. 
Workaround:  In 2021.0.6-b96, use an environment you created before this release to
          choose an image version other than 2021.0.6-b96 when you create a Database Catalog or
          Virtual Warehouse.
DWX-5841: Virtual Warehouse endpoints are now restricted to TLS 1.2
Problem: TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer considered secure, so now Virtual Warehouse
        endpoints must be secured with TLS 1.2 or later, and then the environment that the Virtual
        Warehouse uses must be reactivated in CDW. This includes both Hive and Impala Virtual
        Warehouses. To reactivate the environment in the CDW UI:
        
Deactivate the environment. See Deactivating AWS environments or Deactivating Azure environments.
Activate the environment. See Activating AWS environments or Activating Azure environments


Workaround: If environment reactivation is not possible, you can perform manual
        steps using the kubectl command line tool to pick up the TLS 1.2 endpoint
        change. Open a terminal window on a system where the kubectl command line
        tool is installed, log in, and run the following commands:
      kubectl edit svc nginx-service -n <cluster-name>

# Add the following under the metadata.annotations field
service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-negotiation-policy: "ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01"
      
# Save and quit the editor, and then run the following command to check your changes.
      
kubectl get svc nginx-service -n <cluster-name> -o yaml
      
# Make sure that the annotation you added is present.

DWX-5742: Upgrading multiple Hive and Impala Virtual Warehouses or Database Catalogs at
        the same time fails
Problem: Upgrading multiple Hive and Impala Virtual Warehouses or Database Catalogs
        at the same time fails.
Workaround: If you need to upgrade or create multiple Hive and Impala Virtual
        Warehouses or Database Catalogs, perform the upgrade or creation sequentially one at a time.
