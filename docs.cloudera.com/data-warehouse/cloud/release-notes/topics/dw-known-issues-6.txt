  following known issues:
New known Issues in this release

Do not upgrade this release to EKS 1.22
The latest version of Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) 1.6.1-b258 (released February 7,
            2023) provisions AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) 1.22 by default in AWS
            environments; however, upgrading your activated environments to EKS 1.22 or later is not
            supported. Do not upgrade your EKS clusters to 1.22.
DWX-14163 Limitations reading Iceberg tables in Avro file format from Impala
The Avro, Impala, and Iceberg specifications describe some limitations related to Avro, and those limitations exist in CDP. In addition to these,
      the DECIMAL type is not supported in this release.


DWX-14286 Loading data to Iceberg error
Using LOAD DATA INPATH from an Impala Virtual Warehouse to load data to an Iceberg table
            on S3/ADLS when hidden files (files that are prefixed with . or _) are in the path can
            lead to unexpected query failures. For
            example:AnalysisException: INPATH contains unsupported LOAD format, file '
s3a://dwx-testdata/impala/sql_test/tests/load_data_inpath/runtime_data/0690a6fa9bfb11ed920c164053429bec/load_data_test/A/impala_data/impala_alltypessmall_data/alltypessmall_parquet_iceberg/year=2009/month=1/.hiddenfileforloaddatatest
' has 'This' magic string.


Hive can crash due to the default setting of a caching property 
Background: The relatively new hive.fetch.task.caching property
            was designed to prevent files from being cleaned up prematurely during the fetch phase.
            By default, hive.fetch.task.caching is enabled for queries that have
            been converted by the hive.fetch.task.conversion optimization.
Problem: The resulting caching activity can use too much heap while running
            queries that execute fetch tasks with a cache size of 1GB. Frequent garbage collection
            and high CPU usage can occur, causing Hue and other clients to timeout when returning
            results.
Workaround: Try setting hive.fetch.task.caching to false to
            disable the optimization. This action might cause queries to fail due to timing if the
            table is modified concurrent with the fetching. If problems continue, or cannot tolerate
            the low risk of a query failure, set hive.fetch.task.conversion to
            none. In this release, hive.fetch.task.conversion=none might add a
            little latency to some SELECT queries.


DWX-14409 Starting a Virtual Warehouse in an AWS environments in the Asia-Pacific Southeast region fails
When you upgrade the Virtual Warehouse in this release and start it, a timing issue causes failure.
Workaround: Continue using the previous release 1.5.1-b110 (released Nov 22,
            2022). Do not upgrade to 1.6.1-b282 (released Feb 7, 2023). Delay upgrading your Virtual
            Warehouse until the next release of CDW.


DWX-14376 Upgrade Database Catalog button issue
A UI issue exists when you to upgrade the latest Virtual Warehouse 1.6.1-b258 (released
            Feb 7, 2023) and you are already running the latest release. The Upgrade
              Database Catalog button is not working when you attempt this futile
            Virtual Warehouse upgrade.




Carried over from the previous release: General

DWX-13103 Cloudera Data Warehouse environment activation problem
When CDW environments are
      activated, a race condition can occur between the prometheus pod and istiod pod. The
      prometheus pod can be set up without an istio-proxy container, causing communication failures
      to/from prometheus to any other pods in the Kubernetes cluster. Data Warehouse
      prometheus-related functionalities, such as autoscaling, stop working. Grafana dashboards,
      which get metrics from prometheus, are not populated. 
Workaround: Restart the prometheus pod so that it gets the istio-proxy container.


DWX-6619 Browser auto-close not working on some browsers after token-Based authentication
      for accessing CDW 
 The Firefox and Edge browser window does not close automatically after successful
      authentication. 
DWX-9774 Database Catalog or Virtual Warehouse image version problem
Background: In Cloudera Data Warehouse 2021.0.3-b27 - 2021.0.5-b36, you can choose
      any supported image version when you create a Database Catalog or Virtual Warehouse, assuming
      you have the CDW_VERSIONED_DEPLOY entitlement.
Problem: In Cloudera Data Warehouse 2021.0.6-b96, you can choose an image version
      other than 2021.0.6-b96 when you create a Database Catalog or Virtual Warehouse only if you
      use an existing environment. An existing environment is one you created in 2021.0.3-b27 -
      2021.0.5-b36. 
Workaround:  In 2021.0.6-b96, use an environment you created before this release to
      choose an image version other than 2021.0.6-b96 when you create a Database Catalog or Virtual
      Warehouse.
DWX-5841: Virtual Warehouse endpoints are now restricted to TLS 1.2
Problem: TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer considered secure, so now Virtual Warehouse
      endpoints must be secured with TLS 1.2 or later, and then the environment that the Virtual
      Warehouse uses must be reactivated in CDW. This includes both Hive and Impala Virtual
      Warehouses. To reactivate the environment in the CDW UI: 
Deactivate the environment. See Deactivating AWS environments or Deactivating Azure environments.
Activate the environment. See Activating AWS environments or Activating Azure environments


Workaround: If environment reactivation is not possible, you can perform manual
      steps using the kubectl command line tool to pick up the TLS 1.2 endpoint
      change. Open a terminal window on a system where the kubectl command line
      tool is installed, log in, and run the following commands:
      kubectl edit svc nginx-service -n <cluster-name>
       
       # Add the following under the metadata.annotations field
       service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-negotiation-policy: "ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01"
       
       # Save and quit the editor, and then run the following command to check your changes.
       
       kubectl get svc nginx-service -n <cluster-name> -o yaml
       
       # Make sure that the annotation you added is present.

DWX-5742: Upgrading multiple Hive and Impala Virtual Warehouses or Database Catalogs at the
      same time fails
Problem: Upgrading multiple Hive and Impala Virtual Warehouses or Database Catalogs
      at the same time fails.
Workaround: If you need to upgrade or create multiple Hive and Impala Virtual
      Warehouses or Database Catalogs, perform the upgrade or creation sequentially one at a
      time.


Carried over from the previous release: AWS

Workloads from CDW versions 1.4.2 and earlier cannot be deployed on new AWS
            environments
You must upgrade the version of Kubernetes that supports your existing CDW clusters
              to EKS version 1.21. AWS environments you activate using this release of Cloudera Data
              Warehouse, and later, will use version 1.22. Because new environments are
            provisioned automatically to use AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) 1.22, deprecated
            APIs used in workloads of versions 1.4.2-b118 (released August 4, 2022) and earlier are
            not supported in this version 1.5.1-b110 (released November 22, 2022). This issue
            affects you only if you have the CDW_VERSIONED_DEPLOY entitlement.
Workaround: Create new workloads or use workloads from the previous release CDW
            1.4.3--b225 (released September 15, 2022). Workloads from CDW 1.4.2-b118 (released
            August 4, 2022) and earlier in Database Catalogs, Hive, Impala, Hue, Data Visualization,
            and are incompatible with EKS 1.22.


AWS availability zone inventory issue
In this release, you can select a preferred availability zone when you create a Virtual
      Warehouse; however, AWS might not be able to provide enough compute instances of the type that
      Cloudera Data Warehouse needs.
Workaround: If you experience this AWS issue, try recreating the Virtual Warehouse
      and choosing a different availability zone.
DWX-7613: CloudFormation stack creation using AWS CLI broken for CDW Reduced Permissions
      Mode
Problem: If you use the AWS CLI to create a CloudFormation stack to activate an AWS
      environment for use in Reduced Permissions Mode, it fails and returns the following error:
      An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateStack
       operation: Parameters: [SdxDDBTableName] must have values
      The default value of SdxDDBTableName is not being set. If you create the CloudFormation stack
      using the AWS Console, there is no problem. 
Workaround: If you must use the AWS CLI, edit the CloudFormation stack template file
      as follows:
      SdxDDBTableName:
       Description: DynamoDB table name for the SDX S3 file listings, created through S3Guard
       Type: String
       Default: " "
      Then rerun the CloudFormation stack creation command using the AWS CLI. 
ENGESC-8271: Helm 2 to Helm 3 migration fails on AWS environments where the overlay network
      feature is in use and namespaces are stuck in a terminating state
Problem: While using the overlay network feature for AWS environments and after
      attempting to migrate an AWS environment from Helm 2 to Helm 3, the migration process
      fails.
Workaround: Run the following kubectl command to determine whether
      you have any namespaces stuck in a terminating state: kubectl get ns
      Then contact Cloudera Technical Support to report and get help on this issue. 
DWX-6970: Tags do not get applied in existing CDW environments
Problem: You may see the following error while trying to apply tags to Virtual
      Warehouses in an existing CDW environment: An error occurred (UnauthorizedOperation)
       when calling the CreateTags operation: You are not authorized to perform this
       operation and Compute node tagging was unsuccessful. This happens
      because the ec2:CreateTags privilege is missing from your AWS
      cluster-autoscaler inline policy for the NodeInstanceRole role.
Workaround: Add the ec2:CreateTags privilege to the
      cluster-autoscaler inline policy as follows:
Log into the AWS IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
In the navigation panel, choose Roles.
Search the list of roles for NodeInstanceRole.
Click Permissions.
Select cluster-autoscaler and click Edit
         policy.
Add the ec2:CreateTags line in the
         Actions
        section after the ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions line as shown:
"Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
          {
          "Action": [
          "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups",
          "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingInstances",
          "autoscaling:DescribeTags",
          "autoscaling:DescribeLaunchConfigurations",
          "autoscaling:SetDesiredCapacity",
          "autoscaling:TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup",
          "ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions",
          "ec2:CreateTags"
          ],

Save changes.



Carried over from the previous release: Azure

Workloads from earlier CDW versions cannot be deployed on new Azure environments
Because new environments are provisioned automatically to use Azure Kubernetes Service
            (AKS) 1.22, deprecated APIs used in workloads of earlier versions are not supported in
            this version 2022.0.9.0-120 (released August 4, 2022). This issue affects you only if
            you have the CDW_VERSIONED_DEPLOY entitlement.
Workaround: Create new workloads. Workloads in Database Catalogs, Hive, Impala, Hue,
            Data Visualization, and are incompatible with AKS 1.22.


Incorrect diagnostic bundle location
Problem:The path you see to the diagnostic bundle is wrong when you create a
            Virtual Warehouse, collect a diagnostic bundle of log files for troubleshooting, and
            click 
Edit > Diagnostic Bundle. Your storage account name is missing from the beginning of the
            path.
Workaround:To find your diagnostic bundle, add your storage account name to the
            beginning of the path, for example:
            my-storage-account-name/log-files/clusters/my-env/my-warehouse-xx-yy/warehouse/debug-artifacts/hive/compute-zz-mvvf/compute-zz-mvvf-0926210111-0927090111-01234.zipTo
            get your storage account name, in Cloudera Management Console, click Environments,
            select your environment, and scroll down to Logs Storage and Audits. The first part of
            the path is your storage account name. 


Changed environment credentials not propagated to AKS

Problem: When you change the credentials of a running cloud environment using
              the Management Console, the changes are not automatically propagated to the
              corresponding active Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) environment. As a result, the Azure
              Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses old credentials and may not function as expected
              resulting in inaccessible Hive or Impala Virtual Warehouses.
Workaround: To resolve this issue, you must manually synchronize the changes
              with the CDW AKS resources. To synchronize the updated credentials, see Update AKS cluster with new service principal
                credentials in the Azure product documentation.



Carried over from the previous release: Database Catalog

Non-default Database Catalogs created with several earlier CDW versions fails
This issue affects you only if you meet the following conditions:
You have a versioned CDW deployment and the multi default DBC entitlement.
You are using this release of CDW version 2022.0.9.0-120 (released August 4, 2022).
You added Database Catalogs (not the automatically generated default Database Catalog)
        using either one of these CDW versions:
2022.0.8.0-89 (released June, 22, 2022)
2022-0.7.1-2 (released May 10, 2022)

Do not attempt to upgrade the Database Catalog you created with these earlier
       releases. The Database Catalog will fail. Your existing Database Catalog created with the
       earlier release works fine with CDW Runtime. Recreating your existing Database Catalog
       updates CDW Runtime for 2022.0.9.0-120 (released August 4, 2022). 


DWX-7349: In reduced permissions mode, default Database Catalog name does not include the
      environment name
Problem:
When you activate an AWS environment in reduced permissions mode, the default Database
       Catalog name does not include the environment name:



This does not cause collisions because each Database Catalog named "default" is associated
       with a different environment. For more information about reduced permissions mode, see Reduced permissions mode for AWS environments.

Workaround: None available.
DWX-6167: Maximum connections reached when creating multiple Database Catalogs
Problem:After creating 17 Database Catalogs on one AWS environment, Virtual
      Warehouses failed to start.
Workaround: Limit the number of Database Catalogs created on one environment to 5.
      This applies to both AWS and Azure environments.


Carried over from the previous release: Hive Virtual Warehouse

DWX-13347 Diagnostic bundle download fails
After upgrading to version 1.4.3 (released September 15, 2022), downloading the diagnostic
      bundle for the Hive Virtual Warehouse results in an error. New environments do not have this
      problem. The problem is caused by missing permissions to access Kubernetes resources. Version
      1.4.3 adds a requirement for the role-based access control (rbac) permissions to download the
      diagnostic bundle.
Workaround: Add the missing rbac permissions as follows: 1) Create the following file:
       apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
       kind: ClusterRole
       metadata:
       name: diagnostic-data-generator-role-monitor
       rules:
       - apiGroups:
       - ""
       resources:
       - configmaps
       - events
       - pods
       - persistentvolumeclaims
       - nodes
       verbs:
       - get
       - list
       - apiGroups:
       - apps
       resources:
       - deployments
       - statefulsets
       verbs:
       - get
       - list
       - apiGroups:
       - "edws.cloudera.com"
       resources:
       - computes
       verbs:
       - get
       - list2)
       Run the following command to apply the
       permissions:kubectl apply -f <filename>



CDPD-40730 Parquet change can cause incompatibility
Parquet files written by the parquet-mr library in this version of CDW, where the schema
      contains a timestamp with no UTC conversion will not be compatible with older versions of
      Parquet readers. The effect is that the older versions will still consider these timestamps as
      they would require UTC conversions and will thus end up with a wrong result. You can encounter
      this problem only when you write Parquet-based tables using Hive, and tables have the
      non-default configuration hive.parquet.write.int64.timestamp=true.


DWX-10271: Missing log section in Hive query results
In a Hive Virtual Warehouse, when you run a query in Hue, the query results do not contain
      a logs section.
DWX-8118: INSERT INTO command fails under certain circumstances
This problem affects users who have a PostgreSQL database as the backend Hive database. If
      you create a table A and create a table B as select (CTAS) from an empty table A, inserting
      values into table B fails as follows:
      Error while compiling statement: FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from 
       org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.StatsTask.org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException
Workaround: Disable auto-stats gathering: Go to Cloudera Manager Data Warehouse > Virtual Warehouses, and click the Hive VW name in the list. In Configuration > HiveServer2, set hive.cbo.enable to false. 
DWX-5841: Virtual Warehouse endpoints are now restricted to TLS 1.2
Problem: TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer considered secure, so now Virtual Warehouse
      endpoints must be secured with TLS 1.2 or later, and then the environment that the Virtual
      Warehouse uses must be reactivated in CDW. This includes both Hive and Impala Virtual
      Warehouses. To reactivate the environment in the CDW UI: 
Deactivate the environment. See Deactivating AWS environments or Deactivating Azure environments.
Activate the environment. See Activating AWS environments or Activating Azure environments


Workaround: If environment reactivation is not possible, you can perform manual
      steps using the kubectl command line tool to pick up the TLS 1.2 endpoint
      change. Open a terminal window on a system where the kubectl command line
      tool is installed, log in, and run the following commands:
      kubectl edit svc nginx-service -n <cluster-name>
       
       # Add the following under the metadata.annotations field
       service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-negotiation-policy: "ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01"
       
       # Save and quit the editor, and then run the following command to check your changes.
       
       kubectl get svc nginx-service -n <cluster-name> -o yaml
       
       # Make sure that the annotation you added is present.

DWX-5926: Cloning an existing Hive Virtual Warehouse fails
Problem: If you have an existing Hive Virtual Warehouse that you clone by selecting
       Clone from the drop-down menu, the cloning process fails. This does
      not apply to creating a new Hive Virtual Warehouse.
Workaround: Make the following configuration change to resolve this issue: 
In the Hive Virtual Warehouse tile, click the edit icon. This launches the Virtual
        Warehouse details page.
In the details page for the Virtual Warehouse, click the
         Configurations tab.
Click the Hiveserver2 sub-tab.
Select hive-site from the configuration file drop-down list
        menu.
Search for the configuration property hive.metastore.sasl.enabled.
Set the hive.metastore.sasl.enabled configuration property to
         true. noteIf the hive.metastore.sasl.enabled
         configuration property is already set to true, delete the setting and
         re-enter it.
 Click Apply in the upper right corner of the page to save the
        configuration. 
Click the Actions menu and select Clone to
        clone the Hive Virtual Warehouse: 



DWX-2690: Older versions of Beeline return SSLPeerUnverifiedException when submitting a
      query

Problem: When submitting queries to Virtual Warehouses that use Hive, older Beeline
       clients return an SSLPeerUnverifiedException error:
javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: Host name ‘ec2-18-219-32-183.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com’ does not
       match the certificate subject provided by the peer (CN=*.env-c25dsw.dwx.cloudera.site) (state=08S01,code=0)


Workaround: Only use Beeline clients from CDP Runtime version 7.0.1.0 or later.



Carried over from the previous release: Hue Query Editor

IMPALA-11447 Selecting certain complex types in Hue crashes Impala
Queries that have structs/arrays in the select list crash Impala if initiated by Hue.
Workaround: Do not select structs/arrays in Hue.
DWX-8460: Unable to delete, move, or rename directories within the S3 bucket from Hue
Problem: You may not be able to rename, move, or delete directories within your S3
      bucket from the Hue web interface. This is because of an underlying issue, which will be fixed
      in a future release.
Workaround: You can move, rename, or delete a directory using the HDFS commands as
       follows:
SSH into your CDP environment host.
To delete a directory within your S3 bucket, run the following
        command:hdfs dfs -rm -r [***COMPLETE-PATH-TO-S3-BUCKET***]/[***DIRECTORY-NAME***]
To rename a folder, create a new directory and run the following command to move files
        from the source directory to the target
        directory:hdfs dfs -mkdir [***DIRECTORY-NAME***]hdfs dfs -mv [***COMPLETE-PATH-TO-S3-BUCKET***]/[***SOURCE-DIRECTORY***] [***COMPLETE-PATH-TO-S3-BUCKET***]/[***TARGET-DIRECTORY***]



DWX-6674: Hue connection fails on cloned Impala Virtual Warehouses after upgrading
Problem: If you clone an Impala Virtual Warehouse from a recently upgraded Impala
      Virtual Warehouse, and then try to connect to Hue, the connection fails.
Workaround: Create a new Impala Virtual Warehouse and do not clone from a recently
      upgraded warehouse. Then the connection to Hue from the new Impala Virtual Warehouse
      succeeds.
DWX-5650: Hue only makes the first user a superuser for all Virtual Warehouses within a
      Data Catalog
Problem: Hue marks the user that logs in to Hue from a Virtual Warehouse for the
      first time as the Hue superuser. But if multiple Virtual Warehouses are connected to a single
      Data Catalog, then the first user that logs in to any one of the Virtual Warehouses within
      that Data Catalog is the Hue superuser.For example, consider that a Data Catalog DC-1 has
       two Virtual Warehouses VW-1 and VW-2. If a user named John logs in to Hue from VW-1 first,
       then he becomes the Hue superuser for all the Virtual Warehouses within DC-1. At this time,
       if Amy logs in to Hue from VW-2, Hue does not make her a superuser within VW-2. 
None.


Iceberg

DEX-7946 Data loss during migration of a Hive table to Iceberg
In this release, by default the table property 'external.table.purge' is set to true,
            which deletes the table data and metadata is you drop the table during migration from
            Hive to Iceberg.
Workarounds: Either one of the following workarounds prevents data loss during table
            migration: 
Set the table property 'external.table.purge'='FALSE'.
Do not drop a table during migration from Hive to Iceberg.



DWX-13733 Timeout issue querying Iceberg tables from Hive
A timeout issue can cause the query to fail. 
Workaround: Add the following configuration to hadoop-core-site for the Database
            Catalog and the Virtual
            Warehouse.fs.s3.maxConnections=1000
fs.s3a.connection.maximum=1000Restart the Database Catalog and Virtual
            Warehouse.


DWX-13062 Hive-26507 Converting a Hive table having CHAR or VARCHAR columns to Iceberg
      causes an exception
CHAR and VARCHAR data can be shorter than the length specified by the data type. Remaining
      characters are padded with spaces. Data is converted to a string in Iceberg. This process can
      yield incorrect results when you query the converted Iceberg table.
Workaround: Change columns from CHAR or VARCHAR to string types before converting the Hive
      table to Iceberg.


DWX-13276 Multiple inserts into tables having different formats can cause a deadlock.
Under the following conditions, a deadlock can occur:
You run a query to insert data into multiple tables comprised of at least one Iceberg
       table and at least one non-Iceberg table.
The STAT task locking feature is turned on (default = on).

Workarounds: Perform either one of the following workarounds:
Run separate queries to insert data into only one table at a time.
Turn off STAT task locking as follows:
       set iceberg.hive.request-lock-on-stats-task=false;



Carried over from the previous release: Impala Virtual Warehouse

IMPALA-11045 Impala Virtual Warehouses might produce an error when querying transactional
      (ACID) table even after you enabled the automatic metadata refresh (version DWX
      1.1.2-b2008)
Problem: Impala doesn't open a transaction for select queries, so you might get a
      FileNotFound error after compaction even though you refreshed the metadata automatically.
Workaround: Run the INVALIDATE METADATA statement on the
      transactional (ACID) table to refresh the metadata. This fixes the problem until the next
      compaction occurs. For information about running this statement, see INVALIDATE METADATA statement.


Impala Virtual Warehouses might produce an error when querying transactional (ACID) tables
        (DWX 1.1.2-b1949 or earlier)
Problem: If you are querying transactional (ACID) tables with an Impala Virtual
      Warehouse and compaction is run on the compacting Hive Virtual Warehouse, the query might
      fail. The compacting process deletes files and the Impala Virtual Warehouse might not be aware
      of the deletion. Then when the Impala Virtual Warehouse attempts to read the deleted file, an
      error can occur. This situation occurs randomly.
Workaround: Run the INVALIDATE METADATA statement on the
      transactional (ACID) table to refresh the metadata. This fixes the problem until the next
      compaction occurs. For information about running this statement, see INVALIDATE METADATA statement.
Do not use the start/stop icons in Impala Virtual Warehouses version 7.2.2.0-106 or
      earlier
Problem: If you use the stop/start icons in Impala Virtual Warehouses version
      7.2.2.0-106 or earlier, it might render the Virtual Warehouse unusable and make it necessary
      for you to re-create it.
Workaround: Do not use the stop/start icons in these older Virtual Warehouses.
      Instead, these older versions automatically suspend and resume the Impala executors depending
      on the absence or presence of queries, making manual start or stop unnecessary.
DWX-6674: Hue connection fails on cloned Impala Virtual Warehouses after upgrading
Problem: If you clone an Impala Virtual Warehouse from a recently upgraded Impala
      Virtual Warehouse, and then try to connect to Hue, the connection fails.
Workaround: Create a new Impala Virtual Warehouse and do not clone from a recently
      upgraded warehouse. Then the connection to Hue from the new Impala Virtual Warehouse
      succeeds.
DWX-5841: Virtual Warehouse endpoints are now restricted to TLS 1.2
Problem: TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer considered secure, so now Virtual Warehouse
      endpoints must be secured with TLS 1.2 or later, and then the environment that the Virtual
      Warehouse uses must be reactivated in CDW. This includes both Hive and Impala Virtual
      Warehouses. To reactivate the environment in the CDW UI: 
Deactivate the environment. See Deactivating AWS environments or Deactivating Azure environments.
Activate the environment. See Activating AWS environments or Activating Azure environments


Workaround: If environment reactivation is not possible, you can perform manual
      steps using the kubectl command line tool to pick up the TLS 1.2 endpoint
      change. Open a terminal window on a system where the kubectl command line
      tool is installed, log in, and run the following commands:
      kubectl edit svc nginx-service -n <cluster-name>
       
       # Add the following under the metadata.annotations field
       service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-negotiation-policy: "ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01"
       
       # Save and quit the editor, and then run the following command to check your changes.
       
       kubectl get svc nginx-service -n <cluster-name> -o yaml
       
       # Make sure that the annotation you added is present.

DWX-5276: Upgrading an older version of an Impala Virtual Warehouse can result in error
      state
Problem: If you upgrade an older version of an Impala Virtual Warehouse (DWX
      1.1.1.1-4) to the latest version, the Virtual Warehouse can get into an Updating or Error
      state.
Workaround: none
DWX-3914: Collect Diagnostic Bundle option does not work on older
      environments
The Collect Diagnostic Bundle menu option in Impala Virtual
      Warehouses does not work for older environments: 



Data caching:
This feature is limited to 200 GB per executor, multiplied by the total number of
      executors.
Sessions with Impala continue to run for 15 minutes after the connection is
      disconnected.
When a connection to Impala is disconnected, the session continues to run for 15 minutes in
      case so the user or client can reconnect to the same session again by presenting the
       session_token. After 15 minutes, the client must re-authenticate to Impala
      to establish a new connection.
