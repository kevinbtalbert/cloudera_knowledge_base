Known issues in CDW running on AWS environments
Learn about the known issues in Cloudera Data Warehouse service in AWS environments,
    the impact or changes to the functionality, and workarounds.

AWS availability zone inventory issue
In this release, you can select a preferred availability zone when you create a Virtual Warehouse; however, AWS might not be able to provide enough compute instances of the type that Cloudera Data Warehouse needs.
Workaround: If you experience this AWS issue, try recreating the Virtual Warehouse and choosing a different availability zone.
DWX-8573: EKS upgrade from DWX UI to K8s v1.20 fails in reduced permissions mode
In reduced permissions mode, attempting to update Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to
            Kubernetes version 1.20 fails with an AccessDenied error.
Workaround:In AWS, add the following permissions to your reduced permissions mode JSON IAM permissions
          policy right after
          "iam:PutRolePolicy":{
 ...
                "cloudformation:GetTemplate",
                "cloudformation:GetTemplateSummary",
                "iam:GetRole",
                "eks:ListUpdates",
                "ec2:CreateLaunchTemplateVersion",
                "ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions",
                "ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplates",
                "autoscaling:UpdateAutoScalingGroup",
                "autoscaling:DeleteAutoScalingGroup",
                "ec2:RunInstances",
                "autoscaling:DescribeScalingActivities",
                "autoscaling:TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup",
                "autoscaling:DescribeScheduledActions",
                "autoscaling:SetDesiredCapacity",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "rds:DescribeDBInstances",

DWX-7613: CloudFormation stack creation using AWS CLI broken for CDW Reduced Permissions
          Mode
Problem: If you use the AWS CLI to create a CloudFormation stack to activate an
          AWS environment for use in Reduced Permissions Mode, it fails and returns the following
          error:
        An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateStack
 operation: Parameters: [SdxDDBTableName] must have values
          The default value of SdxDDBTableName is not being set.
          If you create the CloudFormation stack using the AWS Console, there is no problem.
        
Workaround: If you must use the AWS CLI, edit the CloudFormation stack template
          file as follows:
        SdxDDBTableName:
    Description: DynamoDB table name for the SDX S3 file listings, created through S3Guard
    Type: String
    Default: " "
          Then rerun the CloudFormation stack creation command using the AWS CLI.
        
ENGESC-8271: Helm 2 to Helm 3 migration fails on AWS environments where the overlay
          network feature is in use and namespaces are stuck in a terminating state
Problem: While using the overlay network feature for AWS environments and after
          attempting to migrate an AWS environment from Helm 2 to Helm 3, the migration process
          fails.
Workaround: Run the following kubectl command to determine
          whether you have any namespaces stuck in a terminating state:
        kubectl get ns
          Then contact Cloudera Technical Support to report and get help on this issue.
        
DWX-7349: In reduced permissions mode, default Database Catalog name does not include
          the environment name
Problem:
When you activate an AWS environment in reduced permissions mode, the
            default Database Catalog name does not include the environment name:



This does not cause collisions because each Database Catalog named "default" is associated
            with a different environment. For more information about reduced
            permissions mode, see Reduced permissions mode for AWS environments.

Workaround: None available.
DWX-6970: Tags do not get applied in existing CDW environments
Problem: You may see the following error while trying to apply tags to Virtual
          Warehouses in an existing CDW environment: An error occurred
            (UnauthorizedOperation) when calling the CreateTags operation: You are not authorized to
            perform this operation and Compute node tagging was
            unsuccessful. This happens because the ec2:CreateTags
          privilege is missing from your AWS cluster-autoscaler inline policy for the
            NodeInstanceRole role.
Workaround: Add the ec2:CreateTags privilege to the
          cluster-autoscaler inline policy as follows:
Log into the AWS IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
In the navigation panel, choose Roles.
Search the list of roles for NodeInstanceRole.
Click Permissions.
Select cluster-autoscaler and click Edit
                policy.
Add the ec2:CreateTags line in the
                Actions
              section after the ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions line as shown:
"Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups",
                "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingInstances",
                "autoscaling:DescribeTags",
                "autoscaling:DescribeLaunchConfigurations",
                "autoscaling:SetDesiredCapacity",
                "autoscaling:TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup",
                "ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions",
                "ec2:CreateTags"
            ],
