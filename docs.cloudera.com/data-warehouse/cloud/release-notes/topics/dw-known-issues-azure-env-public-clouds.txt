Known issues in CDW running on Azure environments
Learn about the known issues in Cloudera Data Warehouse service in Azure environments,
  the impact or changes to the functionality, and the workaround.

Incorrect diagnostic bundle location
Problem:The path you see to the diagnostic bundle is wrong when you create a Virtual
     Warehouse, collect a diagnostic bundle of log files for troubleshooting, and click 
Edit > Diagnostic Bundle. Your storage account name is missing from the beginning of the path.
Workaround:To find your diagnostic bundle, add your storage account name to the
     beginning of the path, for example:
     my-storage-account-name/log-files/clusters/my-env/my-warehouse-xx-yy/warehouse/debug-artifacts/hive/compute-zz-mvvf/compute-zz-mvvf-0926210111-0927090111-01234.zipTo
     get your storage account name, in Cloudera Management Console, click Environments, select your
     environment, and scroll down to Logs Storage and Audits. The first part of the path is your
     storage account name. 


Changed environment credentials not propagated to AKS

Problem: When you change the credentials of a running cloud environment using the
      Management Console, the changes are not automatically propagated to the corresponding active
      Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) environment. As a result, the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
      uses old credentials and may not function as expected resulting in inaccessible Hive or Impala
      Virtual Warehouses.
Workaround: To resolve this issue, you must manually synchronize the changes with the
      CDW AKS resources. To synchronize the updated credentials, see Update AKS cluster with new service principal
       credentials in the Azure product documentation.
