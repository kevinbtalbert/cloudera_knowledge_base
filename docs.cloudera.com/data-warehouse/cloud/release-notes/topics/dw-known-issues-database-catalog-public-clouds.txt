DWX-7349: In reduced permissions mode, default Database Catalog name do not include the
             environment name
Problem:
When you activate an AWS environment in reduced permissions mode, the
               default Database Catalog name does not include the environment name:



This does not cause collisions because each Database Catalog named "default" is associated
               with a different environment. For more information about reduced
               permissions mode, see Reduced permissions mode for AWS environments.

Workaround: None available.
DWX-6167: Maximum connections reached when creating multiple Database Catalogs
Problem:After creating 17 Database Catalogs on one AWS environment, Virtual
             Warehouses failed to start.
Workaround: Limit the number of Database Catalogs created on one environment
             to 5. This applies to both AWS and Azure environments.
