DWX-8460: Unable to delete, move, or rename directories within the S3 bucket from
          Hue
Problem: You may not be able to rename, move, or delete directories within your
          S3 bucket from the Hue web interface. This is because of an underlying issue, which will
          be fixed in a future release.
Workaround: You can move, rename, or delete a directory using the HDFS commands
          as follows:
SSH into your CDP environment host.
To delete a directory within your S3 bucket, run the following
              command:hdfs dfs -rm -r [***COMPLETE-PATH-TO-S3-BUCKET***]/[***DIRECTORY-NAME***]
To rename a folder, create a new directory and run the following command to move
              files from the source directory to the target
              directory:hdfs dfs -mkdir [***DIRECTORY-NAME***]hdfs dfs -mv [***COMPLETE-PATH-TO-S3-BUCKET***]/[***SOURCE-DIRECTORY***] [***COMPLETE-PATH-TO-S3-BUCKET***]/[***TARGET-DIRECTORY***]



DWX-6674: Hue connection fails on cloned Impala Virtual Warehouses after upgrading
Problem: If you clone an Impala Virtual Warehouse from a
          recently upgraded Impala Virtual Warehouse, and then try to connect to Hue, the connection
          fails.
Workaround: Create a new Impala Virtual Warehouse and do not clone from a recently
        upgraded warehouse. Then the connection to Hue from the new Impala Virtual Warehouse
        succeeds.
DWX-5650: Hue only makes the first user a superuser for all Virtual Warehouses within a
     Data Catalog
Problem: Hue marks the user that logs in to Hue from a Virtual
          Warehouse for the first time as the Hue superuser. But if multiple Virtual Warehouses are
          connected to a single Data Catalog, then the first user that logs in to any one of the
          Virtual Warehouses within that Data Catalog is the Hue superuser.For example, consider
            that a Data Catalog DC-1 has two Virtual Warehouses VW-1 and VW-2. If a user named John
            logs in to Hue from VW-1 first, then he becomes the Hue superuser for all the Virtual
            Warehouses within DC-1. At this time, if Amy logs in to Hue from VW-2, Hue does not make
            her a superuser within VW-2. 
None.
