This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse service on CDP Public Cloud introduces the following new features and
    improvements:
Hue single-sign-on (SSO) support using SAML
In this release, Hue now supports SSO by using SAML. For more information, see Authenticating users with SAML in the Hue documentation.

Private networking feature now available for AWS environments when only private subnets
       are available
When you are unable to use public subnets in your AWS VPC, CDP Data Warehouse service now
       supports private networking for your Data Warehouse in this situation. To configure
       private networking for AWS environments where only private subnets are available to use, register a CDP
       environment in AWS with three private subnets. Then network administrators must make sure
       there is outbound internet access from private subnets by way of the transit gateway or by
       another means. For information about configuring private networking with these AWS
       environments, see Step 4 in Activating an AWS environment with private subnet
         support.
