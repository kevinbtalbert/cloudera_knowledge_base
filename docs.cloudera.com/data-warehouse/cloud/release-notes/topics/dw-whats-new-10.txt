This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud introduces the new features and
    improvements that are described in this topic.
Stability and performance improvements
This release includes numerous stability and performance improvements, improvements to
        health checks, plus multiple bug fixes.

Ability to configure custom Hue properties
You can configure custom Hue properties that are not directly exposed through the CDW web
        UI by specifying them in a Hue configuration called hue-safety-valve for a Virtual
        Warehouse. For more details, see Configuring custom properties using safety
        valves.

Health check for the Hue load balancer
Unlike earlier, if the Hue server starts and the Hue load balancer has not started yet, Hue
        does not display an error message when you try to access the Hue endpoint (or the web UI).
        This is because Hue now checks the health of the load balancer as well as the Hue server
        before loading the Hue user interface.
