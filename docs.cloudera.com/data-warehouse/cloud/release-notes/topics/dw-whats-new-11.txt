This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud introduces the new features and
    improvements that are described in this topic.
Overlay networks now available for Azure environments
An overlay network is a software-defined layer of network abstraction that is used to run
       multiple separate, discrete virtualized network layers over the Azure virtual network. You
       use overlay networks to increase the number of IP addresses available to support nodes in
       your CDW cluster on Azure. For more information about using this feature in Azure
       environments and how to enable it, see Overlay networks for Azure environments.
