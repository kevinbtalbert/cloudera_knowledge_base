This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud
    introduces the new features and improvements that are described in this topic.
Use Data Visualization with Virtual Warehouses
You can now use CDP Data Visualization, a tool that enables you to explore data by using
        visual objects, with CDW Virtual Warehouses. 

Start and stop Impala Virtual Warehouses
In this release, you can now explicitly start and stop Impala Virtual Warehouses by clicking
     the start or stop icon in the upper right corner of the Virtual Warehouse tile.
     In the Virtual Warehouse details page, you can use this feature by clicking
     the Suspend or Start options
       in the Actions menu. Use this feature to better control costs and resource
       usage in your cloud environment.
noteThis feature is only available on newly created Impala Virtual Warehouses.

Azure environments: Use DAS and Hue to create new custom functions
HiveServer2 localizes and packages the User-Defined Functions (UDF) jar files into
       Azure Blob storage. You can use DAS and Hue to create new custom functions using the
       external jar file. To create user-defined functions, see Using functions in the Hive
       documentation.
