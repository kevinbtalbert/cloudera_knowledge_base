This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud
    introduces the following new features and behavioral changes.
Reduced permissions mode for AWS environments
This feature enables you to activate an AWS environment for CDW with fewer than half of the
      standard required IAM permissions on your AWS cross-account IAM role. This is useful if your
      InfoSec policies do not permit you to use the standard set of required permissions.
When activating an AWS environment in CDW, if the system detects that your account does not
       have the standard set of required IAM permissions, it invokes this feature automatically.
       Then you must manually create the cloud resources in your AWS account and tag them
       appropriately instead of having CDW do this for you. To assist you, CDW pre-populates the
       required CloudFormation template for you within the AWS Console, but you must perform the
       manual steps to create the stack. When you are finished using the stack, you must manually
       delete it in the AWS Console. For more information about this feature, see Reduced permissions mode for AWS environments.
