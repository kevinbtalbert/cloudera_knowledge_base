This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud
    introduces the new features and improvements that are described in this topic.
Support for custom tags on AWS and Azure environments
You can specify tenant-level custom tags to identify and monitor resources within the CDW
        service for AWS and Azure environments at the time of environment creation. See Custom tags in Azure environments for the list of
        resources that you can tag in Azure environments. If you are using AWS, you can also tag
        Virtual Warehouses using custom Virtual Warehouse-level tags. For a complete list of
        resources that you can tag in AWS environments, see Custom tags in AWS environments.
For information on applying custom tags, see Defining custom tags in the Management Console
        documentation.
