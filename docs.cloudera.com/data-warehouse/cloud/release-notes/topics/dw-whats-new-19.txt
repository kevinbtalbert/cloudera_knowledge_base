This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud
    introduces the new features and improvements that are described in this topic.
Non-transparent proxy support for AWS environments
CDW Public Cloud now supports AWS environments that use non-transparent proxies.
      Using non-transparent proxies permits you to pass connection or security
      information along with the connection request that is sent by clients.
      Some organizations' security policies require the use of non-transparent
      proxies and now CDW can support that requirement. For more information about this feature, see
      Use a non-transparent proxy with CDW.
