This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud
    introduces the improvements that are described in this topic.
Ability to use the internal load balancer with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
You can enable an internal (private) load balancer to distribute traffic within your
        virtual network (VNET). An internal load balancer makes a Kubernetes service accessible only
        to applications running in the same or peered Azure VNET as the Kubernetes cluster, or
        applications running in on-premises networks that are connected using Azure ExpressRoute
        circuits. For more information, see Enabling internal load balancer for AKS
        clusters.

Behavioral changes

CDPD-24214: Virtual Warehouse compaction issues resolved
Description: The compaction processes, which are performed by Hive Virtual
           Warehouses, were failing to clean up directories, which caused query performance issues.
Resolution: A fix has been added from Apache HIVE-24900, which resolves this issue.
