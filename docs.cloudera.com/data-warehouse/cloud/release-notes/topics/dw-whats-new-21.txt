This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud
    introduces the improvements that are described in this topic.
Virtual Warehouse improvement

Ability to launch and use the Hue app while the Virtual Warehouse is starting up
When you restart a Virtual Warehouse, it takes a few minutes to start and change to
            the "Running' state. In the older CDW version, you had to wait to launch the Hue app
            until the Virtual Warehouse is up and running. Now you can open Hue and run queries even
            when it is in the "Starting" state.
