This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud
    introduces these changes.
S3 Guard disabled for custom Database Catalogs and default Database Catalogs on AWS
      environments
During new AWS environment activation in CDW:
          
If you have not specified a DynamoDB table name
              during environment registration in Management Console, the S3
              Guard feature is disabled for all Database Catalogs and Virtual
              Warehouses.
If you have specified a DynamoDB table name during environment registration
              in Management Console, the S3 Guard feature is enabled for default Database Catalogs
              and Virtual Warehouses. However, it is disabled for non-default (custom) Database
              Catalogs.

          For all environments that were activated before the June 1, 2021 release, S3 Guard is
          enabled.
