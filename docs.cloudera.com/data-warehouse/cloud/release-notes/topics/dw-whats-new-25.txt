This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud
    introduces these changes.
S3 buckets created by CDW on AWS environments are now encrypted by default with SSE
When you use the latest cross-account role from Management Console to register an
            environment, S3 buckets created by CDW during AWS environment activation, are now
            encrypted by default with SSE-S3. This provides server-side object encryption (SSE),
            which protects data at rest. Before this enhancement, S3 buckets were created with only
            object-level encryption for every object in the bucket during environment activation. 
importantThis only applies to S3 buckets created for managed tables and for
           external tables, which are actually created by CDW during environment activation. You
           must ensure that S3 buckets you add to CDW after environment activation are encrypted to
           meet your organization's security requirements.

Impala Virtual Warehouses can now be recovered after going into an error state
Impala resources are not deleted when the Virtual Warehouse goes into an
       error state. Consequently, if an Impala Virtual Warehouse goes into an
       error state, you can now use the Edit option to
       recover the Virtual Warehouse with its original configurations.

Impala Virtual Warehouses now use node memory more efficiently
Impala coordinators now can use ~13GiB more of available memory on a node to better support
       concurrent query execution.
