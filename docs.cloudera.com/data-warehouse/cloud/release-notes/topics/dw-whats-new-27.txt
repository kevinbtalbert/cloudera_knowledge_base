    introduces these changes.
Auto-shutdown of Impala coordinators for cost saving
When
        you create a Virtual Warehouse, you can configure Impala coordinators to automatically
        shutdown during idle periods. You can also set a delay before the coordinator shuts down.
        For more information, see Configuring Impala coordinator shutdown.
