This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud introduces
  these changes.
Prevention of ineffective scaling in Impala Warehouses
CDW takes advantage of IMPALA-10244 to detect the case of queries being queued because of a
    resource bottleneck on the Impala Coordinator. In this case, adding more executor groups does
    not result in the ability to run more queries, and so, the warehouse does not scale up.
