This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud introduces
  these changes.
Retaining PostgreSQL backups in the cluster
When you create a Cloudera Data Warehouse cluster using the CDP CLI create-cluster command,
    any PostgreSQL backup retention period you set on your Cloud provider side, is observed by CDP.
    For example, if you configure backupRetentionDays in Azure or BackupRetentionPeriod in AWS, and then create a cluster
    using the CDP CLI, the cluster will retain the PostgreSQL backups according to your
    configuration.

AWS EKS Kubernetes version upgrade
AWS environments that you activate using this release of Cloudera Data Warehouse, and later,
    will use version Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) version 1.20.
