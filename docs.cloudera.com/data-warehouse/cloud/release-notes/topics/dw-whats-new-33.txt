This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud introduces
  these changes.
CDW upgrade of embedded Log4j version
Cloudera has released a new version of CDW which upgrades the embedded Log4j version to 2.16. This provides a permanent fix for CVE-2021-44228.
 
To use this version you must upgrade your Database Catalog(s) and Virtual Warehouse(s) to the
        latest version, which is 2021.0.4.1-3. Additionally, you can create new Virtual Warehouses
        using the latest version, and those will also have the fix for this vulnerability.
If you had previously applied the configurations shared in CVE-2021-44228 remediation for CDW, then those are
    no longer required. Please reach out to Cloudera Support if you have questions.
