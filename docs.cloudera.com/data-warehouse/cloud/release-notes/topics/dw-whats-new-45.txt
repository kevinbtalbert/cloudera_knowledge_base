This release of the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service on CDP Public Cloud introduces
  these changes. 
Azure AKS 1.26 upgrade
The new kubernetes version 1.26 has breaking changes; thus, starting earlier workload (Impala,
    Hive, Hue) versions is not supported, and this option is now disabled. In this release
    1.6.4-b161 (released May 30, 2023), when you activate an environment, CDW automatically
    provisions Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) 1.26. To upgrade to AKS 1.26 from 1.6.3 or earlier,
    you must backup and restore CDW. To avoid compatibility issues
    between CDW and AKS, upgrade to version 1.26.
Using the Azure CLI or Azure portal to upgrade the AKS cluster is not
     supported. Doing so can cause the cluster to become unusable and can cause downtime. For
    more information about upgrading, see Upgrading an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster for
    CDW.

Azure AKS managed identity now mandatory
You must now specify a user-assigned, managed identity for the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
    cluster when you activate the Azure environment from the CDP CLI in
    1.6.4-b161 (released May 30, 2023). In 1.6.3 (released May 5, 2023), specifying the managed
    identity is also mandatory when you activate the Azure environment from the UI. A managed
    identity is required because AKS does not support certificate authentication for service
    principals. The cluster creation operation will fail if the userAssignedManagedIdentity is not
    set to your managed identity.

New Backup/Restore CDP CLI commands
The following CDP CLI 0.9.87, including Beta DW CLI commands are available and support backing
    up and restoring CDW:
dw backup-cluster
dw restore-cluster
