Configuring AutoSuspend
 You need to enable or disable AutoSuspend to handle resources when the auto-scaler
        has scaled back to the last executor group. You can control the time that the original
        warehouse executor group idles after all other groups scale down and release their
        executors. The JDBC endpoint lives on to respond to queries from the result cache or
        statistics, but expensive executors no longer run.

When the auto-scaler increases or decreases the number of executor groups in the
                Virtual Warehouse, it can take several minutes before the scaling up or down takes
                effect. This slight delay is caused by the time required by your cloud provider to
                provision clusters. 
When no queries are sent to an executor group, resources scale down and executors are
                released. When all executor groups are scaled back, when executors are idle, and
                after a period of idle time (AutoSuspend Timeout), the Virtual Warehouse is
                suspended. 
You set an AutoSuspend Timeout to configure how long a Virtual Warehouse idles before
                shutting down. 
AutoSuspend Timeout is independent of the auto-scaling process and only applies to
                the original Virtual Warehouse and not to any additional warehouses that are created
                as a result of auto-scaling. 
If a query is executed on a suspended Virtual Warehouse, then the query coordinator
                queues the query. When a queued query is detected, an executor group is immediately
                added to run the query on the Virtual Warehouse. 
This feature can help lower cloud costs.
In Cloudera Data Warehouse, you added a Hive Virtual Warehouse, and configured the
            size of the Hive Virtual Warehouse. You see Disable Auto-Suspend.

Enable AutoSuspend.






Set AutoSuspend Timeout to the number of seconds you want the Virtual Warehouse
                    to idle before shutting down.
For example, if you set the timeout to 300 seconds, the Virtual Warehouse
                    suspends itself after 300 seconds to save compute resource expense. The
                    suspended Virtual Warehouse restarts as soon as you run a query.
