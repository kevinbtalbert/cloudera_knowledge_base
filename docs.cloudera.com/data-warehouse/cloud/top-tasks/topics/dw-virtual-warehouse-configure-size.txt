How
            to size a Virtual Warehouse
When you create a Virtual Warehouse, you need to carefully set the size of your
        Virtual Warehouse. The size of the Virtual Warehouse you select during Virtual Warehouse
        creation determines the number of executors and concurrent queries the Virtual Warehouse can
        run. 
Before creating a Virtual Warehouse and setting the Virtual
            Warehouse size, learn about critical "Warehouse sizing requirements". If you
            misconfigure the size of your Virtual Warehouse, you can use one of the following
            methods, depending on the Impala or Hive type of Virtual Warehouse, to correct the
                size:
Impala: Edit your Virtual Warehouse configuration to
                        correct the size.
Hive: Delete and recreate the Virtual Warehouse to
                        correct the size.


When you create a Virtual Warehouse, you select one of the following Virtual Warehouse
            sizes:


Virtual Warehouse Size
Number of Executors



XSMALL
2


SMALL
10


MEDIUM
20


LARGE
40


Custom
Enter a value between '1' and '100'


If you are evaluating CDW, or just learning, XSMALL is the recommended size. For
            production workloads, choose a size based on the following factors: 
The number of executors you typically use for clusters in an on-premises
                    deployment. 
The complexity of your queries and the size of the data sets that they
                    access.

Large warehouses with more executors can cache more data than small warehouses. Caching
            enhances performance.
