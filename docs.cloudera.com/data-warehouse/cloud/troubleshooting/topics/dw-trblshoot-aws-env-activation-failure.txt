AWS environment fails to activate
Learn how to resolve AWS environment activation failure in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW)
 Public Cloud.
When activating an AWS environment in CDW Public Cloud, the following error message might be
      returned if your cloud resources reside in the us-east-1 region:
TemplateURL must reference a valid S3 object to which you have access.
Cause of the issue
For this region, the endpoint URL is incorrect and cannot load the CloudFormation template to create the AWS
       CloudFormation stack in your AWS account. CDW uses these stack resources for Database
       Catalogs and Virtual Warehouses in CDW.

Steps to resolve the issue
Use the reduced permissions mode feature for AWS environments to manually create the
       CloudFormation stack for CDW. This feature enables you to manually crate the CloudFormation
       stack resources from a template with a reduced set of IAM permissions. When you no longer
       need the environment, you must manually delete the CloudFormation stack resources in your AWS
     account.


Remove one of the permissions in your IAM permissions policy for the AWS account that you
       used to register the environment you want to activate for CDW. For example, remove the
           s3:CreateBucket permission from your IAM permissions policy:



Removing one of the required permissions from your IAM policy causes CDW to display the
           reduced permissions mode option in the system dialog box when you activate your
           environment in CDW.


Follow the steps in Activating AWS environments in reduced permissions
           mode.
important
In Step 4 of the Activating AWS environments in reduced permissions
           mode procedure, edit the pre-populated CloudFormation template URL as follows.
Change the URL from:
https://<bucketName>.s3-region.amazonaws.com/cf-templates/<CDW-clusterID>-cf-template.yml
To:
https://<bucketName>.s3.amazonaws.com/cf-templates/<CDW-clusterID>-cf-template.yml


After you activate the environment and create the AWS CloudFormation stack resources in
         your AWS account, make sure that you apply the required tags to the stack that are listed
         in Required tags for CloudFormation stacks created with
           reduced permissions mode.
Add the s3:CreateBucket IAM permission back to your IAM permissions
         policy to make sure you have adequate permissions so CDW can create CloudFormation stack
         resources for you when you activate environments later.


Deactivating environments created with the reduced permissions mode
When you no longer need the environment, you must manually delete the CloudFormation stack
       resources in the AWS Console by following the steps in Deactivating AWS environments created with reduced
         permissions mode.
