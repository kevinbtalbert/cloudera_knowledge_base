Opening Hue from CDW causes an error
You need to be aware of some naming limitations when you create an environment. Observe
  the character limits for the Virtual Warehouse domain name. 
Problem: After creating a Virtual Warehouse, you get an HTTP 500 error when you open
   Hue.
Probable Cause: The fully qualified domain name of your Virtual Warehouse, which
   includes the Virtual Warehouse name plus the environment name, has likely exceeded the limit: 64
   characters.
Solution: Recreate the Virtual Warehouse using a name having a length that when added to
   the length of the environment name conforms to the limit.
