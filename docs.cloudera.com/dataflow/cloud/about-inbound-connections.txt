Inbound Connections


An Inbound Connection Endpoint provides a stable hostname allowing you to stream data
from an external source application to a Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) deployment
located in the same environment.

Inbound Connection architecture

Endpoints have the following attributes:


The environment in which it exists


A stable hostname


An SSLContextService configured that can work with the TLS context auto
created during flow deployment that corresponds to the Inbound Connection
Endpoint hostname


A server certificate that corresponds to the hostname, signed by a public
root CA


A single Intermediate CA (issued by the Environment CA) for signing client
certificates for this endpoint, with the public certificate part available
to download for client truststores


Endpoints exist within the environment where they were created. They cannot be
moved between environments. If the environment is deleted, the endpoint gets
deleted as well, and cannot be reused.
An endpoint can be assigned to one flow deployment at a time, but it is possible
to reassign them.
Setting up an Inbound Connection Endpoint
To create in NiFi, deploy in CDF, and configure the client side of an Inbound Connection, follow these steps:

Inbound Connection workflow




Adding Inbound Connection support to a NiFi flow
You can enable a dataflow to listen on a public endpoint to data sources that are outside your CDP environment by adding inbound connection support to your flow definition.

Creating a Connection Endpoint
During flow deployment, you can enable an endpoint that allows NiFi to listen to external data sources.
 

Connecting to an Endpoint
Once a dataflow deployment with inbound connection is available, you can go on and connect an external application to start sending data.
