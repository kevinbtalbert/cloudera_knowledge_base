Catalog


The CDF Catalog is where your flow definitions are stored and where you manage
the CDF flow definition lifecycle from import through versioning to deletion.



Importing Flow Definitions
If you want to use a NiFi flow in Cloudera DataFlow, you must import it as a flow definition. When imported, the flow definition is added to the Flow Catalog.
 

Managing Flow Definitions
In Cloudera DataFlow, your flow definitions are available in the Flow Catalog. You can browse, discover, and manage flow definition versions in the Catalog view. You can also deploy and reuse your flow definitions across multiple environments.
