Auto-scaling flow deployments
Flow deployments can be configured to automatically scale up or down the number of NiFi
  nodes depending on the resource utilization in the cluster.
Flow deployments can be configured to automatically scale up or down the number of
   NiFi nodes depending on the resource utilization in the cluster.
With Auto-scaling, you get the following benefits:


You can choose a minimum and maximum number of nodes to ensure that the required
     resources are available while controlling cost.


Flow deployments support CPU based auto-scaling as well as flow metrics based
     auto-scaling.


When a flow deployment scales down, the affected NiFi nodes are being offloaded
     before they are removed from the cluster to ensure that no data is lost.


After new nodes have been added to the cluster, new data is automatically
     distributed to all cluster nodes including the recently provisioned ones.



CPU based auto-scalingWhen you turn this feature on, CDF uses the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)   to increase or decrease the number of NiFi pods in a deployment based on resource   utilization.Configure CPU based auto-scalingFlow metrics based auto-scalingIn contrast to CPU based auto-scaling where scaling decisions are made based on   infrastructure utilization, flow metrics based auto-scaling uses back pressure prediction, data   queued to determine when to scale up or down.Enable Flow metrics based auto-scalingFlow metrics based scaling is an optional setting which can be enabled in addition to   CPU based auto-scaling.
