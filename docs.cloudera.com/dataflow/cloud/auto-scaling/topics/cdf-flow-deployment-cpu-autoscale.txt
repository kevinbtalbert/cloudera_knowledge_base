CPU based auto-scaling
When you turn this feature on, CDF uses the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
  to increase or decrease the number of NiFi pods in a deployment based on resource
  utilization.
HPA monitors CPU utilization across all NiFi pods of a flow deployment. When CPU utilization
   reaches 75%, a new NiFi pod gets created and is added to the NiFi cluster. HPA continues to add
   additional NiFi pods until the aggregated CPU utilization for a deployment becomes stable around
   the 75% threshold. Once the new NiFi pod has joined the NiFi cluster, it starts receiving and
   processing data. 
noteData that has already been received by the NiFi cluster and is being
   processed is not redistributed to new NiFi pods.
A similar logic is applied to automatically scale down and decrease the number of NiFi pods.
   HPA monitors CPU utilization and when it falls below 75% for five minutes it starts removing NiFi
   pods. Before the NiFi pod is terminated, CDF offloads all existing data from the NiFi pod that
   has been selected for termination. Offloading data distributes data that is currently being
   processed by the affected node to the remaining nodes in the cluster. This offloading procedure
   ensures that NiFi pods are terminated gracefully and avoids data loss.
Use cases
CPU based auto-scaling is great for data flows that require CPU intensive transformations like
    compressing or decompressing data and have to deal with bursts of data every now and then.
