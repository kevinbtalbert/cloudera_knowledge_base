Steps


Activate the Auto Scaling toggle to turn on CPU based
       auto-scaling.





Use the slider or text fields to adjust the minimum and maximum number of nodes.
       CDF automatically determines the best number of nodes within the specified boundaries.

Select Flow Metrics Scaling to enable flow metrics based
      auto-scaling for your deployment.


To configure auto-scaling using the CDP CLI, execute the cdp df
      create-deployment command with the following configuration:
cdp df create-deployment \
  --service-crn <your DFService CRN> \
  --flow-version-crn "<your flow version CRN>" \
  --deployment-name "<your flow deployment name" \
  --cfm-nifi-version <your desired NiFi version> \
  --auto-start-flow \
  --cluster-size-name <your desired NiFi Node Size> \
  --auto-scaling-enabled \
  --auto-scale-min-nodes 1 \
  --auto-scale-max-nodes 3
  --flow-metrics-scaling-enabled
