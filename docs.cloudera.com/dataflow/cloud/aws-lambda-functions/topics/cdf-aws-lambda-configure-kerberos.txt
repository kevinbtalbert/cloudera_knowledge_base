Configuring Kerberos
Depending on the dataflow that is used, you may need to enable Kerberos authentication
    in order to interact with some service(s).

To enable Kerberos, you must provide an appropriate
          krb5.conf file. This file tells the DataFlow Function where the Key
        Distribution Center (KDC) is located and the Kerberos Realm to use.
To specify this, make the krb5.conf available to DataFlow
        Functions. You can do it by using the Lambda Layer or by placing the file in an S3 bucket.
        For more information, see S3 Bucket storage.
Additionally, you must tell DataFlow Function where it can find this
          krb5.conf file. To do this, add an environment variable to your
        Lambda function. The environment variable must have the name KRB5_FILE and the value must be
        the fully qualified filename of the krb5.conf file. For example, it
        might use /opt/krb5.conf.
In order to use Keytabs in your data flow, it is also important to provide the
        necessary keytab files to the DataFlow Function. You can accomplished it by using a Lambda
        Layer or an S3 bucket. While the krb5.conf file is a system
        configuration, the keytab is not. The keytab will be configured in the data flow on a
        per-component basis. For example, one processor may use keytab nifi-keytab-1 while some
        Controller Service makes use of keytab hive-keytab-4. The location of these files may change
        from deployment to deployment. For example, for an on-premises deployment, keytabs may be
        stored in /etc/security/keytabs while in DataFlow Function, they may be
        made available in /opt.
So it is better to use Parameter Contexts to parameterize the location of the
        keytab files. This is a good practice for any file-based resource that will need to be made
        available to a deployment. In this case, because there is a parameter referencing the
        location, you need to provide DataFlow Function with a value for that parameter. For more
        information, see Parameters.
