DataFlow state


By default, if your data flow contains any stateful processors (for example,
        ListSFTP), this state will automatically be stored in a DynamoDB table called
          nifi_state. This name can be set using the DYNAMODB_STATE_TABLE
        environment variable. If state is to be stored in DynamoDB, the role executing the Lambda
        function requires permissions to create and describe tables, and permissions to put and get
        items. If the data flow contains no stateful processors, this provider is not used, and
        requires no extra permissions.
The default DynamoDB billing mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST. To change this to
        PROVISIONED, set the DYNAMODB_BILLING_MODE environment variable to
          PROVISIONED, and set the DYNAMODB_READ_CAPACITY_UNITS and
          DYNAMODB_WRITE_CAPACITY_UNITS variables accordingly. For more
        information, see Read/write capacity mode.
The DynamoDB state provider can be disabled even if your data flow contains
        stateful processors by setting the DISABLE_STATE_PROVIDER environment
        variable to true.
warningThis will cause the processor state to get lost
        between function executions.
