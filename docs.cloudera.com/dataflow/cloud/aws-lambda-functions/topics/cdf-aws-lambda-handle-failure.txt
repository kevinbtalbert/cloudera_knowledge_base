Handling failures
You can use a failure Output Port to notify the Cloud function that an invocation has
    failed.

Lambda will automatically retry the invocation, by default, twice. After that, if
        it still fails, the default option in Lambda is to simply drop the event notification. This
        could result in data loss, as it means that our Lambda function will not have a chance to
        process the data again.
Instead, you can also choose to use a "Dead-Letter Queue" for the data:

On the Function details page of the AWS Console, navigate to the Configuration > Asynchronous invocation tab.
Click Edit.You can see an option to configure
            Dead-letter queue service. Use a dead-letter queue to send discarded events to an Amazon
            SQS queue or Amazon SNS topic. Your function's execution role requires permission to
            write to the queue or topic.You can use None (the default, which drops the
            notification), or you can configure an SNS or SQS queue to use in the case
            of failure. This would give you the option to later go back and manually process the
            data or triage and analyze it to understand why processing failed.
