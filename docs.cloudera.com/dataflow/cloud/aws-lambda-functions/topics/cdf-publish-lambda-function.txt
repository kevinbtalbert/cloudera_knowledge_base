Publishing your Lambda function
When the Lambda configuration is ready, you can publish a new version of the Lambda
    function.

For more information about Lambda function versions, see the AWS documentation.



You can define the Triggers/Destinations for the newly published version of your
        Lambda function and everything will be ready to process the events.
