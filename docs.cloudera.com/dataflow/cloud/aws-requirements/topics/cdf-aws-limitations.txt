Limitations on AWS
Review the default AWS service limits and your current AWS account limits.
By default, AWS imposes certain default limits for AWS services for each user account. Make
   sure you review your account's current usage status and resource limits before you start
   provisioning additional resources for CDP and CDE.
For example, depending on your AWS account, you may only be allowed to provision a certain
   number of EC2 instances. Be sure to review your AWS service limits before your proceed.
For more information, see the AWS documentation: AWS Service Limits and
    Amazon EC2 Resource Limits. The links are in the Related information
   section below.
DataFlow environments have the following resource limits on AWS.

Certificate creation (for TLS) uses LetsEncrypt which is limited to 2000 certs/week. As such,
    a single tenant in CDP can create a maximum of 2000 flows per week.
