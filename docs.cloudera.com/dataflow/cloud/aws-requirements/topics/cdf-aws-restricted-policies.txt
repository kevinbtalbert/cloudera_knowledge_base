AWS restricted policies
Customers with strict security policies beyond what the default Cloudera cross-account
  policy permits can enable DataFlow for a CDP environment with more restricted IAM policies. To do
  so, an administrator must attach the Compute Restricted IAM policy with the cross-account role
  associated with the CDP environment. 
DataFlow uses AWS IAM write permissions to create/delete Roles and Instance Profiles. If due to
   security requirements you cannot provide IAM write permission in the roleâ€™s policy, you can set
   up static pre-created roles and an instance profile. DataFlow makes use of these static
   pre-created roles and instance-profile while provisioning the cluster.
noteDataFlow will only be able to use the pre-created Roles and Instance Profile only if the
   entitlement LIFTIE_USE_PRECREATED_IAM_RESOURCES for the tenant in use is
   set.
To enable DataFlow with restricted IAM policies, perform the following tasks: 
Create the IAM Roles and Instance Profile pair.
Create the CDP cross-account role credential.

You         can do this during the environment-creation process or before you enable the environment.
