Using Customer Managed Keys with DataFlow
By default, DataFlow uses your account level KMS key for EBS storage encryption. You can
    optionally secure your data with a custom KMS key.
You have two options to implement Customer Managed Keys (CMKs):
define a new default KMS key for EBS encryption on AWS account level
define a key on CDF environment level


Define a new default KMS key for AWS account level EBS encryptionWhen you define a new account level default key in AWS, you need to add policies to         your key definition that allow for storage provisioning and fulfilling scaling requests. Define a new default KMS key for CDP environment level EBS encryptionWhen you define a custom KMS key at the CDP environment level, you need to add         policies to your key definition that allow for storage provisioning and fulfilling scaling         requests.
