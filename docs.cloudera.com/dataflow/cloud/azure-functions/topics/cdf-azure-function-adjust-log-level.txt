Adjusting logs levels
DataFlow Functions makes use of the SLF4J Simple Logger for logging purposes. You can
    update the log levels by adjusting the JVM's system properties.

To do so, you need to set the JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS application
        setting.


To set a log level for a given logger, you can set the JVM system property named
              org.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.<logger name> to the desired log
            level.
For example, if you want to enable DEBUG logging for the
              StandardStatelessNiFiFunction to view the actual data flow JSON being
            used, you would set the JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS environment variable to
              -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.com.cloudera.naaf.StandardStatelessNiFiFunction=DEBUG


You can also set additional logger levels by adding multiple
              -D options separated by spaces. For example, to enable DEBUG
            logs on both the DataFlow Functions framework and the Stateless Bootstrap class, you
            would set JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS to a value
            of:-Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.com.cloudera.naaf.StandardStatelessNiFiFunction=DEBUG
          -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.org.apache.nifi.stateless.bootstrap.StatelessBootstrap=DEBUG
