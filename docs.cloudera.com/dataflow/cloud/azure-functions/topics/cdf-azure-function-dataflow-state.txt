Data flow state


By default, if your data flow contains any stateful processors (for example,
        ListSFTP), this state will automatically be stored in a Cosmos database called
          nifi_state, though this name can be set using the
          COSMOSDB_STATE_DATABASE environment variable. To integrate with Cosmos
        DB, some additional steps are required. If you do not perform these steps, the data flow
        will still run, but the state will not be preserved.


In the Azure console, navigate to the Cosmos DB service.


Click Create.


Click Create under Core (SQL) -
              Recommended.


Select your Resource Group, and enter an account name.


All other configurations are optional, and may be different depending on your
            use case. While provisioned throughput is supported, it is recommended to select
              Serverless. 


Click Review + Create and check the function
            details.


Click Create.


In your Function App, go to the Identity blade, and
            note the Object (principal) ID, for the following steps.


Click the Cloud Shell icon in the upper right and
            follow any initial prompts that may set up the web-based cloud shell for you.


Run the following commands in the cloud shell:
resourceGroup=<your resource group>
accountName=<your CosmosDB account name>
principalId=<your Function App Object principal ID from above>
az cosmosdb sql role assignment create --account-name $accountName \
  --resource-group $resourceGroup --scope "/" \
  --principal-id $principalId --role-definition-id 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
az cosmosdb sql role assignment create --account-name $accountName \
  --resource-group $resourceGroup --scope "/" \
  --principal-id $principalId --role-definition-id 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002



On the Overview blade, click the Add
              Container.


Specify the database and container IDs.
If you use nifi_state for both, the
              COSMOSDB_STATE_DATABASE and COSMOSDB_STATE_CONTAINER
            Application Settings are not needed.


Specify /id for the Partition Key and click
              OK.


In your Function App Configuration, add an Application Setting called
              COSMOSDB_ENDPOINT with the Cosmos DB URI (from the
              Overview page).
If you specified any other database or container name than
              nifi_state, you will need to specify the
              COSMOSDB_STATE_DATABASE and COSMOSDB_STATE_CONTAINER
            Application Settings, respectively.


The Cosmos DB state provider can be disabled even if your data flow contains stateful
        processors by setting the DISABLE_STATE_PROVIDER Application Setting to
          true.
warningThis will cause processor state to be lost between
        function executions.
