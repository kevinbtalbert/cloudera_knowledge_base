General configuration
​​You must configure the function to specify the dataflow to run and add any necessary
    runtime configuration using environment variables.

Click Configuration under Settings on the
          left of your Function App screen.

Select the Application Settings tab.




Application settings are exposed as Environment Variables inside the
            function. Azure pre-populates some of these, which are used by the Function framework
            itself. You  have to add the remaining Application Settings.


Click New application setting at the top to add the first
          setting, which is required for all DataFlow Functions deployments.

As a name, enter WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE.
The value is different depending on the Operating System: 
For Windows, enter 1. This tells the Function App to use the Zip
              package you uploaded earlier to the File share.
For Linux, enter the full path to the NaafAzureFunctions.zip
              uploaded to the Container.
To get the URL, navigate to the Storage account and click
                    Containers.
Click the container you created before.
Click the NaafAzureFunctions.zip file and click the
                    Copy icon next to the URL.
 Back in the Function app, paste the value as the value of the
                    WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE setting.



Additionally, the following Application Settings are
            supported.

Variable Name
Description
Required
Default Value



FUNCTION_NAME

The unique function name for this deployment. It is recommended to simply use
                      the name of the Function App. 

warningIf more than one Function App has
                        the same value for this variable, data flow state may be corrupted.

FLOW_CRN
The Cloudera Resource Name (CRN) for the data flow that is to
                      be run.The data flow must be stored in the DataFlow Catalog.
                      This CRN should indicate the specific version of the data flow and as such
                      will end with some suffix such as /v.1.For more information, see
                      Retrieving data flow CRN.
true

DF_PRIVATE_KEY

The Private Key for accessing the Cloudera DataFlow service.
The Private Key and Access Key are used to authenticate with the DataFlow
                      Service and they must provide the necessary authorizations to access the
                      specified data flow.
For more information, see Provisioning Access Key ID and Private
                        Key.

noteIt is a best practice to configure the
                        DF_PRIVATE_KEY as a Secret in Key Vault.

DF_ACCESS_KEY

The Access Key for accessing the Cloudera DataFlow service.
The Private Key and Access Key are used to authenticate with the DataFlow
                      Service and they must provide the necessary authorizations to access the
                      specified data flow.
For more information, see Provisioning Access Key ID and Private
                        Key.

true

INPUT_PORT

The name of the Input Port to use. If the specified data flow has more than
                      one Input Port at the root group level, this environment variable must be
                      specified, indicating the name of the Input Port to queue up the Cloud
                      Function event. If there is only one Input Port, this variable is not
                      required. If it is specified, it must properly match the name of the Input
                      Port.

false
--


OUTPUT_PORT

The name of the Output Port to retrieve the results from. If no
                      Output Port exists, the variable does not need to be specified and no data
                      will be returned. If at least one Output Port exists in the data flow, this
                      variable can be used to determine the name of the Output Port whose data will
                      be sent along as the output of the function.
For more information on how the appropriate Output Port is determined, see
                        Output ports.

false
--


FAILURE_PORTS

A comma-separated list of Output Ports that exist at the root group
                      level of the data flow. If any FlowFile is sent to one of these Output Ports,
                      the function invocation is considered a failure.
For more information, see Output ports.

CONTENT_REPO

The contents of the FlowFiles can be stored either in memory, on the JVM
