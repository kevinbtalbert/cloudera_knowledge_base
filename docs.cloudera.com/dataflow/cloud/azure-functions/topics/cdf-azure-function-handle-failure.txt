Handling failures
You can use a failure Output Port to notify the Function that an invocation has
    failed.

You can use a failure Output Port to notify the Function that an
        invocation has failed. For HTTP triggers, there is no retry. For Event Grid triggers, Azure
        Event Grid may automatically retry the invocation, if configured in the Event Subscription,
        for a default of 30 attempts. After that, if it still fails, the Event Subscription will
        simply drop the event notification. This could result in data loss, as it means that our
        Function App will not have a chance to process the data again.
