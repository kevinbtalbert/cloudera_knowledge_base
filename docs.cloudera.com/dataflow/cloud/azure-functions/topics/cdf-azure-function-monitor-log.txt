Monitoring and logs
Azure Functions offers an integration with Azure Monitor Logs to monitor
    functions.

You can view Function logs either directly in the Log
          Stream blade at the Function App level, or under the
          Monitoring blade of the individual Function. Function output log
        files are also available in the Storage account File share under
          LogFiles/Application/Functions/Host.
