Output ports
While all Function trigger types support Failure ports, only HTTP Functions will use the
    output from non-failure Output Ports. This topic collects different considerations of Output
    Ports for the different Function trigger types.
Event Grid Function Output Ports
With Event Grid Functions, the Output Port data flow logic is simpler.
If one Output Port is present, and its name is "failure", any data routed to that
        Output Port will cause the function invocation to fail.
If two Output Ports are present, and one of them is named "failure", that Output
        Port will behave as the "failure" port above. Any other non-failure Output Port is
        considered a successful invocation, but the function will do nothing with data routed
        here.
Any port with the name "failure" (ignoring case) will be considered a Failure Port.
        Additionally, if the FAILURE_PORTS environment variable is specified, any
        port whose name is in the comma-separated list will be considered a Failure Port.

HTTP Function Output Ports
Since Functions with an HTTP trigger are invoked synchronously, they directly
        return a response. The Output Port semantics for this case is as follows.
If no Output Port is present in the data flow's root group, no output will be
        provided from the function invocation, but a default success message will be returned in the
        HTTP response with a status code of 200.
If one Output Port is present, and its name is "failure", any data routed to that
        Output Port will cause the function invocation to fail. No output will be provided as the
        output of the function invocation, and an error message will be returned from the HTTP
        response, with a status code of 500.
If two Output Ports are present, and one of them is named "failure", that Output
        Port will behave as the "failure" port above. The other Output Port is considered a
        successful invocation. When the data flow is invoked, if a single FlowFile is routed to this
        Port, the contents of the FlowFile will be returned as the HTTP response. If more than one
        FlowFile is sent to the Output Port, the data flow will be considered a failure, as there is
        only one HTTP response possible. A MergeContent or MergeRecord Processor may be used in
        order to assemble multiple FlowFiles into a single output FlowFile if necessary.
Any Port with the name "failure" (ignoring case) will be considered a Failure
        Port. Additionally, if the FAILURE_PORTS environment variable is
        specified, any port whose name is in the comma-separated list will be considered a Failure
        Port.
If two or more Output Ports, other than failure ports, are present, the
          OUTPUT_PORT environment variable must be provided. In such a case, this
        environment variable must match the name of an Output Port at the data flow's root group
        (case is NOT ignored). Anything that is routed to the specified port is considered the
        output of the function invocation. Anything routed to any other port is considered a
        failure.
note
In any successful response, the mime.type flowfile attribute
          is used as the Content-Type of the response.
