Limitations on Azure
This section lists some resource limits that DataFlow and Azure impose on workloads
  running in DataFlow workspaces. 


There is no ability to grant or revoke remote access (via Kubeconfig) to specific users.
     Users with the DFAdmin role in the environment can download a Kubeconfig file. The Kubeconfig
     file will continue to allow access even if the DFAdmin role is later revoked.


Each DataFlow workspace requires a separate subnet. For more information on this issue, see
      Use kubenet networking with your own IP address ranges in Azure Kubernetes
      Service (AKS).


Heavy AKS activity can cause default API rate limits to trigger, causing throttling and
     eventually failures for AKS clusters. For some examples, see AKS issue
      1187 and AKS issue 1413.
