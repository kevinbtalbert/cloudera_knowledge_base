Setting up minimum permissions
The minimum permissions for Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) on Azure govern access control
    between Azure resources, the Azure storage account, and CDF. The minimum permissions that allow
    for enabling/disabling CDF and deploying/undeploying flows can be set using a custom
    role.

You have registered an application on the Azure Portal. For instructions, see
            Create an app registration and assign a role to it.You have created an app-based provisioning credential in your Azure
          subscription. For instructions, see Create a provisioning credential for
            Azure.


Create a custom role that contains the minimum permissions.

The following role definition outlines the minimum permissions required to create a
            custom role for CDF. The permissions are listed in the Actions section, so that
            CDF can access resources and operate correctly.
When using the role defintiion, replace the following values:

[YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID]: Your subscription ID in
              use.
[YOUR-RESTRICTED-ROLE-NAME]: The custom role name which
              is assigned to the application. For example: Cloudera Dataflow Azure Operator
                for Single Resource Group
[YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME]: The original resource group
              name.
