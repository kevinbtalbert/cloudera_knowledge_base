Best practices for building custom components
Learn about general guidelines concerning the creation of custom NiFi archives
  (NARs).
The goal is to build your code once against a baseline version of Apache NiFi and it can be
   deployed to any flow you need using any version of CDF powered by any NiFi deployment equal to or
   greater than the version it was built against, bar major version changes.
Apache NiFi extensions are packaged in NARs. A NAR allows several components and their
   dependencies to be packaged together into a single package. NiFi provides Maven archetypes for
   creating custom processor and controller service bundle project structures.  For detailed
   information, see the Maven Projects for Extensions Apache NiFi wiki page.

If directly specifying the nifi-nar-maven-plugin, ensure you use the most
    recent version when compiling your custom code.
If inheriting the nifi-nar-maven-plugin, Cloudera recommends that the parent
    version of nifi-nar-bundles has the same major and minor version as the
    selected NiFi runtime version. For example, If the CFM Version is 1.18.0.2.3.7.1 (NiFi Major
    Version: 1, NiFi Minor Version: 18) the recommended compilation version is 1.18.0 (The first two
    version numbers must be equal to, or less than the CFM version).

 <parent>
        <groupId>org.apache.nifi</groupId>
        <artifactId>nifi-nar-bundles</artifactId>
        <version>1.18.0.2.3.7.1-1</version>
    </parent>
Ensure your NAR pom only depends on another NAR pom for a
    controller service API NAR. Generally, do not extend from implementation NARs like
     nifi-standard-nar.
Ensure your components jar
pom marks API dependencies as provided in order to obtain them at runtime
    through the appropriate NAR dependency.
