Developing a NiFi flow for DataFlow Functions
A flow definition represents the data flow logic that you can download from NiFi, import
    to the DataFlow Catalog and run in serverless mode. You can develop this data flow for your
    function in any development environment using Apache NiFi and then deploy the function on a
    Function as a Service (FAAS) solution on AWS, Azure, or the Google Cloud Platform
    (GCP).
You have three main options for developing your flow:
Use CDF Flow Designer and publish your draft as a flow definition in the Catalog. For
          more information on using the Flow Designer, see Creating a new draft. In
          this case you can skip the downloading flow and importing flow to Catalog steps as you
          have already added your flow to the CDF Catalog.

Use Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud Data Hub with the Flow
            Management template, if you are a CDP customer who has a CDP Data Lake.
For more information on how to set up a managed and secured Flow Management
            cluster in CDP Public Cloud, see Setting up your Flow Management
            cluster.


Develop the data flow in your local development environment using open source
            Apache NiFi.


Once you have developed and test your NiFi flow, you can deploy it as a DataFlow function in
      serverless mode using one of the three cloud providers function services: AWS Lambda, Google
      Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions.
To make sure that your NiFi data flow can be deployed as a function in CDF, review
      your traditional NiFi flow development process and follow the best practices outlined in the
      next sections.

Data flows to be used by AWS Lambda require an Input Port and most often will also contain at     least one Output Port. This makes it quite easy to test these data flows in NiFi.
