Downloading Lambda DataFlow Function binaries and uploading to S3
To be able to run the NiFi flow in AWS Lambda, you need to add the DataFlow function
    handler libraries to S3.

Click Functions in the left navigation pane and download the
          DataFlow Function binaries for AWS Lambda.
AWS Lambda will use these binaries to run the NiFi flow.



Upload this binary to an S3 bucket that you will later reference when creating the
          function in AWS Lambda.
The S3 bucket needs to be in the same region as where the Lambda is being
          created/deployed.

Copy the S3 URI for later use.
