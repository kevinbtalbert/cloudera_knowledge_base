Downloading a flow from NiFi 
When ready, you can download the Flow Definition from NiFi, import it to the Cloudera
    DataFlow Catalog, and deploy the function on AWS, Azure, or the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to
    run it in serverless mode. In DataFlow Functions, only flows versioned in the DataFlow Catalog
    can be used as functions.
The Download flow definition option in NiFi allows you to download the
      flow definition of a Process Group as a JSON file. After you have downloaded your flow from
      NiFi, you can import it into DataFlow. For detailed instructions, see Downloading a flow
        definition from NiFi .
