Uploading a NiFi flow to the Catalog
Before a NiFi flow can be run in serverless mode on a cloud provider function service,
    you must register it as a DataFlow function by importing it into the Cloudera DataFlow (CDF)
    Catalog. With DataFlow Functions, only flows versioned in the DataFlow Catalog can be used as
    functions. 
If you want to use a NiFi flow in CDF, you must import it to CDF as a flow definition. When
      imported, the flow definition is added to the Catalog and you can start using it. For
      instructions, see Importing a flow definition.
