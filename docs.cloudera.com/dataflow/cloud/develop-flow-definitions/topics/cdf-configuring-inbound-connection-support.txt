Adding Inbound Connection support to a NiFi flow
You can enable a dataflow to listen on a public endpoint to data sources that are
  outside your CDP environment by adding inbound connection support to your flow definition.
To enable your dataflow to use listen processors with inbound connection endpoint
   support, make the following addition to your flow definition:

In NiFi, open the flow definition where you want to enable inbound connection support.
Add the required listen processor to your flow definintion.CDF supports all
     listen processors, including Custom Processors.

Configure the processor to enable inbound connections.

Port
Provide a port number where the flow deployment listens for incoming data. You can either
       parameterize it and set the actual port number during flow deployment, or you can set an
       explicit port number when designing the flow.
SSL Context Service
Create an external StandardRestrictedSSLContextService for your processor. You must name
       this context service Inbound SSL Context Service. No other
       configuration is required. The SSL context service will be created during cluster deployment
       and all other properties will be populated with values generated for that NiFi cluster.
Client Auth
Set  to “REQUIRED” to use mTLS

noteMost listen processors only support TCP. ListenSyslog supports both
     TCP and UDP. As dataflow deployments do not support mixed protocols for listening ports, and
     UDP does not support SSL Context Service and Client authentication, Cloudera advises to
     configure your ListenSyslog processor to use TCP protocol. This allows your CDF dataflow to use
     SSL Context Service for authentication and to listen to different data sources on different
      ports.If this is not possible, create separate flows that listen on UDP and TCP
      respectively.

Save and download the updated flow definition.
