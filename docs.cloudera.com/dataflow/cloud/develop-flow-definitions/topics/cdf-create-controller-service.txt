Creating controller service for flow definitions

As you are building your data flow in your NiFi development
      environment, follow these steps to create a controller service:
Select your process group and click Configure from either
          the Operate Palette or the process group context menu of the NiFi
          UI.The Process Group Configuration dialog is
          displayed.Select the Controller Services tab.Click the (+) button to add a new controller
          service.The Add Controller Service dialog is
          displayed.Select the required controller service and click
        Add.Click the (Configure) icon in the right column and set the
          necessary options.Click Apply to save the changes.Click the (Flash) button to enable the controller
          service.
importantYou must define the controller services for your data flow in the
            configuration of the process group where they will be used. This ensures that the
            controller services are included in the process group flow definition.
