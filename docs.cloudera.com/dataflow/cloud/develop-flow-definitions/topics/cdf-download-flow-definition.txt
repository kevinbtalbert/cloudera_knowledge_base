Download a flow definition from NiFi
Before you can run a NiFi flow in Cloudera DataFlow, you need to download the NiFi
    flow as a flow definition. The Download flow definition option in NiFi allows you to
    download the flow definition of a process group as a JSON file. The file can be imported into
    Cloudera DataFlow using the Import Flow Definition option. 


Review Best Practices for Flow Definition Development to ensure that you
          have a good understanding of flow isolation best practices.
Develop your data flow in NiFi.

important
When you download your data flow from NiFi: 
Default values are exported with the flow definition. When you import this flow
              definition to Cloudera DataFlow and want to deploy your flow, the default values are
              carried over into the deployment wizard.
Sensitive values are removed and you have to set them again during flow deployment
              in Cloudera DataFlow.
Empty strings remain empty.



Select the process group that you want to transfer to Cloudera
          DataFlow.For recommendations on how to export your process groups for
          deployment in Cloudera Dataflow, see Best Practices for Flow Definition
            Development.Right-click the process group.Select Download flow definition.

note
You can download flow definitions from NiFi at any level of your process group
              hierarchy. If you download one particular process group, your package contains the
              flow(s) included in the selected process group. When you download your flow definition
              from the root canvas level, you basically export all your data flows running on a
              cluster in one package, as the root canvas is the top level in the process group
              hierarchy.
If you download a versioned process group, the versioning information is not included
              in the downloaded JSON file.
After the download, you can upload your flow to Cloudera DataFlow.

For more information on how to plan and organize your NiFi data flows, see Best
              Practices for Flow Definition Development.

The data flow is downloaded as a JSON file. You have a portable
      NiFi flow ready to be imported into Cloudera DataFlow.
Import the NiFi flow to Cloudera DataFlow as a flow
      definition.
