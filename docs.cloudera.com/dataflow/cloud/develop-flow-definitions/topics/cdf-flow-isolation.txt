Best Practices for Developing Flow Definitions
Before you can deploy a flow definition in Cloudera DataFlow (CDF), you need to develop
    your data flow logic in a development environment using Apache NiFi. To make sure that your NiFi
    data flow can be deployed in CDF, follow the best practices outlined in this
    section.
What is a flow definition?
A flow definition represents data flow logic which was developed in Apache
        NiFi and exported by using the Download Flow Definition action on a
        NiFi process group or the root canvas. Flow definitions typically leverage parameterization
        to make them portable between different environments such as development or production NiFi
        environments.
To run one of your existing NiFi data flows in CDF you have to export it as a flow
          definition and upload it to the CDF catalog.

What is flow isolation?
CDF is the first cloud service allowing NiFi users to easily isolate data flows
        from each other and guarantee a set of resources to each one without requiring
        administrators to create additional NiFi clusters.
Flow isolation describes the ability to treat NiFi process groups which typically
        run on a shared cluster on shared resources as independent, deployable artifacts which can
        be exported as flow definitions from NiFi.
Flow isolation is useful when


You want to guarantee a set of resources for a specific data flow.


You want to isolate failure domains.
