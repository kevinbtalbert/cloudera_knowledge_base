Enabling DataFlow for an environment
Enabling DataFlow for an environment is your first step in getting started with
        Cloudera DataFlow. To do this, ensure that you have met the prerequisites, and then launch
        the Enable Environment window to walk you through the process. 


You have an AWS or an Azure account.

You have prepared your infrastructure and network. For more
                        information on requirements, see the AWS Resource Planning or
                        the Azure Resource Planning documentation respectively.

You have created and registered a CDP environment. For more
                        information, see the Data Hub documentation.

FreeIPA is running and healthy. 

Your Data Lake is started and healthy.
You have the DFAdmin role for the environment you want to enable. For more
                    information, see the DataFlow Security documentation

Steps

From the CDP Public Cloud home page, click Cloudera
                                DataFlow, then click
                            Environments.
Find the environment you want to enable, and click
                                Enable to launch the Environments
                                / Enable DataFlow window.If the
                                    Enable button is grayed out, hover over
                                the Not Enabled icon for more details about
                                the problem. note
If you have previously disabled the environment but preserved
                                    event history, go to Actions and select
                                        Enable Environment.

Configure DataFlow Capacity. This defines the
                                Kubernetes cluster minimum and maximum size and specifies the size
                                of the Kubernetes cluster. Your DataFlow cluster automatically
                                scales between the minimum and maximum cluster size that you specify
                                here.
Configure Networking.

Specify whether to use a Public
                                            Endpoint.Select this option when you want
                                            to allow users to connect to workload side UIs like the
                                            DataFlow Deployment Manager or the actual NiFi UI
                                            through the public Internet.

If checked when enabling an AWS environment, this
                                                  option provisions an endpoint (load balancer) in a
                                                  public subnet.
noteA public endpoint
                                                  requires public subnets. If you want to place a
                                                  public endpoint in private subnets, you must
                                                  explicitly select them.
If checked when enabling an Azure environment,
                                                  this option provisions an endpoint (load balancer)
                                                  in a public subnet and you cannot explicitly
                                                  specify subnets. The Load Balancer
                                                  Subnet Use option is not
                                                  available.


If unchecked, CDP creates an endpoint in a
                                                  private subnet, and you must set up access to the
                                                  endpoint manually in your cloud account to allow
                                                  user access to workload side UIs.


Specify Load Balancer
                                            Subnets.Select from Available
                                                Subnets. Explicitly specifying subnets
                                            overrides the automatic, tag-based subnet selection
                                            process and ensures load balancer provisioning in the
                                            specified subnets. If no subnets are specified, DataFlow
                                            provisions a load balancer according to how the subnets
                                            have been tagged. For more information, see VPC
                                                and subnets in the Related
                                                information section below.
Specify Worker Node Subnets.Select
                                            one of the Available Subnets. If
                                            you do not make a subnet selection, DataFlow considers
                                            any available subnet that has been registered with the
                                            environment for worker placement. Worker nodes are only
                                            placed in public subnets if no private subnets are
                                            available.
Specify Load Balancer Endpoint
                                        Access. Specify a set of IP address ranges
                                            that will be allowed to access the DataFlow load
                                            balancer endpoint. Providing no IP address ranges makes
                                            the load balancer endpoint open to all traffic.


Configure Kubernetes.

Configure API Server Endpoint
                                            Access.CDP environments with Cluster
                                            Connectivity Manager (CCM) enabled support the ability
                                            to create a fully private cluster, which disallows all
                                            access to the Kubernetes API Server Endpoint.
Specify whether to use a Private
                                                  Cluster.If you select
                                                  Private Cluster IP based
                                                  access is not applicable, and the option to
                                                  specify a set of IP address ranges is not
                                                  available.If you do not select
                                                  Private Cluster you can
                                                  specify a set of IP address ranges that are
                                                  allowed to access the Kubernetes API Server
                                                  Endpoint. Providing no Classless Inter-Domain
                                                  Routing (CIDR) makes the Kubernetes API Server
                                                  Endpoint open to all traffic.In either
                                                  case, any user who needs access to the Kubernetes
                                                  API Server must be granted remote access to the
                                                  underlying Kubernetes cluster. This can be
                                                  configured after DataFlow has been enabled
                                                  successfully.noteIf
                                                  you select Private Cluster
                                                  while enabling an Azure environment, the
                                                  UDR Mode option becomes
                                                  available. If you  enable UDR mode, make sure that
                                                  under Networking > Worker Node Subnets you selected the specific worker
                                                  node subnet where UDR mode has been
                                                  configured.

Configure Pod CIDR Range.The CIDR
                                            notation IP range from which to assign IPs to pods in
                                            your kubernetes cluster. This address should be a large
                                            address space that is not in use elsewhere in your
                                            network environment, accommodating the number of nodes
                                            that you expect to scale up to. The default value is
                                                10.244.0.0/16. The value is used to
                                            assign a /24 address space to each node
                                            in the cluster. For example, the first node would be
                                            assigned 10.244.0.0/24, the second node
                                                10.244.1.0/24, the third node
                                                10.244.2.0/24. As the cluster
                                            scales or upgrades, the platform continues to assign a
                                            pod IP address range to each new node.
Configure Service CIDR Range.The
                                            CIDR notation IP range from which to assign IPs to
                                            internal services in your kubernetes cluster. This IP
                                            address range should be an address space that is not in
                                            use elsewhere in your network environment, accommodating
                                            the amount of kubernetes services that you intend to
                                            use. The default value is
                                            10.0.0.0/16.


Configure Tags as keys and their values.Tags
                                are added to DataFlow resources at the time of enablement. These
                                tags are included in addition to those set by the CDP
                            service.
Click Enable. This may take up to 45
                            minutes.

Result
Your cluster status changes from Not Enabled
                        to Enabling.

Before you begin

You have installed the CDP CLI.
You have run cdp environments list-environments # to
                            obtain the environment-crn.

Steps

To enable DataFlow for an environment,
                                enter:
cdp df enable-service 
--environment-crn [***ENVIRONMENT_CRN***] 
--min-k8s-node-count [***MIN_K8S_NODE_COUNT***]
--max-k8s-node-count [***MAX_K8S_NODE_COUNT***] 
[--use-public-load-balancer] [--no-use-public-load-balancer] 
[--private-cluster] [--no-private-cluster] 
[--kube-api-authorized-ip-ranges [[***KUBE_API_AUTHORIZED_IP_RANGES***[ [[***KUBE_API_AUTHORIZED_IP_RANGES***[ ...]]]
[--tags [***TAGS***]]
[--load-balancer-authorized-ip-ranges [[***LOAD_BALANCER_AUTHORIZED_IP_RANGES***] [[***LOAD_BALANCER_AUTHORIZED_IP_RANGES***] ...]]]
[--cluster-subnets [[***CLUSTER_SUBNETS***] [[***CLUSTER_SUBNETS***] ...]]]
[--load-balancer-subnets [[***LOAD_BALANCER_SUBNETS***] [[***LOAD_BALANCER_SUBNETS***] ...]]]
Where: 
--environment-crn specifies the environment-crn you obtained
                                    while completing the pre-requisites.
--min-k8s-node-count and --max-k8s-node-count specify your
                                    DataFlow capacity. Your DataFlow cluster automatically scales
                                    between the minimum and maximum cluster size that you specify
                                    here.
[--use-public-load-balancer] [--no-use-public-load-balancer]
                                        
[--private-cluster] [--no-private-cluster]
--kube-api-authorized-ip-ranges specifies a set of IP address
                                    ranges that will be allowed to access the Kubernetes API Server
                                    Endpoint. Providing no IP address ranges makes the Kubernetes
                                    API Server Endpoint open to all traffic.
--tags specifies any tags you want to add to DataFlow resources
                                    at the time of enablement. These tags are in addition to those
                                    set by the CDP service.
--load-balancer-authorized-ip-ranges
--cluster-subnets
--load-balancer-subnets

  }
}



Once you have enabled your DataFlow environment, you are ready to deploy your first
                flow definition from the Catalog. For instructions, see Deploying a flow
                    definition.
For more information on managing and monitoring DataFlow, see Managing DataFlow
                    in an environment.
