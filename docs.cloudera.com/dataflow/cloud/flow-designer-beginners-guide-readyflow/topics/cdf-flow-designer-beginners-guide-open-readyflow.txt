Open the Hello World ReadyFlow as a template for your draft

ReadyFlows are read-only, therefore you cannot publish a
            new version of them. When you are done with creating your customized version of the
            given ReadyFlow, you can only publish your work to the Catalog as
            a new flow definition.



You have an enabled and healthy CDF environment.


You have been assigned the DFDeveloper role granting you access to
                        the Flow Designer.


You have been assigned the DFCatalogAdmin or DFCatalogViewer role
                        granting you access to the Catalog. You will need this authorization to
                        publish your draft flow as a flow definition to the Catalog.


You have been assigned the DFFlowAdmin role for the environment to
                        which you want to deploy the flow definition.




Open Cloudera DataFlow by clicking the DataFlow tile in
                    the CDP sidebar.

                    name already exists, you need to provide a different name.

Click Create.
Hello World opens as a draft in the designated Flow Designer workspace
                    with the Flow Name you provided on the Flow
                        Design canvas.
