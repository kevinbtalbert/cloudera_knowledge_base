Learn about creating Controller Services in CDF Flow Designer.

Services are extension points that provide information for use by other components
                (such as processors or other controller services). The idea is that, rather than
                configure this information in every processor that might need it, the service
                provides it for any processor to use as needed.
You will use the services you create now to configure the behavior of several
                processors you will add to your flow as you are building it.


Go to Flow Options > Services.






Click Add Service.
The Add Service page opens.



In the text box, filter for CSVReader.



Provide Service Name:
                        CSVReader_Recent_Changes.

Click Add.
You do not need to configure the
                        CSVReader_Recent_Changes service. You can leave all
                    properties with their default values.

Click Add Service to create another service.

In the text box, filter for CSVRecordSetWriter.

Provide Service Name:
                        CSVRecordSetWriter_Recent_Changes.

Click Add.
You do not need to configure the
                        CSVRecordSetWriter_Recent_Changes service. You can
                    leave all properties with their default values.

Select the AvroReader_Recent_Changes service and check
                    the list of Referencing Components in the
                        Service Details pane on the right.
Make a note of the listed components, because that is where you will need to
                    replace AvroReader_Recent_Changes with the
                        CSVReader_Recent_Changes service.

Select the AvroWriter_Recent_Changes service and check
                    the list of Referencing Components in the
                        Service Details pane on the right.
Make a note of the listed components, because that is where you will need to
                    replace AvroWriter_Recent_Changes with the
                        CSVRecordSetWriter_Recent_Changes service.
