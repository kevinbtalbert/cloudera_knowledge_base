Tutorial: customizing a ReadyFlow
Learn how to create a draft using a ReadyFlow as a template.

This tutorial shows you how you can open a ReadyFlow from the ReadyFlow
                    Gallery and create a customized flow design using the ReadyFlow as a
                template. This tutorial uses the 'Hello World' ReadyFlow, a simple flow design that
                retrieves the latest changes from Wikipedia through invoking the Wikipedia API. It
                converts JSON events to Avro, before filtering and routing them to two different
                processors which merge events together before a file is written to local disk.
You will learn about:

                    Canvas.
Creating a Controller Service
Changing the configuration of processors
Running a Test Session
Publishing a draft to the Catalog as a flow
                    definition.



The 'Hello World' ReadyFlow that you are about to customize can be deployed without
                any external dependencies and does not require any parameter values during
                deployment. Still, there are prerequisites you have to meet before you can start
                building your first draft.


You have an enabled and healthy CDF environment.


You have been assigned the DFDeveloper role granting you access to
                        the Flow Designer.


You have been assigned the DFCatalogAdmin or DFCatalogViewer role
                        granting you access to the Catalog. You will need this authorization to
                        publish your draft as a flow definition to the Catalog.


You have been assigned the DFFlowAdmin role for the environment to
                        which you want to deploy the flow definition.
