Build your draft flow
Start building your draft flow by adding components to the Canvas and configuring
        them.

Add an InvokeHTTP processor to the canvas.


Drag a Processor from the
                                Components sidebar to the canvas. 







In the text box, filter for InvokeHTTP.







Change the Processor Name to Get
                                Recent Wikipedia Changes.


Click Add.



After configuration, this processor calls the Wikipedia API to retrieve the
                        latest changes.


Configure the Get Recent Wikipedia Changes
                    processor.
Properties
HTTP URL
provide
                                    https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=recentchanges&format=json&rcprop=user%7Ccomment%7Cparsedcomment%7Ctimestamp%7Ctitle%7Csizes%7Ctags




RelationshipsSelect the following
                        relationships:
Original - Terminate 

Failure - Terminate, Retry


Retry - Terminate


No Retry - Terminate



Click Apply.

noteNote the orange  Notification Pill in the upper
                        left corner of your processor. It is there to warn you about possible issues
                        with a component.

In this particular case, it warns you about one of the
                            Relationships not being addressed when
                        configuring your processor. Do not worry, it will disappear when you create
                        a connection to another processor for the 'Response' relationship.


Add a ConvertRecord processor to the canvas.
                        


Drag a Processor from the
                                Components sidebar to the canvas. 


In the text box, filter for ConvertRecord.


Change the Processor Name to Convert
                                JSON to AVRO.


Click Add.



This processor converts the JSON response to AVRO format. It uses
                        RecordReaders and RecordWriters to accomplish this. It infers the JSON
                        schema starting from the recent changes field.


Configure the Convert JSON to AVRO processor.

Properties

Record Reader
Select the JSON_Reader_Recent_Changes
                                controller service you have created from the drop-down list.


Record Writer
Select the AvroWriter_Recent_Changes
                                controller service you have created from the drop-down list.


RelationshipsSelect the following
                            relationships:failure - Terminate,
                        Retry

Click Apply.

Connect the Get Recent Wikipedia Changes and
                        Convert JSON to AVRO processors by hovering over the
                    lower-right corner of the Get Recent Wikipedia Changes
                    processor, clicking the arrow that appears and dragging it to the
                        Convert JSON to AVRO processor.






In the configuration popup, select the Response
                    relationship and click Add.









noteNote, that the  Notification Pill warning about
                        the unconfigured 'Response' relationship disappeared from your
                            Get Recent Wikipedia Changes processor.


Add a QueryRecord processor.


Drag a Processor from the
                                Components sidebar to the canvas. 


In the text box, filter for QueryRecord.


Name it Filter
                            Edits.


Click Add.



This processor filters out anything but actual page edits. To achieve this,
                        it's running a query that selects all FlowFiles (events) of the type
                            edit.


Configure the Filter Edits processor.
Properties
Record Reader
Select the AvroReader_Recent_Changes

                                Name


Provide Select * from FLOWFILE where type='edit' as
                                Value.


Click Apply.



Connect the Convert JSON to AVRO and Filter
                        Edits processors by hovering over the lower-right corner of the
                        Convert JSON to AVRO processor, clicking the arrow
                    that appears and dragging it to the Filter Edits
                    processor.

In the configuration pane, select the success and
                        failure relationships and click
                        Add.

Add a second QueryRecord processor.


Drag a Processor from the
                                Components sidebar to the canvas. 


In the text box, filter for QueryRecord.


Name it Route on Content
                                Size.


Click Add.



This processor uses two SQL statements to separate edit events that resulted
                        in a longer article from edit events that resulted in a shorter article.


Configure the Route on Content Size processor.
Properties
Record Reader

For the Route on Content Size processor you also need to
                    add two user-defined properties.


Click Add Property.


Provide Added content as
                                Name


Provide Select * from FLOWFILE where newlen>=oldlen as
                                Value.


Click Add.


Click Add Property, to create the second
                            property.


Provide Removed content as
                                Name.


Provide Select * from FLOWFILE where newlen<oldlen
                            as Value.


Click Add.


Click Apply.



Connect the Filter Edits and Route on Content
                        Size processors by hovering over the lower-right corner of the
                        Filter Edits processor, clicking the arrow that
                    appears and drawing it to Route on Content Size.
In the Create Connection pop up select the
                        Filtered edits relation and click
                        Add.

Add two MergeRecord processors. 


Drag a Processor from the
                                Components sidebar to the canvas. 


In the text box, filter for MergeRecord.


Name it Merge Edit
                            Events.


Click Add.


Repeat the above steps to add another identical processor.



These processors are configured to merge at least 100 records into one
                        flowfile to avoid writing lots of small files. The MaxBinAge property is set
                        to 2 minutes which makes the processors merge records after two minutes even
                        if less than 100 records have arrived.


Configure the two Merge Edit Events processors.

Properties

Record Reader
Select the AvroReader_Recent_Changes
                                controller service you have created from the drop-down list.
Record Writer
Select the AvroWriter_Recent_Changes
                                controller service you have created from the drop-down list.
Max Bin Age
Set to two minutes by providing a value of 2
                                min.


RelationshipsSelect the following
                        relationships:

failure - Terminate


original - Terminate

noteDo not forget to perform configuration  for
                        both Merge Edit Events processors.

Connect the Route on Content Size processor to both of
                    the Merge Edit Events processors.


For the first Merge Edit Events processor,
                            select Added content from
                                Relationships and click
                                Add.


For the second Merge Edit Events processor,
                            select Removed content from
                                Relationships and click
                                Add.








Add two PutFile processors to the canvas.


Drag a Processor from the
                                Components sidebar to the canvas. 


In the text box, filter for PutFile.


Name it Write "Added Content" Events
                                To File.


Click Add.


Repeat the above steps to add another identical processor, naming this
                            second PutFile processor Write
                                "Removed Content" Events To File.



These processors write the filtered, routed edit events to two different
                        locations on the local disk. In CDF-PC, you would typically not write to
                        local disk but replace these processors with processors that resemble your
                        destination system (Kafka, Database, Object Store etc.)


Configure the Write "Added Content" Events To File
                    processor.
Properties:
Directory
Provide /tmp/larger_edits
Maximum File Count
Provide 500

RelationshipsSelect the following
                        relationships:

SUCCESS - Terminate


failure - Terminate



Click Apply.

Configure the Write "Removed Content" Events To File
                    processor.
