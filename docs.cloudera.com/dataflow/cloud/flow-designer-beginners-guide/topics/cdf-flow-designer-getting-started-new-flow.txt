Create a new flow
Create a new flow in a Flow Designer Workspace and give it a name.

Open Cloudera DataFlow by clicking the DataFlow tile in
                    the CDP sidebar.






Click Flow Design in the left navigation pane.






You are redirected to the Flow Design page, where
                        previously created draft flows are displayed, one flow per row.


Click Create New Flow.






Select a Workspace where you want to create the draft
                    flow.






Provide a Flow Name for the draft flow.
Provide Hello World.

Click Create.
Flow Designer creates a default Process Group with the Flow
                        Name you provided, 'Hello World' in this case,  and you are
                    redirected to the Flow Design canvas. The
                        Configuration pane on the right displays configuration
                    options for the default Process Group.



Proceed to creating controller services.
