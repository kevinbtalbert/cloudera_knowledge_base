Creating a draft from a flow definition in the Catalog
You can open flow definitions in the Catalog as drafts in Flow Designer. Depending on
        whether the flow definition has associated flow drafts or not, you may have more than one
        option.



You have an enabled and healthy CDF environment.


You have been assigned the DFDeveloper role granting you access to
                        the Flow Designer.


You have been assigned the DFCatalogAdmin or DFCatalogViewer role
                        granting you access to the Catalog. You will need this authorization to view
                        and open flow definitions, and to publish your draft as a flow definition to
                        the Catalog.


You have been assigned the DFFlowAdmin role for the environment to
                        which you want to deploy the flow definition.




If you have sufficient rights, you can create a new draft from existing flow
                definitions in the Catalog. This gives you two options:

You can update the existing flow definition by creating a draft and then
                    publishing your work as a new version of the source flow definition.
You can create a draft using the source flow definition as a template and then
                    publish your work as a new flow definition to the Catalog.



Open Cloudera DataFlow by clicking the DataFlow tile in
                    the CDP sidebar.

Select  Catalog in the left navigation
                    pane.

Select the flow that you want to open as a draft.

Depending on whether there already is one or more associated draft for the
                    selected flow, you may have two options to select from:

If there is one or more ASSOCIATED DRAFT, you can
                        select that and the draft opens for editing in the Flow
                            Design view.
If there are no associated drafts or you want to create a new flow based
                        on the existing one, select Create New Draft. noteIf there is more than one version available,
                            select the version that you want to use as a template for your
                            draft.Proceed according to Creating a
                        draft.
