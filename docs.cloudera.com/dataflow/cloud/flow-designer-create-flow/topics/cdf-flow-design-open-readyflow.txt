Creating a draft from a ReadyFlow
You can use ReadyFlows as the starting point of your flow design. Select an available
        ReadyFlow from the ReadyFlow Gallery, open it for editing on the Canvas, and publish it to
        the Catalog as your own custom flow definition.



You have an enabled and healthy CDF environment.


You have been assigned the DFDeveloper role granting you access to
                        the Flow Designer.


You have been assigned the DFCatalogAdmin or DFCatalogViewer role
                        granting you access to the Catalog. You will need this authorization to
                        publish your draft as a flow definition to the Catalog.


You have been assigned the DFFlowAdmin role for the environment to
                        which you want to deploy the flow definition.



ReadyFlows are read-only, therefore you cannot add a new
            version to them. When you are done with creating your customized version of the given
            ReadyFlow, you can only publish your work to the Catalog as a new
            flow definition.

Open Cloudera DataFlow by selecting the DataFlow tile in
                    the CDP sidebar.

Select  ReadyFlow Gallery in the left
                    navigation pane.

Select the ReadyFlow you want to use as a template for your flow design.

Click Create New Draft.

Select the target Workspace where you want to create the
                    draft.

Provide a valid Draft Name for the draft.
Flow names must be unique within a workspace. If a draft with the provided
                    name already exists, you need to provide a different name.

Click Create.
The selected ReadyFlow opens as a draft in the designated Flow Designer
                    workspace with the Draft Name you provided, on the
                        Flow Design canvas.
