Copying and pasting processors
In Flow Designer you can copy processors together with their configuration and then
        paste them to the same or another draft, or to an external application.
Copying a processor copies the entire processor
            configuration to the clipboard, even sensitive properties are kept. If you paste the
            processor to a different draft, you may still get an error as, for example, services are
            not copied together with your processor and you will have to recreate those in the new
            draft.

Select the processor you want to copy then either right-click on it and select
                        Copy to clipboard or press
                            ⌘+C.

To paste the processor, press
                    ⌘+V.

tipYou can also paste processor
                        configurations in JSON format to external applications, such as text editors
                        and easily share them for troubleshooting purposes.
