Creating a new draft
Learn about creating a draft in CDF Flow Designer.


Make sure that you have DFDeveloper permission to perform this task. For
                    information on account and resource roles, see DataFlow
                    Authorization.



Open Cloudera DataFlow by selecting the DataFlow tile in
                    the CDP sidebar.

Select  Flow
                        Design in the left navigation pane.

You are redirected to the Flow Design page, where
                        previously created drafts are displayed, one per row.


Select  Create Draft.

Select the target Workspace where you want to create the
                    draft.

Provide a valid Draft Name.
Draft names must be unique within a workspace. If a draft with the provided
                    name already exists, you need to provide a different name.

Click Create.
Flow Designer creates a draft and a default Process Group with the
                        Draft Name you provided and you are redirected to the
                        Flow Design canvas. The
                        Configuration pane on the right displays configuration
                    options for the default Process Group.

Start building your draft by dragging components to the canvas from the
                        Components sidebar on the left.
The Configuration sidebar always displays configuration
                    options for the highlighted component. To select a component for configuration,
                    click on it.tip

To create a Controller Service, click Flow Options >  Services > Add Service. 
To create a Parameter, click Flow Options >  Parameters > Add Parameter.Unlike in NiFi, there is one default parameter
                                    group auto-created for each draft, where you can add parameters.
                                    This parameter group is then automatically bound to each Process
                                    Group you create within your draft.



You can connect two processors by hovering the cursor over the lower-right
                    corner of the source processor, clicking the arrow that appears and dragging it
                    to the target processor.






To test your draft, start a Test Session by clicking Flow Options > Test Session > Start > Start Test Session.

This provisions a NiFi sandbox and allows you to validate your draft and work
                        with live data by starting and stopping components.
tipYou can check the status of your Test
                        Session in the upper right corner of your workspace. That is where you can
                        also deactivate the Test Session.


Once you are confident that your flow design is ready for production, click Flow Options > Publish To Catalog > Publish.
This step turns your draft to a flow definition and adds it to the Catalog.
                    From there, you can deploy your flow to any environment where you have
                    DFFlowAdmin authorization.
