Configuring advanced usage of the UpdateAtribute processor
The UpdateAttribute processor may be used to make conditional changes, based on user
        defined rules.

Rules are a set of Conditions and associated Actions. Each rule basically says, "If
                these conditions are met, then do this action." One or more conditions may be used
                in a given rule, and they all must be met in order for the designated action(s) to
                be taken.
In this topic we use two rules as an example to demonstrate how adding rules work:
                    CheckForLargeFiles and CheckForGiantFiles. 
The CheckForLargeFiles rule has the following conditions:

${filename:equals('fileOfInterest')}
${fileSize:toNumber():ge(1048576)}
${fileSize:toNumber():lt(1073741824)}

The associated action for the filename attribute:

${filename}.meg

Taken together, this rule says:

If the value of the filename attribute is fileOfInterest, and
If the fileSize is greater than or equal to (ge) one megabyte (1,048,576 bytes),
                        and
If the fileSize is less than (lt) one gigabyte (1,073,741,824 bytes)
Then change the value of the filename attribute by appending ".meg" to the
                    filename.

Continuing with this example, we can add another rule to check for files that are
                larger than one gigabyte. When we add this second rule, we can use the previous rule
                as a template, so to speak, by selecting the Expand > Duplicate option for the CheckForLargeFiles rule.
In this example, the CheckForGiantFiles rule has these
                conditions:

${filename:equals('fileOfInterest')}
${fileSize:toNumber():gt(1073741824)}

Then it has this action for the filename attribute:

${filename}.gig

Taken together, this rule says:

If the value of the filename attribute is fileOfInterest,
                        and
If the fileSize is greater than (gt) one gigabyte
                    (1,073,741,824 bytes)
Then change the value of the filename attribute by appending
                        ".gig" to the filename.



To add rules to the UpdateAttribute processor and to
                    define behavior when  multiple rules match, go to  Configuration Pane > Define Rules.






Select a Flow File Policy:


Use Clone
Matching rules are executed with a copy of the original flow file.
                                This is the default behavior.
Use Original
Matching rules are executed with the original flow file, in the
                                order that you specify under Rule Order
                                List.





Add a Rule


You can add rules by clicking Add Rule.
Specify a Rule Name.
Specify CheckForLargeFiles

Add Conditions by clicking Add Condition.
noteAll conditions you add here must be
                                    met for the rule to match.In the Add
                                    Condition modal window you can specify a condition
                                using regular expressions.
Add the
                                    ${filename:equals('fileOfInterest')}
Click Add Condition in the modal window to
                                save your changes.

To add Actions, click Add Action.
In the Add Action modal window specify an
                                    Attribute name and a
                                    Value.
For example, specify filename as
                                    Attribute and
                                    ${filename}.meg as
                                    Value.
Click Add Action  to save your
                                changes.

Once you are done with creating or updating a Rule, click
                                    Apply to save your changes.

tipAs long as your rule
                                    configuration is invalid, the Apply
                                    button is inactive and you can only Discard
                                    Changes.





Reorder Rules
