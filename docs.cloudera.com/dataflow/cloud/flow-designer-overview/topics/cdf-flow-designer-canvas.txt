Flow Design canvas
Learn about getting around and performing basic actions on the Flow Design
    Canvas.
Components sidebar
You can add components to your draft by dragging them from the
          Components sidebar and dropping them onto the
          Canvas.




Configuration pane
To access the Configuration pane, click 
          Expand in the upper-right corner of the workspace. The
          Configuration pane is context-sensitive. It always displays the
        settings belonging to the element selected on the Canvas. When you
        create a new draft and the Canvas is empty, it defaults to the
          Process Group that was auto-created with the draft. 



To hide the Configuration pane, click 
          Hide.
tipYou can also open the Configuration
        pane by double-clicking the component that you want to configure on the
          Canvas.
