Connecting an external application to a test session
Once a test session with inbound connection is running, you can go on and connect an
        external application to start sending data. 



A test session with inbound connection configured is running.


A network connection through which the client can reach the NiFi
                        endpoint is available.

You have been assigned at least the DFFlowDeveloper role
                    for the environment to which you want to configure the inbound connection.



Select the draft where you want to send data and go to Flow Options > Inbound Connection Details.

Make a note of the ENDPOINT HOSTNAME and
                        LISTENING PORTS.

Click Download Client Certificate.

The X.509 client certificate downloads to your computer in PEM format.


Click Download Private Key to obtain the RSA Private
                    Key.

The unencrypted RSA Private Key encoded with PKCS8 downloads to your computer
                        in PEM format.


Depending on your client, you may have to convert the certificate and the
                    private key to a different format.

For example, to convert PEM to PKCS12 format, use the following command:
openssl pkcs12 -export -in [***DOWNLOADED PEM CERT FILE***] -inkey [***DOWNLOADED PEM PRIVATE KEY***] -out certificate.p12
 To further convert the PKCS12 file to JKS format for a Java client, run the
                        following command:
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore [***CERTIFICATE NAME***].p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore [***DESTINATION KEYSTORE***].jks


Add the certificate file and the private key files to the keystore of your
                    application.

Configure your application to stream data to the Endpoint Hostname, port, and
                    protocol of the NiFi instance behind the Test Session.
