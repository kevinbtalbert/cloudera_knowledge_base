Stopping a test session
You can stop a test session to reconfigure your NiFi cluster. You can continue
        edidting your draft flow in the meantime.


Make sure that you have DFDeveloper permission to perform this task. For
                    information on account and resource roles, see DataFlow
                    Authorization.
You have an active test session.



You have two options to end an active test session:

Click the toggle next to the Active Test Session
                        notification.
Click Flow Options then click  Stop under Test
                            Session.


Click End.
Test session status first changes to  Ending Test Session... then, after
                    the NiFi cluster shuts down, it changes to  Test Session Not
                    Active.

Once the test session stops, you can update the
            configuration of your NiFi testbed cluster. To do so, select Flow Options > Test Session >  Edit Configuration.
