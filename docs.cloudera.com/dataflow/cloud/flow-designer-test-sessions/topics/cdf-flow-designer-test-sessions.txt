Test sessions
Starting a Test Session provisions NiFi resources, acting like a development sandbox for
  a particular draft. It allows you to work with live data to validate your data flow logic while
  updating your draft. You can suspend a test session any time and change the configuration of the
  NiFi cluster, then resume testing with the updated configuration.
