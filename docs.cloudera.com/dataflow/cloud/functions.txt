DataFlow Functions


DataFlow Functions is a CDF-PC extension to run NiFi flows as functions for event-driven use cases, 
where Apache NiFi provides a no-code UI for building and running functions very efficiently. By using DataFlow Functions, 
you do not need to code your functions yourself anymore. You can just design your flow in NiFi and set up your 
function in the cloud provider environment of your choice.



Quickstart
Get started with DataFlow Functions quickly by walking through a set of steps. This guide takes you through the process of going from zero - no CDP Public Cloud (CDP-PC) tenant and no data flow - to your first serverless NiFi flow on AWS Lambda in under 30 minutes without any Cloudera technical/sales assistance.

Getting Ready to Run Functions
Learn how  you can develop a data flow for your function and how you need to prepare deploying it as a function.

Troubleshooting Functions
You can enable the DataFlow service for any supported environment you have registered with CDP. Once DataFlow has been enabled for an environment, you can start deploying flow definitions to it.
 

Functions in AWS
Learn about the serverless, event-driven compute service provided by AWS Lambda and how it lets you run code for  virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers.

Functions in Google Cloud
Learn about Google Cloud Functions' serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services.

Functions in Azure
Learn about the erverless computer service provided by Azure Functions that allows you to write less code, maintain  less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure  less provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.
