Configuring your Google Cloud functionCloudera Docs
Configuring your Google Cloud function
After you have created a function, you can use the built-in configuration options to
    control its behavior. You can configure additional capabilities, adjust resources associated
    with your function, such as memory and timeout, or you can also create and edit test events to
    test your function using the console.
Memory and timeout in runtime configuration
You can configure two important elements on the Runtime
          Configuration tab, timeout and memory allocated to the cloud function. The
        appropriate values for these two settings depend on the data flow to be deployed. Typically,
        it is recommended to start with allocating 1 GB - 2 GB memory. You can adjust this value
        later as you see how much memory your function needs.

noteAny extensions or resources added to the Google Cloud Function
          are placed under /tmp, which is an in-memory mount. This means that they
          consume memory resources provisioned for the function. For more information, see
            Cloud Storage.

While DataFlow Functions performs very well during a warm start, a cold start that must
        source extensions may take several seconds to initialize. As a result, it is recommended to
        set the timeout to at least 60 seconds. If the dataflow to run reaches out to many other
        services or performs complex computation, it may be necessary to use a larger value (even
        several minutes).

Runtime environment variables
You must configure the function to specify the data flow to run and add any
        necessary runtime configuration using environment variables.


Navigate to the Runtime tab and choose Runtime
            Environment variables in the left-hand menu.

Click Add variable to add the first environment variable.
You can add one or more environment variables to configure the function. The following
          environment variables are supported:

Variable Name
Description
Required
Default Value



FLOW_CRN

The Cloudera Resource Name (CRN) for the data flow that is to be
                      run.
The data flow must be stored in the DataFlow Catalog. This CRN
                      should indicate the specific version of the data flow and as such will end
                      with a suffix like /v.1.
For more information, see Retrieving data flow CRN.

true

DF_PRIVATE_KEY

The Private Key for accessing the Cloudera DataFlow service. 
The Private Key and Access Key are used to authenticate with the DataFlow
                      Service and they must provide the necessary authorizations to access the
                      specified data flow. For more information, see Provisioning Access Key
                        ID and Private Key.

true
--


DF_ACCESS_KEY

The Access Key for accessing the Cloudera DataFlow service.
The Private Key and Access Key are used to authenticate with the DataFlow
                      Service and they must provide the necessary authorizations to access the
                      specified data flow. For more information, see Provisioning Access Key
                        ID and Private Key.

true
--


INPUT_PORT

The name of the Input Port to use. If the specified data flow has more than
                      one Input Port at the root group level, this environment variable must be
                      specified, indicating the name of the Input Port to queue up the Cloud
                      Function event. If there is only one Input Port, this variable is not
                      required. If it is specified, it must properly match the name of the Input
                      Port.

false
--


OUTPUT_PORT

The name of the Output Port to retrieve the results from. If no
                      Output Port exists, the variable does not need to be specified and no data
                      will be returned. If at least one Output Port exists in the data flow, this
                      variable can be used to determine the name of the Output Port whose data will
                      be sent along as the output of the function.
For more information on how the appropriate Output Port is determined, see
                        Output ports.

false
--


FAILURE_PORTS

A comma-separated list of Output Ports that exist at the root group
                      level of the data flow. If any FlowFile is sent to one of these Output Ports,
                      the function invocation is considered a failure.
For more information, see Output ports.

false
