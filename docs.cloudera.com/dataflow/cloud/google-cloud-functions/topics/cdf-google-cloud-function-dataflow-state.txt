Data flow state

By default, if your data flow contains any stateful processors
      (e.g. ListSFTP), this state is automatically stored in a Firestore collection called
      nifi_state. You can set this name using the FIRESTORE_STATE_COLLECTION
      environment variable. In order to integrate with Firestore, some additional steps are
      required. Without these steps, the data flow will still run, but the state will not be
      preserved.

In the GCP console, navigate to the Firestore service.

Click Select Native Mode.

Select the appropriate region, and click Create database.

Navigate to the IAM service, and click the Edit (pencil) button
          on the service account principal that runs your Cloud Function.

Click Add Role, and add the Firebase
            Admin role.

Click Save.

The Firestore state provider can be disabled even if your data flow contains
            stateful processors by setting the DISABLE_STATE_PROVIDER Environment
            Variable to true. warningDisabling the
              Firestore state provider will cause processor state to be lost between function
              executions.
