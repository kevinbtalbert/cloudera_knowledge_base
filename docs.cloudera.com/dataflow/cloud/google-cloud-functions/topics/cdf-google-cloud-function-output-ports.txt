Google Cloud functions may or may not allow the function to return a result. 
The only Google Cloud Function trigger type that can directly return a result is an
      HTTP trigger. In this case, the output of the data flow, is written as the HTTP response to
      the trigger, as described in the HTTP trigger section of Google Cloud
        Function triggers .
