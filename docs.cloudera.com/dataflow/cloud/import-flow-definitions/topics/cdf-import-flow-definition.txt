Create a data flow in NiFi and download it as a flow definition JSON file. For
                    more information, see Creating a Flow Definition.Make sure that you have DFCatalogAdmin permission to perform this task.
                    For information on account and resource roles, see DataFlow

Open Cloudera DataFlow by clicking the DataFlow tile in the CDP
            sidebar.
Click Catalog from the left navigation pane.The
                Flow Catalog page is displayed. Previously imported flow
              definitions are displayed, one definition per row.

Provide a name (Flow Name) and a description (Flow
              Description) for the flow definition.
In the NiFi Flow Configuration field, select the JSON file you
            downloaded from NiFi.Alternatively, you can drop the JSON file into this field to
              select it.
Optional:You can add comments to the flow definition version you are importing
              (Version Comments).noteWhen you are importing the first
              version of a flow definition, the Version Comments field
              contains Initial Version by default. You can change this comment if
              needed.
Click Import.
