Connecting applications to an endpoint
Once a dataflow deployment with inbound connection is available, you can go on and
        connect an external application to start sending data. 



A flow deployment with inbound connection is available.


A network connection through which the client can reach the flow
                        deployment endpoint is available.

You have been assigned at least the DFFlowUser role for
                    the environment to which you want to configure the inbound connection.



Select the dataflow deployment where you want to send data and go to Deployment Manager > Deployment Settings.

Select the NiFi Configuration tab.

Make a note of the Endpoint Hostname and port.

Click Download Client Certificate.

The X.509 client certificate downloads to your computer in PEM format.


Click Download Client Private Key to obtain the RSA
                    Private Key.

The unencrypted RSA Private Key encoded with PKCS8 downloads to your computer
                        in PEM format.


Depending on your client, you may have to convert the certificate and the
                    private key to a different format.

For example, to convert PEM to PKCS12 format, use the following command:
openssl pkcs12 -export -in [***DOWNLOADED PEM CERT FILE***] -inkey [***DOWNLOADED PEM PRIVATE KEY***] -out certificate.p12
 To further convert the PKCS12 file to JKS format for a Java client, run the
                        following command:
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore [***CERTIFICATE NAME***].p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore [***DESTINATION KEYSTORE***].jks


Add the certificate file and the private key files to the keystore of your
                    application.

Configure your application to stream data to the Endpoint Hostname, port, and
                    protocol of the CDF DataFlow Deployment.


TLS keys and certificatesWhen using Inbound Connection Endpoints, sensitive information is sent over the network   between Cloudera Data Flow (CDF) and external data sources including configuration files that   contain passwords. To secure this transfer, Cloudera strongly recommends that you configure mutual   Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption.
