Configure an Application Gateway in Azure
Learn about the settings required to set up an Azure Application Gateway to communicate
  with an Inbound Connection Endpoint.

Create an Azure Application Gateway service (you find it in the
    Networking services category) using the following settings:


Make the following Backend Pool settings:

Backend Pool without targets
Set to No.
Backend Targets


IP address or FQDN 
Set to the [*** Inbound Connection Endpoint Hostname
            ***] acquired from the NiFi settings of the flow deployment where
           you want to connect with your gateway.For example,
             my-endpoint.inbound.dfx.p8jdxchd.xcu2-8y8x.cloudera.site.


For all other settings you can keep the default values.tip
You can use a single gateway for multiple flow deployments, with rules for routing traffic
       to the correct flow deployment. For this scenario, setup multiple backend pools, one for each
       flow deployment.


Make the following Backend Settings:


If your flow listen processor uses TLS (recommended):

Backend protocol:
HTTPS
Trusted root certificate
Yes
Backend port
Match the port of your HTTP Listen Processor.
For all other settings you can keep the default values.



If your flow listen processor does not use TLS:

Backend protocol
HTTP
Backend port
Match the port of your HTTP Listen Processor.
For all other settings you can keep the default values.




tipYou can use a single Application Gateway for multiple
      HTTP listen processors, with rules to route traffic to the correct listen processor port. For
      this scenario, setup multiple backend settings, one for each listen processor.
