TLS keys and certificates
When using Inbound Connection Endpoints, sensitive information is sent over the network
  between Cloudera Data Flow (CDF) and external data sources including configuration files that
  contain passwords. To secure this transfer, Cloudera strongly recommends that you configure mutual
  Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption.
TLS is an industry standard set of cryptographic protocols for securing
   communications over a network.
Configuring TLS involves creating a private key and a public key for use by server
   and client processes to negotiate an encrypted connection. In addition, TLS can use certificates
   to verify the trustworthiness of keys presented during the negotiation to prevent spoofing and
   mitigate other potential security issues.
