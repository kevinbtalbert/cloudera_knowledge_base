Renewing certificates for Outbound Connection Endpoints
Learn about certificate renewal for Inbound Connection Endpoints.
For security reasons, the cerificates generated for Inbound Connection Endpoints need to be
   renewed after a certain period:

NiFi Inbound SSL Context Service - 90 days
Client SSL Context - 1 year
Client CA - 5 years

CDF polls certificate status, and they are automatically renewed 30 days before expiration. At
   this point you receive a notification on the  Alerts tab, asking you to
   restart the deployment so that the new certificate takes effect.
If it becomes necessary, for example, because a certificate is compromised, you can also renew
   certificates manually.

Renew certificates manually for an Inbound Connection EndpointIf you need to replace an X.509 certificate for an inbound connection endpoint before         it expires, you can do so manually.
