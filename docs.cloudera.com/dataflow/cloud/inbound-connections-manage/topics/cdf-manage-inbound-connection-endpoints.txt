Deleting and reassigning Inbound Connection Endpoints
Learn about deleting and reassigning Inbound Connection Endpoints.
noteInbound Connection Endpoints exist within the environment where they
   were created. They cannot be moved between environments. If you delete an environment, endpoints
   get destroyed as well and they cannot be reused.

To delete an Inbound Connection Endpoint, you need to terminate the flow deployment to which
    it is currently assigned, selecting the Delete assigned endpoint hostname
    option during termination.
To reassign an existing Inbound Connection Endpoint, you need to delete the flow deployment
    to which it is currently assigned, making sure that the Delete assigned endpoint
     hostname option is not selected. You can reassign existing, unassigned endpoints
    during flow deployment.
