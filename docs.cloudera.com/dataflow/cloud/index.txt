Cloudera DataFlow for Public Cloud (CDF-PC) is a cloud-native service that enables
self-serve deployments of Apache NiFi data flows from a central catalog.
DataFlow Deployments provides a cloud-native runtime to run your Apache NiFi 
flows through auto- scaling Kubernetes clusters, and centralized 
monitoring and alerting capabilities for the deployments.
DataFlow Functions provides a cloud-native runtime to run your Apache NiFi flows 
as functions on the serverless compute services of AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions, 
targeting use cases that do not require always running NiFi flows.
