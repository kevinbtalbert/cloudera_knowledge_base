Disabling DataFlow for an environment
Disabling DataFlow for an environment terminates the cloud infrastructure that was
  created as part of the enablement process. 
About this task
When you disable DataFlow for an environment, you can specify whether to preserve
   your environment event history. Preserving the event history retains your environment event
   history and allows you to view past events even after the environment has been disabled.
   Regardless of whether you choose to preserve the event history, you can enable DataFlow for an
   environment again after a successful disablement operation.
Steps
UICLI

In DataFlow, from the Environments page, select the environment
            you want to disable.
Click Manage DataFlow from the Environment
              Details pane. You are redirected to the Manage
                DataFlowpage. 
From the Actions menu, select Disable
              DataFlow. 
Specify whether you want to Preserve event history.
Enter the environment name to confirm.
Select Disable to initiate the disablement process.

Example






Before you begin

You have installed CDP CLI.
Run cdp df list-services to get the service-crn.


To disable DataFlow for an environment, enter:
      
cdp df disable-service 
--service-crn [***SERVICE_CRN***] 
[--persist] [--no-persist] 
[--terminate-deployments] [--no-terminate-deployments]
               [help]

Where:

service-crn – Provides the value you identified when you run cdp df
              list-services.
[--persist] [--no-persist] – Select one to specify whether you want to preserve environment
            history. 
[--terminate-deployments] [--no-terminate-deployments] – Specifies whether you want to
            gracefully terminate deployments associated with this environment. Regardless of this
            setting all associated deployments will be terminated when you disable DataFlow
