Clearing the DataFlow environment Event History


When disabling DataFlow for an environment, you can choose to preserve the Event
                History for the specific environment. This allows you to review past events even
                after DataFlow has been disabled for an environment. When the preserved events are
                no longer relevant, you can delete them by using the Clear Event
                    History action.
note
The Clear event history action is only available for disabled DataFlow
                    environments with a preserved event history.






You have the DFAdmin user role for the environment for which
                            you want to clear the event history.





Select the environment for which you want to clear the event history.

Click Manage DataFlow from the Environment
                        Details pane.
You are redirected to the Manage DataFlow
                    page.

From the Actions menu, select Clear event
                        history.

Select Clear Event History to confirm deleting all event-related information
                    and past alert conditions.


After successfully clearing the event history, you are no longer able to view the
                environment details by clicking on it. You can enable DF in the environment again by
                using the Enable button on the environment row.
