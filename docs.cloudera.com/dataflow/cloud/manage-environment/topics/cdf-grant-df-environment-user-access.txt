Managing Kubernetes API Server user access
 Giving users remote access to CDF environments allows authorized users to use
            kubectl to manage and troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters using the
        Kubernetes API. To do this, use the Actions menu from the
            Environments page.

The API server of the Kubernetes cluster which is created when enabling a CDP
                environment for DataFlow is secured using authentication and role based access
                control. By default no one is allowed to connect to the Kubernetes API server. You
                can grant users access to the Kubernetes API server by adding their AWS ARN to the
                list of Authorized Users so they can communicate with the
                cluster using Kubernetes management tools such as kubectl.



You have the DFAdmin user role. 

You have a cloud user ID. For AWS this is an ARN and looks similar to:

arn:aws:iam::{AWSaccountID}:role/{IAMRoleName}



See the AWS documentation for more information. 


In DataFlow, from the Environments page, click the
                        Environment for which you want to add or remove user access. 

Click Manage DataFlow. 

From the Actions menu, click Manage
                            Kubernetes API Server User Access. 

Provide the Cloud User ID you want to authorize. 



To add more than one user, add Cloud User IDs one by
                                    one.


To remove a user, click the remove icon for the
                                    particular row.





Download the kubeconfig file and share it with authorized users
                so they can connect to the cluster using their preferred Kubernetes management
                tools
