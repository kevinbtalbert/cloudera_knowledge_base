Managing DataFlow in an environment
You can use the DataFlow Manager page to manage and monitor your
  DataFlow environment.
The Actions drop-down menu in the DataFlow
        Manager page allows you to choose between the following options to manage
      DataFlow in an environment:
Disable DataFlow for the environment
Reset DataFlow for the environment
Manage user acces for the Kubernetes API Server
Download the Kubeconfig file
Renew certificates
Manage the environment details in Management Console

Apart from the information on your DataFlow Environment, the DataFlow
        Manager page also displays the capacity, networking, Kubernetes API Server
      endpoint access and tags of your environment under DataFlow Settings.
      You can edit the capacity settings of the environment, update the IP address ranges that are
      allowed to access the Kubernetes API Server and Load Balancer, and review the tags associated
      with the DataFlow environment under DataFlow Settings.
Click Manage DataFlow, from the Environment
    Details pane to perform some actions on your environment. The DataFlow
    Manager page appears.


You can also go back to the environment details by clicking Back to Environment
    Details.
