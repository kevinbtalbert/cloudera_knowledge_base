Renewing certificates 
Certificates for accessing DataFlow have a 90 day lifespan. They are automatically
        renewed after 60 days. Should you need to manually renew your certificates you can use the
        Actions menu to do so.

From the Environments page, click
                        Actions.

Select Renew Certificates from the drop-down menu.

Confirm by clicking Renew Certificates.

note
Renewing your certificates assigns new certificates for accessing
                            DataFlow. The old certificates are not revoked.
