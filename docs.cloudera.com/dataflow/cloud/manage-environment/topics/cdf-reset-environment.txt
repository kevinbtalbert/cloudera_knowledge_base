Resetting your environment
When disabling DataFlow for a specific environment fails, you can use the
            Reset Environment action to reset an environment state for
        DataFlow



You have the DFAdmin user role for the
                        environment you want to reset.




In DataFlow, from the Environment page, select the
                    environment you want to reset.

Click Manage DataFlow from the Environment
                        Details pane.
You are redirected to the Manage DataFlow
                    page.

From the Actions menu, select Reset
                        Environment.

Click Reset in the confirmation dialog to proceed.


Resetting an environment clears DataFlow state without impacting the associated CDP
                environment and any of its components including Data Hubs, Data Lakes, and FreeIPA.
                If the associated CDP environment is still healthy, resetting allows you to enable
                it again for DataFlow.
note
Resetting an environment does not delete associated cloud resources which were
                    created during its enablement process. Manual steps may be necessary to address
                    these orphaned resources in your cloud account.
