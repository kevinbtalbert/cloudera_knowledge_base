Deleting a flow definition
You can delete a flow definition along with all its versions from the Cloudera

You have imported at least one flow definition.

In the DataFlow UI, from the left navigation pane, click

Flow definitions available for you to deploy are displayed, one definition
                        per row.


Identify the flow definition you wish to delete, and click the row to display
                    the flow definition details and versions.

From the Actions drop-down, select Delete
                        Flow Definition.
