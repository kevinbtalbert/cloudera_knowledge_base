Downloading the latest version of a flow definition
You can directly download the latest version of a flow definition from the Cloudera
        DataFlow UI.
You have imported at least one flow definition.

In the DataFlow UI, from the left navigation pane, click
                        Catalog.

Flow definitions available for you to deploy are displayed, one definition
                        per row.


Identify the flow definition you wish to download, and click the row to display
                    the flow definition details and versions.

From the Actions drop-down, select Download
                        Latest Version.

Click Download.


The JSON file of the flow definition is downloaded. After you download the JSON file
                for a flow definition, you need to import it to add it to the Flow Catalog.
