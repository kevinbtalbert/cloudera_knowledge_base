Managing flow definitions in Cloudera DataFlow
In Cloudera DataFlow, your flow definitions are available in the Flow
      Catalog. You can browse, discover, and manage flow definition versions in the
      Catalog view. You can also deploy and reuse your flow definitions
    across multiple environments.


Import your NiFi flow into Cloudera DataFlow to make them available as flow definitions
          in the Flow Catalog.
Make sure that you have DFCatalogAdmin permission to perform this
          task. For information on account and resource roles, see DataFlow
            Authorization.
