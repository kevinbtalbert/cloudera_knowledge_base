Changing NiFi runtime version
You can change the NiFi runtime version for your flow deployment. Generally, you
        change NiFi runtime version to pick up hotfixes and the latest NiFi version. However, when
        you create a flow deployment you can also pick the NiFi version to align with your flow
        certification needs. Cloudera recommends that you always use the latest NiFi version if
        possible.

If you opt to change the NiFi runtime version, the process is carried out node by
                node. If your flow deployment has multiple nodes, the flow deployment continues to
                run. If the flow deployment has only one node, it stops for a short period of
                time.


You must have deployed a flow definition in Cloudera DataFlow and you must have the
                DFFlowAdmin role.
