Accessing Deployment Manager
You can use the Deployment Manager page to manage your flow
    deployment lifecycle.
The Actions drop-down menu in the Deployment
         Manager page allows you to view your flow deployment in NiFi for
         troubleshooting purposes. It also allows you to change NiFi runtime version. You can
         suspend a flow deployment. Suspending a flow deployment means that the flow deployment
         stops processing data but cloud resources remain allocated for the flow deployment. You
         can also terminate your flow deployment. Terminating a flow deployment deletes the
         associated NiFi resources. 
Apart from the details of your flow deployment, the Deployment
             Manager page also displays KPIs and alerts, sizing and scaling, and
             parameters details of your flow deployment under Deployment
                 Settings. You can edit the KPIs, alerts, parameters, size and scale
             details of your flow deployment under Deployment Settings.
To access the Deployment Manager page:

Open Cloudera DataFlow by clicking the DataFlow tile
                        in the CDP sidebar.

Select the flow deployment you want to manage, expanding the
                        Deployment Details pane.

Click Manage Deployments. 





The Deployment Manager page appears.

Generally, you         change NiFi runtime version to pick up hotfixes and the latest NiFi version. However, when         you create a flow deployment you can also pick the NiFi version to align with your flow         certification needs. Cloudera recommends that you always use the latest NiFi version if         possible.Terminating a deploymentYou can terminate a deployment from Cloudera DataFlow.Editing a flow deploymentYou can edit the KPIs, alerts, parameters, size and scale details of your flow   deployment under Deployment Settings or using the CDP CLI.
