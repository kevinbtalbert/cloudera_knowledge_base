Suspending a flow deployment
You can suspend a flow deployment in Cloudera DataFlow

Suspending a flow deployment  results in the following:


All processors are stopped and no data processing happens within the flow
                        deployment.


KPI alerts are suspended. Your KPI alerts are activated again when the flow
                        is restarted. 


Any active KPI alerts are resolved. 


All underlying cloud resources remain allocated for the flow deployment.



You must have deployed a flow definition in Cloudera DataFlow.

Click Actions in the Deployment
                            Manager page.

The Suspend [Deployment Name] page appears.
