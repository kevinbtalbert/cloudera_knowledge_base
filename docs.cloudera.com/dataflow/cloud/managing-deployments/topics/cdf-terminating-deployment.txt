Terminating a deployment
You can terminate a deployment from Cloudera DataFlow.

If you terminate a deployment, you delete the associated NiFi resources and your flow
                no longer remains active. The associated flow definition remains in the catalog and
                is available to be deployed again in a new deployment.

You must have deployed a flow definition in Cloudera DataFlow.

Click Actions in the Deployment
                            Manager page.






Click Terminate.
The Terminate [Deployment Name] page appears.

Enter the name of the deployment to confirm and click
                        Terminate.

Alternately, click the clipboard icon to copy the deployment name and paste
                        the name of the deployment, and then click
                        Terminate.
