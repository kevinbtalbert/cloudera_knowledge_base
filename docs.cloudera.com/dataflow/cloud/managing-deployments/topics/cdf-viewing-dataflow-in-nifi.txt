Viewing data flow in NiFi
You can go to the NiFi cluster where your flow is deployed and view or edit the data
        flow.

When you access the NiFi cluster, the ability to view or edit the flow is based on
                your DataFlow authorizations. The DFFlowUser role has read-only privileges. The
                DFFlowAdmin role has full privileges.

You must have deployed a data flow in Cloudera DataFlow.

Click Actions in the Deployment
                            Manager page.






Click View in NiFi.

The UI for the NiFi cluster where your flow is deployed opens.


View your data flow or edit it based on your NiFi privileges.

If you edit the flow in NiFi and want the changes to exist in a new
                        deployment, perform the following steps:



Download the flow as a flow definition.
For more information, see Downloading a flow definition from
                                NiFi.


Import the flow definition (as a new flow definition or as a new
                            version of an existing flow definition).
For more information, see Importing a flow definition to
                                Cloudera DataFlow.


Deploy the flow definition.
For more information, see Deploy a flow.
