Connection KPIs
Connection KPIs expose the metrics that NiFi provides for the connection used in the
  NiFi data flow. Choosing Connection allows you to set alerts based on any
  of the connection metrics that the data flow monitors.

Metric name: Bytes Queued
Metric unit: Bytes
Meaning: How much data is stored in a queue?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the data queued in the selected queue or
     connection is either more than what is specified in the upper boundary or less than what is
     specified in the lower boundary for the given time period.
Metric name: Percent Full
Metric unit: Percentage
Meaning: How much of the queue's capacity is used?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the data queued in the selected queue or
     connection is either more than what is specified in the upper boundary or less than what is
     specified in the lower boundary for the given time period.


Metric name: Flow Files Queued
Metric unit: Count
Meaning: How many flow files are queued in this connection?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated number of flowfiles queued for the
     selected queue or connection is either higher than what is specified in the upper boundary or
     less than what is specified in the lower boundary for the given time period.
