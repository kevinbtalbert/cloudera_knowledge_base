Entire Flow KPIs
Entire Flow KPIs expose the metrics that NiFi provides for the entire data flow.
  Choosing Entire Flow enables you to set alerts based on any of the flow
  metrics that the data flow monitors.

Metric name: Data In
Metric unit: Bytes/sec
Meaning: How much data did the entire flow receive from external systems per second?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated data received for the entire flow
     is either below the specified lower threshold or above the upper threshold for the given time
     period.
Metric name: Data Out
Metric unit: Bytes/sec
Meaning: How much data did the entire flow send to external systems per second?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated data sent for the entire flow is
     either below the specified lower threshold or above the upper threshold for the given time
     period.


Metric name: Flow Files Queued
Metric unit: Count
Meaning: How many flow files are queued in all connections of the flow?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated number of flowfiles queued for all
     connections of the flow is either higher than what is specified in the upper boundary or less
     than what is specified in the lower boundary for the given time period.
