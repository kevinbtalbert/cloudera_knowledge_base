Introduction to monitoring flow deployments
The Cloudera DataFlow UI is the central monitoring console for all your deployments
  across environments. It is the space where you can monitor flow metrics and infrastructure usage,
  and manage deployments. 
In the Cloudera DataFlow UI, you can monitor the status of your deployment and whether the
      deployment meets performance expectations. You can filter and sort your deployments based on
      your requirements. You can also fetch details for your deployments for a specified time period
      and refresh deployment data.
You can monitor the key performance indicators (KPIs), system metrics, and alerts set for your
      deployments in the Cloudera DataFlow UI. You get alerts for deployments breaching certain
      assigned KPIs and get recommendations about how to tune your deployments. You also receive
      alerts if there are issues in your deployment.
After you deploy a flow definition, you can monitor the deployment in the
        Dashboard of Cloudera DataFlow.
