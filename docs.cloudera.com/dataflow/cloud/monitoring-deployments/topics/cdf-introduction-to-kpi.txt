Introduction to key performance indicators
You can use Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor critical parts of your NiFi
  deployments on the central monitoring dashboard. You do not need to drill deep into the NiFi data
  flow and find the metric to monitor it in NiFi. You can also choose to create alerts for your KPIs
  in Cloudera DataFlow. 
Apache NiFi has multiple metrics to monitor for the system such as memory usage, CPU usage,
   data flow statistics and so on. KPIs are representations of those metrics for a NiFi component in
   Cloudera DataFlow.
You can set alerts while configuring KPIs in your deployment. If you set an alert for a KPI
   scope and metric combination, you get alerted if your flow definition meets the conditions set in
   that alert.


In the above image, a KPI is set for the Entire Flow KPI scope and
    Data In metric combination. When the data into the entire flow exceeds
   the 1MB boundary, an alert is created. No alert boundary is set for the
    Processor KPI scope and Average Linear Duration
   metric combination.
