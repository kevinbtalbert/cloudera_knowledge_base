KPI scope types in Cloudera DataFlow
KPI scope specifies the focus area of the KPI for the flow deployment. You can select
  individual NiFi components such as a processor or connection, or larger components such as a
  process group or the entire flow.
You can track the different statistics of a NiFi data flow by using the following KPI
   scopes:

Connection
Processor
Process Group
Entire Flow
System


Connection KPIsConnection KPIs expose the metrics that NiFi provides for the connection used in the   NiFi data flow. Choosing Connection allows you to set alerts based on any   of the connection metrics that the data flow monitors.Processor KPIsProcessor KPIs expose the metrics that NiFi provides for the processors. Choosing    Processor allows you to set alerts based on any of the processor metrics   that the data flow monitors.Process Group KPIsProcess Group KPIs expose the metrics that NiFi provides for the process groups.             Choosing Process Group enables you to set alerts based on any of             the process group metrics that the data flow monitors.Entire Flow KPIsEntire Flow KPIs expose the metrics that NiFi provides for the entire data flow.   Choosing Entire Flow enables you to set alerts based on any of the flow   metrics that the data flow monitors.System KPIsSystem KPIs expose the metrics that NiFi provides for the system. Choosing    System allows you to set alerts based on any of the system metrics that   the data flow monitors.
