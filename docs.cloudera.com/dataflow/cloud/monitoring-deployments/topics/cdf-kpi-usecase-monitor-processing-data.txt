Use KPIs to monitor whether your data flow is processing data
Learn how to use KPIs to monitor whether your data flow is processing
        data.
You want to track how much data
            your flow is receiving from external systems or processing to an external system. It is
            a common use case where you might want to track whether your flow is reading or writing
            data as expected.
You can achieve your goal by
            selecting appropriate KPI scope and metric while deploying your flow in Cloudera
            DataFlow. Select Entire Flow KPI scope and Data
                In or Data Out metric to track. Select
                Data In metric to track how much data your flow is reading
            and Data Out metric to track how much data your flow is writing
            to the external system. In this example, Data In metric is
            selected. The Data In metric tracks rate of data received from an external source in
            bytes.
You must have reached the Add New KPI screen while deploying
            your flow in Cloudera DataFlow.

Select Entire Flow as the KPI scope.

Select Data In as the metric to track.

Configure the alert settings as per your requirement or when you want to be
                    alerted.

Click Apply.
Similarly, you can set other metrics and alerts as per your
                    requirement.



In this example, you get an alert when your flow is receiving less than 2 MB data
                    per second for 5 minutes.
