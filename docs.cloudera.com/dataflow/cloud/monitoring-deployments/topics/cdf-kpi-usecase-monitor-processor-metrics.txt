Use KPIs to monitor individual processor metrics
Learn how to use KPIs to monitor individual processor metrics.
You want to track a specific metric for a processor in
            your data flow. 
You can achieve your goal by selecting appropriate KPI
            scope and metric while deploying your flow in Cloudera DataFlow. Select
                Processor KPI scope, the processor you want to monitor in the
                Processor Name field, and the metric you want to track. In
            this example, Bytes Sent metric is selected. The Bytes Sent
            metric tracks number of bytes sent to an external recipient. 
You must have reached the Add New KPI screen while deploying
            your flow in Cloudera DataFlow.

Select Processor as the KPI scope.

Select Bytes Sent as the metric to track.

Configure the alert settings as per your requirement or when you want to be
                    alerted.

Click Apply.
Similarly, you can set other metrics and alerts as per your
                    requirement.


In this example, Processor KPI scope and Bytes
                        Sent metric to track are selected. No alert is set here.
