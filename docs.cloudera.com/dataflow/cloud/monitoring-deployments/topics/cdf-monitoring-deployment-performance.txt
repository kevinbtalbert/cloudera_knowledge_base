Monitor performance of deployments
You can monitor performance of your deployments in the Dashboard
  page of the Cloudera DataFlow UI.
To monitor performance, you can monitor the KPIs, system metrics, and alerts set for your
   deployments in the Cloudera DataFlow UI. Click on each deployment to get the details of KPIs,
   system metrics, and alerts. Alternately, you can click on the arrow placed at the end of each
   deployment row.

Key performance indicators for NiFi flow deploymentsApache NiFi has multiple metrics to monitor the system such as memory usage, CPU usage,         data flow statistics, and so on. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are representations of         those metrics for a NiFi component in Cloudera DataFlow. You can use KPIs to monitor         critical parts of your NiFi deployments on the central monitoring dashboard of Cloudera         DataFlow.System metrics for NiFi flow deploymentsCloudera DataFlow provides comprehensive NiFi cluster-specific metrics on core     allocation, disk capacity utilisation, CPU utilisation, and disk usage. You can investigate     these system metrics to identify and resolve performance issues related to your NiFi     deployments.Alerts for NiFi flow deploymentsYou can set alerts while configuring KPIs in your deployment. If you set an alert for a         KPI and metric combination, you get alerted if your flow definition meets the conditions set         in that alert.
