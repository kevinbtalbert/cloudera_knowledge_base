Key performance indicators for NiFi flow deployments
Apache NiFi has multiple metrics to monitor the system such as memory usage, CPU usage,
        data flow statistics, and so on. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are representations of
        those metrics for a NiFi component in Cloudera DataFlow. You can use KPIs to monitor
        critical parts of your NiFi deployments on the central monitoring dashboard of Cloudera
        DataFlow.
For more information on KPIs, see KPI Overview and Using KPIs.
