Process Group KPIs
Process Group KPIs expose the metrics that NiFi provides for the process groups.
            Choosing Process Group enables you to set alerts based on any of
            the process group metrics that the data flow monitors.

Metric name: Bytes Queued
Metric unit: Bytes
Meaning: How much data is queued, in total, in queues of the selected process group?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated data queued for the selected
     process group is either more than what is specified in the upper boundary or less than what is
     specified in the lower boundary for the given time period.
Metric name: Bytes Received
Metric unit: Bytes
Meaning: How much data is received by the selected process group within the flow?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated data received by the selected
     process group is either below the specified lower threshold or above the upper threshold for
     the given time period.
Metric name: Bytes Sent
Metric unit: Bytes
Meaning: How much data is sent by the selected process group within the flow?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated data sent by the selected process
     group is either below the specified lower threshold or above the specified upper threshold for
     the given time period.
Metric name: Flowfiles Input
Metric unit: Count
Meaning: How many flowfiles are received by the selected process group within the flow?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated number of flowfiles received by
     the selected process group is either below the specified lower threshold or above the specified
     upper threshold for the given time period.
Metric name: Flowfiles Out
Metric unit: Count
Meaning: How many flowfiles are sent by the selected process group within the flow?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated number of flowfiles sent by the
     selected process group is either below the specified lower threshold or above the specified
     upper threshold for the given time period.
Metric name: Flowfiles Queued
Metric unit: Count
Meaning: How many flowfiles are queued, in total, in queues for the selected process
                              group?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated number of flowfiles queued for the
     selected process group is either higher than what is specified in the upper boundary or less
     than what is specified in the lower boundary for the given time period.
Metric name: Flowfiles Received
Metric unit: Count
Meaning: How many flowfiles are received from a source that is external to the flow?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated number of flowfiles received from
     a source that is external to the flow is either above the specified in the upper boundary or
     below the specified in the lower boundary.
Metric name: Flowfiles Sent
Metric unit: Count
Meaning: How many flowfiles are sent to an external recipient?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated number of flowfiles sent to an
     external recipient is either above the specified in the upper boundary or below the specified
     in the lower boundary.
