Processor KPIs
Processor KPIs expose the metrics that NiFi provides for the processors. Choosing
   Processor allows you to set alerts based on any of the processor metrics
  that the data flow monitors.

Metric name: Average Lineage Duration
Metric unit: Seconds
Meaning: How much time elapsed between when the original source data was received and the
     time at which this processing event occurred?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the average lineage duration for all flowfiles
     within the specified time period is either above the upper boundary or below the lower
     boundary.
Metric name: Bytes In
Metric unit: Bytes
Meaning: How much data is received by the selected processor?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated data received by the selected
     processor is either below the specified lower threshold or above the specified upper threshold
     for the given time period.
Metric name: Bytes Out
Metric unit: Bytes
Meaning: How much data is sent by the selected processor?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated data sent by the selected
     processor is either below the specified lower threshold or above the specified upper threshold
     for the given time period.
Metric name: Bytes Queued
Metric unit: Bytes
Meaning: How much content is queued for the selected processor?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the data queued for the selected precessor is
     either more than what is specified in the upper boundary or less than specified in the lower
     boundary for the given time period.
Metric name: Bytes Received
Metric unit: Bytes
Meaning: How much data is received from a source that is external to the flows?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the data received or read by the selected
     precessor is either more than what is specified in the upper boundary or less than what is
     specified in the lower boundary for the given time period.
Metric name: Bytes Sent
Metric unit: Bytes
Meaning: How much data is sent to an external recipient?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the data sent by the selected precessor is either
     more than what is specified in the upper boundary or less than specified in the lower boundary
     for the given time period.
Metric name: Flowfiles Input to Processor
Metric unit: Count
Meaning: How many flowfiles are received from a source within the flow?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the number of flowfiles received from a source
     within the flow is either more than the specified in the upper boundary or less than the
     specified in the lower boundary for the given time period.
Metric name: Flowfiles Out from Processor
Metric unit: Count
Meaning: How many flowfiles are sent out of the processor?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the number of flowfiles sent out of the processor
     is either more than the specified in the upper boundary or less than the specified in the lower
     boundary for the given time period.
Metric name: Flowfiles Received
Metric unit: Count
Meaning: How many flowfiles are received by the selected processor from a source that is
                              external to the flows?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated number of flowfiles received by
     the selected processor is either below the specified lower threshold or above the upper
     threshold for the given time period.
Metric name: Flowfiles Sent
Metric unit: Count
Meaning: How many flowfiles are sent by the selected processor to an external
                              recipient?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the aggregated number of flowfiles sent by the
     selected processor is either below the specified lower threshold or above the upper threshold
     for the given time period.
