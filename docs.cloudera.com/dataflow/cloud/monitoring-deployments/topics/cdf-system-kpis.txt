System KPIs
System KPIs expose the metrics that NiFi provides for the system. Choosing
   System allows you to set alerts based on any of the system metrics that
  the data flow monitors.

Metric name: CPU Utilization
Metric unit: Percentage
Meaning: How much of the available CPU to the entire cluster is being used by
          deployment?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the CPU utilization is either above the specified
          upper threshold or below the specified lower threshold for the given time period. For
          example, if the threshold is 80% and the time period is 5 minutes, all data points that
          are being captured within five minutes must show a higher utilization than 80%, to trigger
          an alert.


Metric name: Core Allocation
Metric unit: Count
Meaning: How many cores are allocated?
Threshold: Upper and lower boundary
You can use this KPI to create alerts when the core allocation is either above the specified
     upper threshold or below the specified lower threshold for the given time period.
