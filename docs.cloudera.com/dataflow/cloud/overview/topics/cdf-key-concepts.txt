Cloudera DataFlow key concepts
Learn about the key concepts and terms used in Cloudera DataFlow (CDF).
Flow definition
A flow definition represents the data flow logic developed in Apache NiFi
        and exported by using the Download Flow Definition action on a NiFi
        process group or the root canvas. Flow definitions typically leverage parameterization to
        make the flows portable between for example development and production NiFi
        environments.
To run an existing NiFi data flow in CDF, you have to export it as a flow
        definition and upload it to the CDF Catalog.

Catalog
The CDF Catalog is where your flow definitions are stored and where you
        manage the CDF flow definition lifecycle from import through versioning to deletion. The
        Catalog is also the place from where you can initiate new deployments from.

Flow deployment
A flow deployment represents a NiFi cluster running on Kubernetes and
        executing a specific flow definition. When you initiate the flow deployment process from the
        CDF Catalog, a deployment wizard helps you turn a flow definition into a flow deployment.
        When using the wizard, specify your environment, provide configuration parameters,
        auto-scaling settings and KPI definitions for your flow deployment.

Deployment Manager
The Deployment Manager allows you to review and modify flow deployment parameters,
        settings for size and scaling, and KPI and alert definitions. It also allows you to initiate
        NiFi version upgrades, access the NiFi canvas of your flow deployments as well as terminate
        them. Click the Manage Deployment link in the Deployment
          Details pane to access the Deployment Manager.

Function
A function is a flow that is uploaded into the DataFlow Catalog and that
        can be run in serverless mode by serverless cloud provider services.

Environment
CDF works in the context of CDP environments. You can enable the DataFlow service
        for any supported environment you have registered with CDP. The enablement process creates
        the Kubernetes infrastructure required by CDF and each environment maps to one Kubernetes
        cluster.
Once DataFlow has been enabled for an environment, you can start deploying flow
        definitions to it.

ReadyFlow
A ReadyFlow is a predefined, out-of-the-box data flow which can be
        immediately deployed by providing a small set of required parameters.

ReadyFlow Gallery
The ReadyFlow Gallery is where you can find all available ReadyFlows. To
        use a ReadyFlow, you need to add it from the ReadyFlow Gallery to the Catalog and then use
        it to create a Flow Deployment.

KPI
Apache NiFi has multiple metrics to monitor the different statistics of the
        system such as memory usage, CPU usage, data flow statistics, and so on. Key Performance
          Indicators (KPIs) are representations of those metrics for a NiFi component in
        Cloudera DataFlow. They provide a critical monitoring tool for a real-time view into your
        data flow performance.

Dashboard
The Dashboard is the central monitoring component within CDF showing all
        flow deployments across environments at a glance. For each flow deployment, you can open the
        Deployment Details pane, which shows you the KPIs you have defined, system metrics, as well
        as system events and alerts.
