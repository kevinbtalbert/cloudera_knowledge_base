Install custom Python libraries in flow deployments
If your data flow requires custom Python packages you can modify your Python script
        to install these dependencies through the use of NiFi processors.

Create a Python script, to install the package you want to add:
#!/usr/bin/python3
try: import [***PACKAGE NAME***] as [***IMPORT AS***]
except ImportError:
    from pip._internal import main as pip
    pip(['install', '--user', '[***PACKAGE NAME***]])
    import [***PACKAGE NAME***] as [***IMPORT AS***]
import sys
file = [***IMPORT AS***].read_csv(sys.stdin)Replace
                        [***PACKAGE NAME***] with the name of the package you
                    want to import and [***IMPORT AS***] with a meaningful name
                    you want the package to be called in your data flow.

#!/usr/bin/python3
try: import pandas as pd
except ImportError:
    from pip._internal import main as pip
    pip(['install', '--user', 'pandas'])
    import pandas as pd
import sys
file = pd.read_csv(sys.stdin)


Open the flow definition which requires custom packages in NiFi.

Add and configure an ExecuteStreamCommand processor to run
                        your script.
Make the following property settings:
Command Arguments
provide #{Script}
Command Path
provide python
Leave all other properties with their default values.

Add and configure a processor that allows uploading file-based resources as
                        part of its deployment in CDF-PC.

This procedure uses FetchHDFS as an example. For this
                            processor make the following configuration:

Hadoop Configuration Resources
provide #{Script}

Leave all other parameters with their default values.
noteDo not connect this processor to your flow. Its
                            only role is to enable file upload during flow deployment.


Download the data flow as a flow definition from NiFi and import it to
                        Cloudera DataFlow.

Initiate a flow deployment from the Catalog. In the
                            Parameters step of the
                            Deployment Wizard, upload your Python script to
                        the Script parameter. Complete the
                            Wizard and submit your deployment request.

Your Python script is uploaded to the flow deployment and
            the required custom libraries are installed when the script is executed as part of the
            data flow.
