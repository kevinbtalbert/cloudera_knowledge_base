To enable DataFlow for an environment, users must have the
            DFAdmin role. Grant the DFAdmin role to a
        user or group that should be allowed enable CDF for an environment. 


You have the CDP PowerUser role.



From the Cloudera Management Console, click
                    Environments.

Use the search field to find and select the CDP environment for which you want
                    to grant DFAdmin rights. 

Click Actions | Manage Access to display the
                        Environment Access page.

Find the user to whom you want to grant the DFAdmin
                    role, and click Update Roles.

From the Update Roles page, select
                        DFAdmin and click
                    Update.







When you have finished granting a user or group administrator permissions, they can
                now proceed by enabling DataFlow for an environment.
