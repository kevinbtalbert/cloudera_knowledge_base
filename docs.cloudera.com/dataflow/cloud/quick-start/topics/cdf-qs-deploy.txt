Deploy the Hello World ReadyFlow
Learn about the steps to deploy the Hello World Flow to get started with Cloudera
        DataFlow.

Once you have added the Hello World ReadyFlow into the
                Catalog, stay in the Catalog and use
                the Deployment wizard to deploy that flow definition. 




You have an enabled and healthy CDF environment.


You have imported the Hello World Flow flow definition.


You have been assigned the DFCatalogAdmin
                        role granting you access to the Catalog.


You have been assigned the DFFlowAdmin role
                        for the environment to which you want to deploy the flow definition.




To launch the Deployment wizard, click the row of the
                        Hello World Flow to display the flow definition
                    details and versions. 






Click Deploy to launch the Deployment
                        wizard.






From the Deployment wizard, select the Target
                        Environment to which you want to deploy the ReadyFlow.

The Deployment wizard only displays environments:


For which DataFlow is enabled


That are in a healthy state


To which you have access 




Click Continue.

From the Overview, give your flow deployment a unique
                    name. 

noteFlow Deployment names need to be unique. The Deployment
                            Wizard indicates whether a name is valid by displaying a
                        green check below the Deployment Name text
                        box.

                        New KPI to add a Key Performance Indicator. It lets you monitor
                    the performance of your DataFlow deployment.






To learn about the use of Key Performance Indicaators (KPIs), add a KPI that
                    will track how much data the processor is writing to the destination files. The
                    KPI will  raise an alert whenever this value goes below 1MB. 
Set  the following properties:
KPI Scope
select Processor.
Processor Name
select Write "Added Content" Events to
                                File.
Metric to Track
select Bytes Sent
Alerts
select Trigger alert when metric is less than
                                and set value to 1
MBytes.
Alert will be triggered when metric is outside the boundary(s)
                                for
set to 2 Minutes.




Click Add, to create the KPI.

Click Next.

Once you click Deploy, you are redirected to the
                    Alerts tab in the detail view for the deployment where
                you can track its progress.
