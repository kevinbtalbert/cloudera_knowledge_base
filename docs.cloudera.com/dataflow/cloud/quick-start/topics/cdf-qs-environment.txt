Enable DataFlow for your environment
Before you can deploy flow definitions, you must enable CDF for a CDP Public Cloud
        environment. Enabling CDF for an environment means that you are preparing an active and
        healthy CDP environment for use with CDF.


You have a cloud provider account and meet the infrastructure and network
                    requirements.
You have a healthy CDP environment, with FreeIPA and the data lake running and
                    healthy.
You have the DFAdmin role for the CDP environment for
                    which you want to enable DataFlow. 



Navigate to DataFlow, by selecting DataFlow from the CDP Home Page.

In DataFlow, navigate to Environments, and click
                        Enable to launch the Enable
                        Environment dialog for the environment you want to enable. 

From Enable Environment, provide the following
                    information:


DataFlow Capacity â€“ Specifies Kubernetes cluster
                            minimum and maximum size
Networking

Specify whether a public endpoint should be deployed to access CDF
                            components via the internet.note
CDF only makes this option selectable if it detects that at least
                                    one subnet in your environment is considered a public
                                    subnet.

A list of source IP address ranges which are allowed to connect to the
                            Kubernetes API server.



Click Enable. Enabling CDF can take up to one
                    hour.







When you have finished enabling DataFlow for an environment, proceed by giving users
                permission to import and deploy flow definitions.
