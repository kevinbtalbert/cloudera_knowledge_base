Give users access
Cloudera DataFlow restricts who can import flow definitions and deploy them. To get
        started with CDF, you must grant users permissions to perform these tasks so that they can
        import and deploy flow definitions in CDF. 

To get started with importing and deploying flow definitions, a user will need to
                have the following DataFlow roles, at minimum:

DFCatalogAdmin – To import flow definitions to the CDF
                        Catalog
DFFlowAdmin – To deploy flow definitions in CDF 




You have a PowerUser role.
You know the user or group name to which you want to grant CDF user access
                    roles.



Give a user permission to import flow definitions.


From Cloudera Management Console, click User

                            definitions.

                                Environment Access page.
