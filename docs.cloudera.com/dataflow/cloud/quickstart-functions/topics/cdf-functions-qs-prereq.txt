Prerequisites for running the Quickstart
This section helps you to examine the list of actions you must perfom before you start
    working on your function.

Get the CRN (Customer Resource Number) of the flow definiton.


Download the flow definition for this use case and upload it into your DataFlow
              Catalog.
Once you have the flow definition in the Catalog, copy its CRN with its version.
                For
                  example:crn:cdp:df:us-west-1:558bc1d3-8867-4357-8524-311d51289233:flow:Resize-Image/v.1

noteMake sure you have the full CRN with the flow version as the
            end. For more information, see Retrieving data flow CRN.


Make sure that you have a CDP machine user created.

This machine user is used when the function is triggered to retrieve the flow
            definition to be executed. For more information, see Creating CDP service account.


Give the CDP machine user the appropriate role and generate the necessary keys.

For more information, see Provisioning Access Key ID and Private Key.


Download the DataFlow Functions binary from the Functions page of Cloudera DataFlow for
          the cloud provider of your choice.




noteThis quickstart leverages the CLI of the cloud providers to
            make deploying the function straightforward. If you want to deploy your function using
            the control plane UI of the cloud provider, see the appropriate section of the DataFlow
            Functions documentation. The instructions provided in this quickstart are based on using
            the CLI of the cloud provider.
