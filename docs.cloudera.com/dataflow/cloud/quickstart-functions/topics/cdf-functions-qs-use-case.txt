Use case
The quickstart is based on a 'Resize Image web service' use case.
This use case shows you how to deploy a serverless microservice to resize images
      using NiFi on any of the three main cloud providers. You deploy a function that is triggered
      by an HTTP call. In this HTTP call, you send an image with optional HTTP headers to specify
      the new dimensions of the image. The DataFlow function will return the resized image.
