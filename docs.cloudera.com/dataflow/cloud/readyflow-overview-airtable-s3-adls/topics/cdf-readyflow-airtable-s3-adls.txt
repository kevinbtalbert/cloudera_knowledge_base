ReadyFlow overview: Airtable to S3/ADLS
You can use the Airtable to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow to consume objects from an
  Airtable table, filter them, and write them as JSON, CSV or Avro files to a destination in Amazon
  S3 or Azure Data Lake Service (ADLS).
This ReadyFlow consumes objects from an Airtable table, filtered by field name(s). You can pick
   whether to include metadata or to extract only the Airtable fields. The objects are then
   converted to the specified output data format and written to the target S3 or ADLS destination.
   The flow writes out a file every time its size has either reached 100 MB or five minutes have
   passed. Files can reach a maximum size of 1 GB. Failed S3 or ADLS write operations are retried
   automatically to handle transient issues. Define a KPI on the
    failure_WriteToS3/ADLS connection to monitor failed write operations.
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.
