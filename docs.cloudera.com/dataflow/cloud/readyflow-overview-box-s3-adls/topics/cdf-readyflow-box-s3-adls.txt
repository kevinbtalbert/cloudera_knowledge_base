ReadyFlow overview: Box to S3/ADLS
You can use the Box to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow to move data from a source Box
  location to a destination Amazon S3 bucket or Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) location.
This ReadyFlow consumes files from a Box folder and writes them to a CDP managed destination S3
   or ADLS location. For the source, specify the Box App credentials (Account ID, config file) and
   the Box folder ID. You can choose whether to include subfolder files. For the destination,
   specify the S3 or ADLS storage location and path. The ReadyFlow polls the Box folder for new
   files (it performs a listing periodically). Failed S3 or ADLS write operations are retried
   automatically to handle transient issues. Define a KPI on the
    failure_WriteToS3/ADLS connection to monitor failed write operations.
note
This ReadyFlow leverages CDP's centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure
    to either set up an IDBroker mapping or Ranger policies when using fine-grained object store
    access allowing your workload user access to the destination S3 or ADLS location.
