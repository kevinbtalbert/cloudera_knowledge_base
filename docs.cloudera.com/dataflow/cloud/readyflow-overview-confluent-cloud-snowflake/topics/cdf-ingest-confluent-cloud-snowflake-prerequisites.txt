Prerequisites
Learn how to collect the information you need to deploy the Confluent Cloud to Snowflake
  ReadyFlow, and meet other prerequisites.
For your data ingest source


You have created a Confluent Cloud Kafka cluster.


You have created at least one Kafka topic.


You have created a schema for your data in the Confluent Cloud Schema
      Registry.


You have the Confluent Cloud Kafka broker endpoint.


You have the Confluent Cloud Kafka client API Key and Secret.


You have the Kafka Consumer Group ID.


You have the Confluent Cloud Schema Registry endpoint.


You have the Confluent Cloud Schema Registry API Key and Secret.



For DataFlow


You have enabled DataFlow for an environment.
For information on how to enable DataFlow for an
              environment, see Enabling DataFlow for an Environment.


You have created a Machine User to use as the CDP Workload User.

You have given the CDP Workload User the
              EnvironmentUser role.

From the Management Console, go to the environment for
                  which DataFlow is enabled.
From the Actions drop down, click
                    Manage Access.
Identify the user you want to use as a Workload User.note
The CDP Workload User can be a machine user or your own user name. It is best
                      practice to create a dedicated Machine user for this.

Give that user EnvironmentUser role.



You have synchronized your user to the CDP Public Cloud environment that you enabled
              for DataFlow.
For information on how to synchronize your user to
              FreeIPA, see Performing User Sync.

You have granted your CDP user the
              DFCatalogAdmin and DFFlowAdmin roles to
            enable your user to add the ReadyFlow to the Catalog and deploy the flow definition.

Give a user permission to add the ReadyFlow to the
                    Catalog.
From the Management Console, click User
                        Management.
Enter the name of the user or group you wish to authorize in the
                        Search field.
Select the user or group from the list that displays.
Click Roles > Update Roles.
From Update Roles, select
                        DFCatalogAdmin and click
                        Update.noteIf the ReadyFlow
                        is already in the Catalog, then you can give your user just the
                          DFCatalogViewer role.

Give your user or group permission to deploy flow definitions.
From the Management Console, click
                        Environments to display the Environment
                        List page.
Select the environment to which you want your user or group to deploy flow
                      definitions.
Click Actions > Manage Access to display the Environment Access
                      page.
Enter the name of your user or group you wish to authorize in the
                        Search field.
Select your user or group and click Update
                      Roles.
Select DFFlowAdmin from the list of roles.
Click Update Roles.





For your data ingest target


You have created a Snowflake account.


Ensure that the Snowflake database and table you are ingesting data to exist.
            If not, create them.


You have set up your destination Snowflake table with the right columns and
            columns type.


Your Snowflake user account has write access to the Snowflake database
            table.


You have the schema of the Snowflake database. The default value is
            PUBLIC.

You have created Snowflake Private and Public Keys and assigned the Public Key to your
          Snowflake account user. For more information, see Key Pair Authentication in Snowflake documentation.
You have created your Snowflake Pipe and configured the file format for CSV input. For more information, see CREATE FILE FORMAT in Snowflake documentation.
