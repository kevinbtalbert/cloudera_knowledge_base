ReadyFlow: Confluent Cloud to Snowflake
You can use the Confluent Cloud to Snowflake ReadyFlow to move your data from a Kafka
  topic hosted in a Confluent Cloud Kafka cluster to a  Snowflake table.
This ReadyFlow consumes JSON, CSV or Avro data from a source Kafka topic in Confluent Cloud and
   parses the schema by looking up the schema name in the Confluent Schema Registry. You can filter
   events based on a user provided SQL query. The filtered events are then merged into CSV files,
   compressed into gzip format and written to the destination Snowflake DB table.
