ReadyFlow overview: Dropbox to S3/ADLS
You can use the Dropbox to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow to ingest data from Dropbox and
  write it to a destination in Amazon S3 or Azure Data Lake Service (ADLS).
This ReadyFlow consumes files from a Dropbox folder and writes them to a CDP managed
   destination S3 or ADLS location. For the source, specify the Dropbox App credentials (app key,
   app secret, access token, refresh token) and the ID or path of the Dropbox folder. You can choose
   whether to include subfolder files. For the destination, specify the S3 or ADLS storage location
   and path.
The ReadyFlow polls the Dropbox folder for new files (it performs a listing periodically).
   Failed S3 or ADLS write operations are retried automatically to handle transient issues. Define a
   KPI on the failure_WriteToS3/ADLS connection to monitor failed write
   operations.
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.
