Prerequisites
Learn how to collect the information you need to deploy the Azure Event Hub to ADLS
  ReadyFlow, and meet other prerequisites.
For your data ingest source


You have obtained the Event Hub Namespace and Instance name


Navigate to Event Hubs and select your Event Hub instance (msignite,
                in this example):



Copy the namespace and the Event Hub Instance name
                    (msignite/msignite in this example).







You have created an Event Hub Shared Access Policy and obtained its name and
          Primary Access Key

Click Shared access policies.
Set up a shared access policy that allows “Listen”. Copy the Policy name. 


Select the policy and copy the primary key.



You have created a consumer group.

Click Consumer groups.
Use the $Default consumer group or create your own group
                for the ReadyFlow:






For DataFlow


You have enabled DataFlow for an environment.
For information on how to enable DataFlow for an
              environment, see Enabling DataFlow for an Environment.


You have created a Machine User to use as the CDP Workload User.

You have given the CDP Workload User the
              EnvironmentUser role.

From the Management Console, go to the environment for
                  which DataFlow is enabled.
From the Actions drop down, click
                    Manage Access.
Identify the user you want to use as a Workload User.note
The CDP Workload User can be a machine user or your own user name. It is best
                      practice to create a dedicated Machine user for this.

Give that user EnvironmentUser role.



You have synchronized your user to the CDP Public Cloud environment that you enabled
              for DataFlow.
For information on how to synchronize your user to
              FreeIPA, see Performing User Sync.

You have granted your CDP user the
              DFCatalogAdmin and DFFlowAdmin roles to
            enable your user to add the ReadyFlow to the Catalog and deploy the flow definition.

Give a user permission to add the ReadyFlow to the
                    Catalog.
From the Management Console, click User
                        Management.
Enter the name of the user or group you wish to authorize in the
                        Search field.
Select the user or group from the list that displays.
Click Roles > Update Roles.
From Update Roles, select
                        DFCatalogAdmin and click
                        Update.noteIf the ReadyFlow
                        is already in the Catalog, then you can give your user just the
                          DFCatalogViewer role.

Give your user or group permission to deploy flow definitions.
From the Management Console, click
                        Environments to display the Environment
                        List page.
Select the environment to which you want your user or group to deploy flow
                      definitions.
Click Actions > Manage Access to display the Environment Access
                      page.
Enter the name of your user or group you wish to authorize in the
                        Search field.
Select your user or group and click Update
                      Roles.
Select DFFlowAdmin from the list of roles.
Click Update Roles.





For your data ingest target


You have your ADLS container and path into which you want to ingest
              data.



You have performed one of the following to configure access to your ADLS folder:

You have configured access to the ADLS folders with a RAZ enabled environment.
It is a best practice to enable RAZ to control access
              to your object store folders. This allows you to use your CDP credentials to access
              ADLS folders, increases auditability, and makes object store data ingest workflows
              portable across cloud providers.
Ensure that Fine-grained access control is enabled for
                  your DataFlow environment.
From the Ranger UI, navigate to the
                    ADLS repository.
Create a policy to govern access to the ADLS container and path used in your
                  ingest workflow. For example:
                    adls-to-adls-avro-ingesttipThe
                      Path field must begin with a forward slash ( /
                    ).
Add the machine user that you have created for your ingest workflow to ingest
                  the policy you just created.
 For more information, see Ranger policies for RAZ-enabled Azure
                environment.


You have configured access to ADLS folders using ID Broker mapping.
If your environment is not RAZ-enabled, you can
              configure access to ADLS folders using ID Broker mapping.
Access IDBroker mappings.
To access IDBroker mappings in your environment, click Actions > Manage Access.
Choose the IDBroker Mappings tab where you
                      can provide mappings for users or groups and click
                      Edit.

Add your CDP Workload User and the corresponding Azure role that
                  provides write access to your folder in ADLS to the Current
                    Mappings section by clicking the blue +
                    sign.noteYou can get the Azure Managed Identity Resource
                    ID from the Azure Portal by navigating to Managed Identities > Your Managed Identity > Properties > Resource ID. The selected Azure MSI role must have a trust policy allowing
                    IDBroker to assume this role.
Click Save and Sync.
