 Parameter Name
Description



ADLS File System
Specify the name of the ADLS data container you want to
                write to.The full path will be constructed from: abfs://{ADLS File
              System}@#{ADLS Storage Account}.dfs.core.windows.net/#{ADLS
              Path}/${Kafka.topic}


ADLS Path
Specify the path within the ADLS data container where
                you want to write to without any leading characters.The full path will be
              constructed from: abfs://{ADLS File System}@#{ADLS Storage
              Account}.dfs.core.windows.net/#{ADLS Path}/${Kafka.topic}


ADLS Storage Account
Specify the storage account name you want to write
                to.The full ADLS data container path will be constructed from: abfs://{ADLS File
              System}@#{ADLS Storage Account}.dfs.core.windows.net/#{ADLS
              Path}/${Kafka.topic}


CDP Workload User
Specify the CDP machine user or workload username
              that you want to use to authenticate to Kafka and the object store. Ensure this user
              has the appropriate access rights in Ranger for the Kafka topic and Ranger or IDBroker
              for object store access.


CDP Workload User Password
Specify the password of the CDP machine user or workload
              user you are using to authenticate against Kafka and the object store.


CSV Delimiter
If your source data is CSV, specify the delimiter

Data Output Format
Specify the desired format for your output data. You can
              select from 
CSV
JSON

with this ReadyFlow.


Event Hub Access Policy Name
Specify the Access Policy Name that this flow should
                use.The full path for the event hub endpoint will be constructed from
                sb://#{Event Hub Namespace}.#{Event Hub Service Bus
                Endpoint}/;SharedAccessKeyName=#{Event Hub Access Policy
                Name};SharedAccessKey=#{Event Hub Access Primary Key}


Event Hub Access Primary Key
Specify the Primary Key that allows clients to use the
                Access Policy that you provided earlier.The full path for the event hub endpoint
              will be constructed from sb://#{Event Hub Namespace}.#{Event Hub Service Bus
                Endpoint}/;SharedAccessKeyName=#{Event Hub Access Policy
                Name};SharedAccessKey=#{Event Hub Access Primary Key}


Event Hub Consumer Group
Specify the Event Hub Consumer Group you want to use with
              this flow. Any consumer group other than $Default needs to be created in Event Hub
              first.


Event Hub Instance Name
Specify the Event Hub Instance Name inside the Event Hub
              Namespace you want to use.


Event Hub Namespace
Specify the Event Hub Namespace which contains the Event
                Hub instance you want to use.The full path for the event hub endpoint will be
              constructed from sb://#{Event Hub Namespace}.#{Event Hub Service Bus
                Endpoint}/;SharedAccessKeyName=#{Event Hub Access Policy
                Name};SharedAccessKey=#{Event Hub Access Primary Key}


Event Hub Partitions Count
Specify the number of partitions that the Event Hub has.
              Only this number of partitions will be used, so it is important to ensure that if the
              number of partitions changes that this value be updated. Otherwise, some messages may
              not be consumed.


Event Hub Service Bus Endpoint

Specify the Event Hub Service Bus Endpoint.
The default value is .servicebus.windows.net
The full path for the event hub endpoint will be constructed from
                  sb://#{Event Hub Namespace}.#{Event Hub Service Bus
                  Endpoint}/;SharedAccessKeyName=#{Event Hub Access Policy
                  Name};SharedAccessKey=#{Event Hub Access Primary Key}



Filter Rule
Specify the filter rule expressed in SQL to filter
              streaming events for the destination object store. Records matching the filter will be
              written to the destination object store. The default value forwards all
