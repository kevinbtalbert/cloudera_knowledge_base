ReadyFlow overview: Google Drive to S3/ADLS
You can use the Google Drive to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow to ingest data from a Google
  Drive location to a destination in Amazon S3 or Azure Data Lake Service (ADLS).
This ReadyFlow consumes files from Google Drive and CDP managed S3 or ADLS location. For the
   source, specify the Google service account key file in JSON and the Google Drive folder ID. You
   can choose whether to include objects in subfolders or to only include objects from the specified
   Google Drive folder. For the destination, specify the S3 or ADLS storage location and path.
The ReadyFlow polls the folder on Google Drive for new files (it performs a listing
   periodically). Failed S3 or ADLS write operations are retried automatically to handle transient
   issues. Define a KPI on the failure_WriteToS3/ADLS connection to monitor
   failed write operations.
