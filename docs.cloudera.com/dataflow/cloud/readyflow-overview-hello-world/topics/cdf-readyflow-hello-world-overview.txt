ReadyFlow: Hello World
You can use the Hello World ReadyFlow to move change data from
  Wikipedia API  to local disk. This ReadyFlow gets you started with your first flow deployment
  without  any external dependencies.
This ReadyFlow can be deployed without any external dependencies and does not require any
   parameter values. It retrieves the latest changes from Wikipedia through invoking the Wikipedia
   API. It converts JSON events to Avro, before filtering and routing them to two different
   processors which merge events together before a file is written to local disk.
