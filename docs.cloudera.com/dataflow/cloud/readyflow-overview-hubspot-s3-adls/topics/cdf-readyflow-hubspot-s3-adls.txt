ReadyFlow overview: HubSpot to S3/ADLS
You can use the HubSpot to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow to consume objects from a
  HubSpot database table, filter them, and write the data as JSON, CSV or Avro files to a
  destination in Amazon S3 or Azure Data Lake Service (ADLS).
This ReadyFlow retrieves objects from a Private HubSpot App, filtered by field name(s). You can
   pick whether to include metadata or to extract only the HubSpot fields. The objects are then
   converted to the specified output data format and written to the target S3 or ADLS destination.
   The flow writes out a file every time its size has either reached 100MB or five minutes have
   passed. Files can reach a maximum size of 1GB. Failed S3 or ADLS write operations are retried
   automatically to handle transient issues. Define a KPI on the
    failure_WriteToS3/ADLS connection to monitor failed write operations.
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.

Moving data to object stores
Cloud environments offer numerous deployment options and services. There are many ways to
    store data in the cloud, but the easiest option is to use object stores. Object stores are
    extremely robust and cost-effective storage solutions with multiple levels of durability and
    availability. You can include them in your data pipeline, both as an intermediate step and as an
    end state. Object stores are accessible to many tools and connecting systems, and you have a
    variety of options to control access.
