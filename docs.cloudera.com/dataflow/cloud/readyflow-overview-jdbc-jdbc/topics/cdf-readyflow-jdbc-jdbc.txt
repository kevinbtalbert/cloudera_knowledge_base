ReadyFlow overview: JDBC to JDBC
You can use the JDBC to JDBC ReadyFlow to move data between a source
  database table and destination database table.
This ReadyFlow consumes data from a source database table. You can filter records by specifying
   a SQL query in the Filter Rule parameter. The filtered records are then inserted into the target
   database table. Failed database operations are retried automatically to handle transient issues.
   Define a KPI on the failure_PutDatabaseRecord connection to monitor failed
   insert operations. Define a KPI on the retry_PutDatabaseRecord connection to
   monitor retryable insert operations.
