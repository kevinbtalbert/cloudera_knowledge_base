ReadyFlow overview: JDBC to S3/ADLS
You can use the JDBC to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow to move data from a database
  table to an Amazon S3 bucket or Azure Data Lake Storage location while converting the files to the
  specified format.
This ReadyFlow consumes data from a source database table. You can filter records by specifying
   a SQL query in the Filter Rule parameter. The filtered records are then
   converted to the specified output data format and written to S3 or ADLS. Failed S3 or ADLS write
   operations are retried automatically to handle transient issues. Define a KPI on the
    failure_WriteToS3/ADLS connection to monitor failed write operations.
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.
