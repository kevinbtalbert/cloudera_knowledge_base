ReadyFlow: Kafka to Kafka
You can use the Kafka to Kafka ReadyFlow to move your data from a source
  Kafka topic to the specified destination Kafka topic. 
This ReadyFlow consumes data from a source Kafka topic and writes it to the specified
   destination topic. The flow does not apply any schema to the data. The data is simply passed
   through to the specified destination topic. Failed Kafka write operations are retried
   automatically to handle transient issues. Define a KPI on the
    failure_WriteToKafka connection to monitor failed write operations.
