ReadyFlow: Kafka to Cloudera Operational Database
You can use an Apache NiFi data flow to ingest data into Cloudera Operational Database
  (COD) through Cloudera DataFlow. Learn how to use NiFi to move data from a range of locations to
  COD in CDP Public Cloud.
This ReadyFlow consumes JSON, CSV or Avro data from a source Kafka topic, parses the schema by
   looking up the schema name in the CDP Schema Registry and ingests it into an HBase table in COD.
   Failed HBase write operations are retried automatically to handle transient issues. Define a KPI
   on the failure_WriteToCOD connection to monitor failed write operations.

Todayâ€™s scalable web applications for use cases like hotel or flight bookings as well
   as mobile banking applications are relying on an equally scalable database which can serve data
   at a very low latency. COD in Cloudera DataFlow is powered by Apache HBase and provides
   application developers with everything they need to build scalable applications on top of it.
You can use Apache NiFi data flows into Apache HBase in a CDP Public Cloud
   Operational Database cluster to make sure that the applications you build on top always have
   access to the latest data.
