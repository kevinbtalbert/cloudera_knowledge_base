ReadyFlow Overview: Kafka to Snowflake
ou can use the Kafka to Snowflake ReadyFlow to move your data from a Kafka
  topic to a Snowflake table.
This ReadyFlow consumes JSON, CSV or Avro data from a source Kafka topic and parses the schema
   by looking up the schema name in the CDP Schema Registry. You can filter events based on a user
   provided SQL query. The filtered events are then merged into CSV files, compressed into gzip
   format and written to the destination Snowflake DB table.
