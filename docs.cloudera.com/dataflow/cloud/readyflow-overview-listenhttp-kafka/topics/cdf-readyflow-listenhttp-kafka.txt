ReadyFlow overview: ListenHTTP filter to Kafka
You can use the ListenHTTP filter to Kafka ReadyFlow to listen to JSON, CSV or Avro
  events on a specified port and write them to CDP Kafka.
This ReadyFlow listens to a JSON, CSV or Avro data stream on a specified port and parses the
   schema by looking up the schema name in the CDP Schema Registry. You can filter events by
   specifying a SQL query in the 'Filter Rule' parameter. The filtered events are then converted to
   the specified output data format and written to the destination CDP Kafka topic. Failed Kafka
   write operations are retried automatically to handle transient issues. Define a KPI on the
   'failure_WriteToKafka' connection to monitor failed write operations.
note
The default filter criteria allows all records to pass through. The ListenHTTP processor is
    configured to use mutual TLS authentication.
