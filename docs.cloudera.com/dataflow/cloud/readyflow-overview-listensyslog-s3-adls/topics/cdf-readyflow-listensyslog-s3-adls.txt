ReadyFlow: ListenSyslog filter to S3/ADLS
You can use the ListenSyslog filter to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow to listen to Syslog events on a
  specified port, filter them, and write them as JSON, CSV or Avro files to S3 or ADLS.
This ReadyFlow listens to a Syslog data stream on a specified port. You can filter events by
   specifying a SQL query in the Filter Rule parameter. The default filter
   criteria allows all records to pass through. The filtered events are then converted to the
   specified output data format and written to the target S3 or ADLS destination. The flow writes
   out a file every time its size has either reached 100MB or five minutes have passed. Files can
   reach a maximum size of 1GB. Failed S3 or ADLS write operations are retried automatically to
   handle transient issues. Define a KPI on the failure_WriteToS3/ADLS
   connection to monitor failed write operations.
The ListenSyslog processor is configured to use mutual TLS authentication. 
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.

Moving data to object stores
Cloud environments offer numerous deployment options and services. There are many ways to
    store data in the cloud, but the easiest option is to use object stores. Object stores are
    extremely robust and cost-effective storage solutions with multiple levels of durability and
    availability. You can include them in your data pipeline, both as an intermediate step and as an
    end state. Object stores are accessible to many tools and connecting systems, and you have a
    variety of options to control access.
