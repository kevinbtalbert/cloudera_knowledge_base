ReadyFlow: ListenTCP filter to S3/ADLS
You can use the ListenTCP filter to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow to listen to TCP events on a
  specified port, filter them, and write them as JSON, CSV or Avro files to S3 or ADLS.
This ReadyFlow listens to a JSON, CSV or Avro data stream on a specified port and parses the
   data based on a specified Avro-formatted schema. You can filter events by specifying a SQL query
   in the 'Filter Rule' parameter. The filtered events are then converted to the specified output
   data format and written to the target S3 or ADLS destination. The flow writes out a file every
   time its size has either reached 100MB or five minutes have passed. Files can reach a maximum
   size of 1GB. Failed S3 or ADLS write operations are retried automatically to handle transient
   issues. Define a KPI on the 'failure_WriteToS3/ADLS' connection to monitor failed write
   operations.
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.
