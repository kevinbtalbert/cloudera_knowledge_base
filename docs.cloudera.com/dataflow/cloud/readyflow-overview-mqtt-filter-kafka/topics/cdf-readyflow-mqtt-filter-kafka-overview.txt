ReadyFlow: MQTT filter to Kafka
You can use the MQTT filter to Kafka ReadyFlow to move your data from an MQTT
  source to a Kafka topic. 
This ReadyFlow consumes JSON, CSV or Avro data from a source MQTT topic and parses the schema
   by looking up the schema name in the CDP Schema Registry. You can filter events by specifying a
   SQL query in the 'Filter Rule' parameter. The filtered events are then converted to the specified
   output data format and written to the destination Kafka topic. Failed Kafka write operations are
   retried automatically to handle transient issues. Define a KPI on the
    failure_WriteToKafka connection to monitor failed write operations.
noteThe default filter criteria allows all records to pass through.

Moving data with MQTT filter to Kafka flow
MQTT is a messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT) that is used in a wide variety
    of industries. You can use the MQTT filter to Kafka ReadyFlow to read data from a MQTT
    topic, parse the data using a schema provided either through the CDP Schema Registry or through
    direct schema input. You can then filter or transform the data using a SQL query before it is
    written to a destination topic in a CDP Kafka cluster.
