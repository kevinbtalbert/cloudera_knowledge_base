ReadyFlow overview: Non-CDP ADLS to CDP ADLS 
You can use the Non-CDP ADLS to ADLS ReadyFlow to move data between a non-CDP managed
  source ADLS location and a CDP managed destination ADLS location.
This ReadyFlow consumes files from an external source Azure Data Lake Service (ADLS) location
   and writes them to the destination CDP managed ADLS location. You can specify the source and
   target locations. The ReadyFlow polls the source container for new files by periodically listing
   its content.
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.
