ReadyFlow: Non-CDP ADLS to S3/ADLS
You can use the Non-CDP ADLS to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow to move your data from a non-CDP
  ADLS to a destination S3 or ADLS.
This ReadyFlow consumes files from an external source non-CDP ADLS location and writes them to
   a CDP managed destination S3 or ADLS location. For the source, specify the ADLS file system,
   path, and storage account name and key. For the destination, specify the S3 or ADLS storage
   location and path. The ReadyFlow polls the source container for new files (it performs a listing
   periodically). Failed S3 or ADLS write operations are retried automatically to handle transient
   issues. Define a KPI on the failure_WriteToS3/ADLS connection to monitor
   failed write operations.
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.
