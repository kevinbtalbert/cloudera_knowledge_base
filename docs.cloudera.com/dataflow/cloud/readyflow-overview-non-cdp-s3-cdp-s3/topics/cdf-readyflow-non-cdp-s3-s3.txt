ReadyFlow overview: Non-CDP S3 to CDP S3
You can use the Non-CDP S3 to CDP S3 ReadyFlow to move data between a non-CDP managed
  source S3 location and a CDP managed destination S3 location.
This ReadyFlow consumes files from an external source S3 location and writes them to the
   destination CDP managed S3 location. You can specify the source and target locations. You can
   pick whether to preserve or ignore the folder hierarchy of the source files when writing to the
   destination path. The ReadyFlow polls the source bucket for new files by periodically listing its
   content.
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.
