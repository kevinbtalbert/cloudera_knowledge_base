ReadyFlow: Non-CDP S3 to S3/ADLS
You can use the Non-CDP S3 to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow to move your data from a non-CDP
  Amazon S3 to a destination S3 or ADLS. 
This ReadyFlow consumes files from an external source non-CDP S3 location and writes them to a
   CDP managed destination S3 or ADLS location. For the source, specify the S3 bucket region, name,
   path and access keys. For the destination, specify the S3 or ADLS storage location and path. The
   ReadyFlow polls the source bucket for new files (it performs a listing periodically). You can
   pick whether to preserve or ignore the folder hierarchy of the source files when writing to the
   destination path. Failed S3 or ADLS write operations are retried automatically to handle
   transient issues. Define a KPI on the failure_WriteToS3/ADLS connection to
   monitor failed write operations.
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.
