Prerequisites
Learn how to collect the information you need to deploy the S3 to S3 ReadyFlow, and meet
    other prerequisites.
For your S3 data ingest source and target


You have the two S3 buckets and their paths as source and destination for the data
              movement.



You have performed one of the following to configure access to S3 buckets:

You have configured access to S3 buckets with a RAZ enabled environment.
It is a best practice to enable RAZ to control access
              to your object store buckets. This allows you to use your CDP credentials to access S3
              buckets, increases auditability, and makes object store data ingest workflows portable
              across cloud providers. 
Ensure that Fine-grained access control is enabled for
                  your DataFlow environment.
From the Ranger UI, navigate to the S3 repository.
Create a policy to govern access to the S3 bucket and path used in your ingest
                  workflow. tip
The Path field must begin with a forward slash ( /
                      ).

Add the machine user that you have created for your ingest workflow to the
                  policy you just created.


For more information, see Creating Ranger policy to use in RAZ-enabled AWS
                environment.


You have configured access to S3 buckets using ID Broker mapping.
If your environment is
              not RAZ-enabled, you can configure access to S3 buckets using ID Broker mapping.
Access IDBroker mappings.
To access IDBroker mappings in your environment, click Actions > Manage Access.
Choose the IDBroker Mappings tab where you
                      can provide mappings for users or groups and click
                      Edit.

Add your CDP Workload User and the corresponding AWS role that
                  provides write access to your folder in your S3 bucket to the Current
                    Mappings section by clicking the blue +
                    sign.noteYou can get the AWS IAM role ARN from the Roles
                      Summary page in AWS and can copy it into the IDBroker role field.
                    The selected AWS IAM role must have a trust policy allowing IDBroker to assume
                    this role.
Click Save and Sync.




You have created a Streams Messaging cluster in CDP Public Cloud to host
              your Schema Registry.
For information on how to create a Streams Messaging
              cluster, see Setting up your Streams Messaging Cluster.


You have created a schema for your data and have uploaded it to the Schema Registry
              in the Streams Messaging cluster.
For information on how to create a new schema, see
                Creating a new schema. For example:
              
{
   "type":"record",
   "name":"SensorReading",
   "namespace":"com.cloudera.example",
   "doc":"This is a sample sensor reading",
   "fields":[
      {
         "name":"sensor_id",
         "doc":"Sensor identification number.",
         "type":"int"
      },
      {
         "name":"sensor_ts",
         "doc":"Timestamp of the collected readings.",
         "type":"long"
      },
      {
         "name":"sensor_0",
         "doc":"Reading #0.",
         "type":"int"
      },
      {
         "name":"sensor_1",
         "doc":"Reading #1.",
         "type":"int"
      },
      {
         "name":"sensor_2",
         "doc":"Reading #2.",
         "type":"int"
      },
      {
         "name":"sensor_3",
         "doc":"Reading #3.",
         "type":"int"
      }
   ]
}



You have the Schema Registry Host Name.


From the Management Console, go to
                    Data Hub Clusters and select the Streams Messaging
                  cluster you are using.
Navigate to the Hardware tab to locate the Master
                  Node FQDN. Schema Registry is always running on the Master node, so copy the
                  Master node FQDN.






You have assigned the CDP Workload User read-access to the schema.


Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select
                  the environment where you have created your cluster.
Select Ranger. You are redirected to the Ranger
                    Service Manager page. 
Select your Streams Messaging cluster under the Schema
                    Registry folder. 
Click Add New Policy. 
On the Create Policy page, give the policy a name, specify
                  the schema details, add the user, and assign the Read
                  permission.





For DataFlow


You have enabled DataFlow for an environment.
For information on how to enable DataFlow for an
              environment, see Enabling DataFlow for an Environment.


You have created a Machine User to use as the CDP Workload User.

You have given the CDP Workload User the
              EnvironmentUser role.

From the Management Console, go to the environment for
                  which DataFlow is enabled.
From the Actions drop down, click
                    Manage Access.
Identify the user you want to use as a Workload User.note
The CDP Workload User can be a machine user or your own user name. It is best
                      practice to create a dedicated Machine user for this.

Give that user EnvironmentUser role.



You have synchronized your user to the CDP Public Cloud environment that you enabled
              for DataFlow.
For information on how to synchronize your user to
              FreeIPA, see Performing User Sync.

You have granted your CDP user the
              DFCatalogAdmin and DFFlowAdmin roles to
            enable your user to add the ReadyFlow to the Catalog and deploy the flow definition.

Give a user permission to add the ReadyFlow to the
                    Catalog.
From the Management Console, click User
                        Management.
Enter the name of the user or group you wish to authorize in the
                        Search field.
Select the user or group from the list that displays.
Click Roles > Update Roles.
From Update Roles, select
                        DFCatalogAdmin and click
                        Update.noteIf the ReadyFlow
                        is already in the Catalog, then you can give your user just the
                          DFCatalogViewer role.

Give your user or group permission to deploy flow definitions.
From the Management Console, click
                        Environments to display the Environment
                        List page.
Select the environment to which you want your user or group to deploy flow
                      definitions.
Click Actions > Manage Access to display the Environment Access
                      page.
Enter the name of your user or group you wish to authorize in the
                        Search field.
Select your user or group and click Update
                      Roles.
Select DFFlowAdmin from the list of roles.
Click Update Roles.





For your Impala data ingest target

You have activated your environment in Cloudera Data Warehouse. This
          automatically creates a default Database Catalog.
You have created an Impala Virtual Warehouse referencing the default Database
          Catalog. Uncheck the Enable SSO setting.
Select Copy the JDBC URL from the Virtual Warehouse UI.
          Use this connection string as the basis for the Impala JDBC URL
          parameter.
