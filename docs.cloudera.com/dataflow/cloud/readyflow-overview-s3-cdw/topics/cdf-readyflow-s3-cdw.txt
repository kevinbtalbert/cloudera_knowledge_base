ReadyFlow: S3 to CDW
You can use the S3 to CDW Readyflow to consume CSV files from a
  source S3 location and write them as Parquet files to a destination S3 location and CDW Impala
  table.
This ReadyFlow consumes CSV files from a source S3 location, parses the schema by looking up
   the schema name in the CDP Schema Registry, converts the files into Parquet and writes them to a
   destination S3 location and CDW Impala table. You can specify the source S3 location, the target
   S3 location and the destination Impala table name. The ReadyFlow polls the source bucket for new
   files (it performs a listing periodically). Define KPIs on the
    failure_WriteS3 and failure_CreateCDWImpalaTable
   connections to monitor failed write operations.
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.
