ReadyFlow: S3 to S3 Avro
You can use the S3 to S3 Avro ReadyFlow to move data between source and destination S3
  locations while converting the files into Avro format.
This ReadyFlow consumes JSON, CSV or Avro files from a source S3 location, converts the files
   into Avro and writes them to the destination S3 location. You can specify the source format, the
   source and target location as well as the schema to use for reading the source data.

Moving data with an S3 to S3 Avro flow
You can use an S3 to S3 Avro data flow when you want to move data from a location in AWS S3 to
    another S3 location, and at the same time convert the data to Avro format. You need to specify
    the source format, the source and target location as well as the schema to use for handling the
    data. Your flow can consume JSON, CSV or Avro files from the source S3 location. It converts the
    files into Avro format and writes them to the destination S3 location. You define and store the
    data processing schema in the Schema Registry on a Streams Messaging Data Hub cluster. The data
    flow parses the schema by looking up the schema name in the Schema Registry.
