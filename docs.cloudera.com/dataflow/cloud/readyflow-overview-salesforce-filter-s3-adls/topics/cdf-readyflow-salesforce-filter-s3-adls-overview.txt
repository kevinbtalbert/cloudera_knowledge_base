ReadyFlow: Salesforce filter to S3/ADLS
You can use the Salesforce filter to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow to consume objects from a
  Salesforce database table, filter them, and write the data as JSON, CSV or Avro files to a
  destination in Amazon S3 or Azure Data Lake Service (ADLS).
This ReadyFlow consumes objects from a Salesforce database table, filtered by field name(s).
   You can filter events by specifying a SQL query in the Filter Rule
   parameter. The filtered events are then converted to the specified output data format and written
   to the target S3 or ADLS destination. The default filter criteria allows all records to pass
   through.
The flow writes out a file every time its size has either reached 100 MB or five minutes have
   passed. Files can reach a maximum size of 1 GB. Failed S3 or ADLS write operations are retried
   automatically to handle transient issues. Define a KPI on the
    failure_WriteToS3/ADLS connection to monitor failed write operations.
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.
