ReadyFlow overview: Shopify to S3/ADLS
You can use the Shopify to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow to ingest  Shopify objects,
  filter them, and write them as JSON, CSV or Avro files to S3 or ADLS.
This ReadyFlow consumes objects from a Custom Shopify App, converts them to the specified
   output data format, and writes them to a CDP managed destination S3 or ADLS location. For the
   source, specify the Shopify App's Store Domain name, Access Token, the Object Category and the
   Object Type. For the destination, specify the S3 or ADLS storage location and path. The flow
   writes out a file every time its size has either reached 100MB or five minutes have passed. Files
   can reach a maximum size of 1GB. Failed S3 or ADLS write operations are retried automatically to
   handle transient issues. Define a KPI on the failure_WriteToS3/ADLS
   connection to monitor failed write operations.
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.

Moving data to object stores
Cloud environments offer numerous deployment options and services. There are many ways to
    store data in the cloud, but the easiest option is to use object stores. Object stores are
    extremely robust and cost-effective storage solutions with multiple levels of durability and
    availability. You can include them in your data pipeline, both as an intermediate step and as an
    end state. Object stores are accessible to many tools and connecting systems, and you have a
    variety of options to control access.
