ReadyFlow overview: Slack to S3/ADLS
You can use the Slack to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow to consume events from Slack,
  convert them to Avro, CSV, or JSON format and write them to a CDP managed destination in Amazon S3
  or Azure Data Lake Service (ADLS).
This ReadyFlow consumes events from a Slack App, converts them to the specified output data
   format, and writes them to a CDP managed destination S3 or ADLS location. For the source,
   subscribe to the events to be notified of in Slack. For the destination, specify the S3 or ADLS
   storage location and path. The flow writes out a file every time its size has either reached
   100MB or five minutes have passed. Files can reach a maximum size of 1GB. Failed S3 or ADLS write
   operations are retried automatically to handle transient issues. Define a KPI on the
    failure_WriteToS3/ADLS connection to monitor failed write operations.
noteThis ReadyFlow leverages CDP's
    centralized access control for cloud storage access. Make sure to either set up Ranger policies
    or an IDBroker mapping allowing your workload user access to the target S3 or ADLS
    location.
