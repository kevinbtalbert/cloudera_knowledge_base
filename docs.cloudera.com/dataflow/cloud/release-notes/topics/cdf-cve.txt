Cloudera DataFlow fix for CVE-2021-44228
On December 17, 2021, Cloudera released Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) for Public Cloud version
    1.0.3-h1-b6. It addresses 2 CVEs and other vulnerability concerns as listed below. Cloudera
    urges all customers to upgrade their DataFlow services to the latest version.


CVE-2021-44228 which affects Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0 through
     2.14.1.


CVE-2021-45046 which affects Apache Log4j2 version 2.15.0


LOGBACK-1591 which affects logback versions <= 1.2.7


important
DataFlow for Public Cloud does not contain or use the vulnerable
     log4j2 libraries and is therefore not vulnerable to the related CVEs. 
NiFi which runs in a Kubernetes container in the DataFlow cluster does contain the
        vulnerable log4j2 libraries and should be updated. 
Cloudera is not aware of known exploitation paths within DataFlow for Public Cloud,
    however upgrading protects against the possibility of any exploitation.

Upgrade to the latest DataFlow version
To upgrade your DataFlow service to the latest version, which includes fixes for the
          log4j2 security vulnerability and logback
        mitigation issues, follow these steps. These steps provide a comprehensive upgrade and are
        the recommended approach. After completing these steps, no additional action is required. 

Terminate running deployments.
Disable DataFlow for an environment.
Enable DataFlow for an environment.
Recreate your deployments.

Result
You are upgraded to the latest version of the DataFlow service and all deployments are running
        the latest NiFi Runtime.

Upgrade DataFlow deployments to the latest NiFi Runtime
For customers with an enabled DataFlow service 1.0.2 - 1.0.3 who want to address
          log4j2 CVE mitigation only as an immediate action and not fully
        disable and recreate DataFlow service and deployments. For each running deployment:

From the DataFlow Dashboard, click Manage
      Deployment. 
Select Change NiFi Version from the Actions
     drop-down.
Select Latest Version (1.14.0.2.3.2.1-6) and click
      Apply.

Result
For each DataFlow Deployment, this upgrades the running NiFi cluster to a version of NiFi that
        includes log4j2 and logback vulnerability
        mitigation. 
After completing these steps, Cloudera recommends that you do plan to upgrade to the latest
        version of your DataFlow service.
