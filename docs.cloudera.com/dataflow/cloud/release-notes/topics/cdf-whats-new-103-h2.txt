This release (1.0.3-h2-b1) of Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) on CDP Public Cloud introduces
    these changes.
Fixed issues


Fixed bug causing DataFlow to incorrectly appear to have been upgraded to the latest
            version.
When you use Manage DataFlow to modify your DataFlow service,
            updates to the following values cause the Workload Version field
            for your service to be set to the current DataFlow application version. 
Capacity
Networking
Kubernetes API Server Endpoint Access
Once the update is started, it will incorrectly appear as if your DataFlow service
            is upgraded to the latest version.

NOTE: There is no need to tear down and recreate your enabled DataFlow services to benefit
        from these updates.
