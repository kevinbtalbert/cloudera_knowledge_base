January 27, 1.1.0-b127

New features and enhancements



The ability to deploy CDF on Azure is now generally available to all CDP Public
                Cloud customers.


Flow Deployments now support the latest Apache NiFi 1.15 release.


CDF now creates Kubernetes clusters with version 1.20 in AWS EKS and Azure AKS.


CDF now supports username/password authentication for AWS environments with
                non-transparent proxy setups.


When using the Default NiFi SSL Context Service in a flow deployment, the
                automatically generated truststore now contains the default cacerts from the local
                JDK. This ensures that the SSL Context Service can be used with third-party
                applications using certificates from common public certificate authorities.


Users can now perform the Download Kubeconfig and Manage User Access
                actions when an enablement request fails. This allows in-depth troubleshooting
                of a failed enablement attempt.


The following ReadyFlows have been added to the ReadyFlow Gallery:
ADLS to ADLS Avro ReadyFlow
Kafka to ADLS Avro ReadyFlow

                “@” as tag values when enabling CDF.
