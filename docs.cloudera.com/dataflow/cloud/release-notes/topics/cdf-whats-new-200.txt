This release (2.0.0-b302) of Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) on CDP Public Cloud introduces
    support for Inbound Connection Endpoints, allowing you to stream data from external sources to
    Flow Deployments. It also adds support for Apache NiFi 1.16, adds seven new ReadyFlows and
    improves stability of the service.
New features and changes


Inbound Connection Endpoints for Flow Deployments
You can now deploy NiFi flows containing processors like ListenHTTP, ListenTCP,
            ListenUDP, ListenSyslog etc. and let CDF-PC take care of exposing a stable and secure
            endpoint to connect your clients to.

Flow Deployments now support the latest Apache NiFi 1.16 release
Seven new ReadyFlows are available in the ReadyFlow Gallery
Azure Event Hub to ADLS ReadyFlow
Confluent Cloud to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow
Confluent Cloud to Snowflake ReadyFlow
JDBC to S3/ADLS ReadyFlow
ListenHTTP to CDP Kafka ReadyFlow
Non-CDP ADLS to CDP ADLS ReadyFlow
Non-CDP S3 to CDP S3 ReadyFlow 




Single AZ support for DataFlow clusters 
CDF Kubernetes nodes are now always deployed in a single Availability Zone (AZ). When
            enabling CDF, you still have to provide subnets in at least two Availability Zones to
            satisfy Kubernetes control plane requirements.


Value of javax.net.ssl.trustStore property no longer set to existing trust store on
            NiFi node
The javax.net.ssl.trustStore system property is no longer set by default to the
            existing truststore on the NiFi node. Flows which rely on a truststore being available
            by default via the JVM should be updated to leverage the SSLContextService. 
This change may cause errors affecting older existing processors or custom processors
            that do not have a property to reference an SSL Context Service.


Flow Deployments on Azure now use Premium SSD disks to store NiFiâ€™s various
            repositories


CDF-PC integration into the CDP CLI is now generally available. Make sure you
              run the latest CDP CLI version to use
              cdp df commands.




Python 3.9 is now installed on NiFi containers allowing users to run python
            scripts through NiFi processors. Requests and urllib3 libraries are also installed by
            default.


Information level alerts are now displayed in the Dashboard to inform users
            about an action they should perform for a Flow Deployment without changing the Flow
            Deployment status to Concerning. 


Deployments can now be restarted from the Deployment Manager to perform
            actions that require a NiFi process restart.


Filters that have been set in the Dashboard are now
            persisted after a user has navigated to the Deployment Manager
            and returned back to the Dashboard.


When enabling DataFlow, you can now specify CIDRs as a comma separated list
            to configure Load Balancer and Kubernetes API Server Endpoint Access.



Fixed issues
This release includes all cumulative fixes released throughout 1.1.0-h1 to 1.1.0-h5 as well
