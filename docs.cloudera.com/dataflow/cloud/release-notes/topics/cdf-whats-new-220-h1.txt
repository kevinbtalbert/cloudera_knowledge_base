This release (2.2.0-h1-b11) of Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) on CDP Public Cloud introduces
    fixes for certificate renewal issues that could cause the deployment manager and NiFi canvas to
    become inaccessible.
Fixed issues


CDPDFX-5941 - Fixed an issue where CDF did not restart automatically to pick
            up renewed certificates resulting in the deployment manager and NiFi canvas becoming
            inaccessible.


CDPDFX-5943 - Fixed an issue where the trusted certificate CA was not updated
            for vault after renewing certificates resulting in the deployment manager and NiFi
            canvas becoming inaccessible.


CDPDFX-5953 - Fixed an issue where CDF provisioned certificates with an
            incorrect CA lifetime resulting in the deployment manager and NiFi canvas becoming
            inaccessible after 90 days .


CDPDFX-5954 - Fixed an issue where prometheus and alertmanager pods did not
            correctly reload certificates upon renewal.


CDPDFX-5961 - Added renewal of all certificates during CDF upgrades to
            prevent any further certificate related issues.


CDPDFX-6025 - Fixed an issue where no CDF logs were written to S3 when CDP’s
            storage base location contains only a bucket name.


CDPDFX - 5990 - Fixed an issue where a ‘metrics unavailable’ alert was
            incorrectly fired during CDF upgrades.


CDPDFX-5965 - Fixed an issue where flow definitions failed to deploy
            successfully due to their size.
