This release (2.2.0-h3-b2) of Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) on CDP Public Cloud introduces
    compatibility fixes around upgrades.
Fixed issues


CDPDFX-6101 - Fixed an issue with DataFlow upgrade leaving deployments using custom
            NARs not able to retrieve the NAR components from S3. This results in custom processors
            becoming non-functional. 


CDPDFX-6120 - Fixed an issue with DataFlow Upgrade where the internal self-signed CA
            certificate is being unnecessarily renewed in upgrade scenarios where the certificates
            are not also renewed because they were already renewed in prior upgrades. This issue
            would have arisen for customers upgrading from DFX 2.2.0-h1 or 2.2.0-h2 to this
            version.


CDPDFX-6025 - Fixed a documented known issue where a CDP environment configured with a
            storage base location with an S3 bucket but no root directory results in workload logs
            not being uploaded.


CDPDFX-6055 - Fixed an issue where Update DataFlow fails on DataFlow services running
            version 2.0.0, 2.1.0 and 2.1.0-h1.


CDPDFX-5944 - Added support to allow certificate renewal action on a DataFlow service
            in an 'Update Failed' state.
