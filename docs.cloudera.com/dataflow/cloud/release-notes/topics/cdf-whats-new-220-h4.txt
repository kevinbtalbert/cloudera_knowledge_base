This release (2.2.0-h4-b2) of Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) on CDP Public Cloud introduces
    compatibility fixes around upgrades and public ingress certificate renewals.
Fixed issues


CDPDFX-6119 - Fixed an issue where a failed attempt to renew public ingress
            certificates incorrectly fires a certificate expiring soon warning.


CDPDFX-6189 - Fixed an issue where public ingress certificate renewal fails for
            workloads that are not running the latest DataFlow version.


CDPDFX-6191 - Fixed an issue where DataFlow upgrade fails if a public ingress
            certificate renewal has ever been attempted on the DataFlow service.


CDPDFX-4177 - Improved reuse of recently generated public ingress certificate upon
            repetitive retries to avoid a Let's Encrypt certificate rate limit of 5 per 7 days.
