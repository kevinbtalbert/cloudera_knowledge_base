          special characters.

          configurations.

          insufficient java heap memory allocated to NiFi pods, resulting in Out of Memory
          issues.
CDPDFX-6561 - Fixed issue preventing retry upgrade when previous upgrade attempt failed
          after kubernetes upgrade to 1.23 but before liftie service finished upgrading
          deployments..
CDPDFX-6479 - Fixed redis pods being unable to recover after non-graceful shutdown
