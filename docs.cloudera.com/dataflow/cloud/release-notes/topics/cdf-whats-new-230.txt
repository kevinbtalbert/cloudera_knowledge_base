This release (2.3.0-b347) of Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) on CDP Public Cloud introduces the
    technical preview of Flow Designer, adds several new ReadyFlows, improves upgrade reliability
    and fixes issues with stability for clusters with high utilization. 
New features and changes


Flow Designer [Technical Preview]
Developers can now build new data flows from scratch using the integrated
            Designer. Flow Drafts can be tested using Test Sessions before they are published to the
            Catalog. Once they are in the catalog, users can create Flow Deployments using the
            Deployment Wizard or CLI. 

Added support for certificate renewal of inbound connection endpoints

Six new ReadyFlows have been added to the ReadyFlow Gallery:


Airtable to S3/ADLS


Box to S3/ADLS


Dropbox to S3/ADLS


Google Drive to S3/ADLS


MQTT to Kafka


Salesforce to S3/ADLS



Apache Iceberg Integration [Technical Preview] Developers can now use the
              PutIceberg processor to write data to Apache Iceberg in CDP.

DataFlow is now also available in the EU and APAC regional CDP control
            planes.
noteDataFlow Functions is an exception, as it is only available in
            the US control plane.


Updated to support using Kubernetes 1.23 EKS and AKS clusters.
If you use restricted IAM roles in your EKS clusters, this impacts the
            upgrade procedure. For more information, see the CDF Service Upgrade documentation.


General improvements to DataFlow upgrade reliability to allow for improved
            success rates.


Includes new NiFi version 1.18.0.2.3.7.0 for flow development and flow
            deployment.


Updated DataFlow Function binaries to use NiFi version 1.18.0.



Fixed issues

CDPDFX-5884 - Internal Logging Improvements - fixed logging issues sent to S3
          (AWS) and Azure Blob Storage (Azure)
CDPDFX-6308 / CDPDFX-6323 - updated legacy inbound connection endpoints to
          make them compatible with new certificate renewal capability
CDPDFX-6305 - Fixed issue with inbound connection endpoints created prior to
          DFX 2.2.0 preventing upgrade
CDPDFX-5689 - Expanded character limit on deployment parameters to allow for
          parameters of up to 100000 characters.
CDPDFX-5942 - Fixed a rare issue where a cluster update request can fail due
          to cloud API latency leading to timeouts.
CDPDFX-6334 - Fixed an issue where a large deployment count with active
          metrics unavailable alerts can lead to a deadlock which prevents upgrade
CDPDFX-6345 - Fixed issue which causes existing deployments using assets to no
          longer allow changes to those assets after upgrade due to a certificate mismatch
CDPDFX-6364 - Fixed CLI issue where some listen components are ignored when
          creating deployments with multiple listen components

          liquibase schema file.
CDPDFX-5731 - Cert-manager OOM - increased memory limits for cert-manager to
          ensure certificates can still be issued as deployment numbers increase
CDPDFX-6371 - Correct nifi.provenance.repository.debug.frequency to a
          parseable default value (default 1000000)
CDPDFX-6309 - ZK-Operator OOM - prevent operator from running OOM due to it
          scan/filtering of multiple secrets
CDPDFX-6118 - Suppress deprecation logging in NiFi
