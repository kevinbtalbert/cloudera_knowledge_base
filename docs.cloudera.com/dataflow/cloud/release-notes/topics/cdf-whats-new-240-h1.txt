This release (2.4.0-h1-b1) of Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) on CDP Public Cloud introduces
    various improvements and bug fixes for Flow Designer and DataFlow enablement.
Fixed issues


CDPDFX-6970 - Fixed an issue where using the Convert to Parameter feature in
            Flow Designer cleared all sensitive parameter values.


CDPDFX-7068 - Added missing support for skipPreflightChecks to Enable and
            Update DataFlow CLI calls


CDPDFX-6991 - Fixed an issue with Enable DataFlow for Azure where the cloud
            provider sometimes reflects clusters in an unexpected UPDATING state.


CDPDFX-7057 - Fixed Enable DataFlow request for AWS sometimes timing out
            during initial validation phase due to cloud provider API latency with resources in some
            regions.


CDPDFX-6534 - Fixed concurrency issues with uploads of large assets via CLI.
            Assets of up to 150 MB are now supported. 


CDPDFX-7052 - Fixed an issue with validation of Flow Designer parameters
            where validation was too strict and could prevent certain values from being entered. The
            validation is now consistent with parameter values from the Deployment Wizard.
