This release (2.4.1-b22) of Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) on CDP Public Cloud supports new
    NiFi and Kubernetes versions, includes usability improvements for Flow Designer, resolves an
    issue with deployment ZooKeeper persistence and introduces various bug fixes across the
    platform.
New features and changes

CDF now creates Kubernetes clusters with version 1.24 in AWS EKS and 1.25 in
          Azure AKS.
The PutIceberg processor is now considered GA (requires selecting NiFi version
          1.20.0.2.3.8.2-2).
Improves event age off logic for environments and deployments that produce a
          large number of events.
In the Flow Designer, when deleting a Parameter referencing components are
          populated in the affected components dialog.
In the Flow Designer, the Inbound Connection Details button visibility was
          fixed when a Test Session successfully starts.
After upgrading CDF, aligned the CFM version of any existing Test Session
          configurations with the minimum CFM version supported by the Flow Designer.
