This is the GA release of the Cloudera DataFlow service.
Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) is a CDP Public Cloud service that enables self-serve deployments of
   Apache NiFi data flows from a central catalog to auto-scaling Kubernetes clusters managed by CDP.
   Flow deployments can be monitored from a central dashboard with the ability to define KPIs to
   keep track of critical data flow metrics.
CDF eliminates the operational overhead that is typically associated with running Apache NiFi
   clusters and allows users to fully focus on developing data flows and ensuring they meet business
   SLAs.
