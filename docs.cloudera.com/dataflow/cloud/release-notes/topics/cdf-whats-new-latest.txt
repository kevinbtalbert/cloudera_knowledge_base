This release (2.5.0-h2-b1) of Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) on CDP Public Cloud resolves an
    issue with NiFi cluster autoscaling behavior that can cause unnecessary flow
    disruptions.
Fixed issues


CDPDFX-7567 - Fixed unnecessary NiFi cluster pod restarts triggered by
            autoscaling operations.


This issue impacted only those running DataFlow 2.5.0-h1-b6 and
                deployments configured with autoscaling enabled.


Any scale-up or scale-down operation would trigger unnecessary restarts
                of existing pods resulting in temporary flow disruptions.


Upgrading to this new DataFlow version automatically resolves the
                issue.
