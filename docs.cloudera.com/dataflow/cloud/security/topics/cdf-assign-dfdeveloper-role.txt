Authorize user to develop flows in a DataFlow environment
To authorize a user to create and manage  drafts in a DataFlow environment, assign
        the DFDeveloper role to the user. 

You must have one of the following:
CDP PowerUser role
Owner role for the specific environment



noteTo create drafts from flow definitions in the
                    Catalog and ReadyFlows in the ReadyFlow
                    Gallery, users also need the DFFlowViewer or the
                    DFFlowAdmin role. To publish drafts to the Catalog
                as new flow definitions or versions of existing flow definitions, users need the
                    DFFlowAdmin role.


From the Cloudera Management Console, click
                    Environments.
The Environment List page appears.

Search for and select the environment you want the user to have rights
                    to.
The Environment page appears. 

Click Actions >  Manage Access.
The Environment Access page appears.

noteIf you do not see the Manage Access option, request
                        your administrator to assign the PowerUser role to you.


Find the user and click Update Roles.

From the Update Roles dialog, select the
                        DFDeveloper role.

Click Update Roles.

If the user is logged into the DataFlow workload
            application when you assign or remove the DFFlowAdmin role, ask the user to log out and
            log back in for the change to take effect. noteA user can remain logged in for upto 8
                hours after their last interaction with the DataFlow environment.
