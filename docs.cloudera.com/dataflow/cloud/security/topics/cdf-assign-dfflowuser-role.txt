From the Cloudera Management Console, click
                    Environments.
The Environment List page
                    appears.

Search for and select the environment you want the user to have rights
                    to.
The Environment page appears. 

Click Actions >  Manage Access.
The Environment Access page appears.

noteIf you do not see the Manage Access option, request
                        your admin to assign the iamViewer role to you.


Find the user and click Update Roles.

From the Update Roles dialog, select the
                        DFFlowUser role and any other role the user
                    requires.

Click Update Roles.

If the user is logged into the DataFlow workload
            application when you assign or remove the DFFlowUser role, ask the user to log out and
            log back in for the change to take effect. noteA user can remain logged in for upto 8
                hours after their last interaction with the DataFlow environment.
