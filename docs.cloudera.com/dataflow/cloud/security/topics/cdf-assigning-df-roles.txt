Authorize user to manage lifecycle of a DataFlow environment
To authorize a user to enable, disable, and administer a given CDP environment for
        DataFlow, assign the DFAdmin role to the user. This role also permits the user to
        grant and revoke the ability to access the DataFlow Kubernetes API server.

You must have one of the following:
CDP PowerUser role
Owner role for the specific environment



From the Cloudera Management Console, click
                    Environments.
The Environment List page appears.

Search for and select the environment you want the user to have rights
                    to.
The Environment page appears. 

Click Actions >  Manage Access.
The Environment Access page appears.

noteIf you do not see the Manage Access option, request
                        your admin to assign the iamViewer role to you.


Find the user and click Update Roles.

From the Update Roles dialog, select the
                        DFAdmin role and any other role the user
                    requires.
