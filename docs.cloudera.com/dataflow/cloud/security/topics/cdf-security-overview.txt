DataFlow security
As a security administrator, understand the out-of-the box security features as well as
    the tasks that you need to
    perform
    to authorize CDP users.
CDP provides the following security features:
User authentication
Role-based user authorization
Data encryption
 You must assign roles to CDP users based on their DataFlow job responsibilities. 
User authentication
Users are automatically authenticated through the CDP identity provider. For more
        information, see CDP Security Overview.

Role-based user authorization
DataFlow roles allow you to set user permissions. Assign one or more of the following roles
        to a CDP user: 
To enable a user to view and search flow definitions and ReadyFlows, assign the
              DFCatalogViewer role.
To enable a user to import and manage flow definitions in the DataFlow Catalog and add
            ReadyFlows to the DataFlow Catalog, assign the DFCatalogAdmin role.
To enable a user to manage the lifecycle of a DataFlow environment, assign the
              DFAdmin role.
To enable a user to manage flow deployments such as view a flow deployment in NiFi,
            suspend or terminate a flow deployment, or change the NiFi version, assign the
              DFFlowAdmin role. 
To enable a user to manage flow deployments and deploy flow definitions, assign the
              DFFlowAdmin role and either the DFCatalogViewer or DFCatalogAdmin
            role.
To enable a user to view, search, and monitor deployed flows, assign the
              DFFlowUser role.

For more information on the DataFlow roles, see DataFlow Authorization. 

Data encryption
CDP encrypts data at rest and in motion. 

Data at rest
When you import a flow definition, the flow definition is encrypted and stored in the
            DataFlow Catalog. DataFlow Catalog is a service that enables you to manage flow
            definitions centrally.note

Logs and the NiFi FlowFile, Content, and Provenance repositories are stored in
                  your cloud account. Access to the logs and repositories is based on user
                  permissions. 
Before you import a flow definition: 
Verify that the flow definition will not write secure information to the
                      logs

Data in transit
When you deploy a flow, the encrypted flow definition is transferred to your cloud
            account where it is decrypted and deployed. During a flow deployment, data can be
            transferred between servers, systems, applications, and users. Every transfer is a
            secure and trusted exchange through TLS. Through cryptographic protocols, TLS encrypts
            and authenticates: 


The flow definition from the DataFlow Catalog to a DataFlow environment.
The connections from the user's browser to the DataFlow service.
The communication between the DataFlow service and other services in the CDP
                Control Plane.
The communication between the CDP Control Plane services and environment
                services.
The communication between the DataFlow service, flows, and shared services within
                an environment.
