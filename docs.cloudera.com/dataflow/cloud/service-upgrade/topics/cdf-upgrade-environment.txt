Upgrade a DataFlow service
You can upgrade your Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) service together with all DataFlow
        deployments in that environment with the push of a button.

On the DataFlow Dashboard select
                        Environments from the left navigation pane.

Select the environment you want to upgrade and click Manage
                        DataFlow.

Click Actions > Upgrade DataFlow.

noteIf the upgrade wizard determines that the NiFi
                        version of your DataFlow deployments is compatible with the CDF service
                        after the upgrade, you have the option to skip upgrading NiFi in current
                        deployments. In this case you can upgrade NiFi manually later.




Click Upgrade.
The environment status changes to Upgrading and
                    you see a similar message under Event History: 




You can monitor the upgrade procedure in Event History.
                    Click Manage DataFlow then select
                        Alerts.






The message DataFlow Successfully
                Upgraded in Event History and the
                Status of the service changing from
                Upgrading to Good Health on the
                Environments page signal that the upgrade has ended. Depending
            on the number of running nodes in the cluster, the upgrade can take more than an hour to
            complete.
If you had restricted policies in place before the upgrade,
            run the aws ec2 describe-volumes --profile <aws-profile> --query
                'Volumes[?Tags[?contains(Key,`kubernetes.io/cluster/liftie-`)] &&
                State==`available`].[VolumeId,State,Tags[?contains(Key,`kubernetes.io/cluster/liftie-`)].Key|[0]]'
            command to confirm that no unused volumes were left behind.
