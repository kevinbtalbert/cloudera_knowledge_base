Pre-upgrade information
Learn about tasks you need to perform and information you need to consider before
  starting a CDF service upgrade.
importantIf you are upgrading on AWS to CDF-PC 2.3.0 or higher
   from release 2.2.0 or lower and you use a pre-created IAM policy, you need to update the
    cdp-liftie-instance-profile before the upgrade. For more information, see Update cdp-liftie-instance-profile.
noteIn CDF-PC versions 2.4.0 and lower, ZooKeeper may lose component state
   information under certain conditions due to its previous configuration to use ephemeral storage.
   If a ZooKeeper pod fails, it retains component state information as long as it is rescheduled to
   the same Kubernetes (K8s) node, as it can reattach to  storage already present there. If the
   ZooKeeper pod gets rescheduled to a different K8s node, existing storage is not moved with it,
   therefore state information is lost. If your use case requires that component state information
   is retained even during an upgrade, contact Cloudera Support to provide you with a patch that you
   need to apply to every deployment before starting the upgrade.

You trigger an upgrade for a selected CDF environment. Upgrades move from an older version to
    the latest version available. 
Once you trigger the upgrade, the service enters UPGRADING state and
    is upgraded to the latest supported DataFlow and Kubernetes versions. Kubernetes upgrade can
    take up to an hour to complete. During the upgrade service actions are restricted, that is, you
    are not able to create or manage deployments in the given DataFlow service.
As part of a DataFlow Service (Environment) upgrade, all existing deployments are also
    upgraded. 
If the upgrade fails, all components are rolled back to their original state.
To keep existing DataFlow deployments working, you may choose not to upgrade the NiFi version
    of existing deployments during the upgrade. This selection applies to all existing
     deployments.noteThe option to skip NiFi version upgrade is not always
     available: NiFi version upgrade is mandatory if the upgrade wizard determines that the new
     workload version is not compatible with the current NiFi version running in any deployment. The
     same automatism prevents you from accidentally downgrading NiFi below the minimum supported
     version later.You can manually upgrade NiFi for individual deployments later.
If upgrading a deployment fails, all components are rolled back to their original state and
    it causes the overall DataFlow service upgrade to be rolled back as well.
