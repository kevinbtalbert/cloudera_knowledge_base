Configuring your Lambda functionCloudera Docs
Configuring your Lambda function
After you create a function, you can use the built-in configuration options to control
    its behavior. You can configure additional capabilities, adjust resources associated with your
    function, such as memory and timeout, or you can also create and edit test events to test your
    function using the console.
Memory and timeout in runtime configuration
You can configure two very important elements, memory and timeout  on the Configuration > General configuration tab of the Lambda function details screen.



The appropriate values for these two settings depend on the data flow to be
        deployed. Typically, it is recommended to start with 1536-2048 MB (1.5 - 2 GB) memory
        allocated to Lambda. This amount of memory may be more than necessary or less than required.
        The default value of 512 MB may be perfectly fine for many use cases. You can adjust this
        value later as you see how much memory your function needs.
While DataFlow Functions tend to perform very well during a warm start, a cold
        start that must source extensions (processors, controller services, and so on) may take
        several seconds to initialize. So it is recommended to set the Timeout to at least 30
        seconds. If the data flow to run reaches out to many other services or performs complex
        computation, it may be necessary to use a larger value, even several minutes.
Click Edit if you want to change the default values.
See the corresponding AWS documentation to learn more about timeout
        duration and memory sizing, which determines the amount of resources provisioned for your
        function.

Runtime environment variables
You must configure the function to specify which data flow to run and add any
        necessary runtime configuration using environment variables.


Navigate to the Configuration tab and select
            Environment variables from the menu on the left.

Click Edit on the Environment variables
          pane.

Define your environment variables as key-value pairs.
You can add one or more environment variables to configure the function. The following
          environment variables are supported:

Variable Name
Description
Required
Default Value



FLOW_CRN

The Cloudera Resource Name (CRN) for the data flow that is to be
                      run.
The data flow must be stored in the DataFlow Catalog. This CRN
                      should indicate the specific version of the data flow and as such will end
                      with a suffix like /v.1.
For more information, see Retrieving data flow CRN.

DF_PRIVATE_KEY

The Private Key for accessing the Cloudera DataFlow service.
The Private Key and Access Key are used to authenticate with the DataFlow
                      Service and they must provide the necessary authorizations to access the
                      specified data flow.
For more information, see Provisioning Access Key ID and Private
                        Key.

true
--


DF_ACCESS_KEY

The Access Key for accessing the Cloudera DataFlow service.
The Private Key and Access Key are used to authenticate with the DataFlow
                      Service and they must provide the necessary authorizations to access the
                      specified data flow.
For more information, see Provisioning Access Key ID and Private
                        Key.

true
--


INPUT_PORT

The name of the Input Port to use.
If the specified data flow has more than one Input Port at the root group
                      level, this environment variable must be specified, indicating the name of the
                      Input Port to queue up the AWS Lambda notification. If there is only one Input
                      Port, this variable is not required. If it is specified, it must properly
                      match the name of the Input Port.

false
--


OUTPUT_PORT

The name of the Output Port to retrieve the results from.
If no Output Port exists, the variable does not need to be
                      specified and no data will be returned. If at least one Output Port exists in
                      the data flow, this variable can be used to determine the name of the Output
                      Port whose data will be sent along as the output of the function.
For more information on how the appropriate Output Port is determined, see
                        Output ports.

false
--


FAILURE_PORTS

A comma-separated list of Output Ports that exist at the root group
                      level of the data flow. If any FlowFile is sent to one of these Output Ports,
                      the function invocation is considered a failure.
For more information, see Output ports.

false
--


DEFAULT_PARAM_CONTEXT

If the data flow uses a Parameter Context, the Lambda function will look for
                      a Secret in the AWS Secrets Manager with the same name. If no Secret can be
                      found with that name, this variable specifies the name of the Secret to
                      default to.
For more information, see Parameters.

false
--


PARAM_CONTEXT_*

If the data flow makes use of Parameter Contexts, this environment
                      variable provides a mechanism for mapping a Parameter Context to an alternate
                      Secret in the AWS Secrets Manager.
For more information, see Parameters.

false
--


CONTENT_REPO

The contents of the FlowFiles can be stored either in memory, on
                      the JVM heap, or on disk. If this environment variable is set, it specifies
                      the path to a directory where the content should be stored. If it is not
                      specified, the content is held in memory.
For more information, see File system for content
                      repository.
