Creating a Lambda function
AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for
    virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing
    servers.
Follow these steps to create an AWS Lambda function that is
      able to run DataFlow Functions:

Navigate to the AWS Lambda page in your cloud account in the region of your
          choice.






Click Create function.
The Create function page opens.

Fill in the Basic information section:


Keep the default Author from scratch option selected.


Give your function a meaningful name for your use case.


Select Java 8 on Amazon Linux 2 for Runtime.


Choose x86_64 for Architecture.


Click Create function.






Your function is created and its details are displayed.


In the Code source section of the Code
          tab, click Upload from > Amazon S3 location.
The Upload a file from Amazon S3 modal window appears.

Provide the S3 URL of  DataFlow Function binaries in the textbox.

noteYou have downloaded the DataFlow Function handler libraries as
            a zip of binaries from CDF and uploaded them to an S3 bucket when getting ready to run
            functions. AWS Lambda will use these binaries to run the NiFi flow. For instructions,
            see Downloading Lambda DataFlow Function binaries and uploading to
            S3.







Click Save.

Navigate to the Runtime Settings on the
            Code tab and click Edit to change the
          Handler property to:
            com.cloudera.naaf.aws.lambda.StatelessNiFiFunctionHandler::handleRequest


The details of your first function:






You can now start configuring your Lambda specifically for your flow and for your
        use case.
