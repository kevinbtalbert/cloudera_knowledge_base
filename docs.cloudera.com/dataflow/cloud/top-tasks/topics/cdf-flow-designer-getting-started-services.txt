Create controller services
Learn about creating Controller Services in CDF Flow Designer.

Controller Services are extension points that provide information for use by other
                components (such as processors or other controller services). The idea is that,
                rather than configure this information in every processor that might need it, the
                controller service provides it for any processor to use as needed.
You will use the controller services you create now to configure the behavior of
                several processors you will add to your flow as you are building it.
