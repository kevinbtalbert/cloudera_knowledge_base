Tutorial: Building a new flow from scratch
If you are new to flow design and have never used NiFi before, this tutorial is for
        you. Learn how to build a draft adding and configuring components, connecting them, creating
        Controller Services, and testing your flow while creating it.

This tutorial walks you through the creation of a simple flow design that retrieves
                the latest changes from Wikipedia through invoking the Wikipedia API. It converts
                JSON events to Avro, before filtering and routing them to two different processors
                which merge events together before a file is written to local disk.
You will learn about:

Creating a draft
Creating a Controller Service
Adding processors to your draft
Configuring processors
Adding a user-defined property to a processor configuration
Connecting processors to create relationships between them
Running a Test Session
Publishing a draft to the Catalog as a flow
                    definition.



The flow you are about to build can be deployed without any external dependencies and
                does not require any parameter values during deployment. Still, there are
                prerequisites you have to meet before you can start building your first draft.


You have an enabled and healthy CDF environment.


You have been assigned the DFDeveloper role granting you access to
                        the Flow Designer.


You have been assigned the DFCatalogAdmin or DFCatalogViewer role
                        granting you access to the Catalog. You will need this authorization to
                        publish your draft as a flow definition to the Catalog.


You have been assigned the DFFlowAdmin role for the environment to
                        which you want to deploy the flow definition.
