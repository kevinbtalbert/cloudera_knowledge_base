Creating CDP service account
The first step of executing DataFlow Functions code in your cloud environment is
    fetching the flow definition to be executed from the DataFlow Catalog. For this, you need to
    create a service account and provision an access key.

Navigate to the Management Console >  User Management >  Users.

From the Actions menu, select Create Machine
            User.

Provide a name and click Create.

noteMachine user names cannot start with a double underscore
            ("__").



The user details page is displayed showing information about the user.
