Retrieving data flow CRN
When configuring your function on the cloud provider service page, you need to provide
    the Customer Resource Number (CRN) of the flow to be executed.
You can retrieve the CRN by checking the flow in the DataFlow Catalog.noteThe CRN must include the specific version of the flow that should be
        executed, so it should end with some version suffix such as /v.1.
