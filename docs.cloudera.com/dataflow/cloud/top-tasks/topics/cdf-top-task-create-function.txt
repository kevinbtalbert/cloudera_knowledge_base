Creating a DataFlow function in AWS
You are all set up for creating your first DataFlow function: you have a flow definition
  created in and downloaded from NiFi, a Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) environment, and the appropriate
  rights to that environment. All you need now is to follow these steps to get your DataFlow
  function up and running.
Prerequisites
You have a data flow created in NiFi and downloaded as a flow definition JSON file.
You have an enabled and healthy CDF environment.

You have been assigned the DFCatalogAdmin role granting you access to
      the CDF Catalog.

You have been assigned the DFFlowAdmin role for the
      environment to which you want to deploy the flow definition.

An AWS user account is required with access policies that has permissions to list and create
      buckets, roles, and Lambda functions.



Import a flow definitionIf you want to use a NiFi flow in Cloudera DataFlow, you must import it as a flow     definition. When imported, the flow definition is added to the Flow Catalog. Retrieving data flow CRNWhen configuring your function on the cloud provider service page, you need to provide     the Customer Resource Number (CRN) of the flow to be executed.Creating CDP service accountThe first step of executing DataFlow Functions code in your cloud environment is     fetching the flow definition to be executed from the DataFlow Catalog. For this, you need to     create a service account and provision an access key.Generating Access Key ID and Private KeyA CDP machine user must have API access credentials to access CDP services through the     CDP CLI or API.Creating a Lambda functionAWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for     virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing     servers.Configuring your Lambda functionAfter you create a function, you can use the built-in configuration options to control     its behavior. You can configure additional capabilities, adjust resources associated with your     function, such as memory and timeout, or you can also create and edit test events to test your     function using the console.
