Creating a flow deployment
You are all set up for creating your first DataFlow deployment: you have a flow
  definition created in and downloaded from NiFi, a Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) environment, and the
  appropriate rights to that environment. All you need now is to follow a few easy steps to get your
  DataFlow deployment up and running.
Prerequisites
You have a data flow created in NiFi and downloaded as a flow definition JSON file.
You have an enabled and healthy CDF environment.

You have been assigned the DFCatalogAdmin role granting you access to
      the CDF Catalog.

You have been assigned the DFFlowAdmin role for the
      environment to which you want to deploy the flow definition.

The CDF Catalog is where you manage the flow definition lifecycle, from initial import,
    to versioning, to deploying a flow definition. 


Import a flow definitionIf you want to use a NiFi flow in Cloudera DataFlow, you must import it as a flow     definition. When imported, the flow definition is added to the Flow Catalog. Deploy a flow definitionDeploy a flow definition to run NiFi flows as flow deployments in CDF. To do this,     launch the Deployment wizard and specify your environment, parameters,     sizing, and KPIs.
