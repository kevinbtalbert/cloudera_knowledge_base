Learn how to recognize and fix common errors that might occur when you are downloading
    NAR (NiFi Archive) files.

By default, the NARs required for the execution of the function are downloaded
        from the Cloudera repository. Depending on where you designed your data flow, specific
        versions of the NAR files are expected, which may not be available in the Cloudera
        repository.
It is important to make sure that the referenced components have a version that
        is available in the repositories. If the component version is not available, you can:


override the NEXUS_URL property to use another repository


make the NARs available to your function by following the instructions
            provided in the Custom NARs topic of the relevant cloud provider section in
            the DataFlow Functions documentation


manually edit your flow definition JSON file to update the version of the
            components to use a version provided by Cloudera before you upload the file in the
            DataFlow Catalog.
