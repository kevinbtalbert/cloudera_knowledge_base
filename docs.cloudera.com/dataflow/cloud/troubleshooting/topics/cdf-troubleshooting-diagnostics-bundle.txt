                    from all components.

--start-time


Description

Specify the time from which you want logs to be collected. No logs generated
                    prior to the start time are collected.
If no end or start time is specified, log collection defaults to logs from the
                    past 24 hours. Time zone is assumed to be UTC. Collection throws an error and
                    does not begin if the provided end time is earlier than the provided start
                    time.

Possible values
Date and time in
                    YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm format.
                  For example, 2023-02-03T11:00

--end-time


Description
Specify the time to which you want logs to be collected. No logs generated after
                  the end time are collected. If no end or start time is specified, log
                    collection defaults to logs from the past 24 hours. Time zone is assumed to be
                    UTC. Collection throws an error and does not begin if the provided end time is
                    earlier than the provided start time.
Possible values
Date and time in
                    YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm format.
                  For example, 2023-02-03T11:01

--deployments


Description

Specify a list of DataFlow Deployment CRNs for which logs should be collected.
                    This list operates as an allowed list when present, only collecting logs for
                    specified deployments. If this list is not present, it allows log collection
                    from all Flow Deployments in the environment.

Possible values
List of valid CRNs

Possible values


ALL
collects logs from environment components and deployments, honoring
                        the provided allowed lists.

ENVIRONMENT

                        environment-components allowed list, and no logs from deployments except for
                        those specified in the deployments allowed list.
