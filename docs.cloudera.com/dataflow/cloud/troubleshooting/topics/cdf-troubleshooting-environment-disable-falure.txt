Troubleshooting errors that occur when disabling DataFlow for an environment fails
Learn how to recognize and correct common errors that occur when you are disabling
  Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) for an environment.
DataFlow can be in Bad Health due to a failed disablement process. If you see
   error messages in the Event History indicating that disabling DataFlow has
   failed, use the Retry Disable Process to try again to ensure that the issue is not
   transient.



If the issue persists, select Environments > Action > Reset Environment to clear DataFlowâ€™s state for the environment. Resetting the Environment
   allows you to enable DataFlow for the same environment again at a later stage. 
note
Resetting DataFlow does not terminate the associated cloud infrastructure. After
    resetting DataFlow for an environment, you must manually delete the cloud resources that were
    created during DataFlow enablement.
