Scope and goals
This tutorial walks you through the process of going from zero – no CDP Public Cloud
    tenant and no data flow – to a serverless NiFi flow on AWS Lambda in under 30 minutes without
    any Cloudera Sales or technical assistance.
You can deploy a serverless NiFi flow using DataFlow Functions without the need to
      create a Data Lake and to perfom the corresponding cloud prerequisite steps. Following this
      end-to-end workflow, you will:



Register for a 60-day trial for CDP Public Cloud Trial which will provision a
            tenant in CDP Public Cloud.


Implement a data distribution use case on a local development workstation
            using Apache NiFi.


Register the NiFi flow in Cloudera DataFlow Service as a DataFlow
            function.


Deploy the DataFlow function in serverless mode using AWS Lambda.
