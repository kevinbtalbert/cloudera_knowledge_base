Register for CDP Public Cloud 60-day trial
This section provides information on the free CDP Public Cloud (CDP-PC)
    trial.

Log into your Cloudera account.
If you do not have an account on cloudera.com, register for a new account here. 

Once you have a cloudera.com account created and you logged into the account, register
          for the 60-day CDP Public Cloud trial.


If your company has been registered for a trial account, by the end of the
              registration you will have a newly provisioned tenant on CDP Public Cloud.


If your company has not been registered for a trial account, shortly after
              completing the registration, the Cloudera Sales Team will reach out to you to complete
              your trial registration.





After completing the registration, you will receive an email with instructions on how
          to log into your newly provisioned tenant on CDP Public Cloud. Disregard steps 2 and 3 as
          DataFlow Function does not require any of the prerequisites to create an environment or a
          DataLake. 






After logging into the CDP-PC console with the credentials that you used to register
          for the trial, select the DataFlow service from the homepage.






If you click Functions in the left navigation pane, you can see
          the options for cloud provider functions.




This is from where you can Download on the AWS Lambda tile to download the DataFlow
            function binaries for AWS Lambda.


If you click Catalog in the left navigation pane, you can see
          that it is empty. You can develop a NiFi flow locally, test it, and then come back to the
            Catalog to upload it as a DataFlow function.
