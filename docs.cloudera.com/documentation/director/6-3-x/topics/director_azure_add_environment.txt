Adding an Altus Director Environment on Azure

To deploy Cloudera Manager and CDH on an Azure VM instance, begin by creating an environment. The environment defines common settings, like region and key pair, that Altus Director uses
with Azure. While creating an environment, you are also prompted to deploy its first cluster.
In the Add Environment screen:



Enter a name in the Environment Name field.
In the Cloud provider field, select Azure Cloud Platform.
In the Azure Cloud Environment field, select which Azure Cloud to use.
In the Subscription ID field, enter the Azure subscription ID.
In the Tenant ID field, enter the ID of your ADD tenant. See Obtain Obtaining Credentials for Altus Director for details on obtaining the AAD tenant ID.
In the Client ID field, enter the client ID of the Azure service principal you created earlier. See Obtaining Credentials for Altus Director for details on obtaining the client ID.
In the Client Secret field, enter the client secret of the Azure service principal you created earlier. See Obtaining Credentials for Altus Director for details on obtaining the client secret.
In the Region field, select which location to use.
In the SSH Credentials section:

Enter a username in the Username field. Azure creates the user specified here.
Create an SSH key with the following command:
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/my_azure_vm_keyname -t rsa
Copy the SSH private key into the Private key field. Altus Director uses the SSH key pairs to create and access VMs in Azure.


Click Continue to add the environment and advance to creating a cluster, either with the simple setup procedure or the advanced setup procedure:




A Creating a cluster with simple setup is quick and easy because many configuration choices have been made for you. This is a great way to try out the
product, and get a cluster up and running quickly. The advanced setup procedure gives you many more options for how you want your cluster to be configured, and can be
used to set up advanced features, like Kerberos, TLS, and external databases.
To proceed, and create one of these kinds of clusters, choose one of the following topics:

Simple Setup: Creating an Azure Cluster with Default Settings
Advanced Setup: Installing Cloudera Manager and CDH on Azure
