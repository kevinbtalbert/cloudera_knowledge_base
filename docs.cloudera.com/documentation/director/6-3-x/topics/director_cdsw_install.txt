Using Cloudera Data Science Workbench with Altus Director

Important: Cloudera Data Science Workbench is not currently supported with Cloudera Manager 6.0.0 and CDH 6.0.0. Consequently, you cannot use
Altus Director 6 to deploy Cloudera Data Science Workbench on a C6 cluster. Cloudera Data Science Workbench will be supported with Cloudera Enterprise 6 in a future release.
Altus Director support for Cloudera Data Science Workbench is currently available for the following platforms and versions:


Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Altus Director 2.6.0 (and higher)
Microsoft Azure - Altus Director 2.7 (and higher)


Cloudera Manager 5.13.1 (and higher 5.x versions)


CSD-based Cloudera Data Science Workbench 1.2.x (and higher)



To create a configuration file to bootstrap a cluster that includes Cloudera Data Science Workbench, see the sample configuration file for your cloud provider:

AWS: aws.cdsw.conf
Microsoft Azure: azure.cdsw.conf



Note:
Users of Altus Director 2.7 and higher on AWS or Azure: The latest sample aws.cdsw.conf and azure.cdsw.conf files include an instance-level setting for mountAllUnmountedDisks. This must be set to false:
normalizationConfig {
 mountAllUnmountedDisks: false
}
Users of Altus Director 2.6 on AWS: Set the lp.normalization.mountAllUnmountedDisksRequired global property to false in the Altus Director server's application.properties file and then restart Altus Director before you run the command to bootstrap a new cluster
that includes Cloudera Data Science Workbench. (The application.properties file is located at /etc/cloudera-director-server/application.properties on the Altus Director server instance.)
A sample configuration file for clusters including Cloudera Data Science Workbench on Google Cloud Platform is not available at this time.


For more information about using Cloudera Data Science Workbench with Altus Director, see Altus Director Support (AWS and Azure Only) in the
Cloudera Data Science Workbench documentation.
