Setting Altus Director Properties

This topic lists the configuration properties recognized by Altus Director. Upon installation, these properties are pre-configured with reasonable default values, and you can run either
client or server versions without specifying any of them. However, you might want to customize one or more properties, depending on your environment and the Altus Director features you want to
use.

Setting Configuration Properties
The Altus Director command line provides the simplest way to specify a configuration property. For example:
./bin/cloudera-director bootstrap-remote aws.simple.conf \
--lp.pipeline.retry.maxWaitBetweenAttempts=60 ...
./bin/cloudera-director-server --lp.security.disabled=false
Tip: If you want to configure many properties, add them to the /etc/cloudera-director-client/application.properties
file (for the client) or the /etc/cloudera-director-server/application.properties (for the server) in the Altus Director installation. Any changed properties in these
files take effect automatically when Altus Director is restarted. To override existing properties, set new values in the command line.
While the application.properties files are located on the Altus Director EC2 instance at /etc/cloudera-director-client/application.properties for the
client, and /etc/cloudera-director-server/application.properties, you can see an example of the files on Cloudera's GitHub site, showing the configuration properties.


For users upgrading Altus Director
If you modified the application.properties file in Altus Director, the result of an upgrade depends on the version of Linux you are using:

RHEL and CentOS - When new properties are introduced in Altus Director, they are added to application.properties.rpmnew.
The original application.properties file functions as before and is not overwritten with the new Altus Director version properties. You do not need to copy the new
properties from application.properties.rpmnew to the old application.properties file.
Ubuntu - The modified Altus Director application.properties file is backed up to a file named application.properties.dpkg-old. The original application.properties file is then overwritten by the new application.properties file containing new Altus Director properties. After upgrading, copy your changes from application.properties.dpkg-old to the
new application.properties file.


All the new properties are commented, and they all use valid defaults, so you do not necessarily need to merge the two properties files. But you must merge the two files if you want to
modify one of the newly introduced properties.
