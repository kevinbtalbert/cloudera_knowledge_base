Using Custom Repositories with Cloudera Manager and CDH

You can create a custom repository to use when deploying Cloudera Manager and CDH, for example, if your organization restricts internet access to the Cloudera repositories, or if you
wish to use custom AMIs preloaded with Cloudera Manager packages and CDH parcels.


Creating a Custom Repository

See Creating and Using a Package Repository
for Cloudera Manager in the Cloudera Manager documentation for instructions and a link for downloading the Cloudera Manager repository for various operating systems. Following these instructions
will ensure that your repository is created with the required directory structure. Be sure to choose an operating system that is supported by Altus Director.



Creating a Cloudera Manager and CDH AMI

For clusters running on AWS EC2 instances, you can reduce cluster bootstrap times by preloading the AMI with Cloudera Manager packages and CDH parcel files. For information on creating
AMIs preloaded with Cloudera Manager packages and CDH parcels for use by Altus Director see the README.md file on the Cloudera GitHub site.

Note: If you are using an AMI that already has Cloudera Manager or CDH pre-loaded on it, you must override the repository in Altus Director by
specifying a custom repository URL in the custom repository field. The version you specify in this URL override must match what is on your AMI, down to the three digits of the maintenance release.
For example, if you have CDH 5.5.1 on the AMI, the repository you specify should be /5.5.1 and not /5.5 or /5.
