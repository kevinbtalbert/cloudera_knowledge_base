Installing Altus Director Server and Client on the EC2 Instance

To install Altus Director, perform the following tasks. You must be either running as root or using sudo to perform these tasks.
Note: Cloudera strongly recommends using MySQL for production deployments of Altus Director, instead of H2. Use of the H2 database in production
environments can result in excessive space consumption for database files and slow database access.

RHEL 7 and CentOS 7
RHEL 6 and CentOS 6
Ubuntu
Installing Only Altus Director Server or Altus Director Client




RHEL 7 and CentOS 7


SSH as ec2-user (RHEL) or centos (CentOS) into the EC2 instance you created for Altus Director. If you have VPN or AWS
Direct Connect, SSH to your private IP address. Otherwise, use your public IP address.
ssh -i your_file.pem ec2-user@private_IP_address
Note: Depending on the operating system, different AMIs might require different SSH logins. To check the SSH login name for your EC2 instance, go
to the Instances page in the AWS Console and click the instance name to display details for your instance and click the Usage
Instructions tab. In this example, centos is used, not ec2-user:



Install a supported version of the Oracle JDK or OpenJDK on the Altus Director host.
Altus Director 6.x requires JDK version 8.


Oracle JDK
For download and installation information, see Java SE
Downloads on the Oracle web site.
After you download the RPM file to the EC2 instance, install the JDK:
sudo yum localinstall jdk-version-linux-x64.rpm

OpenJDK
Use the following command to download and install OpenJDK:
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
For more information, see How to download and install prebuilt OpenJDK packages.




Some RHEL 7 AMIs do not include wget by default. If your RHEL AMI does not include wget, install it now:
sudo yum install wget
Add the Altus Director repository to the package manager:
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo wget "http://username:password@archive.cloudera.com/p/director6/6.3/redhat7/cloudera-director.repo"
Install Altus Director server and client by running the following command:
sudo yum install cloudera-director-server cloudera-director-client
Start the Altus Director server by running the following command:
sudo service cloudera-director-server start
If the RHEL 7 or CentOS firewall is running on the EC2 instance where you have installed Altus Director, disable and stop the firewall with the following commands:
sudo systemctl disable firewalld
sudo systemctl stop firewalld

You are now ready to configure a SOCKS proxy.



RHEL 6 and CentOS 6


SSH as ec2-user into the EC2 instance you created for Altus Director. If you have VPN or AWS Direct Connect, SSH to your private IP address. Otherwise,
use your public IP address.
ssh -i your_file.pem ec2-user@private_IP_address
Install a supported version of the Oracle JDK or OpenJDK on the Altus Director host.
Altus Director 6.x requires JDK version 8.


Oracle JDK
For download and installation information, see Java SE
Downloads on the Oracle web site.
After you download the RPM file to the EC2 instance, install the JDK:
sudo yum localinstall jdk-version-linux-x64.rpm

OpenJDK
Use the following command to download and install OpenJDK:
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
For more information, see How to download and install prebuilt OpenJDK packages.




Add the Altus Director repository to the package manager:
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo wget "http://username:password@archive.cloudera.com/p/director6/6.3/redhat6/cloudera-director.repo"
Install Altus Director server and client by running the following command:
sudo yum install cloudera-director-server cloudera-director-client
Start the Altus Director server by running the following command:
sudo service cloudera-director-server start
Save the existing iptables rule set and disable the firewall:
sudo service iptables save
sudo chkconfig iptables off
sudo service iptables stop

You are now ready to configure a SOCKS proxy.



Ubuntu


SSH as ubuntu into the EC2 instance you created for Altus Director. If you have VPN or AWS Direct Connect, SSH to your private IP address. Otherwise use
your public IP address.
ssh -i your_file.pem ubuntu@private_IP_address
Add the Altus Director repository to the package manager and add the signing key.
If you are on version 14.04, run the following commands:
cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
sudo curl -L "http://username:password@archive.cloudera.com/p/director6/6.3/ubuntu1404/cloudera-director.list" -O
sudo curl -s -L "https://username:password@archive.cloudera.com/p/director6/6.3/ubuntu1404/archive.key" | sudo apt-key add -
If you are on version 16.04, run the following commands:
cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
sudo curl -L "http://username:password@archive.cloudera.com/p/director6/6.3/ubuntu1604/cloudera-director.list" -O
sudo curl -s -L "https://username:password@archive.cloudera.com/p/director6/6.3/ubuntu1604/archive.key" | sudo apt-key add -


If you are on version 18.04, run the following commands:

Install a supported version of the Oracle JDK or OpenJDK on the Altus Director host.
Altus Director 6.x requires JDK version 8.


Oracle JDK
For download and installation information, see Java SE
Downloads on the Oracle web site.
After downloading the installation file to the EC2 instance, install the JDK. The following example installs JDK version 7:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-j2sdk1.8


OpenJDK
Use the following command to download and install OpenJDK:
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
For more information, see How to download and install prebuilt OpenJDK packages.




Install Altus Director server by running the following command:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cloudera-director-server cloudera-director-client
Start the Altus Director server by running the following command:
sudo service cloudera-director-server start
Save the existing firewall rules and disable the firewall:
sudo iptables-save > ~/firewall.rules
sudo service ufw stop

You are now ready to configure a SOCKS proxy.



Installing Only Altus Director Server or Altus Director Client

The installation instructions above will install both the server and client. Cloudera recommends installing both because together they provide the full functionality of Altus Director.
Optionally, you can install just the client, and configure it to interact with an Altus Director server running on another machine, rather than the default localhost.
Similarly, you can install just the server, but then you will be unable to launch a cluster at the command line with a customized configuration file.
To install only the Altus Director client, run one of the following installation commands in place of the command given above:

For RHEL and CentoOS, run the command sudo yum install cloudera-director-client instead of sudo yum install
cloudera-director-server cloudera-director-client.
For Ubuntu, run the command sudo apt-get install cloudera-director-client instead of sudo apt-get install
cloudera-director-server cloudera-director-client.


To install only the Altus Director server, run one of the following installation commands in place of the command given above:

For RHEL and CentoOS, run the command sudo yum install cloudera-director-server instead of sudo yum install
cloudera-director-server cloudera-director-client.
For Ubuntu, run the command sudo apt-get install cloudera-director-server instead of sudo apt-get install
cloudera-director-server cloudera-director-client.
