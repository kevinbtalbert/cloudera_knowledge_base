Installing Altus Director Server and Client on Google Compute Engine

Cloudera recommends that you install Altus Director server on your cloud provider in the subnet where you will create CDH clusters, because Altus Director must have access to the
private IP addresses of the instances that it creates. To install Altus Director server, perform the following tasks.
Note: You must be either running as root or using sudo to perform these tasks.

RHEL 7 and CentOS 7
RHEL 6 and CentOS 6
Ubuntu




RHEL 7 and CentOS 7


In the Compute Engine > VM instances screen, click the SSH link next to your instance name.
This opens a new window.
Note: Alternatively, you can connect to your instance using:

SSH in a terminal using the following command:
ssh -i your_key_file -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null \ 
 -o CheckHostIP=no -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@ip_address
The gcloud compute ssh command. When you connect to your instance for the first time using the gcloud compute command-line tool, gcloud automatically
creates an ssh key and inserts it into the instance.



Install a supported version of the Oracle JDK or OpenJDK on the Altus Director host.
Altus Director 6.x requires JDK version 8.


Oracle JDK
For download and installation information, see Java SE
Downloads on the Oracle web site.
After you download the RPM file to the EC2 instance, install the JDK:
sudo yum localinstall jdk-version-linux-x64.rpm

OpenJDK
Use the following command to download and install OpenJDK:
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
For more information, see How to download and install prebuilt OpenJDK packages.




Download Altus Director by running the following commands:
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo wget "http://username:password@archive.cloudera.com/p/director6/6.3/redhat7/cloudera-director.repo"
Install Altus Director server by running the following command:
sudo yum install cloudera-director-server cloudera-director-client
Start the Altus Director server by running the following command:
sudo service cloudera-director-server start
Disable and stop the firewall with the following commands:
sudo systemctl disable firewalld
sudo systemctl stop firewalld

You are now ready to configure a SOCKS proxy for your instances.
