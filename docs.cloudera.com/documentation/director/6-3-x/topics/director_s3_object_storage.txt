Using Amazon S3 Object Storage

For clusters running on AWS, Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides an efficient and cost-effective cloud storage option. For information on the uses of Amazon S3 in a CDH
cluster, and how to configure Amazon S3 using Cloudera Manager, see How
to Configure AWS Credentials and Configuring the Amazon S3
Connector in the Cloudera Enterprise documentation. For links to more topics focused on Amazon S3 from the core Cloudera Enterprise documentation library, see Get Started with Amazon S3.
Note: S3Guard is a feature that guarantees consistent read operations for data stored in Amazon S3. Without S3Guard, Amazon S3 only guarantees
"eventual consistency" for data stored in S3, which means that data written to Amazon S3 might not be immediately available for queries and listing operations. S3Guard adds an additional metadata
store using an Amazon DynamoDB instance that allows for consistent read operations and improved performance. Instructions for configuring S3Guard in Altus Director are included below. For more
information on S3Guard, see Configuring and Managing S3Guard in the Cloudera
Enterprise documentation.
Important: CDH 5.11.1 clusters using S3Guard can share Amazon DynamoDB tables with CDH 5.12.x clusters, but CDH 5.11.0 clusters cannot share tables with CDH 5.12.x clusters. You must upgrade CDH 5.11.0 clusters using S3Guard to CDH 5.11.1 or higher in order to use the same tables for S3Guard metadata as CDH 5.12
clusters.



Configuring Amazon S3 with Altus Director

Cluster access to Amazon S3 storage can be configured through Altus Director by launching your cluster with a configuration file and the bootstrap-remote CLI command. Altus Director
will make the necessary API calls and pass your AWS access key information or IAM role information to Cloudera Manager so that S3 access is set up according to your configuration settings. Sample
content for the sections of the configuration file needed to configure Amazon S3 access is in the aws.reference.conf configuration file, but is commented-out by default. To provide your
cluster instances with access to Amazon S3, configure the following sections of the configuration file:

First, create an external account with AWS access in the External Accounts section of your configuration file. There are two choices for
authentication, as described in the configuration file comments, AWS access key authentication or IAM role authentication.

To use AWS access key authentication, uncomment the appropriate section shown below and provide an AWS access key and an AWS secret key.
To use IAM role authentication, uncomment the appropriate section show below and choose or create an IAM policy that includes Amazon S3 access (such as the AWS-managed policy
AmazonS3FullAccess) and attach this policy to the IAM role that you assign to your cluster instances. IAM roles for instances that will use S3Guard should also
include a policy that gives access to DynamoDB (such as the AWS-managed policy AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess). Specify the IAM role for the instance with the iamProfileName property in the common-instance-properties section of the configuration file.

  #
  # External accounts
  #

  # # Any external accounts that should be set up within Cloudera Manager. These will allow some cluster
  # # services to utilize cloud functionality, such as object stores.
  #
  # # Note: CM/CDH 5.10 is required for this feature. At the moment, only AWS external accounts are supported.
  # externalAccounts {
  #
  #     # External account that uses AWS Access Key Authentication. This type of authentication
  #     # will also require the AWS_S3 service.
  #     AWSAccount1 {
  #         type: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_AUTH
  #         configs {
  #             aws_access_key: REPLACE-ME
  #             aws_secret_key: REPLACE-ME
  #
  #             #
  #             # S3 Guard (added in CM/CDH 5.11) can be enabled to guarantee a consistent view of data stored
  #             # in Amazon S3 by storing additional metadata in a table residing in an Amazon DynamoDB instances.
  #             # See https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_s3guard.html for more
  #             # details and additional S3 Guard configuration properties.
  #             #
  #
  #             # s3guard_enable: false
  #             # s3guard_region: REPLACE-ME
  #             # s3guard_table_name: s3guard-metadata
  #             # s3guard_table_auto_create: false
  #         }
  #     }
  #
  #     # External account that uses IAM Role Authentication.
  #     AWSAccount2 {
  #         type: AWS_IAM_ROLES_AUTH
  #     }
Optionally, to use S3Guard with IAM role authentication, copy the S3Guard configurations from the access key authentication configs block to the IAM role
authentication section and configure them.
# s3guard_enable: false
  # s3guard_region: REPLACE-ME
  # s3guard_table_name: s3guard-metadata
  # s3guard_table_auto_create: false
For descriptions of the S3Guard configuration properties, see the table in Configuring S3Guard in the Enterprise documentation. Use the API names given in this table when adding properties to the configs block of the Altus
Director configuration file. For more information about the differences between AWS access key authentication and IAM role-based authentication, and the characteristics and use cases for each of
them, see the sections on each in How to Configure AWS
Credentials in the Enterprise documentation.
Note: When you bootstrap a cluster with Altus Director that is configured to use external accounts, you will see the external accounts in the Altus
Director web UI. But if you use Cloudera Manager to add external accounts to an existing cluster, while these external accounts will be functional and available to use, they will not appear in the
Altus Director web UI. In this case, you must use Cloudera Manager to view all external accounts for the cluster.


Next, if you are using access key authentication, add (or uncomment) the Cloudera S3 Connector service, AWS_S3, in
the list of cluster services in the Cluster description section of the configuration file. You should also add the AWS_S3 service
with IAM role-based authentication if you are enabling S3Guard. Use of IAM role authentication doesn't require adding the AWS_S3 service if S3Guard is not enabled.

                HDFS,
                YARN,

                HBASE,
                HIVE,
                HUE,

                # AWS_S3     # Requires Sentry and Kerberos (on default configurations)
              ]
Finally, point the AWS_S3 service to the external account you created in step #1 above in the custom service configurations section :
 #
    # Optional custom service configurations
    # Configuration keys containing special characters (e.g., '.', ':') must be enclosed in double quotes.
    #
    # Configuration properties for CDH roles and services are documented at
    # https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/properties/5-11-x/topics/cm_props_cdh5110.html
    #

    #
    # configs {
    #     AWS_S3 {
    #       cloud_account: AWSAccount1
    #     }
    #
    #     HDFS {
    #       dfs_block_size: 134217728
    #     }
    #
    #     MAPREDUCE {
    #       mapred_system_dir: /user/home
    #       mr_user_to_impersonate: mapred1
    #     }
    #
    #     KAFKA {
    #       "num.partitions": 3
    #     }
    # }

Note: By default, as noted in the comment in the configuration file shown in step 2 above, Sentry and Kerberos are required for the AWS_S3 service.
You can disable this requirement by setting the key_distribution_policy to UNSECURE in the configs section of the configuration file
(shown in step 3 above).
AWS_S3 {
  cloud_account: AWSAccount1
  key_distribution_policy: UNSECURE
}
