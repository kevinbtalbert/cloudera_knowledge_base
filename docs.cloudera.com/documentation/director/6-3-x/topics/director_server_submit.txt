Submitting a Cluster Configuration File

In Altus Director, you can deploy clusters in two ways:

Through the Altus Director server web UI.
Through the Altus Director client, which you can use to send a configuration file that the server uses for cluster deployment. The configuration file provides advanced options not
available in the server web UI.


This section describes the second of these ways, using the Altus Director client to submit a configuration file. The configuration file will be applied to the cluster and managed by the
Altus Director server.
When you submit a cluster configuration from a Altus Director client to the Altus Director server, all communications are transmitted in the clear (including the AWS credentials) unless
you use TLS. If the client and server communicate over the Internet, Cloudera recommends that you either use TLS, or use a VPN for security. For information about configuring Altus Director to
require TLS encryption for access, see Enabling TLS for the Altus Director Server and Client.
Note: If you create tags in the configuration file for AWS or Google Cloud Platform instance metadata or for service or role configurations,
special characters, such as periods and colons, must be enclosed in double quotes. This includes some characters required by the HOCON format. For example, a tag value that would require quoting is
"company:department:team". See the AWS and Google Cloud Platform documentation for information about which special characters are supported on these cloud platforms in
instance metadata tags.
To submit a cluster configuration file to the Altus Director server, follow these steps:

Create a configuration file. See Provisioning a Cluster on
AWS.
Install the latest version of the Altus Director client from the Altus
Director Download Page.
Enter the following command:

cloudera-director bootstrap-remote myconfig.conf --lp.remote.username=admin --lp.remote.password=admin --lp.remote.hostAndPort=host:port
myconfig.conf is the name of your configuration file, admin is the default value for both the username and password for the Admin
account (enter your actual values), host is the hostname or IP address of the instance on which Altus Director server is running, and port is the port on which it is listening. The default port for Altus Director is 7189.
Both the Altus Director client (in the terminal where the bootstrap-remote command was issued) and the Altus Director server web UI display the status
throughout the deployment process.
