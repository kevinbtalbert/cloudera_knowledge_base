User Management

User roles control the actions a user can perform. There are currently two user roles:

Admin - For administrative access. Has full access to Altus Director functionality, and can perform the following actions:

Add environments, Cloudera Manager instances, and clusters
Delete environments
Terminate Cloudera Manager and cluster instances
Review environments, Cloudera Manager instances, and clusters
Grow and shrink clusters
Add and delete users
Change user roles
Change passwords, including own password


Guest - For read-only access.


On installation, the Altus Director server component includes one of each of the two kinds of user accounts:

admin - Default password: admin
guest - Default password: guest


Cloudera recommends that you change the passwords for these accounts after installing the server. User accounts can be created, deleted, enabled, or disabled. A disabled user account
cannot log in or perform any Altus Director actions.
User account data is kept in the Altus Director database. You can define new user accounts for Altus Director with either the server web UI or the API.

Note: Cloudera Manager has many more user roles that control access to Cloudera Manager features. For more information see Cloudera Manager User Roles in the Enterprise documentation.
