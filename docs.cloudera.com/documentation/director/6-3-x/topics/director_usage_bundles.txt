Altus Director Usage Bundles

An Altus Director usage bundle is a JSON document representing a snapshot in time of Cloudera Manager and cluster usage. It contains three sections: a metadata section, a Cloudera
Manager block, and an Altus Director block.
Note: All passwords and sensitive information included in Altus Director usage bundles are redacted.


Continue reading:

Metadata Section
Cloudera Manager Block
Altus Director Block
Usage Logging




Metadata Section

The short metadata section in a usage bundle contains:

The version of the metadata structure
The complete license key and billing ID for the deployment
The creation time of the bundle
A message ID structure, used by Cloudera's metering service for context and sequencing





Cloudera Manager Block

The Cloudera Manager block contains information queried from Cloudera Manager about itself and clusters that it manages.
Initial metadata in the block includes the metadata structure version and the host, port, and API version of Cloudera Manager itself.
Next, the block contains details about Cloudera Manager itself, as retrieved from its /cm/deployment API endpoint. See the Cloudera Manager REST API documentation for complete information. The data is retrieved from Cloudera
Manager using its export redacted view, which eliminates sensitive configuration information such as passwords. This deployment data includes information about all
clusters and their services, all hosts, and all management services. Some specific data items in the details are:

Cluster, service, and role names
Service and role configurations (redacted) and health statuses
Cloudera Manager's internal user accounts, with redacted passwords
Instances' Cloudera Manager host identifiers, private IP addresses, and private host names
Instances' core counts and memory sizes


Finally, the block includes time series data for the capacity and used capacity of each filesystem associated with the Cloudera Manager instance and with every instance that is part of a
cluster. The data covers the five minutes prior to the bundle's creation. See the Cloudera
Manager REST API documentation for complete information on the data structures in a time series. Instance private IP addresses and host names are included in the time series data.



Altus Director Block

The Altus Director block contains information queried from Altus Director itself about Cloudera Manager installations and clusters that it manages. For complete information on the data
structures described here, consult the Altus Director
API documentation or explore using the API console included with Altus Director, at the /api-console URL.
Initial metadata in the block includes the metadata structure version and the host, port, and API version of Altus Director itself. Ensuing details begin with the version of Altus
Director and the time when the block was created.
Next, the block includes the deployment template used to create the Cloudera Manager installation. The data retrieved from Altus Director here is redacted, eliminating potentially
sensitive information such as external database account details and inline scripts. Some specific data items are:

Redacted license and billing ID (which are available unredacted in the usage bundle metadata)
External Cloudera Manager database templates, if any
The Cloudera Manager instance template


After some deployment health and status information, details about the running deployment are included. As with the deployment template information, deployment information is redacted
to eliminate potentially sensitive information such as the Cloudera Manager administrator password. Some specific data items are:

The Cloudera Manager version and private IP address
Details about the instance running Cloudera Manager, including its public and private IP addresses and host names, information specific to the cloud provider such as virtual network
and subnet identifiers, its installed software capabilities, and its instance template
The Cloudera Manager port and administrative username


Next, the cluster templates for each of the clusters created by Altus Director are listed. As with other Altus Director API calls, cluster template information such as inline scripts
is redacted for security. Some specific data items are:

The cluster template name and list of services deployed
External service database templates, if any
Virtual instance groups and associated instance templates


Finally, after some cluster status and health information, details about each bootstrapped cluster are provided. Sensitive information is left out of these query results like the rest.
Some specific data items are:

Overall cluster health and individual service health checks
Installed software capabilities of each cluster instance





Usage Logging

Altus Director is capable of logging usage bundles and heartbeats as they exist immediately before submission to Cloudera's metering service. The logging is disabled by default, but it
can be enabled and configured to provide visibility into precisely what Altus Director is sending out.
To enable usage logging in the Altus Director server, locate the logback.xml file used to configure its logging system. The file is normally in /usr/lib/cloudera-director-server/etc
[check this]. Look for the configurations for the following loggers:

com.cloudera.director.metering.heartbeats
com.cloudera.director.metering.bundles


Change the level for each logger to INFO to enable usage logging. To disable usage logging, change the level back to
ERROR. After changing the level, restart Altus Director so that the change takes effect.
The logging configuration writes the JSON for heartbeats and usage bundles to a dedicated log file. Those comfortable with configuring the Logback logging system can make further changes
to have the information written elsewhere. Consult Logback documentation for the options available.
Usage logging increases the demand for file storage on the Altus Director instance. Do not enable it for long periods of time, to avoid running out of disk space.
