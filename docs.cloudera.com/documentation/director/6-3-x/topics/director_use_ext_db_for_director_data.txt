Using MySQL for Altus Director Server

You can set up an external MySQL database to store Altus Director server data. In a production environment, Cloudera recommends that you set up an external database for the Altus
Director server instead of using the default H2 database.
To use a MySQL database for Altus Director data, complete the following steps:

Install the MySQL server.
Configure and start the MySQL server.
Install the MySQL JDBC driver.
Create a database for the Altus Director server.
Configure the Altus Director server to use the MySQL database.




Installing the MySQL Server

Note:

If you already have a MySQL database set up, you can skip to Configuring and Starting the MySQL
Server to verify that your MySQL configuration meets the requirements for Altus Director.
The datadir directory (/var/lib/mysql by default) must be located on a partition that has sufficient free space.



Install the MySQL database.




OS
Command




RHEL and Centos

$ sudo yum install mysql-server


 
 


Ubuntu

$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server




After issuing the command, you might need to confirm that you want to complete the installation.




Configuring and Starting the MySQL Server


Determine the version of MySQL.
Stop the MySQL server if it is running.




OS
Command




RHEL and Centos

$ sudo service mysqld stop


Ubuntu

$ sudo service mysql stop





Move old InnoDB log files /var/lib/mysql/ib_logfile0 and /var/lib/mysql/ib_logfile1 from /var/lib/mysql/ to a backup location.
Determine the location of the option file, my.cnf,
and update it as follows::

To prevent deadlocks, set the isolation level to read committed.
Configure MySQL to use the InnoDB engine, rather than MyISAM. (The default storage engine for MySQL is MyISAM.) To check which engine your tables are using, run the following command from the MySQL shell:
mysql> show table status;
To configure MySQL to use the InnoDB storage engine, add the following line to the [mysqld] section of the my.cnf option file:
[mysqld]
default-storage-engine = innodb
Binary logging is not a requirement for Altus Director installations. Binary logging provides benefits such as MySQL replication or point-in-time incremental recovery after database
restore. Examples of this configuration follow. For more information, see The Binary Log.

Following is a typical option file:
[mysqld]
default-storage-engine = innodb
transaction-isolation = READ-COMMITTED
# Disabling symbolic-links is recommended to prevent assorted security risks;
# to do so, uncomment this line:
# symbolic-links = 0

key_buffer_size = 32M
max_allowed_packet = 32M
thread_stack = 256K
thread_cache_size = 64
query_cache_limit = 8M
query_cache_size = 64M
query_cache_type = 1

max_connections = 550

#log_bin should be on a disk with enough free space. Replace '/var/lib/mysql/mysql_binary_log' with an appropriate path for your system.
#log_bin=/var/lib/mysql/mysql_binary_log
#expire_logs_days = 10
#max_binlog_size = 100M

# For MySQL version 5.1.8 or higher. Comment out binlog_format for lower versions.
binlog_format = mixed

read_buffer_size = 2M
read_rnd_buffer_size = 16M
sort_buffer_size = 8M
join_buffer_size = 8M

# InnoDB settings
innodb_file_per_table = 1
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit  = 2
innodb_log_buffer_size = 64M
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 4G
innodb_thread_concurrency = 8
innodb_flush_method = O_DIRECT
innodb_log_file_size = 512M

[mysqld_safe]
log-error=/var/log/mysqld.log
pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
If AppArmor is running on the host where MySQL is installed, you might need to configure AppArmor to allow MySQL to write to the binary.
Ensure that the MySQL server starts at boot.




OS
Command




RHEL and Centos

$ sudo /sbin/chkconfig mysqld on
$ sudo /sbin/chkconfig --list mysqld
mysqld          0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off


Ubuntu

$ sudo chkconfig mysql on
Note: chkconfig might not be available on recent Ubuntu releases. You might need to use Upstart to configure MySQL
to start automatically when the system boots. For more information, see the Ubuntu documentation or the Upstart
Cookbook.






Start the MySQL server:




OS
Command




RHEL and Centos

$ sudo service mysqld start


Ubuntu

$ sudo service mysql start





Set the MySQL root password. In the following example, the current root password is blank. Press the Enter key when you're
prompted for the root password.
$ sudo /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
[...]
Enter current password for root (enter for none):
OK, successfully used password, moving on...
[...]
Set root password? [Y/n] y
New password:
Re-enter new password:
Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
[...]
Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] N
[...]
Remove test database and access to it [Y/n] Y
[...]
Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
All done!




Installing the MySQL JDBC Driver

Install the MySQL JDBC driver for the Linux distribution you are using.




OS
Command




RHEL and Centos


Download the MySQL JDBC driver from the Download Connector/J page of the MySQL web
site.
Extract the JDBC driver JAR file from the downloaded file. For example:
tar zxvf mysql-connector-java-version.tar.gz
Add the JDBC driver, renamed, to the relevant server. For example:
$ sudo cp
                        mysql-convnector-java-version/mysql-connector-java-version-bin.jar
                          /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar
If the target directory does not yet exist on this host, you can create it before copying the JAR file. For example:
$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/java/
$ sudo cp
mysql-connector-java-version/mysql-connector-java-version-bin.jar
                      /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar

Note: Do not use the yum install command to install the MySQL connector package, because it installs the openJDK,
and then uses the Linux alternatives command to set the system JDK to be the openJDK.



Ubuntu

$ sudo apt-get install libmysql-java







Creating a Database for Altus Director Server


You can create the database on the host where the Altus Director server will run, or on another host that is accessible by the Altus Director server. The database must be configured to
support UTF-8 character set encoding.
Record the values you enter for database names, usernames, and passwords. Altus Director requires this information to connect to the database.



Log into MySQL as the root user:
$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
Create a database for Altus Director server:
mysql> create database database DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql > grant all on database.* TO 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
database, user, and password can be any value. The examples match the names you provide in the
Altus Director configuration settings described below in Configuring Altus Director Server to use the
MySQL Database.




Backing Up MySQL Databases

To back up the MySQL database, run the mysqldump command on the MySQL host, as follows:
$ mysqldump -hhostname -uusername -ppassword database > /tmp/database-backup.sql
You can restore the MySQL database from your backed-up copy.
Note: Be sure to stop Altus Director server before backing up or restoring. For backups, it is important that no database writes are happening
while the backup is being made. For restoring, Altus Director server should be stopped because it won't reread its database until you restart it.





Configuring Altus Director Server to use the MySQL Database

Before starting the Altus Director server, edit the "Configurations for database connectivity" section of /etc/cloudera-director-server/application.properties.
Note: If the Altus Director server is already running, it must be restarted after configuring MySQL access. The server will not load configuration
updates while running.
.
#

#

# Optional database type (H2 or MySQL) (defaults to H2)
#lp.database.type: mysql
