Avro
A serialization system for storing and transmitting data over a network. Apache Avro supports rich data structures, a compact binary encoding, and a container file for sequences of Avro
data (often referred to as Avro data files). Avro is language-independent and several language bindings are available, including Java, C, C++, Python, and Ruby. All components
in CDH that produce or consume files support Avro data files.
Avro provides functionality similar to systems such as Thrift and Protocol Buffers.
