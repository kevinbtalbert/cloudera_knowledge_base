cluster

A set of computers or racks of computers that contains an HDFS filesystem and runs MapReduce and other processes on that data. A pseudo-distributed cluster is a CDH
installation run on a single machine and useful for demonstrations and individual study.
In Cloudera Manager, a logical entity that contains a set of hosts, a single version of CDH installed on the hosts, and the service and role instances running on the hosts. A host can
belong to only one cluster. Cloudera Manager can manage multiple CDH clusters, however each cluster can only be associated with a single Cloudera Manager Server or Cloudera Manager HA pair.
