gateway
A type of role that typically provides client access to specific cluster services. For example, HDFS, Hive, Kafka, MapReduce, Solr, and Spark each have gateway roles to provide access
for their clients to their respective services. Gateway roles do not always have "gateway" in their names, nor are they exclusively for client access. For example, Hue Kerberos Ticket Renewer is a
gateway role that proxies tickets from Kerberos.
The node supporting one or more gateway roles is sometimes referred to as the gateway node or edge node, with the notion of "edge" common
in network or cloud environments. In terms of the Cloudera cluster, the gateway nodes in the cluster receive the appropriate client configuration files when Deploy Client
Configuration is selected from the Actions menu in Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
