Impala
Official name: Apache Impala. A service that enables real-time querying of data stored in HDFS or HBase. It supports the same metadata and ODBC and JDBC drivers as Apache Hive
and a query language based on the Hive Standard Query Language (HiveQL). To avoid latency, Impala circumvents MapReduce to directly
access data through a specialized distributed query engine that is similar to those found in commercial parallel RDBMS.
