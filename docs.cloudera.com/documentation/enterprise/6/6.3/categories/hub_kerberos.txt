Kerberos
An authentication protocol in wide use since it was first developed by MIT in 1993 and standardized by the IETF in 2005 (RFC 4120, Kerberos Version 5). Cloudera recommends using Kerberos
to secure clusters, by integrating either MIT Kerberos or Microsoft Active Directory (which uses Kerberos). With Kerberos enabled, user authentication is required. Once users authenticate, other
components of the cluster can also be leveraged (for example, Sentry's role-based access privileges) to provide appropriate, secure access to the cluster. See Cloudera Security for more information.
