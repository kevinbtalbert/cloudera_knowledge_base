Kudu
A columnar storage manager for the Hadoop platform. Like other Hadoop ecosystem applications, Apache Kudu runs on commodity hardware, is horizontally scalable, and supports highly
available operation.
Fast processing, integration with Hadoop ecosystem components, high availability, and other benefits make it ideal for a variety of applications: reporting applications where new data
must be immediately available for end users; time-series applications that must support queries across large amounts of historic data while simultaneously returning granular queries about an
individual entity; and applications that use predictive models to make real-time decisions.
