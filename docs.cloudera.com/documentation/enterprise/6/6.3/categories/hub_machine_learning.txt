machine learning
A field of computer science that explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Categories of machine learning problems include:

Recommendation mining - Identifies things users will like based on past preferences; for example, online shopping recommendations.
Clustering - Groups similar items; for example, documents that address similar topics.
Classification - Learns what members of existing categories have in common and then uses that information to categorize new items.
Frequent item-set mining - Examines a set of item-groups (such as items in a query session or shopping cart content) and identifies items that usually appear together.

Libraries implementing machine learning algorithms include:

Mahout
Oryx
Apache Spark MLlib
