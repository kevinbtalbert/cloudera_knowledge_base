List of Pages in Category Metadata (12 pages)

metadata
Data about data. Metadata includes attributes that characterize the entities contained in or generated by the cluster. The name and date properties associated with a file created on a
hard-disk drive are examples of metadata. Apache Sentry generates metadata to indicate who can access cluster files and tables. Cloudera Navigator collects system-generated metadata (technical
metadata) for cluster entities and allows you to create additional metadata to associate with these entities.
