Cloudera Navigator
A fully integrated data management and security tool for the Hadoop platform. Cloudera Navigator provides three categories of functionality:

Auditing data access and verifying access privileges. Cloudera Navigator allows administrators to configure, collect, and view audit events, and generate reports that list the HDFS
access permissions granted to groups. Cloudera Navigator tracks access permissions and actual accesses to all entities in HDFS, Hive, HBase, Hue, Impala, Sentry, and Solr.
Searching metadata and visualizing lineage. Metadata management features allow DBAs, data modelers, business analysts, and data scientists to search for, amend the properties of, and
tag data entities. Cloudera Navigator supports tracking the lineage of HDFS files, datasets, and directories, Hive tables and columns, MapReduce and YARN jobs, Hive queries, Impala queries, Pig
scripts, Oozie workflows, Spark jobs, and Sqoop jobs.
Securing data and simplifying storage and management of encryption keys. Data encryption and key management provide protection against potential threats by malicious actors on the
network or in the datacenter. It is also a requirement for meeting key compliance initiatives and ensuring the integrity of enterprise data.
