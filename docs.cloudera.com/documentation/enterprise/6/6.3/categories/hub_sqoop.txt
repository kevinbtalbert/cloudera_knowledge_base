Sqoop
A tool for efficiently transferring bulk data between Hadoop and external structured datastores, such as relational databases. Apache Sqoop imports the contents of tables into HDFS, Hive, and HBase and generates Java classes that enable users to interpret the table's schema. Sqoop can also extract data from Hadoop storage and export
records from HDFS to external structured datastores such as relational databases and enterprise data warehouses.
There are two versions: Sqoop and Sqoop 2. Sqoop requires client-side installation and configuration. Sqoop 2 is a web-based service with a client command-line interface. In Sqoop 2,
connectors and database drivers are configured on the server.
