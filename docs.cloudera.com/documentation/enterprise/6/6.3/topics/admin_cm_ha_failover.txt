Step 4: Automating Failover with Corosync and Pacemaker

Corosync and Pacemaker are popular
high-availability utilities that allow you to configure Cloudera Manager to fail over automatically.

This document describes one way to set up clustering using these tools. Actual setup can be done in several ways, depending on the network configuration of your
environment.

Setting up the Cloudera Manager Service

Setting Up Corosync
Setting Up Pacemaker
Testing Failover with Pacemaker




Prerequisites:

Install Pacemaker and Corosync on CMS1, MGMT1,
CMS2, and MGMT2, using the correct versions for your Linux
distribution:
Note: The versions referred to for setting up automatic failover in this document are Pacemaker 1.1.11 and Corosync 1.4.7. See http://clusterlabs.org/wiki/Install to determine what works best for your Linux distribution.
RHEL/CentOS:
yum install pacemaker corosync
Ubuntu:
apt-get install pacemaker corosync
SUSE:
zypper install pacemaker corosync

Make sure that the crm tool exists on all of the hosts. This procedure uses the crm tool, which works with Pacemaker
configuration. If this tool is not installed when you installed Pacemaker (verify this by running which crm), you can download and install the tool for your
distribution using the instructions at http://crmsh.github.io/installation.




About Corosync and Pacemaker



By default, Corosync and Pacemaker are not autostarted as part of the boot sequence. Cloudera recommends leaving this as is. If the machine crashes and restarts, manually make sure
that failover was successful and determine the cause of the restart before manually starting these processes to achieve higher availability.

If the /etc/default/corosync file exists, make sure that START is set to yes in that file:
START=yes
Make sure that Corosync is not set to start automatically, by running the following command:
RHEL/CentOS/SUSE:
chkconfig corosync off
Ubuntu:
update-rc.d -f corosync remove



Note which version of Corosync is installed. The contents of the configuration file for Corosync (corosync.conf) that you edit varies based on the
version suitable for your distribution. Sample configurations are supplied in this document and are labeled with the Corosync version.
This document does not demonstrate configuring Corosync with authentication (with secauth set to on). The Corosync website
demonstrates a mechanism to encrypt traffic using symmetric keys.
Firewall configuration:
Corosync uses UDP transport on ports 5404 and 5405, and these ports must be open for both inbound and outbound traffic on all hosts. If you are using IP tables, run a command similar
to the following:
sudo iptables -I INPUT -m state --state NEW -p udp -m multiport --dports 5404,5405 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -m state --state NEW -p udp -m multiport --sports 5404,5405 -j ACCEPT






Setting up Cloudera Manager Server

Set up a Corosync cluster over unicast, between CMS1 and CMS2, and make sure that the hosts can âclusterâ together. Then, set up Pacemaker to register Cloudera Manager Server as a resource that it monitors and to fail over to
the secondary when needed.


Setting up Corosync


Edit the /etc/corosync/corosync.conf file on CMS1 and replace the entire contents with
the following text (use the correct version for your environment):
Corosync version 1.x:
compatibility: whitetank
totem {
        version: 2
        secauth: off
        interface {
                member {
                        memberaddr: CMS1
                }
                member {
                        memberaddr: CMS2
                }
                ringnumber: 0
                bindnetaddr: CMS1
                mcastport: 5405
        }
        transport: udpu
}

logging {

        timestamp: on
        logger_subsys {
                subsys: AMF
                debug: off
        }
}
service {
        # Load the Pacemaker Cluster Resource Manager
        name: pacemaker
        ver:  1
        #
}
Corosync version 2.x:
totem {
version: 2
secauth: off
cluster_name: cmf
transport: udpu
}

nodelist {
  node {
        ring0_addr: CMS1
        nodeid: 1
       }
  node {

        nodeid: 2
       }
}

quorum {
provider: corosync_votequorum
two_node: 1
}

Edit the /etc/corosync/corosync.conf file on CMS2, and replace the entire contents with
the following text (use the correct version for your environment):
Corosync version 1.x:
compatibility: whitetank
totem {
        version: 2
        secauth: off
        interface {
                member {
                        memberaddr: CMS1
                }
                member {
                        memberaddr: CMS2
                }
                ringnumber: 0
                bindnetaddr: CMS2
                mcastport: 5405
        }
        transport: udpu
}

logging {
        fileline: off
        to_logfile: yes
        to_syslog: yes
        logfile: /var/log/cluster/corosync.log
        debug: off

        logger_subsys {
                subsys: AMF
                debug: off
        }
}
service {
        # Load the Pacemaker Cluster Resource Manager
        name: pacemaker
        ver:  1
        #
}
Corosync version 2.x:
totem {
version: 2
secauth: off
cluster_name: cmf
transport: udpu
}

nodelist {
  node {
        ring0_addr: CMS1
        nodeid: 1
       }
  node {
        ring0_addr: CMS2
        nodeid: 2
       }
}

quorum {
provider: corosync_votequorum
two_node: 1
}

Restart Corosync on CMS1 and CMS2 so that the new
configuration takes effect:
service corosync restart




Setting up Pacemaker

You use Pacemaker to set up Cloudera Manager Server as a cluster resource.
See the Pacemaker configuration reference at http://clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html/Clusters_from_Scratch/ for more details about Pacemaker options.
The following steps demonstrate one way, recommended by Cloudera, to configure Pacemaker for simple use:

Disable autostart for Cloudera Manager Server (because you manage its lifecycle through Pacemaker) on both CMS1 and
CMS2:
RHEL/CentOS/SUSE:
chkconfig cloudera-scm-server off
Ubuntu:
update-rc.d -f cloudera-scm-server remove
Make sure that Pacemaker has been started on both CMS1 and CMS2:
/etc/init.d/pacemaker start
Make sure that crm reports two nodes in the cluster:
# crm status
Last updated: Wed Mar  4 18:55:27 2015
Last change: Wed Mar  4 18:38:40 2015 via crmd on CMS1
Stack: corosync
Current DC: CMS1 (1) - partition with quorum
Version: 1.1.10-42f2063
2 Nodes configured
0 Resources configured

Change the Pacemaker cluster configuration (on either CMS1 or CMS2):
crm configure property no-quorum-policy=ignore
crm configure property stonith-enabled=false
crm configure rsc_defaults resource-stickiness=100
These commands do the following:

Disable quorum checks. (Because there are only two nodes in this cluster, quorum cannot be established.)
Disable STONITH explicitly (see Enabling STONITH (Shoot the other node in the head)).
Reduce the likelihood of the resource being moved among hosts on restarts.



Add Cloudera Manager Server as an LSB-managed resource (either on CMS1 or CMS2):
crm configure primitive cloudera-scm-server lsb:cloudera-scm-server
Verify that the primitive has been picked up by Pacemaker:
crm_mon
For example:
$ crm_mon
Last updated: Tue Jan 27 15:01:35 2015
Last change: Mon Jan 27 14:10:11 2015
Stack: classic openais (with plugin)
Current DC: CMS1 - partition with quorum
Version: 1.1.11-97629de
2 Nodes configured, 2 expected votes
1 Resources configured
Online: [ CMS1 CMS2 ]
cloudera-scm-server
(lsb:cloudera-scm-server):
Started CMS1



At this point, Pacemaker manages the status of the cloudera-scm-server service on hosts CMS1 and CMS2, ensuring that only one instance is running at a time.
Note: Pacemaker expects all lifecycle actions, such as start and stop, to go through Pacemaker; therefore, running direct service start or service stop commands breaks that assumption.




Testing Failover with Pacemaker

Test Pacemaker failover by running the following command to move the cloudera-scm-server resource to CMS2:
crm resource move cloudera-scm-server <CMS2>
Test the resource move by connecting to a shell on CMS2 and verifying that the cloudera-scm-server
process is now active on that host. It takes usually a few minutes for the new services to come up on the new host.



Enabling STONITH (Shoot the other node in the head)

The following link provides an explanation of the problem of fencing and ensuring (within reasonable limits) that only one host is running a shared resource at a time: http://clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html-single/Clusters_from_Scratch/index.html#idm140603947390416
As noted in that link, you can use several methods (such as IPMI) to
achieve reasonable guarantees on remote host shutdown. Cloudera recommends enabling STONITH, based on the hardware configuration in your environment.




Setting up the Cloudera Manager Service

Setting Up Corosync


Edit the /etc/corosync/corosync.conf file on MGMT1 and replace the entire contents with
the contents below; make sure to use the correct section for your version of Corosync:
Corosync version 1.x:
compatibility: whitetank
totem {
        version: 2
        secauth: off
        interface {
                member {
                        memberaddr: MGMT1
                }
                member {
                        memberaddr: MGMT2
                }
                ringnumber: 0
                bindnetaddr: MGMT1
                mcastport: 5405
        }
        transport: udpu
}

logging {
        fileline: off
        to_logfile: yes
        to_syslog: yes
        logfile: /var/log/cluster/corosync.log
        debug: off
        timestamp: on
        logger_subsys {
                subsys: AMF
                debug: off
        }
}
service {
        # Load the Pacemaker Cluster Resource Manager
        name: pacemaker
        ver:  1
        #
}
Corosync version 2.x:
totem {
version: 2
secauth: off
cluster_name: mgmt
transport: udpu
}

nodelist {
  node {
        ring0_addr: MGMT1
        nodeid: 1
       }
  node {
        ring0_addr: MGMT2
        nodeid: 2
       }
}

quorum {
provider: corosync_votequorum
two_node: 1
}

Edit the /etc/corosync/corosync.conf file on MGMT2 andf replace the contents with the
contents below:
Corosync version 1.x:
compatibility: whitetank
totem {
        version: 2
        secauth: off
        interface {
                member {
                        memberaddr: MGMT1
                }
                member {
                        memberaddr: MGMT2
                }
                ringnumber: 0
                bindnetaddr: MGMT2
                mcastport: 5405
        }
        transport: udpu
}

logging {
        fileline: off
        to_logfile: yes
        to_syslog: yes
        logfile: /var/log/cluster/corosync.log
        debug: off
        timestamp: on
        logger_subsys {
                subsys: AMF
                debug: off
        }
}
service {
        # Load the Pacemaker Cluster Resource Manager
        name: pacemaker
        ver:  1
        #
}
Corosync version 2.x:
totem {
version: 2
secauth: off
cluster_name: mgmt
transport: udpu
}

nodelist {
  node {
        ring0_addr: CMS1
        nodeid: 1
       }
  node {
        ring0_addr: CMS2
        nodeid: 2
       }
}

quorum {
provider: corosync_votequorum
two_node: 1
}

Restart Corosync on MGMT1 and MGMT2 for the new
configuration to take effect:
service corosync restart
Test whether Corosync has set up a cluster, by using the corosync-cmapctl or corosync-objctl commands. You should see two
members with status joined:
corosync-objctl | grep "member"
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.1.config_version (u64) = 0
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.1.ip (str) = r(0) ip(MGMT1)
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.1.join_count (u32) = 1
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.1.status (str) = joined
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.2.config_version (u64) = 0
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.2.ip (str) = r(0) ip(MGMT2)
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.2.join_count (u32) = 1
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.2.status (str) = joined





Setting Up Pacemaker

Use Pacemaker to set up Cloudera Management Service as a cluster resource.
See the Pacemaker configuration reference at http://clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html/Clusters_from_Scratch/ for more information about Pacemaker options.
Because the lifecycle of Cloudera Management Service is managed through the Cloudera Manager Agent, you configure the Cloudera Manager Agent to be highly available.
Follow these steps to configure Pacemaker, recommended by Cloudera for simple use:

Disable autostart for the Cloudera Manager Agent (because Pacemaker manages its lifecycle) on both MGMT1 and
MGMT2:
RHEL/CentOS/SUSE
chkconfig cloudera-scm-agent off
Ubuntu:
update-rc.d -f cloudera-scm-agent remove

Make sure that Pacemaker is started on both MGMT1 and MGMT2:
/etc/init.d/pacemaker start
Make sure that the crm command reports two nodes in the cluster; you can run this command on either host:
# crm status
Last updated: Wed Mar  4 18:55:27 2015
Last change: Wed Mar  4 18:38:40 2015 via crmd on MGMT1
Stack: corosync
Current DC: MGMT1 (1) - partition with quorum
Version: 1.1.10-42f2063
2 Nodes configured
0 Resources configured
Change the Pacemaker cluster configuration on either MGMT1 or MGMT2:
crm configure property no-quorum-policy=ignore
crm configure property stonith-enabled=false
crm configure rsc_defaults resource-stickiness=100
As with Cloudera Manager Server Pacemaker configuration, this step disables quorum checks, disables STONITH explicitly, and reduces the likelihood of resources being moved between
hosts.

Create an Open Cluster Framework (OCF) provider on both MGMT1 and MGMT2 for Cloudera Manager Agent for use with Pacemaker:

Create an OCF directory for creating OCF resources for Cloudera Manager:
mkdir -p /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/cm
Create a Cloudera Manager Agent OCF wrapper as a file at /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/cm/agent, with the following content, on both MGMT1 and MGMT2:

Run chmod on that file to make it executable:
chmod 770 /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/cm/agent


Test the OCF resource script:
/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/cm/agent monitor
This script should return the current running status of the SCM agent.

Add Cloudera Manager Agent as an OCF-managed resource (either on MGMT1 or MGMT2):
crm configure primitive cloudera-scm-agent ocf:cm:agent
Verify that the primitive has been picked up by Pacemaker by running the following command:
crm_mon
For example:
>crm_mon

(ocf:cm:agent):
Started MGMT2


Pacemaker starts managing the status of the cloudera-scm-agent service on hosts MGMT1
and MGMT2, ensuring that only one instance is running at a time.
Note: Pacemaker expects that all lifecycle actions, such as start and stop, go through Pacemaker; therefore, running direct service start or service stop commands on one of the hosts breaks that assumption and could cause Pacemaker to start the service on the other
host.




Testing Failover with Pacemaker

Test that Pacemaker can move resources by running the following command, which moves the cloudera-scm-agent resource to MGMT2:
crm resource move cloudera-scm-agent MGMT2
Test the resource move by connecting to a shell on MGMT2 and verifying that the cloudera-scm-agent and the associated Cloudera Management Services processes are now active on that host. It usually takes a few minutes for the new services to come up on the new
host.
