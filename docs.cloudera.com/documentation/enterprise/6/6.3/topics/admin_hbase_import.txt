Importing Data Into HBase


Note: This page contains references to CDH 5 components or features that have been removed from CDH 6. These references are only applicable if you
are managing a CDH 5 cluster with Cloudera Manager 6. For more information, see Deprecated Items.

The method you use for importing data into HBase depends on several factors:

The location, size, and format of your existing data
Whether you need to import data once or periodically over time
Whether you want to import the data in bulk or stream it into HBase regularly
How fresh the HBase data needs to be


Always run HBase administrative commands as the HBase user (typically hbase).

Choosing the Right Import Method

If the data is already in an HBase table:


To move the data from one HBase cluster to another, use snapshot and either the clone_snapshot or ExportSnapshot utility; or, use the CopyTable utility.


To move the data from one HBase cluster to another without downtime on either cluster, use replication.


If the data currently exists outside HBase:


If possible, write the data to HFile format, and use a BulkLoad to import it into HBase. The data is immediately available to HBase and you can bypass the normal write path, increasing
efficiency.


If you prefer not to use bulk loads, and you are using a tool such as Pig, you can use it to import your data.


If you need to stream live data to HBase instead of import in bulk:


Write a Java client using the Java API, or use the Apache Thrift Proxy API to write a client in a language supported by Thrift.


Stream data directly into HBase using the REST Proxy API in conjunction with an HTTP client such as wget or curl.


Use Flume or Spark.


Most likely, at least one of these methods works in your situation. If not, you can use MapReduce directly. Test the most feasible methods with a subset of your data to determine which
one is optimal.



Using CopyTable

CopyTable uses HBase read and write paths to copy part or all of a table to a new table in either the same cluster or a different cluster. CopyTable causes read load when reading from the source, and write load when writing to the destination. Region splits occur on the destination table in real time as needed. To
avoid these issues, use snapshot and export commands instead of CopyTable. Alternatively, you can
pre-split the destination table to avoid excessive splits. The destination table can be partitioned differently from the source table. See this section of the Apache HBase documentation for more information.
Edits to the source table after the CopyTable starts are not copied, so you may need to do an additional CopyTable
operation to copy new data into the destination table. Run CopyTable as follows, using --help to see details about possible parameters.
$ ./bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.CopyTable --help
Usage: CopyTable [general options] [--starttime=X] [--endtime=Y] [--new.name=NEW] [--peer.adr=ADR] <tablename>
The starttime/endtime and startrow/endrow pairs function in a
similar way: if you leave out the first of the pair, the first timestamp or row in the table is the starting point. Similarly, if you leave out the second of the pair, the operation continues until
the end of the table. To copy the table to a new table in the same cluster, you must specify --new.name, unless you want to write the copy back to the same table, which
would add a new version of each cell (with the same data), or just overwrite the cell with the same value if the maximum number of versions is set to 1 (the default in CDH 5). To copy the table to a
new table in a different cluster, specify --peer.adr and optionally, specify a new table name.
The following example creates a new table using HBase Shell in non-interactive mode, and then copies data in two ColumnFamilies in rows starting with timestamp 1265875194289 and
including the last row before the CopyTable started, to the new table.
echo create 'NewTestTable', 'cf1', 'cf2', 'cf3' | bin/hbase shell --non-interactive
bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.CopyTable --starttime=1265875194289  --families=cf1,cf2,cf3 --new.name=NewTestTable TestTable
Snapshots are recommended instead of CopyTable for most situations.



Using Snapshots

Cloudera recommends snapshots instead of CopyTable where possible. A snapshot captures the state of a table at the time the snapshot was taken. Because no data is copied when a snapshot
is taken, the process is very quick. As long as the snapshot exists, cells in the snapshot are never deleted from HBase, even if they are explicitly deleted by the API. Instead, they are archived so
that the snapshot can restore the table to its state at the time of the snapshot.
After taking a snapshot, use the clone_snapshot command to copy the data to a new (immediately enabled) table in the same cluster, or the Export utility to
create a new table based on the snapshot, in the same cluster or a new cluster. This is a copy-on-write operation. The new table shares HFiles with the original table until writes occur in the new
table but not the old table, or until a compaction or split occurs in either of the tables. This can improve performance in the short term compared to CopyTable.
To export the snapshot to a new cluster, use the ExportSnapshot utility, which uses MapReduce to copy the snapshot to the new cluster. Run the ExportSnapshot utility on the source cluster, as a user with HBase and HDFS write permission on the destination cluster, and HDFS read permission on the source cluster. This
creates the expected amount of IO load on the destination cluster. Optionally, you can limit bandwidth consumption, which affects IO on the destination cluster. After the ExportSnapshot operation
completes, you can see the snapshot in the new cluster using the list_snapshot command, and you can use the clone_snapshot command to
create the table in the new cluster from the snapshot.
For full instructions for the snapshot and clone_snapshot HBase Shell commands, run the HBase Shell and type help snapshot. The following example takes a snapshot of a table, uses it to clone the table to a new table in the same cluster, and then uses the ExportSnapshot utility to copy the table to a different cluster, with 16 mappers and limited to 200 Mb/sec bandwidth.

You can use the SnapshotInfo command-line utility included with HBase to verify or debug snapshots.



Using BulkLoad

HBase uses the well-known HFile format to store its data on disk. In many situations, writing HFiles programmatically with your data, and bulk-loading that data into HBase on the
RegionServer, has advantages over other data ingest mechanisms. BulkLoad operations bypass the write path completely, providing the following benefits:

The data is available to HBase immediately but does cause additional load or latency on the cluster when it appears.
BulkLoad operations do not use the write-ahead log (WAL) and do not cause flushes or split storms.
BulkLoad operations do not cause excessive garbage collection.
Note: Because they bypass the WAL, BulkLoad operations are not propagated between clusters using replication. If you need the data on all
replicated clusters, you must perform the BulkLoad on each cluster.



If you use BulkLoads with HBase, your workflow is similar to the following:

Extract your data from its existing source. For instance, if your data is in a MySQL database, you might run the mysqldump
command. The process you use depends on your data. If your data is already in TSV or CSV format, skip this step and use the included ImportTsv utility to process your
data into HFiles. See the ImportTsv documentation for details.
Process your data into HFile format. See http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#_hfile_format_2 for details about HFile format. Usually you use a MapReduce job for the conversion, and you often need to write the Mapper yourself
because your data is unique. The job must to emit the row key as the Key, and either a KeyValue, a Put, or
a Delete as the Value. The Reducer is handled by HBase; configure it using HFileOutputFormat.configureIncrementalLoad() and it does the following:

Inspects the table to configure a total order partitioner
Uploads the partitions file to the cluster and adds it to the DistributedCache
Sets the number of reduce tasks to match the current number of regions
Sets the output key/value class to match HFileOutputFormat requirements
Sets the Reducer to perform the appropriate sorting (either KeyValueSortReducer or PutSortReducer)


One HFile is created per region in the output folder. Input data is almost completely re-written, so you need available disk space at least twice the size
of the original data set. For example, for a 100 GB output from mysqldump, you should have at least 200 GB of available disk space in HDFS. You can delete the original
input file at the end of the process.
Load the files into HBase. Use the LoadIncrementalHFiles command (more commonly known as the completebulkload tool), passing it a URL that locates the files in HDFS. Each file is loaded into the relevant region on the
RegionServer for the region. You can limit the number of versions that are loaded by passing the --versions= N option, where N is the maximum number of versions to include, from newest to oldest (largest timestamp to smallest timestamp).
If a region was split after the files were created, the tool automatically splits the HFile according to the new boundaries. This process is inefficient, so if your table is being
written to by other processes, you should load as soon as the transform step is done.



The following illustration shows the full BulkLoad process.




Extra Steps for BulkLoad With Encryption Zones
When using BulkLoad to import data into HBase in the a cluster using encryption zones, the following information is important.

Both the staging directory and the directory into which you place your generated HFiles need to be within HBase's encryption zone (generally under the /hbase directory). Before you can do this, you need to change the permissions of /hbase to be world-executable but not world-readable (rwx--x--x, or numeric mode 711).
You also need to configure the HMaster to set the permissions of the HBase root directory correctly. If you use Cloudera Manager, edit the Master Advanced
Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hbase-site.xml. Otherwise, edit hbase-site.xml on the HMaster. Add the following:
<property>
  <name>hbase.rootdir.perms</name>
  <value>711</value>
</property>
If you skip this step, a previously-working BulkLoad setup will start to fail with permission errors when you restart the HMaster.




Use Cases for BulkLoad


Loading your original dataset into HBase for the first time - Your initial dataset might be quite large, and bypassing the HBase write path can speed up
the process considerably.
Incremental Load - To load new data periodically, use BulkLoad to import it in batches at your preferred intervals. This alleviates latency problems and
helps you to achieve service-level agreements (SLAs). However, one trigger for compaction is the number of HFiles on a RegionServer. Therefore, importing a large number of HFiles at frequent
intervals can cause major compactions to happen more often than they otherwise would, negatively impacting performance. You can mitigate this by tuning the compaction settings such that the maximum
number of HFiles that can be present without triggering a compaction is very high, and relying on other factors, such as the size of the Memstore, to trigger compactions.
Data needs to originate elsewhere - If an existing system is capturing the data you want to have in HBase and needs to remain active for business reasons,
you can periodically BulkLoad data from the system into HBase so that you can perform operations on it without impacting the system.




Using BulkLoad On A Secure Cluster
If you use security, HBase allows you to securely BulkLoad data into HBase. For a full explanation of how secure BulkLoad works, see HBase Transparent Encryption at Rest.
First, configure a hbase.bulkload.staging.dir which will be managed by HBase and whose subdirectories will be writable (but not readable) by HBase users.
Next, add the org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.access.SecureBulkLoadEndpoint coprocessor to your configuration, so that users besides the hbase user can BulkLoad files into HBase.
<property>
  <name>hbase.bulkload.staging.dir</name>
  <value>/tmp/hbase-staging</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hbase.coprocessor.region.classes</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.access.SecureBulkLoadEndpoint</value>
</property>

More Information about BulkLoad
For more information and examples, as well as an explanation of the ImportTsv utility, which can be used to import data in text-delimited formats such as CSV, see this post on the Cloudera Blog.




Using Cluster Replication

If your data is already in an HBase cluster, replication is useful for getting the data into additional HBase clusters. In HBase, cluster
replication refers to keeping one cluster state synchronized with that of another cluster, using the write-ahead log (WAL) of the source cluster to propagate the changes. Replication is enabled at
column family granularity. Before enabling replication for a column family, create the table and all column families to be replicated, on the destination cluster. Replication is supported both from
CDH 5 to CDH 6 and from CDH 6 to CDH 5, the source and destination cluster do not have to run the same major version of CDH.
Cluster replication uses an active-push methodology. An HBase cluster can be a source (also called active, meaning that it
writes new data), a destination (also called passive, meaning that it receives data using replication), or can fulfill both roles at once. Replication is asynchronous, and the
goal of replication is consistency.
When data is replicated from one cluster to another, the original source of the data is tracked with a cluster ID, which is part of the metadata.
All clusters that have already consumed the data are also tracked. This prevents replication loops.
Common Replication Topologies

A central source cluster might propagate changes to multiple destination clusters, for failover or due to geographic distribution.
A source cluster might push changes to a destination cluster, which might also push its own changes back to the original cluster.
Many different low-latency clusters might push changes to one centralized cluster for backup or resource-intensive data-analytics jobs. The processed data might then be replicated back
to the low-latency clusters.
Multiple levels of replication can be chained together to suit your needs. The following diagram shows a hypothetical scenario. Use the arrows to follow the data paths.



At the top of the diagram, the San Jose and Tokyo clusters, shown in red, replicate
changes to each other, and each also replicates changes to a User Data and a Payment Data cluster.
Each cluster in the second row, shown in blue, replicates its changes to the All Data Backup 1 cluster, shown in
grey. The All Data Backup 1 cluster replicates changes to the All Data Backup 2 cluster (also shown in grey), as well as the Data Analysis cluster (shown in green). All Data Backup 2 also propagates any of its own changes back to All Data Backup
1.
The Data Analysis cluster runs MapReduce jobs on its data, and then pushes the processed data back to the
San Jose and Tokyo clusters.
Configuring Clusters for Replication
To configure your clusters for replication, see HBase Replication and Configuring Secure HBase Replication. The following is a high-level overview of the steps to enable replication.
Important: You cannot run replication-related HBase commands as an HBase administrator. To run replication-related HBase commands, you must
have HBase user permissions. If ZooKeeper uses Kerberos, configure HBase Shell to authenticate to ZooKeeper using
Kerberos before attempting to run replication-related commands. No replication-related ACLs are available at this time.



Configure and start the source and destination clusters.
Create tables with the same names and column families on both the source and destination clusters, so that the destination cluster knows where to store data it receives. All hosts in
the source and destination clusters should be reachable to each other. See Creating the Empty Table On the Destination
Cluster.
On the source cluster, enable replication in Cloudera Manager, or by setting hbase.replication to true in hbase-site.xml.
Obtain Kerberos credentials as the HBase principal. Substitute your fully.qualified.domain.name and realm in the following command:
kinit -k -t /etc/hbase/conf/hbase.keytab hbase/fully.qualified.domain.name@YOUR-REALM.COM
On the source cluster, in HBase Shell, add the destination cluster as a peer, using the add_peer command. The
syntax is as follows:
add_peer 'ID', 'CLUSTER_KEY'
The ID must be a short integer. To compose the CLUSTER_KEY, use the following template:
hbase.zookeeper.quorum:hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort:zookeeper.znode.parent
If both clusters use the same ZooKeeper cluster, you must use a different zookeeper.znode.parent, because they cannot write in the same folder.

On the source cluster, configure each column family to be replicated by setting its REPLICATION_SCOPE to 1, using commands such as the following in HBase
Shell.
hbase> disable 'example_table'
hbase> alter 'example_table', {NAME => 'example_family', REPLICATION_SCOPE => '1'}
hbase> enable 'example_table'
Verify that replication is occurring by examining the logs on the source cluster for messages such as the following.
Considering 1 rs, with ratio 0.1
Getting 1 rs from peer cluster # 0
Choosing peer 192.0.2.49:62020
To verify the validity of replicated data, use the included VerifyReplication MapReduce job on the source cluster,
providing it with the ID of the replication peer and table name to verify. Other options are available, such as a time range or specific families to verify.
The command has the following form:
hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.replication.VerifyReplication [--starttime=timestamp1] [--stoptime=timestamp] [--families=comma separated list of families] <peerId> <tablename>
The VerifyReplication command prints GOODROWS and BADROWS counters to indicate rows that did
and did not replicate correctly.



Note:
Some changes are not replicated and must be propagated by other means, such as Snapshots or CopyTable. See Initiating Replication When Data Already Exists for more details.

Using Pig and HCatalog

Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets using a high-level language. Apache HCatalog is a sub-project of Apache Hive, which enables reading and writing of data from one
Hadoop utility to another. You can use a combination of Pig and HCatalog to import data into HBase. The initial format of your data and other details about your infrastructure determine the steps you
follow to accomplish this task. The following simple example assumes that you can get your data into a TSV (text-separated value) format, such as a tab-delimited or comma-delimited text file.

Format the data as a TSV file. You can work with other file formats; see the Pig and HCatalog project documentation for more details.
The following example shows a subset of data from Google's NGram Dataset,
which shows the frequency of specific phrases or letter-groupings found in publications indexed by Google. Here, the first column has been added to this dataset as the row ID. The first column is
formulated by combining the n-gram itself (in this case, Zones) with the line number of the file in which it occurs (z_LINE_NUM). This
creates a format such as "Zones_z_6230867." The second column is the n-gram itself, the third column is the year of occurrence, the fourth column is the frequency of
occurrence of that Ngram in that year, and the fifth column is the number of distinct publications. This extract is from the z file of the 1-gram dataset from version 20120701. The data is truncated
at the ... mark, for the sake of readability of this document. In most real-world scenarios, you will not work with tables that have five columns. Most HBase tables
have one or two columns.
Zones_z_6230867 Zones 1507 1 1
Zones_z_6230868 Zones 1638 1 1

Using the hadoop fs command, put the data into HDFS. This example places the file into an /imported_data/ directory.
hadoop fs -put zones_frequency.tsv /imported_data/
Create and register a new HBase table in HCatalog, using the hcat command, passing it a DDL file to represent your table. You could also register an
existing HBase table, using the same command. The DDL file format is specified as part of the Hive REST
API. The following example illustrates the basic mechanism.
CREATE TABLE
zones_frequency_table (id STRING, ngram STRING, year STRING, freq STRING, sources STRING)
STORED BY 'org.apache.hcatalog.hbase.HBaseHCatStorageHandler'
TBLPROPERTIES (
  'hbase.table.name' = 'zones_frequency_table',
  'hbase.columns.mapping' = 'd:ngram,d:year,d:freq,d:sources',
  'hcat.hbase.output.bulkMode' = 'true'
);
hcat -f zones_frequency_table.ddl
Create a Pig file to process the TSV file created in step 1, using the DDL file created in step 3. Modify the file names and other parameters in this command to match your values if
you use data different from this working example. USING PigStorage('\t') indicates that the input file is tab-delimited. For more details about Pig syntax, see the
Pig Latin reference documentation.
A = LOAD 'hdfs:///imported_data/zones_frequency.tsv' USING PigStorage('\t') AS (id:chararray, ngram:chararray, year:chararray, freq:chararray, sources:chararray);
-- DUMP A;
STORE A INTO 'zones_frequency_table' USING org.apache.hcatalog.pig.HCatStorer();
Save the file as zones.bulkload.pig.

Use the pig command to bulk-load the data into HBase.
pig -useHCatalog zones.bulkload.pig
The data is now in HBase and is available to use.






Using the Java API

The Java API is the most common mechanism for getting data into HBase, through Put operations. The Thrift and REST APIs, as well as the HBase Shell, use the Java API. The following
simple example ouses the Java API to put data into an HBase table. The Java API traverses the entire write path and can cause compactions and region splits, which can adversely affect performance.
...
  HTable table = null;
  try {
    table = myCode.createTable(tableName, fam);
    int i = 1;
    List<Put> puts = new ArrayList<Put>();
    for (String labelExp : labelExps) {
      Put put = new Put(Bytes.toBytes("row" + i));
      put.add(fam, qual, HConstants.LATEST_TIMESTAMP, value);
      puts.add(put);
      i++;
    }
    table.put(puts);
  } finally {
    if (table != null) {
      table.flushCommits();
    }
  }
...



Using the Apache Thrift Proxy API

The Apache Thrift library provides cross-language client-server remote procedure calls (RPCs), using Thrift bindings. A Thrift binding is client code generated by
the Apache Thrift Compiler for a target language (such as Python) that allows communication between the Thrift server and clients using that client code. HBase includes an Apache Thrift Proxy API,
which allows you to write HBase applications in Python, C, C++, or another language that Thrift supports. The Thrift Proxy API is slower than the Java API and may have fewer features. T use the
Thrift Proxy API, you need to configure and run the HBase Thrift server on your cluster. You also need to install the Apache Thrift compiler on your development system.
After the Thrift server is configured and running, generate Thrift bindings for the language of your choice, using an IDL file. A HBase IDL file named HBase.thrift is included as part of HBase. After generating the bindings, copy the Thrift libraries for your language into the same directory as the generated bindings. In the
following Python example, these libraries provide the thrift.transport and thrift.protocol libraries. These commands show how you might
generate the Thrift bindings for Python and copy the libraries on a Linux system.
mkdir HBaseThrift
cd HBaseThrift/
thrift -gen py /path/to/Hbase.thrift
mv gen-py/* .
rm -rf gen-py/
mkdir thrift
cp -rp ~/Downloads/thrift-0.9.0/lib/py/src/* ./thrift/
The following example shows a simple Python application using the Thrift Proxy API.
from thrift.transport import TSocket
from thrift.protocol import TBinaryProtocol
from thrift.transport import TTransport
from hbase import Hbase

# Connect to HBase Thrift server
transport = TTransport.TBufferedTransport(TSocket.TSocket(host, port))
protocol = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocolAccelerated(transport)

# Create and open the client connection
client = Hbase.Client(protocol)
transport.open()

# Modify a single row
mutations = [Hbase.Mutation(
  column='columnfamily:columndescriptor', value='columnvalue')]
client.mutateRow('tablename', 'rowkey', mutations)

# Modify a batch of rows
# Create a list of mutations per work of Shakespeare
mutationsbatch = []

for line in myDataFile:
    rowkey = username + "-" + filename + "-" + str(linenumber).zfill(6)

    mutations = [
            Hbase.Mutation(column=messagecolumncf, value=line.strip()),
            Hbase.Mutation(column=linenumbercolumncf, value=encode(linenumber)),
            Hbase.Mutation(column=usernamecolumncf, value=username)
        ]

       mutationsbatch.append(Hbase.BatchMutation(row=rowkey,mutations=mutations))

# Run the mutations for all the lines in myDataFile
client.mutateRows(tablename, mutationsbatch)

transport.close()
The Thrift Proxy API does not support writing to HBase clusters that are secured using Kerberos.
This example was modified from the following two blog posts on http://www.cloudera.com. See them for more details.

Using the REST Proxy API

After configuring and starting HBase on your cluster, you can use the HBase REST Proxy API to stream data into HBase, from within another application or shell script, or by using an HTTP
client such as wget or curl. The REST Proxy API is slower than the Java API and may have fewer features. This approach is simple and does
not require advanced development experience to implement. However, like the Java and Thrift Proxy APIs, it uses the full write path and can cause compactions and region splits.
Specified addresses without existing data create new values. Specified addresses with existing data create new versions, overwriting an existing version if the row, column:qualifier, and
timestamp all match that of the existing value.

curl -H "Content-Type: text/xml" http://localhost:8000/test/testrow/test:testcolumn
The REST Proxy API does not support writing to HBase clusters that are secured using Kerberos.
For full documentation and more examples, see the REST Proxy API documentation.



Using Flume

Apache Flume is a fault-tolerant system designed for ingesting data into HDFS, for use with Hadoop. You can configure Flume to write data directly into HBase. Flume includes a sink
designed to work with HBase: HBase2Sink (org.apache.flume.sink.hbase2.HBase2Sink). HBase2Sink supports HBase 2 IPC calls, and allows you to write data to an HBase cluster that is secured by
Kerberos.
The following code is an example configuration for HBase2Sink. For more information about configuring HBase2Sink, see the Flume documentation. The table, columnFamily, and column parameters correlate to the HBase table, column family, and column where the data is to be imported. The serializer is the class that converts the data at the source into
something HBase can use. Configure your sinks in the Flume configuration file.
In practice, you usually need to write your own serializer, which implements HBase2EventSerializer. The HBase2EventSerializer converts Flume Events into one or more HBase Puts, sends
them to the HBase cluster, and is closed when the HBase2Sink stops.
HBase2Sink:
#Use the HBase2Sink
host1.sinks.sink1.type = org.apache.flume.sink.hbase2.HBase2Sink
host1.sinks.sink1.channel = ch1
host1.sinks.sink1.table = transactions
host1.sinks.sink1.columnFamily = clients
host1.sinks.sink1.column = charges
host1.sinks.sink1.batchSize = 5000
#Use the SimpleHBase2EventSerializer that comes with Flume
host1.sinks.sink1.serializer = org.apache.flume.sink.hbase2.SimpleHBase2EventSerializer
host1.sinks.sink1.serializer.incrementColumn = icol
host1.channels.ch1.type=memory
The following serializer, based on an Apache Flume blog post by Dan
Sandler, splits the event body based on a delimiter and inserts each split into a different column. The column names are defined in the serializer.columns sink parameter. The row key is defined
in the event header. When each event is received, a counter is incremented to track the number of events received.

Using Sqoop

Sqoop can import records into a table in HBase. It has an out-of-the-box support for HBase.

There are two mandatory options you must specify when using the sqoop import command to import data into HBase using Sqoop:

--hbase-table: Specifies the name of the table in HBase to which you want to import your data.
--column-family: Specifies into which column family Sqoop imports the data of your tables.




For example, you can import the table cities into an already existing HBase table with the same name and use the column family name world:
sqoop import --connect jdbc:mysql://mysql.example.com/sqoop --username sqoop --password sqoop --table cities --hbase-table cities --column-family world

If the target table and column family do not exist, the Sqoop job will exit with an error. You must create the target table and column family before running an import. If you specify
--hbase-create-table, Sqoop creates the target table and column family if they do not exist, using the default parameters from your HBase configuration.
Sqoop needs to identify which RDBMS column is used as row key column in the HBase table. There are three ways to do this:

By default, with the column name specified in the --split-by option
With the primary key of the table, if it is available
With the --hbase-row-key parameter, which overrides both the --split-by option and the primary key of the table


For more information on data insertion into HBase, see Sqoop User
Guide.


Import NULL Column Updates into HBase
You can specify how Sqoop handles RDBMS table column updated to NULL during incremental import.
There are two modes for this, ignore and delete. You can specify the mode using the --hbase-null-incrementel-mode option:

-ignore: This is the default value. If the source table's column is updated to NULL, the target HBase table will still show the previous value for that
column.
-delete: If the source table's column is updated to NULL, all previous versions of the column will be deleted from HBase. When checking the column in
HBase using the Java API, a null value will be displayed.

Examples:
Execute an incremental import to an HBase table and ignore the columns which were updated to NULL in the relational database:
sqoop import --connect $CONN --username $USER --password $PASS --table "hbase_test" --hbase-table hbase_test --column-family data -m 1 --incremental lastmodified --check-column date_modified --last-value "2017-12-15 10:58:44.0" --merge-key id --hbase-null-incremental-mode ignore
Execute an incremental import to an HBase table and delete all the versions of the columns which were updated to NULL in the relational database:

sqoop import --connect $CONN --username $USER --password $PASS --table "hbase_test" --hbase-table hbase_test --column-family data -m 1 --incremental lastmodified --check-column date_modified --last-value "2017-12-15 10:58:44.0" --merge-key id --hbase-null-incremental-mode delete



Using Spark

For instructions on configuring an HBase service as a Spark service dependency, see Accessing HBase from Spark.
You can write data to HBase from Apache Spark by using def saveAsHadoopDataset(conf: JobConf): Unit. This example is adapted from a post on the spark-users mailing list.
// Note: mapred package is used, instead of the
// mapreduce package which contains new hadoop APIs.

import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapred.TableOutputFormat
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client
// ... some other settings

val conf = HBaseConfiguration.create()

// general hbase settings
conf.set("hbase.rootdir",
         "hdfs://" + nameNodeURL + ":" + hdfsPort + "/hbase")
conf.setBoolean("hbase.cluster.distributed", true)
conf.set("hbase.zookeeper.quorum", hostname)
conf.setInt("hbase.client.scanner.caching", 10000)
// ... some other settings

val jobConfig: JobConf = new JobConf(conf, this.getClass)

// Note:  TableOutputFormat is used as deprecated code
// because JobConf is an old hadoop API
jobConfig.setOutputFormat(classOf[TableOutputFormat])
jobConfig.set(TableOutputFormat.OUTPUT_TABLE, outputTable)
Next, provide the mapping between how the data looks in Spark and how it should look in HBase. The following example assumes that your HBase table has two column families, col_1 and
col_2, and that your data is formatted in sets of three in Spark, like (row_key, col_1, col_2).
def convert(triple: (Int, Int, Int)) = {
      val p = new Put(Bytes.toBytes(triple._1))
      p.add(Bytes.toBytes("cf"),
            Bytes.toBytes("col_1"),
            Bytes.toBytes(triple._2))
      p.add(Bytes.toBytes("cf"),
            Bytes.toBytes("col_2"),
            Bytes.toBytes(triple._3))
      (new ImmutableBytesWritable, p)
}
To write the data from Spark to HBase, you might use:
new PairRDDFunctions(localData.map(convert)).saveAsHadoopDataset(jobConfig)



Using Spark and Kafka

For instructions on configuring an HBase service as a Spark service dependency, see Accessing HBase from Spark.
This example, written in Scala, uses Apache Spark in conjunction with the Apache Kafka message bus to stream data from Spark to HBase. The example was provided in SPARK-944. It produces some random words and then stores them in an HBase table, creating the table if necessary.

    (new ImmutableBytesWritable, record)
  }

        }
      }.toArray

      producer.send(messages : _*)
      Thread.sleep(100)
    }
  }
}



Using a Custom MapReduce Job

Many of the methods to import data into HBase use MapReduce implicitly. If none of those approaches fit your needs, you can use MapReduce directly to convert data to a series of HFiles
or API calls for import into HBase. In this way, you can import data from Avro, Parquet, or another format into HBase, or export data from HBase into another format, using API calls such as
TableOutputFormat, HFileOutputFormat, and TableInputFormat.
