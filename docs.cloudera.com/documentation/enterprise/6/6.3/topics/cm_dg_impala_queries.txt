Monitoring Impala Queries

The Impala Queries page displays information about Impala queries that are running and have run in your cluster. You can filter the queries by time period and by specifying simple filtering expressions.
Note: The Impala query monitoring feature requires Impala 1.0.1 and higher.

Continue reading:

Viewing Queries
Configuring Impala Query Monitoring
Impala Best Practices
Results Tab
Filtering Queries




Viewing Queries


Do one of the following:

Select Clusters > Cluster name > Impala service name Queries.
On the Home > Status tab, select Impala service name and click the Queries tab.

The Impala queries run during the selected time range display in the Results Tab.

You can also perform the following actions on this page:


Viewing Queries Actions


Action
Description




Filter the displayed queries
Create filter expressions manually, select preconfigured filters, or use the Workload Summary
section to build a query interactively. See Filtering Queries.


Select additional attributes for display.
Click Select Attributes. Selected attributes also display as available filters in the Workload Summary section. To display information about attributes, hover over a field label. See Filter Attributes.
Only attributes that support filtering appear in the Workload Summary section. See the Attributes table.



View a histogram of the attribute values.
Click the  icon to the right of each
attribute displayed in the Workload Summary section.


Display charts based on the filter expression and selected attributes.
Cick the Charts tab.


View charts that help identify whether Impala best practices are being followed.
Click the Best Practices link.


Export a JSON file with the query results that you can use for further analysis.
Click Export.








Configuring Impala Query Monitoring

You can configure the visibility of the Impala query results and the size of the storage allocated to Impala query results.
For information on how to configure whether admin and non-admin users can view all queries, only that user's queries, or no queries, see Configuring Query Visibility.
Query information is stored in-memory in a ring buffer. If you restart Service Monitor, all queries are lost, and older queries eventually are dropped. For information on how to
configure the query store, see Configuring Impala Query Data Store Maximum Size.



Impala Best Practices

To open the Impala Best Practices page, click the Best Practices tab on the Impala service page. The page contains charts that include description of
each best practice and how to determine if it is being followed. See the Impala documentation for more detail on each best practice and for additional best practices.
Adjust the time range to see data on queries run at different times. Click the charts to get more detail on individual queries. Use the filter box at the top right of the Best Practices
page to adjust which data is shown on the page. For example, to see just the queries that took more than ten seconds, make the filter query_duration > 10s.
Create a trigger based on any best practice by choosing Create Trigger from the individual chart drop-down menu.



Results Tab

Queries appear on the Results tab, with the most recent at the top. Each query has summary and detail information. A query summary includes the
following default attributes: start and end timestamps, statement, duration, rows produced, user,
coordinator, database, and query type. For example:


You can add additional attributes to the summary by clicking the Attribute Selector. In each query summary, the
query statement is truncated if it is too long to display. To display the entire statement, click . The
query entry expands to display the entire query string. To collapse the query display, click . To display
information about query attributes and possible values, hover over a field in a query. For example:



A running job displays a progress bar under the starting timestamp:


If an error occurred while processing the query, displays under the complete timestamp.

Use the Actions drop-down menu  to the right of each query listing to do the following. (Not
all options display, depending on the type of job.)

Query Details – Opens a details page for the job. See query details.
User's Impala Queries – Displays a list of queries run by the user for the current job.
Cancel (running queries only) – Cancel a running query (administrators only). Canceling a running query creates an audit event. When you cancel a query,  replaces the progress bar.
Queries in the same YARN pool – Displays queries that use the same resource pool.





Filtering Queries

You filter queries by selecting a time range and specifying a filter expression in the search box.
You can use the Time Range Selector or a duration link (  ) to set the time range.
(See Time Line for details).

Filter Expressions
Filter expressions specify which entries should display when you run the filter. The simplest expression consists of three components:

Attribute - Query language name of the attribute.
Operator - Type of comparison between the attribute and the attribute value. Cloudera Manager supports the standard comparator operators =, !=, >, <, >=, <=, and RLIKE. (RLIKE performs regular expression matching as specified in the Java Pattern class documentation.) Numeric values can be compared with all operators. String values can be
compared with =, !=, and RLIKE. Boolean values can be compared with = and
!=.
Value - The value of the attribute. The value depends on the type of the attribute. For a Boolean value, specify either true or false. When specifying a string value, enclose the value in double quotes.


You create compound filter expressions using the AND and OR operators. When more than one operator is used in an expression, AND is evaluated first, then OR. To change the order of
evaluation, enclose subexpressions in parentheses.


Compound Expressions
To find all the queries issued by the root user that produced over 100 rows, use the expression:
user = "root" AND rowsProduced > 100
To find all the executing queries issued by users Jack or Jill, use the expression:
executing = true AND (user = "Jack" OR user = "Jill")


Choosing and Running a Filter

Do one of the following:

Select a Suggested or Recently Run Filter
Click the  to the right of the Search button to
display a list of sample and recently run filters, and select a filter. The filter text displays in the text box.

Construct a Filter from the Workload Summary Attributes
Optionally, click Select Attributes to display a dialog box where you can chose which attributes to display in the Workload
Summary section. Select the checkbox next to one or more attributes, and click Close.
The attributes display in the Workload Summary section along with values or ranges of values that you can filter on. The values and ranges display as
links with checkboxes. Select one or more checkboxes to add the range or value to the query. Click a link to run a query on that value or range. For example:



Type a Filter

Start typing or press Spacebar in the text box. As you type, filter attributes matching the typed letter display. If you press Spacebar, standard filter attributes display. These suggestions are part of typeahead, which helps build valid queries. For information about the attribute name and supported
values for each field, hover over the field in an existing query.
Select an attribute and press Enter.
Press Spacebar to display a drop-down list of operators.
Select an operator and press Enter.
Specify an attribute value in one of the following ways:

For attribute values that support typeahead, press Spacebar to display a drop-down list of values and press Enter.
Type a value.






Click in the text box and press Enter or click Search. The list displays the results that match the specified
filter. The Workload Summary section refreshes to show only the values for the selected filter. The filter is added to the Recently Run list.



Filter Attributes
The following table includes available filter attributes and their names in Cloudera Manager, types, and descriptions.
Note: Only attributes for which the Supports Filtering?
column value is TRUE appear in the Workload Summary section.
