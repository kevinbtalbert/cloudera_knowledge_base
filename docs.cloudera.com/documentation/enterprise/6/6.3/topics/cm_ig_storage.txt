Data Storage for Monitoring Data

The Service Monitor and Host Monitor roles in the Cloudera Management Service store time series data, health data, and Impala query and YARN application metadata.

Configuring Host Monitor Data Storage
Viewing Host and Service Monitor Data Storage
Data Granularity and Time-Series Metric Data
Moving Monitoring Data on an Active Cluster
Host Monitor and Service Monitor Memory Configuration
Disabling Metric rollup




Configuring Service Monitor Data Storage

The Service Monitor stores time series data and health data, Impala query metadata, and YARN application metadata. By default, the data is stored in /var/lib/cloudera-service-monitor/ on the Service Monitor host. You can change this by modifying the Service Monitor Storage Directory
configuration (firehose.storage.base.directory). To change this configuration on an active system, see Moving Monitoring Data on an Active Cluster.
You can control how much disk space to reserve for the different classes of data the Service Monitor stores by changing the following configuration options:

Time-series metrics and health data - Time-Series Storage (firehose_time_series_storage_bytes - 10 GB default, 10 GB minimum)
Impala query metadata - Impala Storage (firehose_impala_storage_bytes - 1 GB default)
YARN application metadata - YARN Storage (firehose_yarn_storage_bytes - 1 GB default)


For information about how metric data is stored in Cloudera Manager and how storage limits impact data retention, see Data
Granularity and Time-Series Metric Data.
The default values are small, so you should examine disk usage after several days of activity to determine how much space is needed.



Configuring Host Monitor Data Storage

The Host Monitor stores time series data and health data. By default, the data is stored in /var/lib/cloudera-host-monitor/ on the Host Monitor host. You
can change this by modifying the Host Monitor Storage Directory configuration. To change this configuration on an active system, follow the procedure in Moving Monitoring Data on an Active Cluster.
You can control how much disk space to reserve for Host Monitor data by changing the following configuration option:

Time-series metrics and health data: Time Series Storage (firehose_time_series_storage_bytes - 10 GB default, 10 GB minimum)


For information about how metric data is stored in Cloudera Manager and how storage limits impact data retention, see Data
Granularity and Time-Series Metric Data.
The default value is small, so you should examine disk usage after several days of activity to determine how much space they need. The Charts Library
tab on the Cloudera Management Service page shows the current disk space consumed and its rate of growth, categorized by the type of data stored. For example, you can compare the space consumed by
raw metric data to daily summaries of that data.



Viewing Host and Service Monitor Data Storage

The Cloudera Management Service page shows the current disk space consumed and its rate of growth, categorized by the type of data stored. For example, you can compare the space
consumed by raw metric data to daily summaries of that data:

Select Clusters > Cloudera Management
Service.
Click the Charts Library tab.





Data Granularity and Time-Series Metric Data

The Service Monitor and Host Monitor store time-series metric data in a variety of ways. When the data is received, it is written as-is to the metric store. Over time, the raw data is
summarized to and stored at various data granularities. For example, after ten minutes, a summary point is written containing the average of the metric over the period as well as the minimum, the
maximum, the standard deviation, and a variety of other statistics. This process is summarized to produce hourly, six-hourly, daily, and weekly summaries. This data summarization procedure applies
only to metric data. When the Impala query and YARN application monitoring storage limit is reached, the oldest stored records are deleted.
The Service Monitor and Host Monitor internally manage the amount of overall storage space dedicated to each data granularity level. When the limit for a level is reached, the oldest
data points at that level are deleted. Metric data for that time period remains available at the lower granularity levels. For example, when an hourly point for a particular time is deleted to free
up space, a daily point still exists covering that hour. Because each of these data granularities consumes significantly less storage than the previous summary level, lower granularity levels can be
retained for longer periods of time. With the recommended amount of storage, weekly points can often be retained indefinitely.
Some features, such as detailed display of health results, depend on the presence of raw data. Health history is maintained by the event store dictated by its retention policies.



Moving Monitoring Data on an Active Cluster

You can change where monitoring data is stored on a cluster.

Basic: Changing the Configured Directory

Stop the Service Monitor or Host Monitor.
Save your old monitoring data and then copy the current directory to the new directory (optional).
Update the Storage Directory configuration option (firehose.storage.base.directory) on the corresponding role configuration
page.
Start the Service Monitor or Host Monitor.



Advanced: High Performance
For the best performance, and especially for a large cluster, Host Monitor and Service Monitor storage directories should have their own dedicated spindles. In most cases, that provides
sufficient performance, but you can divide your data further if needed. You cannot configure this directly with Cloudera Manager; instead, you must use symbolic links.
For example, if all your Service Monitor data is located in /data/1/service_monitor, and you want to separate your Impala data from your time series data,
you could do the following:

Stop the Service Monitor.
Move the original Impala data in /data/1/service_monitor/impala to the new directory, for example /data/2/impala_data.
Create a symbolic link from /data/1/service_monitor/impala to /data/2/impala_data with the following command:
ln -s /data/2/impala_data /data/1/service_monitor/impala
Start the Service Monitor.





Host Monitor and Service Monitor Memory Configuration

You can configure Java heap size and non-Java memory size. The memory recommended for these configuration options depends on the number of hosts in the cluster, the services running on
the cluster, and the number of monitored entities. Monitored entities are the objects monitored by the Service Monitor or Host Monitor. As the number of hosts and services increases, the number of
monitored entities also increases.
In addition to the memory configured, the Host Monitor and Service Monitor use the Linux page cache. Memory available for page caching on the Host Monitor and Service Monitor hosts
improves performance.
To configure memory allocations, determine how many entities are being monitored and then consult the tables below for required and recommended memory configurations.
To determine the number of entities being monitored:

Go to Clusters > Cloudera Management Service.
Locate the chart with the title Cloudera Management Service Monitored Entities.
The number of monitored entities for the Host Monitor and Service Monitor displays at the bottom of the chart. In the following example, the Host Monitor has 46 monitored entities and
the Service Monitor has 230 monitored entities.



Use the number of monitored entities for the Host Monitor to determine its memory requirements and recommendations in the tables below.
Use the number of monitored entities for the Service Monitor to determine its memory requirements and recommendations in the tables below.



Clusters with HDFS, YARN, or Impala
Use the recommendations in this table for clusters where the only services having worker roles are HDFS, YARN, or Impala.

Disabling Metric rollup

In large clusters, rollup of time-series data (metrics) sometimes cannot complete due to the large volume of data, which can degrade the performance of the Service Monitor. To improve
performance, you can disable this rollup. This change will also affect the following:

Calculations of time-based rollups are stopped. (This is for values such as TEN_MINUTELY, HOURLY, SIX_HOURLY, DAILY, or WEEKLY.)
Forces all time-series queries to use RAW data granularity, in order that time-series queries that would require rollup of data (for example, charts using 12h and above intervals)
continue working using RAW data.
Reallocates time-series storage to use RAW data only. The storage allocation of time-series tables is calculated as follows: the configured allocation * a fraction allocated to each
table. Fraction values are: 35% for RAW data and 50% for aggregated data for a total of 85%. (the remaining 15% is used for subject store, which is not relevant in this case). Reallocation gives all
85% to RAW data so that longer periods can be stored from RAW data and storage is not wasted on unused rollups.
Elastic partitioning is enabled.


To disable Metric Allocation:

Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
Go to Clusters > Cloudera Management Service.
Click the Configuration tab.
Search for "Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for cmon.conf"
Enter the following configuration:

Name: firehose.timeseries.rollup.disabled
Value: true


You can also choose to configure elastic partitioning of time-series tables. When you disable metric rollup, elastic partitioning is enabled by default. Elasticity allows Cloudera
Manager to gradually expire unused rollup data rather than immediately deleting it. If you disable elastic partitioning, aggregated historical data will expire immediately. Cloudera recommends that
you enable elastic partitioning.
To disable elastic partitioning, click the + icon and add another configuration:

Name: firehose.timeseries.partitionpolicy.elastic.enabled
Value: false
