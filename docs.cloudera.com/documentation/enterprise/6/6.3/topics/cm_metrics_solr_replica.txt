Solr Replica Metrics

Important: Although it is technically possible to give user-defined Solr core names during core
creation, it is to be avoided in the context of Cloudera Search. Cloudera Manager expects core names in the default "collection_shardX_replicaY" format. Altering core names results in Cloudera
Manager being unable to fetch Solr metrics for the given core and this, eventually, may corrupt data collection for co-located core, or even shard and server level charts.
