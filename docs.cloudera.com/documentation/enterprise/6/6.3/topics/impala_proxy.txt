Using Impala through a Proxy for High Availability

For most clusters that have multiple users and production availability requirements, you might want to set up a load-balancing proxy server to relay requests to and from Impala.
Set up a software package of your choice to perform these functions.
Note:
Most considerations for load balancing and high availability apply to the impalad daemon. The statestored and catalogd daemons do not have special requirements for high availability, because problems with those daemons do not
result in data loss. If those daemons become unavailable due to an outage on a particular host, you can stop the Impala service, delete the Impala StateStore and
Impala Catalog Server roles, add the roles on a different host, and restart the Impala service.

Overview of Proxy Usage and Load Balancing for Impala

Using a load-balancing proxy server for Impala offers the following advantages:

Applications connect to a single well-known host and port, rather than keeping track of the hosts where the impalad daemons are running.
If any host running an impalad becomes unavailable, application connection requests still succeed because you always connect to the proxy server
rather than a specific host running the impalad daemon.
The coordinator node for each Impala query potentially requires more memory and CPU cycles than the other nodes that process the query. The proxy server can schedule queries so that
each connection uses a different coordinator node. This load-balancing technique lets the impalad nodes share this additional work, rather than directing it on a
single machine.

The following are the general setup steps that apply to any load-balancing proxy software:

Select and download a load-balancing proxy software or other load-balancing hardware appliance. It should only need to be installed and configured on a single host, typically on an
edge node.
Configure the load balancer (typically by editing a configuration file). In particular:

To relay Impala requests back and forth, set up a port that the load balancer will listen on.
Select a load balancing algorithm. See Choosing the Load-Balancing Algorithm for load balancing algorithm options.

For Kerberized clusters, follow the instructions in Special Proxy Considerations for Clusters Using Kerberos.



If you are using Hue or JDBC-based applications, you typically set up load balancing for both ports 21000 and 21050, because these client applications connect through port 21050 while
the impala-shell command connects through port 21000. See Ports Used by Impala for when to use port 21000,
21050, or another value depending on what type of connections you are load balancing.
Run the load-balancing proxy server, pointing it at the configuration file that you set up.
On systems managed by Cloudera Manager:

Navigate to Impala > Configuration > Impala Daemon
Default Group.
In the Impala Daemons Load Balancer field, specify the address of the load balancer in the host:port format.
This setting lets Cloudera Manager route all appropriate Impala-related operations through the load-balancing proxy server.



For any scripts, jobs, or configuration settings for applications that formerly connected to a specific impalad to run Impala SQL statements,
change the connection information (such as the -i option in impala-shell) to point to the load balancer instead.

Note: The following sections use the HAProxy software as a representative example of a load balancer that you can use with Impala. For information
specifically about using Impala with the F5 BIG-IP load balancer, see Impala HA with F5 BIG-IP.



Choosing the Load-Balancing Algorithm

Load-balancing software offers a number of algorithms to distribute requests. Each algorithm has its own characteristics that make it suitable in some situations but not others.

Leastconn

Connects sessions to the coordinator with the fewest connections, to balance the load evenly. Typically used for workloads consisting of many independent, short-running queries. In
configurations with only a few client machines, this setting can avoid having all requests go to only a small set of coordinators.

Recommended for Impala with F5.
Source IP Persistence
Sessions from the same IP address always go to the same coordinator. A good choice for Impala workloads containing a mix of queries and DDL statements, such as CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE. Because the metadata changes from a DDL statement take time to propagate across the cluster, prefer to use the Source
IP Persistence algorithm in this case. If you are unable to choose Source IP Persistence, run the DDL and subsequent queries that depend on the results of the DDL through the same session, for
example by running impala-shell -f script_file to submit several statements through a single session.
Required for setting up high availability with Hue. See Configure Hive and Impala for High Availability for
configuring high availability with Hue.
Round-robin
Distributes connections to all coordinator nodes. Typically not recommended for Impala.

You might need to perform benchmarks and load testing to determine which setting is optimal for your use case. Always set up using two load-balancing algorithms: Source IP Persistence
for Hue and Leastconn for others.



Special Proxy Considerations for Clusters Using Kerberos

In a cluster using Kerberos, applications check host credentials to verify that the host they are connecting to is the same one that is actually processing the request.
In Impala 2.11 and lower versions, once you enable a proxy server in a Kerberized cluster, users will not be able to connect to
individual impala daemons directly from impala-shell.
In Impala 2.12 and higher, when you enable a proxy server in a Kerberized cluster, users have an option to connect to Impala
daemons directly from impala-shell using the -b / --kerberos_host_fqdn impala-shell flag. This option can be used for testing or troubleshooting purposes, but not recommended for live production environments as it defeats the purpose of a load
balancer/proxy.
Example:

impala-shell -i impalad-1.mydomain.com -k -b loadbalancer-1.mydomain.com

Alternatively, with the fully qualified configurations:
impala-shell --impalad=impalad-1.mydomain.com:21000 --kerberos --kerberos_host_fqdn=loadbalancer-1.mydomain.com
See impala-shell Configuration Options for information about the option.
To validate the load-balancing proxy server, perform these extra Kerberos setup steps:

This section assumes you are starting with a Kerberos-enabled cluster. See Enabling Kerberos Authentication for
Impala for instructions for setting up Impala with Kerberos. See Enabling Kerberos Authentication for
CDH for general steps to set up Kerberos.
Choose the host you will use for the proxy server. Based on the Kerberos setup procedure, it should already have an entry impala/proxy_host@realm in its keytab.
In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Impala > Configuration > Impala Daemon Default Group.
In the Impala Daemons Load Balancer field, specify the address of the load balancer in the host:port format.
When this field is specified and Kerberos is enabled, Cloudera Manager adds a principal for impala/proxy_host@realm to the keytab for all Impala daemons.

Restart the Impala service.


Client Connection to Proxy Server in Kerberized Clusters
When a client connect to Impala, the service principal specified by the client must match the -principal setting, impala/proxy_host@realm, of the Impala proxy server as specified in its keytab. And the client should connect to the proxy server port.
In hue.ini, set the following to configure Hue to automatically connect to the proxy server:
[impala]
server_host=proxy_host
impala_principal=impala/proxy_host
The following are the JDBC connection string formats when connecting through the load balancer with the load balancer's host name in the principal:
jdbc:hive2://proxy_host:load_balancer_port/;principal=impala/_HOST@realm
jdbc:hive2://proxy_host:load_balancer_port/;principal=impala/proxy_host@realm
When starting impala-shell, specify the service principal via the -b or --kerberos_host_fqdn flag.




Special Proxy Considerations for TLS/SSL Enabled Clusters

When TLS/SSL is enabled for Impala, the client application, whether impala-shell, Hue, or something else, expects the certificate common name (CN) to match the hostname that it is
connected to. With no load balancing proxy server, the hostname and certificate CN are both that of the impalad instance. However, with a proxy server, the certificate
presented by the impalad instance does not match the load balancing proxy server hostname. If you try to load-balance a TLS/SSL-enabled Impala installation without
additional configuration, you see a certificate mismatch error when a client attempts to connect to the load balancing proxy host.
You can configure a proxy server in several ways to load balance TLS/SSL enabled Impala:

TLS/SSL Bridging
In this configuration, the proxy server presents a TLS/SSL certificate to the client, decrypts the client request, then re-encrypts the request before sending it to the backend
impalad. The client and server certificates can be managed separately. The request or resulting payload is encrypted in transit at all times.
TLS/SSL Passthrough
In this configuration, traffic passes through to the backend impalad instance with no interaction from the load balancing proxy server. Traffic is still
encrypted end-to-end.
The same server certificate, utilizing either wildcard or Subject Alternate Name (SAN), must be installed on each impalad instance.
TLS/SSL Offload
In this configuration, all traffic is decrypted on the load balancing proxy server, and traffic between the backend impalad instances is unencrypted.
This configuration presumes that cluster hosts reside on a trusted network and only external client-facing communication need to be encrypted in-transit.

If you plan to use Auto-TLS, your load balancer must perform TLS/SSL bridging or TLS/SSL offload.
Refer to your load balancer documentation for the steps to set up Impala and the load balancer using one of the options above.
For information specifically about using Impala with the F5 BIG-IP load balancer with TLS/SSL enabled, see Impala HA with F5 BIG-IP.



Example of Configuring HAProxy Load Balancer for Impala

If you are not already using a load-balancing proxy, you can experiment with HAProxy a free, open
source load balancer.

Attention: HAProxy is not a CDH component, and Cloudera does not provide the support for HAProxy. Refer to HAProxy for questions and support issues for HAProxy.

This example shows how you might install and configure that load balancer on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.


Install the load balancer:
yum install haproxy 

Set up the configuration file: /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg. See the following section for a sample configuration file.


Run the load balancer (on a single host, preferably one not running impalad):
/usr/sbin/haproxy –f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg

In impala-shell, JDBC applications, or ODBC applications, connect to the listener port of the proxy host, rather than port 21000 or 21050 on a host
actually running impalad. The sample configuration file sets haproxy to listen on port 25003, therefore you would send all requests to haproxy_host:25003.


This is the sample haproxy.cfg used in this example:
global
    # To have these messages end up in /var/log/haproxy.log you will
    # need to:
    #
    # 1) configure syslog to accept network log events.  This is done
    #    by adding the '-r' option to the SYSLOGD_OPTIONS in
    #    /etc/sysconfig/syslog
    #
    # 2) configure local2 events to go to the /var/log/haproxy.log
    #   file. A line like the following can be added to
    #   /etc/sysconfig/syslog
    #
    #    local2.*                       /var/log/haproxy.log
    #
    log         127.0.0.1 local0
    log         127.0.0.1 local1 notice
    chroot      /var/lib/haproxy
    pidfile     /var/run/haproxy.pid
    maxconn     4000
    user        haproxy
    group       haproxy
    daemon

    # turn on stats unix socket
    #stats socket /var/lib/haproxy/stats

#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# common defaults that all the 'listen' and 'backend' sections will
# use if not designated in their block
#
# You might need to adjust timing values to prevent timeouts.

# This is the setup for Impala. Impala client connect to load_balancer_host:25003.
# HAProxy will balance connections among the list of servers listed below.
# The list of Impalad is listening at port 21000 for beeswax (impala-shell) or original ODBC driver.
# For JDBC or ODBC version 2.x driver, use port 21050 instead of 21000.
listen impala :25003
    mode tcp
    option tcplog
    balance leastconn

    server symbolic_name_1 impala-host-1.example.com:21000 check
    server symbolic_name_2 impala-host-2.example.com:21000 check
    server symbolic_name_3 impala-host-3.example.com:21000 check
    server symbolic_name_4 impala-host-4.example.com:21000 check

# Setup for Hue or other JDBC-enabled applications.
# In particular, Hue requires sticky sessions.
# The application connects to load_balancer_host:21051, and HAProxy balances
# connections to the associated hosts, where Impala listens for JDBC
# requests on port 21050.
listen impalajdbc :21051
    mode tcp
    option tcplog
    balance source
    server symbolic_name_5 impala-host-1.example.com:21050 check
    server symbolic_name_6 impala-host-2.example.com:21050 check
    server symbolic_name_7 impala-host-3.example.com:21050 check
    server symbolic_name_8 impala-host-4.example.com:21050 check

Important: Hue requires the check option at the end of each line in the above file to ensure HAProxy can detect
any unreachable impalad server, and failover can be successful. Without the TCP check, you can hit an error when the impalad daemon
to which Hue tries to connect is down.
Note: If your JDBC or ODBC application connects to Impala through a load balancer such as haproxy, be cautious about
reusing the connections. If the load balancer has set up connection timeout values, either check the connection frequently so that it never sits idle longer than the load balancer timeout value, or
check the connection validity before using it and create a new one if the connection has been closed.
