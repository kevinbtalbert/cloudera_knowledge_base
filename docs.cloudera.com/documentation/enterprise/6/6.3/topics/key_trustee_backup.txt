Backing Up and Restoring Key Trustee Server and Clients

Key Trustee Server high availability applies to read operations only. If either Key Trustee Server fails, the client automatically retries fetching keys from the functioning server. New
write operations (for example, creating new encryption keys) are not allowed unless both Key Trustee Servers are operational.
If a Key Trustee Server fails catastrophically, you must restore it from backup to a new host with the same hostname and IP address as the failed host. Cloudera does not support
PostgreSQL promotion to convert a passive Key Trustee Server to an active Key Trustee Server.
Cloudera strongly recommends regularly backing up Key Trustee Server databases and configuration files. Because these backups contain encryption keys and encrypted deposits, you must
ensure that your backup repository is as secure as the Key Trustee Server.
You must also back up client configuration files and keys for Key Trustee Server clients, such as Key Trustee KMS and Navigator Encrypt clients.
Note: In an HA configuration, the backup need only be performed on one of the hosts for Key Trustee Server and the Key Trustee KMS. For Key Trustee
Server, run the backup on the active server. For Key Trustee KMS, you can run the backup on any instance.

Backing Up Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMS Using Cloudera Manager

Cloudera Manager versions 5.8 and higher, when used with Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMS versions 5.7 and higher, allow for backups of the KT Server and KT KMS configurations.
The actions executed in this procedure are equivalent to running the ktbackup.sh script on the node in question (see Backing Up Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMS Using the ktbackup.sh Script for additional details.
In addition, when using the HDFS Encryption Wizard in Cloudera Manager 5.8 or higher to install and configure Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMS versions 5.7 and higher, a
cron job is automatically set up to back up the Key Trustee Server on an ongoing basis. See Initializing Standalone Key Trustee Server for more detail.
To back up the KT Server or KT KMS service configuration using Cloudera Manager:


Select the KT Server or KMS service configuration that you wish to back up.
For a KT Server backup, select Create Backup on Active Server (or Create Backup on Passive Server) from the Actions menu.
For a KMS backup, select Create Backup.


A successfully completed backup of the KT Server is indicated by the message “Command Create Backup on Active Server finished successfully on service keytrustee_server”.



Backing Up Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMS Using the ktbackup.sh Script

Key Trustee Server releases 5.7 and higher include a script, ktbackup.sh, to simplify and automate backing up Key Trustee Server. Key Trustee KMS releases
5.7 and higher include the same script for backing up Key Trustee KMS.
When run on a Key Trustee Server host, the script creates a tarball containing the Key Trustee Server private GPG keys and the PostgreSQL database. When run on a Key Trustee KMS host,
the script creates a tarball containing the Key Trustee KMS private GPG keys and configuration file.
To preserve the security of the backup, you must specify a GPG recipient. Because this recipient is the only entity that can decrypt the backup, the recipient must be someone authorized
to access the Key Trustee Server database, such as a key administrator.

Creating and Importing a GPG Key for Encrypting and Decrypting Backups
If the key administrator responsible for backing up and restoring Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMS does not already have a GPG key pair, they can create one using the gpg --gen-key command. The following example demonstrates this procedure:
Note: By default, gpg --gen-key fails at the password prompt if you have logged in to your user account with the
su command. You must log in to the SSH session with the user account for which you want to generate the GPG key pair.
[john.doe@backup-host ~]$ gpg --gen-key

After the GPG key pair is generated, you can export the public key:
[john.doe@backup-host ~]$ gpg --armor --output /path/to/johndoe.pub --export 'John Doe'
Copy the public key (johndoe.pub in this example) to the Key Trustee Server or Key Trustee KMS host, and import it into the service account keyring
(keytrustee for Key Trustee Server and kms for Key Trustee KMS):

On the Key Trustee Server host:
sudo -u keytrustee gpg --import /path/to/johndoe.pub
On the Key Trustee KMS host:
sudo -u kms gpg --import /path/to/johndoe.pub



Running the ktbackup.sh Script
You must run ktbackup.sh as the service account. The location of the script depends on the service and installation method. See the following table for the
script location and default service account for package- and parcel-based installations for Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMS.


Backup Script Locations


Service
Service Account
Parcel-Based Installation
Package-Based Installation




Key Trustee Server
keytrustee
/opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE_SERVER/bin/ktbackup.sh
/usr/bin/ktbackup.sh


Key Trustee KMS
kms
/opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE/bin/ktbackup.sh
/usr/share/keytrustee-keyprovider/bin/ktbackup.sh




The following table lists the command options for ktbackup.sh.


Command Options for ktbackup.sh


Command Option
Description




-c, --confdir=CONFDIR
Specifies the Key Trustee configuration directory. Defaults to /var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee for
parcel-based Key Trustee Server. For Key Trustee KMS and package-based Key Trustee Server, you must specify this option.


--database-port=PORT
Specifies the Key Trustee Server database port. Defaults to 11381 for parcel-based installations. For
package-based Key Trustee Server installations, you must specify this option.


--gpg-recipient=GPG_RECIPIENT
Specifies the GPG recipient. The backup is encrypted with the public key of the specified recipient. The GPG recipient public key
must be imported into the service account keyring before running the script. See Creating and Importing a GPG Key
for Encrypting and Decrypting Backups for more information.


--cleartext
Outputs an unencrypted tarball. To preserve the security of the cryptographic keys, do not use this option in
production environments.


--output=DIR
Specifies the output directory for the tarball. Defaults to /var/lib/keytrustee for parcel-based Key
Trustee Server. For Key Trustee KMS and package-based Key Trustee Server, you must specify this option.


--roll=n
Deletes backups older than the last n backups from the directory specified by the --output parameter. For example, if you have 10 backups, specifying --roll=10 creates a new backup (11 backups total) and then delete the oldest
backup. Specifying --roll=1 creates a new backup and then deletes all other backups.
Note: This option works for Key Trustee Server only.



-q, --quiet
Suppresses console log messages and, if successful, returns only the backup tarball file path. This is useful for automating
backups.


--verbose
Outputs additional log messages to the console for debugging.




Important: Running the ktbackup.sh script on the KMS server creates a backed up copy of the GPG private keys
currently being used by the KMS. If this backup is not performed, and the GPG private keys are not saved, then the system cannot be fully restored in the event of a catastrophic failure, and
access to both keys and data may be lost. It is therefore imperative that you perform a manual backup after the KMS starts successfully for the first time, and on all KMS
instances whenever a new Key Trustee High Availability instance is added. Running this backup ensures that the most recent backup contains a copy of the GPG private keys currently in use.
The following examples demonstrate the command usage for different scenarios:

To back up a parcel-based Key Trustee Server, specifying the GPG recipient by name:
$ sudo -u keytrustee /opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE_SERVER/bin/ktbackup.sh --gpg-recipient='John Doe'
To back up a parcel-based Key Trustee KMS, specifying the GPG recipient by email:
$ sudo -u kms /opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE/bin/ktbackup.sh -c /var/lib/kms-keytrustee/keytrustee/.keytrustee --output=/var/lib/kms-keytrustee --gpg-recipient=john.doe@example.com
To back up a package-based Key Trustee Server with the database running on a non-default port (12345 in this example):
$ sudo -u keytrustee ktbackup.sh --database-port=12345 --gpg-recipient=john.doe@example.com
To back up a package-based Key Trustee KMS, specifying the GPG recipient by email:
$ sudo -u kms /usr/share/keytrustee-keyprovider/bin/ktbackup.sh -c /var/lib/kms-keytrustee/keytrustee/.keytrustee --output=/var/lib/kms-keytrustee --gpg-recipient=john.doe@example.com



Automating Backups Using cron
You can schedule automatic backups of Key Trustee Server using the cron scheduling utility.
Create a crontab entry using the following commands:

Edit the crontab by running the following command:
sudo -u keytrustee crontab -e
Add the following entry to run the backup script every 30 minutes. This example is for a parcel-based installation of Key Trustee Server. See the Backup Script Locations table for the package-based script location.
*/30 * * * * /opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE_SERVER/bin/ktbackup.sh --gpg-recipient='John Doe' --quiet --output=/tmp/backups --roll=10
Run man 5 crontab to see the crontab man page for details on using cron to schedule backups
at different intervals.







Backing Up Key Trustee Server Manually

Use this procedure for both parcel-based and package-based installations.
If you have deployed Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server High Availability, perform these steps on
both the active and passive Key Trustee Servers. The following procedure references the default database port and location; if you modified these settings during installation, replace the database
and port with your values.

Back up the Key Trustee Server database:

For Key Trustee Server 3.8:
su - postgres
pg_dump -c -p 5432 keytrustee | zip --encrypt keytrustee-db.zip -
For Key Trustee Server 5.4 and higher:
su - keytrustee
pg_dump -c -p 11381 keytrustee | zip --encrypt keytrustee-db.zip -

The --encrypt option prompts you to create a password used to encrypt the zip file. This password is required to decrypt the file.
For parcel-based installations, you must set environment variables after switching to the keytrustee user:
su - keytrustee
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE_SERVER/PG_DB/opt/postgres/9.3/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE_SERVER/PG_DB/opt/postgres/9.3/lib
pg_dump -c -p 11381 keytrustee | zip --encrypt keytrustee-db.zip -

Back up the Key Trustee Server configuration directory (/var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee):
zip -r --encrypt keytrustee-conf.zip /var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee
The --encrypt option prompts you to create a password used to encrypt the zip file. This password is required to decrypt the file.

Move the backup files (keytrustee-db.zip and keytrustee-conf.zip) to a secure location.





Backing Up Key Trustee Server Clients

Cryptographic keys stored in Key Trustee Server are encrypted by clients before they are sent to Key Trustee Server. The primary clients for Key Trustee Server are Key Trustee KMS and
Navigator Encrypt. Cloudera strongly recommends backing up regularly the configuration files and GPG keys for Key Trustee Server clients. See Backing Up Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMS Using the ktbackup.sh Script for instructions on backing up Key Trustee KMS using the provided
backup script.
Warning: Failure to back up these files can result in irretrievable data loss. For example, encryption zone keys used for HDFS Transparent Encryption are encrypted by the KMS before being stored in Key Trustee Server. A catastrophic failure
of the KMS with no backup causes all HDFS data stored in encryption zones to become permanently irretrievable.
To prevent permanent data loss, regularly back up the following directories on each client that stores objects in Key Trustee Server:


Key Trustee Server Client Configuration Directories


Key Trustee Server Client
Directories to Back Up




Key Trustee KMS
/var/lib/kms-keytrustee


Navigator Encrypt
/etc/navencrypt








Restoring Key Trustee Server

When restoring the Key Trustee Server database from backup, keep in mind that any keys or deposits created after the backup are not restored. If you are using Key Trustee Server high
availability, you can restore the Active Key Trustee Server from the Passive Key Trustee Server. This restores all keys that were successfully written to the Passive Key Trustee Server before the
failure.
The procedure to restore Key Trustee Server is different for parcel-based than for package-based installations. For more information about parcels, see Parcels.


Restoring Key Trustee Server in Parcel-Based Installations

Note: These instructions apply to Key Trustee Servers deployed using parcels. For package-based deployments, skip to the Restoring Key Trustee Server in Package-Based Installations section.
If you have deployed Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server High Availability, perform these steps on both
the active and passive Key Trustee Servers. The following procedures assume the default database port and location; if you modified these settings during installation, replace the database and port
with your custom values.
If the Key Trustee Server host has failed completely, remove the host from the cluster and add a new host using Cloudera Manager:

Remove the failed host from the cluster. See Deleting Hosts for instructions.
Add a new host with the same hostname and IP address as the failed host to the cluster. See Adding a Host to the
Cluster for instructions.
Important: Make sure that the replacement host uses the same operating system version as the failed host.

Install Key Trustee Server on the new host. See Installing Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee
Server for instructions. Make sure to install the same Key Trustee Server version as the failed host.


After you have provisioned a new host and installed Key Trustee Server (or if you are restoring the database or configuration on the original host), restore the database and
configuration directory. If your backups were created using the ktbackup.sh script, skip to
Restoring Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMS from ktbackup.sh Backups. If you need to restore the Active Key Trustee Server
from the Passive Key Trustee Server, skip to Restoring Active Key Trustee Server from Passive Key Trustee Server.
If your backups were created manually using the pg_dump command, do the following:

Copy or move the backup files (keytrustee-db.zip and keytrustee-conf.zip) to the Key Trustee Server host.
Start the PostgreSQL server:
sudo ktadmin db --start --pg-rootdir /var/lib/keytrustee/db --background
Restore the Key Trustee Server database:
su - keytrustee
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE_SERVER/PG_DB/opt/postgres/9.3/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cloudera/parcels/KEYTRUSTEE_SERVER/PG_DB/opt/postgres/9.3/lib
unzip -p /path/to/keytrustee-db.zip | psql -p 11381 -d keytrustee
If the zip file is encrypted, you are prompted for the password to decrypt the file.

Restore the Key Trustee Server configuration directory:
su - keytrustee
cd /var/lib/keytrustee
unzip /path/to/keytrustee-conf.zip
If the zip file is encrypted, you are prompted for the password to decrypt the file.

Stop the PostgreSQL server:
sudo ktadmin db --stop --pg-rootdir /var/lib/keytrustee/db
Start the Key Trustee Server service in Cloudera Manager (Key Trustee Server service > Actions > Start).
Restart the Key Trustee KMS service in Cloudera Manager (Key Trustee KMS service > Actions > Restart).
Remove the backup files (keytrustee-db.zip and keytrustee-conf.zip) from the Key Trustee Server host.





Restoring Key Trustee Server in Package-Based Installations

If you have deployed Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server High Availability, perform these steps on both
the active and passive Key Trustee Servers. The following procedures assume the default database port and location; if you modified these settings during installation, replace the database and port
with your custom values.
If the Key Trustee Server host has failed completely, provision a new host with the same hostname and IP address as the failed host, and re-install Key Trustee Server. See Installing Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server for instructions.
Important: Make sure to install the same operating system and Key Trustee Server versions as the failed host.

After you have provisioned a new host and installed Key Trustee Server (or if you are restoring the database or configuration on the original host), restore the database and
configuration directory. If your backups were created using the ktbackup.sh script, skip to
Restoring Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMS from ktbackup.sh Backups. If you need to restore the Active Key Trustee Server
from the Passive Key Trustee Server, skip to Restoring Active Key Trustee Server from Passive Key Trustee Server.
If your backups were created manually using the pg_dump command, do the following:

Copy or move the backup files (keytrustee-db.zip and keytrustee-conf.zip) to the Key Trustee Server host.
Change the file ownership on the backup files to keytrustee:keytrustee:
sudo chown keytrustee:keytrustee /path/to/keytrustee*.zip
Restore the Key Trustee Server database:
su - keytrustee
unzip -p /path/to/keytrustee-db.zip | psql -p 11381 -d keytrustee
If the zip file is encrypted, you are prompted for the password to decrypt the file.

Restore the Key Trustee Server configuration directory:
cd /var/lib/keytrustee
unzip /path/to/keytrustee-conf.zip
If the zip file is encrypted, you are prompted for the password to decrypt the file.

Start the Key Trustee Server service:

RHEL 6-compatible: $ sudo service keytrusteed start
RHEL 7-compatible: $ sudo systemctl start keytrusteed


Remove the backup files (keytrustee-db.zip and keytrustee-conf.zip) from the Key Trustee Server host.





Restoring Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee KMS from ktbackup.sh Backups

After installing Key Trustee Server or Key Trustee KMS on a new host after a failure, or if you need to restore accidentally deleted keys on the same host, use the following procedure
to restore Key Trustee Server or Key Trustee KMS from backups generated by the ktbackup.sh script.

Decrypt the backup tarball using the private key of the GPG recipient specified in the backup command by running the following command as the GPG recipient user account. The GPG
recipient private key must be available on the Key Trustee Server or Key Trustee KMS host on which you run this command.
gpg -d -o /path/to/decrypted/backup.tar /path/to/encrypted/tarball
Verify the decrypted tarball using the tar tvf /path/to/decrypted/backup.tar command. For example:
$ tar tvf kts_bak_kts01_example_com_2016-02-10_11-14-37.tar

sudo service keytrusteed restart      #RHEL 6-compatible
sudo systemctl restart keytrusteed    #RHEL 7-compatible


Restart the Key Trustee KMS service in Cloudera Manager (Key Trustee KMS service > Actions > Restart).





Restoring Active Key Trustee Server from Passive Key Trustee Server

If the Active Key Trustee Server fails, and you do not have a backup, you can restore it from the Passive Key Trustee Server using the following procedure. You can also use this
procedure if you need to restore keys that were successfully written to the Passive Key Trustee Server, but are not included in the most recent backup.
The following procedure assumes you have installed Key Trustee Server on the replacement host and (if you are using Cloudera Manager) added the Key Trustee Server service. For
instructions on installing Key Trustee Server, see Installing Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee
Server

Copy the Key Trustee Server database from the Passive Key Trustee Server host to the new Active Key Trustee Server host. Run the following command on the Passive Key Trustee Server
host:
sudo rsync --exclude recovery.conf -a /var/lib/keytrustee/db root@kts01.example.com:/var/lib/keytrustee/
Replace kts01.example.com with the hostname of the new Active Key Trustee Server.

Make sure that the recovery.conf file did not get copied to the Active Key Trustee Server (for example, if there was a typo in your rsync command). Run the following command on the Active Key Trustee Server host:
sudo ls -l /var/lib/keytrustee/db/recovery.conf
If the file exists on the Active Key Trustee Server host, delete it. Make sure you are on the Active Key Trustee Server host before deleting the file. Do not delete the recovery.conf file on the Passive Key Trustee Server host.

Copy the configuration directory from the Passive Key Trustee Server host to the new Active Key Trustee Server host. Run the following command on the Passive Key Trustee Server host:
sudo rsync --exclude .ssl --exclude '*.pid' -a /var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee root@kts01.example.com:/var/lib/keytrustee/
Replace kts01.example.com with the hostname of the new Active Key Trustee Server.

Create the logs directory and make sure it is owned by the keytrustee user and group:
sudo mkdir /var/lib/keytrustee/logs
sudo chown keytrustee:keytrustee /var/lib/keytrustee/logs
(Cloudera Manager only) Generate the Key Trustee Server keyring: Key Trustee Server service
> Actions > Generate Key Trustee Server Keyring
Set up the database on the Active Key Trustee Server host.

Using Cloudera Manager: Key Trustee Server service > Actions > Set Up Key Trustee Server Database
Using the Command Line:
sudo ktadmin --confdir /var/lib/keytrustee db --port 11381 --pg-rootdir /var/lib/keytrustee/db --bootstrap --slave kts02.example.com
Replace kts02.example.com with the hostname of the Passive Key Trustee Server.



Start the database.

Using Cloudera Manager: Key Trustee Server service > Instances > Active Database > Actions > Start this Active
Database
Using the Command Line: Run the following command on the Active Key Trustee Server host:
sudo ktadmin --confdir /var/lib/keytrustee db --port 11381 --pg-rootdir /var/lib/keytrustee/db --bootstrap --slave kts02.example.com
Replace kts02.example.com with the hostname of the Passive Key Trustee Server.



Enable synchronous replication.

Using Cloudera Manager: Key Trustee Server service > Actions > Setup Enable Synchronous Replication in HA mode
Using the Command Line: Run the following command on the Active Key Trustee Server host:
sudo ktadmin --confdir /var/lib/keytrustee enable-synchronous-replication


Restart the Active Key Trustee Server.

Using Cloudera Manager: Key Trustee Server service > Actions > Restart
Using the Command Line: Run the following command on the Active Key Trustee Server host:
sudo service keytrusteed restart      #RHEL 6-compatible
sudo systemctl restart keytrusteed    #RHEL 7-compatible


Restart the Key Trustee KMS service in Cloudera Manager (Key Trustee KMS service > Actions > Restart).
