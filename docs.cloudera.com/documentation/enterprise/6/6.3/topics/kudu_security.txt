Kudu Security Overview

Kudu includes security features that allow Kudu clusters to be hardened against access from unauthorized users. Kudu uses strong authentication with Kerberos, while communication between
Kudu clients and servers can now be encrypted with TLS. Kudu also allows you to use HTTPS encryption to connect to the web UI.

The rest of this topic describes the security capabilities of Apache Kudu and how to configure a secure Kudu cluster. Currently, there are a few known limitations in Kudu
security that might impact your cluster. For the list, see Security Limitations.

Kudu Authentication with Kerberos

Kudu can be configured to enforce secure authentication among servers, and between clients and servers. Authentication prevents untrusted actors from gaining access to Kudu, and securely
identifies connecting users or services for authorization checks. Authentication in Kudu is designed to interoperate with other secure Hadoop components by utilizing Kerberos.
Configure authentication on Kudu servers using the --rpc_authentication flag, which can be set to one of the following options:

required - Kudu will reject connections from clients and servers who lack authentication credentials.
optional - Kudu will attempt to use strong authentication, but will allow unauthenticated connections.
disabled - Kudu will only allow unauthenticated connections.

By default, the flag is set to optional. To secure your cluster, set --rpc_authentication to required.


Internal Private Key Infrastructure (PKI)

Kudu uses an internal PKI to issue X.509 certificates to servers in the cluster. Connections between peers who have both obtained certificates will use TLS for authentication. In such
cases, neither peer needs to contact the Kerberos KDC.
X.509 certificates are only used for internal communication among Kudu servers, and between Kudu clients and servers. These certificates are never presented in a public facing protocol.
By using internally-issued certificates, Kudu offers strong authentication which scales to huge clusters, and allows TLS encryption to be used without requiring you to manually deploy certificates on
every node.



Authentication Tokens

After authenticating to a secure cluster, the Kudu client will automatically request an authentication token from the Kudu master. An authentication token encapsulates the identity of
the authenticated user and carries the Kudu master's RSA signature so that its authenticity can be verified. This token will be used to authenticate subsequent connections. By default, authentication
tokens are only valid for seven days, so that even if a token were compromised, it cannot be used indefinitely. For the most part, authentication tokens should be completely transparent to users. By
using authentication tokens, Kudu is able to take advantage of strong authentication, without paying the scalability cost of communicating with a central authority for every connection.
When used with distributed compute frameworks such as Apache Spark, authentication tokens can simplify configuration and improve security. For example, the Kudu Spark connector will
automatically retrieve an authentication token during the planning stage, and distribute the token to tasks. This allows Spark to work against a secure Kudu cluster where only the planner node has
Kerberos credentials.



Client Authentication to Secure Kudu Clusters

Users running client Kudu applications must first run the kinit command to obtain a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket. For example:
kinit admin@EXAMPLE-REALM.COM
Once authenticated, you use the same client code to read from and write to Kudu servers with and without the Kerberos configuration.




Scalability

Kudu authentication is designed to scale to thousands of nodes, which means it must avoid unnecessary coordination with a central authentication authority (such as the Kerberos KDC) for
each connection. Instead, Kudu servers and clients use Kerberos to establish initial trust with the Kudu master, and then use alternate credentials for subsequent connections. As described
previously, the Kudu master issues internal X.509 certificates to tablet servers on startup, and temporary authentication tokens to clients on first contact.



Coarse-grained Authorization

Kudu supports coarse-grained authorization checks for client requests based on the client's authenticated Kerberos principal (user or service). Access levels are granted based on
whitelist-style Access Control Lists (ACLs), one for each level. Each ACL specifies a comma-separated list of users, or may be set to '*' to indicate that all
authenticated users have access rights at the specified level.
The two levels of access which can be configured are:

Superuser - Principals authorized as a superuser can perform certain administrative functions such as using the kudu
command line tool to diagnose and repair cluster issues.
User - Principals authorized as a user are able to access and modify all data in the Kudu cluster. This includes the ability to create, drop, and alter
tables, as well as read, insert, update, and delete data. The default value for the User ACL is '*', which allows all users access to the cluster. However, if
authentication is enabled, this will restrict access to only those users who are able to successfully authenticate using Kerberos. Unauthenticated users on the same network as the Kudu servers will
be unable to access the cluster.

Note: Internally, Kudu has a third access level for the daemons themselves called Service. This is used to ensure
that users cannot connect to the cluster and pose as tablet servers.



Fine-Grained Authorization

As of Kudu 1.10.0, Kudu can be configured to enforce fine-grained authorization across servers. This ensures that users can see only the data they are explicitly authorized to see. Kudu
currently supports this by leveraging policies defined in Apache Sentry 2.2 and later.
Warning: Fine-grained authorization policies are not enforced when accessing the web UI. User data may appear on various pages of the web UI
(e.g. in logs, metrics, scans, etc.). As such, it is recommended to either limit access to the web UI ports, or redact or disable the web UI entirely, as desired. See the Web UI Encryption section for information on securing the web UI.


Apache Sentry

Apache Sentry models tabular objects in the following hierarchy:

Server: is indicated by the Kudu configuration flag --server_name. Everything stored in a Kudu cluster falls within the
given "server"
Database: is indicated as a prefix of table names with the format <database>.<table>
Table: is a single Kudu table.
Column: is a column within a Kudu table.

Each level of this hierarchy defines a scope on which the privileges can be granted. Privileges granted on a higher scope imply privileges on a lower scope. For example, if a user has a
SELECT privilege on a database, then that user implicitly has the SELECT privileges on every table belonging to that database.
Privileges are also associated with specific actions. Access to Kudu tables may rely on privileges on the following actions:

ALTER
CREATE
DELETE
DROP
INSERT
UPDATE
SELECT


Additionally, there are three special actions recognized by Kudu: ALL, OWNER, and METADATA.
If a user has the ALL or OWNER privileges on a given table, that user has all of the above privileges on the table. METADATA privilege is not an actual privilege per se, rather, it is a conceptual privilege with which Kudu models any privilege. If a user has any privilege on a given table, that
user has METADATA privileges on the table, i.e. a privilege granted on any action on a table implies that the user has the METADATA
privilege on that table.
For more details about Sentry privileges, see the Apache Sentry
documentation.
Note: Depending on the value of the sentry.db.explicit.grants.permitted configuration in Sentry, certain privileges
may not be grantable in Sentry. For example, in Sentry deployments that don't support UPDATE privileges, to perform an operation that requires UPDATE privileges, a user must instead have ALL privileges.
When a Kudu master receives a request, it consults Sentry to determine what privileges a user has. If the user is not authorized to perform the requested action, the request is rejected.
Kudu leverages the authenticated identity of a user to decide whether to perform or reject a request.



Authorization Tokens

Rather than having every tablet server communicate directly with Sentry, privileges are propagated and checked via authorization tokens. These tokens
encapsulate what privileges a user has on a given table. Tokens are generated by the master and returned to Kudu clients upon opening a Kudu table. Kudu clients automatically attach authorization
tokens when sending requests to tablet servers.
Authorization tokens are a means to limit the number of nodes directly accessing Sentry to retrieve privileges. As such, since the expected number of tablet servers in a cluster is much
higher than the number of Kudu masters, they are only used to authorize requests sent to tablet servers. Kudu masters fetch privileges directly from Sentry or cache. See
<<privilege-caching>> for more details of Kudu's privilege cache.
Similar to the validity interval for authentication tokens, to limit the window of potential unwanted access if a token becomes compromised, authorization tokens are valid for five
minutes by default. The acquisition and renewal of a token is hidden from the user, as Kudu clients automatically retrieve new tokens when existing tokens expire.
When a tablet server that has been configured to enforce fine-grained access control receives a request, it checks the privileges in the attached token, rejecting it if the privileges
are not sufficient to perform the requested operation, or if it is invalid (e.g. expired).



Trusted Users

It may be desirable to allow certain users to view and modify any data stored in Kudu. Such users can be specified via the --trusted_user_acl master
configuration. Trusted users can perform any operation that would otherwise require fine-grained privileges, without Kudu consulting Sentry.
Additionally, some services that interact with Kudu may authorize requests on behalf of their end users. For example, Apache Impala authorizes queries on behalf of its users, and sends
requests to Kudu as the Impala service user, commonly "impala". Since Impala authorizes requests on its own, to avoid extraneous communication between Sentry and Kudu, the Impala service user should
be listed as a trusted user.
Note: When accessing Kudu through Impala, Impala enforces its own fine-grained authorization policy. This policy is similar to Kudu's and can be
found in Impala's autorization documentation.



Configuring the Integration with Apache Sentry

Sentry is often configured with Kerberos authentication. In order to enable integration with Sentry, a cluster must first be integrated with the Apache Hive Metastore. See the Enabling the Hive Metastore Integration section to configure Kudu to synchronize its internal catalog with the Hive Metastore.
The following configurations must be set on the master:
--sentry_service_rpc_addresses=<Sentry RPC address>
--server_name=<value of HiveServer2's hive.sentry.server configuration>
--kudu_service_name=kudu
--sentry_service_kerberos_principal=sentry
--sentry_service_security_mode=kerberos

# This example ACL setup allows the 'impala' user to access all data stored in
# Kudu, assuming Impala will authorize requests on its own. The 'hadoopadmin'
# user is also granted access to all Kudu data, which may facilitate testing
# and debugging.
--trusted_user_acl=impala,hadoopadmin
The following configurations must be set on the tablet servers:
--tserver_enforce_access_control=true



Caching

To avoid overwhelming Sentry with requests to fetch user privileges, the Kudu master can be configured to cache user privileges. A by-product of this caching is that when privileges
are changed in Sentry, they may not be reflected in Kudu for a configurable amount of time, defined by the following Kudu master configurations:
--sentry_privileges_cache_ttl_factor * --authz_token_validity_interval_secs
The default value is fifty minutes. If privilege updates need to be reflected in Kudu sooner than this, the Kudu CLI tool can be used to invalidate the cached privileges to force Kudu
to fetch new ones from Sentry:
kudu master authz_cache reset <master-addresses>



Policy for Kudu Masters

The following authorization policy is enforced by Kudu masters:


Authorization Policy for Masters


Operation
Required Privilege




CreateTable
CREATE ON DATABASE


CreateTable with a different owner specified than the requesting user
ALL ON DATABASE with the Sentry GRANT OPTION. See GRANT <Privilege> ... WITH GRANT OPTION.


DeleteTable

Policy for Kudu Tablet Servers

The following authorization policy is enforced by Kudu tablet servers:


Authorization Policy for Tablet Servers

Scan

SELECT ON TABLE, or
METADATA ON TABLE and SELECT ON COLUMN for each projected column and each predicate column



Scan (no projected columns, equivalent to COUNT(*))

column


Checksum
User must be configured in --superuser_acl


ListTablets
User must be configured in --superuser_acl




Note: Unlike Impala, Kudu only supports all-or-nothing access to a tableâs schema, rather than showing only authorized columns.




Encryption

Kudu allows you to use TLS to encrypt all communications among servers, and between clients and servers. Configure TLS encryption on Kudu servers using the --rpc_encryption flag, which can be set to one of the following options:

required - Kudu will reject unencrypted connections.
optional - Kudu will attempt to use encryption, but will allow unencrypted connections.
disabled - Kudu will not use encryption.

By default, the flag is set to optional. To secure your cluster, set --rpc_encryption to required.
Note: Kudu will automatically turn off encryption on local loopback connections, since traffic from these connections is never exposed externally.
This allows locality-aware compute frameworks, such as Spark and Impala, to avoid encryption overhead, while still ensuring data confidentiality.
Using Vormetric encryption is considered experimental. We recommend you to experiment using Vormetric encryption with Kudu in a development environment.



Web UI Encryption

The Kudu web UI can be configured to use secure HTTPS encryption by providing each server with TLS certificates. Use the --webserver_certificate_file and
--webserver_private_key_file properties to specify the certificate and private key to be used for communication.
Alternatively, you can choose to completely disable the web UI by setting --webserver_enabled flag to false on the Kudu
servers.



Web UI Redaction

To prevent sensitive data from being included in the web UI, all row data is redacted. Table metadata, such as table names, column names, and partitioning information is not redacted.
Alternatively, you can choose to completely disable the web UI by setting the --webserver_enabled flag to false on the Kudu servers.
Note: Disabling the web UI will also disable REST endpoints such as /metrics. Monitoring systems rely on these
endpoints to gather metrics data.




Log Redaction

To prevent sensitive data from being included in Kudu server logs, all row data will be redacted. You can turn off log redaction using the --redact
flag.



Configuring a Secure Kudu Cluster using Cloudera Manager

Warning: If you are upgrading from Kudu 1.2.0 / CDH 5.10.x, you must upgrade both Kudu and CDH parcels (or packages) at the same time. If you
upgrade Kudu but do not upgrade CDH, new Kudu features such as Security will not be available. Note that even though you might be able to see the updated configuration options for Kudu security in
Cloudera Manager, configuring them will have no effect.

Use the following set of instructions to secure a Kudu cluster using Cloudera Manager:

Enabling Kerberos Authentication and RPC Encryption
Configuring Coarse-grained Authorization with ACLs
Configuring HTTPS Encryption for the Kudu Master and Tablet Server Web UIs
Enabling Sentry Authorization



Enabling Kerberos Authentication and RPC Encryption

Important: The following instructions assume you already have a secure Cloudera Manager cluster with Kerberos authentication enabled. If this
is not the case, first secure your cluster using the steps described at Enabling Kerberos Authentication Using the Cloudera Manager Wizard.

To enable Kerberos authentication for Kudu:

Go to the Kudu service.
Click the Configuration tab.
Select Category > Main.
In the Search field, type Kerberos to show the relevant properties.
Edit the following properties according to your cluster configuration:




Field
Usage Notes




Kerberos Principal
Set to the default principal, kudu. Currently, Kudu does not support
configuring a custom service principal for Kudu processes.


Enable Secure Authentication And Encryption
Select this checkbox to enable authentication and RPC encryption between all Kudu clients and servers,
as well as between individual servers. Only enable this property after you have configured Kerberos.





Click Save Changes.
You will see an error message that tells you the Kudu keytab is missing. To generate the keytab, go to the top navigation bar and click Administration > Security.
Go to the Kerberos Credentials tab. On this page you will see a list of the existing Kerberos principals for services running on the cluster.
Click Generate Missing Credentials. Once the Generate Missing Credentials command has finished running, you will see the Kudu principal added to the
list.




Configuring Coarse-grained Authorization with ACLs


Go to the Kudu service.
Click the Configuration tab.
Select Category > Security.
In the Search field, type ACL to show the relevant properties.
Edit the following properties according to your cluster configuration:




Field
Usage Notes




Superuser Access Control List
Add a comma-separated list of superusers who can access the cluster. By default, this property is left
blank.
'*' indicates that all authenticated users will be given superuser access.



User Access Control List
Add a comma-separated list of users who can access the cluster. By default, this property is set to '*'.
The default value of '*' allows all users access to the cluster. However, if authentication is enabled, this will restrict access to only those users who
are able to successfully authenticate using Kerberos. Unauthenticated users on the same network as the Kudu servers will be unable to access the cluster.
Add the impala user to this list to allow Impala to query data in Kudu. You might choose to add any other relevant usernames if you want to give access to
Spark Streaming jobs.

Enabling Sentry Authorization
To enable Kuduâs integration with Sentry:

First, ensure that Kudu has been configured to synchronize its catalog with the Hive Metastore. See the steps described in Enabling the Hive Metastore Integration.
Go to the Kudu service.
Click the Configuration tab.
Select the Sentry Service with which Kudu should authorize requests.





Configuring a Secure Kudu Cluster using the Command Line

Important: Follow these command-line instructions on systems that do not use Cloudera Manager. If you are using Cloudera Manager, see
Configuring a Secure Kudu Cluster using Cloudera Manager.
The following configuration parameters should be set on all servers (master and tablet servers) to ensure that a Kudu cluster is secure:
# Connection Security
#--------------------
--rpc_authentication=required
--rpc_encryption=required
--keytab_file=<path-to-kerberos-keytab>

# Web UI Security
#--------------------
--webserver_certificate_file=<path-to-cert-pem>
--webserver_private_key_file=<path-to-key-pem>
# optional
--webserver_private_key_password_cmd=<password-cmd>

# If you prefer to disable the web UI entirely:
--webserver_enabled=false

# Coarse-grained authorization
#--------------------------------

# This example ACL setup allows the 'impala' user as well as the
# 'etl_service_account' principal access to all data in the
# Kudu cluster. The 'hadoopadmin' user is allowed to use administrative
# tooling. Note that by granting access to 'impala', other users
# may access data in Kudu via the Impala service subject to its own
# authorization rules.
--user_acl=impala,etl_service_account
--admin_acl=hadoopadmin
More information about these flags can be found in the configuration reference
documentation.
See Configuring the Integration with Apache Sentry to see an example of how to enable fine-grained authorization
via Apache Sentry.
