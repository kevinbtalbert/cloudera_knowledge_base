Navigator Encrypt Access Control List


Managing the Access Control List

Cloudera Navigator Encrypt manages file system permissions with an access control list (ACL). This ACL is a security access control created by Cloudera that enables a predefined Linux
process to access a file or directory managed by Navigator Encrypt.
The ACL uses rules to control process access to files. The rules specify whether a Linux process has access permissions to read from or write to a specific Navigator Encrypt path.
A rule is defined in the following order:
# TYPE @CATEGORY PATH PROCESS PARAMETERS
The following table defines the ACL rule components:


ACL Rule Components


Component
Description




TYPE
Specifies whether to allow or deny a process. It can have either of the following values: ALLOW or
DENY.


@CATEGORY
This is a user-defined shorthand, or container, for the encrypted dataset that the process will have access to. For example, if you
are encrypting the directory /var/lib/mysql, you could use the category @mysql to indicate that this rule is granting access to a process
on the MySQL data. See Listing Categories for instructions on viewing existing categories.


PATH
Specifies the rights permissions of a specific path. For example: *, www/*.htaccess. Omit the leading slash (/).


PROCESS
Specifies the process or command name for the rule.


PARAMETERS

Tells the process the parent-child process to be executed:
--shell defines the script for Navigator Encrypt to allow for executable process. Supported shells are /usr/bin/bash,
/bin/bash, /usr/bin/dash, and /bin/bash.
--children defines for Navigator Encrypt which child processes to allow that are executed by a process/script.
Example: --shell=/bin/bash, --children=/bin/df,/bin/ls






All rules are stored in an encrypted policy file together with a set of process signatures that are used by Navigator Encrypt to authenticate each Linux process. This file is encrypted
with the Navigator Encrypt key you defined during installation.
Cloudera recommends using permissive mode to assist with the initial ACL rule creation for your environment. In permissive
mode, Navigator Encrypt allows full access to the encrypted data by all processes, but logs them in dmesg as action="denied" messages.
Consult these messages to identify required ACL rules. To set Navigator Encrypt to permissive mode, use the following command:
sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt set --mode=permissive
To view the current mode, run navencrypt status -d. For more information on access modes, see Access Modes.

deny2allow
After you generate the action="denied" messages, use the navencrypt deny2allow command to show which ACL rules are
required, based on the action="denied" messages in dmesg. To show which ACL rules are required, perform the following steps:

Save the dmesg content to a file:
sudo dmesg > /tmp/dmesg.txt
Use the dmesg.txt file content as input to the deny2allow command to analyze the action="denied" messages and display a list of required ACL rules based on the action="denied" messages. Here is an example command and output:
$ sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt deny2allow /tmp/dmesg.txt
ALLOW @mysql employees/* /usr/sbin/mysqld
ALLOW @mysql * /bin/bash
ALLOW @mysql * /bin/ls


If you need to clear the dmesg log and start fresh, run dmesg -c.
If a rule is displayed in the output from the command, it does not automatically mean the ACL rule must be added. You must determine which rules are actually needed. For example, the
rule for ls would not typically be added as an ACL rule.
After the initial ACL rules are created, disable permissive mode with the following command:
sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt set --mode=enforcing


Adding ACL Rules
Rules can be added one at a time using the command line or by specifying a policy file containing multiple rules. The following example shows how to add a single rule using the
navencrypt acl --add command:
sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --add --rule="ALLOW @mysql * /usr/sbin/mysqld"
See Listing Categories for instructions on viewing existing categories.
The following example shows how to add multiple rules using a policy file:
sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --add --file=/mnt/private/acl_rules
The contents of the policy file should contain one rule per line. For example:
ALLOW @mysql * /usr/sbin/mysqld
ALLOW @log * /usr/sbin/mysqld
ALLOW @apache * /usr/lib/apache2/mpm-prefork/apache2
Navigator Encrypt releases 3.10 and higher support comments in the policy file. Comments begin with the hash (#) symbol. You can use comments to annotate
the policy file, or to temporarily disable a rule for testing. For example:
# Cloudera Navigator Encrypt policy file
# Allow mysqld to access all database files
ALLOW @mysql * /usr/sbin/mysqld
# Allow mysqld to write logs
ALLOW @log * /usr/sbin/mysqld
# ALLOW @apache * /usr/lib/apache2/mpm-prefork/apache2
Using a policy file is the fastest way to add multiple rules because it only requires the security key one time.
It is also possible to overwrite the entire current rules set with the option --overwrite. When this command is executed, all current rules are replaced by
the ones specified in the file that contains the new set of rules. Cloudera recommends to save a copy of your current set of rules by printing it with the option --print.
Here is an example command using the --overwrite option:
sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --overwrite --file=/mnt/private/acl_rules


Adding ACL Rules by Profile
If your environment requires more granular controls on the processes that can access the data, you can add extra controls by using profiles. Profiles set requirements on a process other
than just having the correct fingerprint. They can include such things as process owner and group, required open files, and the current working directory. To see more about adding rules by profile,
see ACL Profile Rules. For details about fingerprints, see Process-Based Access Control List.


Deleting ACL Rules
Rules can be deleted in one of two ways:

Manually specifying the rule to delete using the command line.
Specifying the line number of the rule to delete.


The following example shows how to delete a rule by passing it as a parameter:
sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --del --rule="ALLOW @mysql * /usr/sbin/mysqld "
If you remove a MySQL ALLOW rule, the MySQL cache must be cleaned by executing the FLUSH TABLES; MySQL statement. Otherwise,
it will still be possible to view data from encrypted table.
The following example shows how to delete a rule by specifying a line number:
sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --del --line 3
It is also possible to delete multiple ACL rules in a single command:
sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --del --line=1,3
See Printing ACL Rules for information on determining line numbers.


Deleting ACL Rules by Profile
See ACL Profile Rules for instructions on deleting rules by profile.


Printing ACL Rules
You can print the current Access Control List using the following command:
sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --print
Save the ACL to a file with the --file option:
sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --print --file=policy-backup
To display additional information about the organization of the policy file, use the --list option:
sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --list


Universal ACL Rules
Universal ACLs will allow or deny a process access to all files or directories encrypted with Navigator Encrypt.
The rule ALLOW @* * /process allows the designated process to access anything from all encrypted categories.
The rule ALLOW @data * * allows all processes access to any path under the @data category.
The rule ALLOW @* * * allows all processes access to all encrypted categories. Cloudera does not recommend using this rule. Use it only in test
environments.
Here is an example adding a universal ACL rule and then displaying it:
$ sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --add --rule="ALLOW @* * /usr/sbin/mysqld"
Type MASTER passphrase:
1 rule(s) were added
# navencrypt acl --listType MASTER passphrase:
# -  Type     Category       Path                     Profile  Process
1    ALLOW    @*             *                                 /usr/sbin/mysqld   


Enabling Shell Scripts to Be Detected by ACL
All of the previous rules work for binary files. There may be times a script, such as a shell script, must be allowed to access the encrypted directory.
You can add the script as a rule by indicating the executable binary process of this script using the --shell option, for example:
ALLOW @scripts * /root/script.sh --shell=/bin/bash
The --shell option identifies which executable process is used to execute the script. Supported shells are /usr/bin/bash,
/bin/bash, /usr/bin/dash, and /bin/bash
If the script is altered, it will no longer be trusted by the ACL because the fingerprint has changed. If you edit the script you must invoke the update option to update the ACL with the
new fingerprint.
In some cases, it may be necessary to grant permissions to sub-processes invoked by scripts. For example, it may be necessary to grant permissions to /bin/bash that also allow running the /bin/df command to allow the system administrator to check disk capacity through a script run using a
crontab entry. By using the --children option, you can specify these permissions. For example:
ALLOW @scripts * /root/script.sh --shell=/bin/bash --children=/bin/df
The --children option tells Navigator Encrypt to allow the /bin/df binary process if it is executed by /root/script.sh.
To allow more than one sub-process, identify them with the --children option as comma-separated values. For example:
ALLOW @scripts * /root/script.sh --shell=/bin/bash --children=/bin/df,/bin/ls
To add shell-children sub-processes, execute the navencrypt acl --add command, for example:
$ sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --add --rule="ALLOW @mysql * /usr/bin/mysqld_safe \
--shell=/bin/bash --children=/bin/df,/bin/ls"




ACL Profile Rules

If your environment requires more granular controls on the processes that can access the data, you can add extra controls by using profiles. Profiles set requirements on a process other
than just having the correct fingerprint. They can include such things as process owner and group, required open files, and the current working directory.
A profile is generated by using the following command:
usr/sbin/navencrypt-profile --pid=<pid>
The output, by default, will be displayed on the screen. You can redirect the output to a file using the > or >>
redirect operators. You can then edit the JSON output in the file to remove lines you do not want. By default, the profile includes the UID, the short name of the binary or script (identified as comm
), and the full command line of the running process (including any parameters passed). You can generate information by using one of these flags:

-c, --with-cwd
Output the current working directory

-e, --with-egid
Output the egid

-g, --with-gid
Output the gid

-u, --with-euid
Output the euid



Example output from the navencrypt-profile command:
{
"uid":"0",
"comm":"NetworkManager",
"cmdline":"NetworkManager âpid-file=/var/run/NetwrkManager/NetworkManager.pid",
"gid":"0"
"cwd":"/",
"fd0":"/dev/null",
"fd1":"/dev/null",
"fd2":"/dev/null"
}
Some distributions do not support euid and guid. Make sure that your profile file is correct by executing the following
command to verify the expected IDs:
ps -p <pid_of_process> -o euid,egid
If cmdline parameters are variable, such as appending a process start timestamp to a filename, then the process profile will not match on subsequent
restarts of the process because the current profile will have an updated timestamp and access will be denied by the ACL. You can mark those parameters as variable inside the profile file. For
example, if the cmdline of a process is something like this:
"cmdline":"NetworkManager âpid-file=/var/run/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.pid \
-logfile=/var/log/NetworkManager/log-20130808152300.log"
Where log-20130505122300.log is a variable cmdline parameter, before adding the process profile to the ACL, edit the
process profile file and use ## to specify that a particular parameter is variable:
"cmdline":"NetworkManager âpid-file=/var/run/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.pid -logfile=##"
With the above configuration, the ACL will allow any value for the -logfile cmdline parameter.
To enable a profile in the ACL, use the additional parameter --profile-file=<filename> when adding the rule to the ACL:
$ sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --add --rule="ALLOW @mysql * /usr/sbin/mysqld" \
â-profile-file=/path/to/profile/file
To display the profile portion of the rules, use the --all parameter with navencrypt acl --list:
$ sudo /usr/sbin/navencrypt acl --list --all
Type MASTER passphrase:
# - Type Category Path Profile Process
1 ALLOW @mysql * YES /usr/sbin/mysqld
PROFILE:
{"uid":"120","comm":"mysqld","cmdline":"mysqld"}
