Tutorial: Using Impala, Hive and Hue with Virtual Private Clusters


Workflows:

Set Up an Environment
Workflow #1: Using impala-shell and Hive
Workflow #2: View HDFS directory structure of Compute clusters
Workflow #3: Insert data in test_table through Spark
Workflow #4: Hue in a Virtual Private Cluster Environment




Set Up an Environment

Set up your environment with Compute and Base clusters as follows: (See Adding a Compute Cluster and Data Context.)

Create clusters where the Cloudera Manager and CDH version match, for example both are 6.2.0. The clusters must use Kerberos and TLS.
If Base cluster has Sentry, then make sure the user executing cross cluster queries is added to the correct role that has all the necessary privileges to create/insert data into
tables. (more in workflow #3).
Configure a Regular cluster called Cluster 1 to be used as a Base cluster. This cluster must have high availability enabled.
Create two Compute clusters called Compute 1 and Compute 2.
Configure services for the three clusters as shown below:







Workflow #1: Using impala-shell and Hive

This workflow desribes how to create a table using Impala, how to insert sample data on Compute cluster 1, and how to access and modify the data using beeline from Compute cluster 2.
In a Virtural Private Cluster environment, Hue and the impala-shell can be used to setup databases, tables, insert and retrieve data using queries. This workflow focuses on running a few
queries using impala-shell command line tool.
This tutorial uses a kerberized environment with TLS, so you must kinit the user first. If you want to add a new user, see Step 6: Get or Create a Kerberos Principal for Each User Account and Enabling Sentry Authorization for Impala
for documentation to create and add the user to the Kerberos principal and the required Linux groups.

Identify a host running Impala Daemon to launch impala-shell using this breadcrumb. In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to Cloudera Manager > Compute Cluster 1 > IMPALA-1 > Instances.
Note the hostname of a host that is running the Impala Daemon and open an ssh session to that host.
ssh <hostname>




Kinit the user (because this is a Kerberized environment):
kinit -kt <keytab path of authorized user> <authorized user>
Start the Impala-shell:
In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to the Impala service and click the Status tab.
The Impala Shell command displays in the upper-left. Copy that string and use it as the command to open Impala shell. For example:
impala-shell -i vpc_host-cqdbms-2.tut.myco.com:25003 -d default -k --ssl --ca_cert=/etc/cdep-ssl-conf/CA_STANDARD/truststore.pem


The command uses the following form:
impala-shell -i <Impala Daemon host URL>:25003 -d default -k --ssl --ca_cert=<path to truststore>/truststore.pem
Query: use `default`
[vpc_host-cqdbms-2.tut.myco.com:25003] default>

Verify that impala-shell is in the connected status.
Create a database and a table:
[vpc_host-cqdbms-2.tut.myco.com:25003] default> create database test_data;

Query: create database test_data

Workflow #2: View HDFS directory structure of Compute clusters

In a Virtual Private Cluster environment, all Compute clusters have a local HDFS. But, crucial directories (JHS for spark, logging for yarn) for compute services are created in the Base
cluster HDFS.
One of the design assumptions of Compute clusters is that they would be transient and so the user should still have a way to access important logs after the Compute clusters have been
destroyed.

Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console and view the HDFS hierarchy on the Base cluster HDFS service by opening the File Browser: Cluster 1 > HDFS-1 > File Browser.




All the logs pertaining to Compute clusters are under the “mc” directory.



This Base cluster has 2 Compute clusters associated with it, Compute 1 and Compute 2.
Each Compute cluster (based on its ID) gets a folder under this directory, so folder 2 belongs to Compute 1 and 3 belongs to Compute 2. The ID of the cluster can be identified from the
URL used to access the cluster. Click on Compute 1 in the CM Cluster view and inspect the URL.
http://quasar-wfrgnj-1.vpc.cloudera.com:7180/cmf/clusters/2/status
The ID is the segment following /clusters in the URL. This is also the subfolder name under the /mc folder.
This is the directory where all the logs for services in Compute 1 are stored.

Navigate to the file browser of a Compute cluster.




Note that folder 2 which is dedicated for the Compute 1 cluster is not visible to the Compute 2 cluster.
Navigating to folders below this hierarchy, you can see the folders created for services present on the Compute 2 cluster.








Workflow #3: Insert data in test_table through Spark


Identify a host to start a spark-shell on the Compute cluster, Compute 2. Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console and go to Clusters > Compute 2 > SPARK_ON_YARN-1 > Instances.




Open a terminal session host <HiveServer2 Host URL>
Verify access for the user:
Assign the user starting spark-shell to a Linux group that has create/insert access configured in Sentry. .e. hive.
[root@vpc_host-nnwznq-1 ~]# usermod -aG hive systest
The user will also need to be created and added to the group on all the hosts of the Base cluster.

kinit the user:
[root@vpc_host-nnwznq-1 ~]# kinit -kt /cdep/keytabs/systest.keytab systest
Start spark-shell:
[root@vpc_host-nnwznq-1 ~]# sudo -u systest spark-shell

Workflow #4: Hue in a Virtual Private Cluster Environment


Login into Hue. Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console and go to Clusters > Compute
Clusters > Hue > Hue Web UI > Load Balanced Web UI.
Note: If the Base cluster uses Sentry, ensure that the logged-in user is a part of a Linux group that has the necessary grants to access the Hive warehouse on the Base cluster.

Select Editor > Hive.
The tables displa in the left panel.

Run a select query to display data in the test_table previously created:




Insert data into the table:




Change the editor to Impala:
Go to Hue > Query > Impala.

Run INVALIDATE METADATA query in the Impala editor.
Verify the data added from the Hive editor in the test_table shows up in the Impala editor:
