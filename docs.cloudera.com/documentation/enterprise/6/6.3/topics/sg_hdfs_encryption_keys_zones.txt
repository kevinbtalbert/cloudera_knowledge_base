Managing Encryption Keys and Zones


Interacting with the KMS and creating encryption zones requires the use of two new CLI commands: hadoop key and hdfs
crypto. The following sections will help you get started with creating encryption keys and setting up encryption zones.

Validating Hadoop Key Operations
Creating Encryption Zones
Adding Files to an Encryption Zone
Deleting Encryption Zones
Backing Up Encryption Keys
Rolling Encryption Keys
Re-encrypting Encrypted Data Encryption Keys (EDEKs)


Before continuing, make sure that your KMS ACLs have been set up according to best practices. For more information, see Configuring KMS Access Control Lists (ACLs).


Validating Hadoop Key Operations

Warning: If you are using or plan to use Cloudera Navigator Key HSM in conjunction with Cloudera
Navigator Key Trustee Server, ensure that:
Key names begin with alphanumeric characters and do not use special characters other than hyphen (-), period (.), or
underscore (_). Using other special characters can prevent you from migrating your keys to an HSM.
See Integrating Key HSM with Key Trustee Server for more information.

Warning:
HSM KMS key names should not exceed 28 characters. If the key name exceeds 28 characters, then it is silently truncated when passed on to the HSM; however, it is used at full length in
the HSM KMS local data store. Truncation only impacts key names created on the HSM, not in those in the HSM KMS metastore.

Use hadoop key create to create a test key, and then use hadoop key list to retrieve the key list:
sudo -u <key_admin> hadoop key create keytrustee_test
hadoop key list



Creating Encryption Zones

Important: Cloudera does not currently support configuring the root directory as an encryption
zone. Nested encryption zones are also not supported.
Important: The Java Keystore KMS default Truststore (for example, org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.JavaKeyStoreProvider) does not support uppercase key names.
Once a KMS has been set up and the NameNode and HDFS clients have been correctly configured, use the hadoop key and hdfs
crypto command-line tools to create encryption keys and set up new encryption zones.


Create an encryption key for your zone as keyadmin for the user/group (regardless of the application that will be using the encryption zone):
sudo -u hdfs hadoop key create <key_name>
Create a new empty directory and make it an encryption zone using the key created above.
sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -mkdir /encryption_zone
sudo -u hdfs hdfs crypto -createZone -keyName <key_name> -path /encryption_zone
You can verify creation of the new encryption zone by running the -listZones command. You should see the encryption zone along with its key listed as follows:
$ sudo -u hdfs hdfs crypto -listZones
/encryption_zone    <key_name>
Warning: Do not delete an encryption key as long as it is still in use for an encryption zone. This results in loss of access to data in that
zone. Also, do not delete the KMS service, as your encrypted HDFS data will be inaccessible. To prevent data loss, first copy the encrypted HDFS data to a non-encrypted zone using the distcp command.



For more information and recommendations on creating encryption zones for each CDH component, see Configuring CDH Services for HDFS Encryption.



Adding Files to an Encryption Zone

You can add files to an encryption zone by copying them to the encryption zone using distcp. For example:
sudo -u hdfs hadoop distcp /user/dir /encryption_zone
Important: You can delete files or directories that are part of an HDFS encryption zone. For details on how to configure trash in HDFS, see
Trash Behavior with HDFS Transparent Encryption Enabled.


DistCp Considerations

A common use case for DistCp is to replicate data between clusters for backup and disaster recovery purposes. This is typically performed by the cluster administrator, who is an HDFS
superuser. To retain this workflow when using HDFS encryption, a new virtual path prefix has been introduced, /.reserved/raw/, that gives superusers direct access to
the underlying block data in the filesystem. This allows superusers to distcp data without requiring access to encryption keys, and avoids the overhead of decrypting
and re-encrypting data. It also means the source and destination data will be byte-for-byte identical, which would not have been true if the data was being re-encrypted with a new EDEK.
Warning:

When using /.reserved/raw/ to distcp encrypted data, make sure you preserve extended attributes with the -px flag. This is because encrypted attributes such as the EDEK are exposed through extended attributes and must be preserved to be able to decrypt the file
This means that if the distcp is initiated at or above the encryption zone root, it will automatically create a new encryption zone at the destination if
it does not already exist. Hence, Cloudera recommends you first create identical encryption zones on the destination cluster to avoid any potential mishaps.

Attempting to perform distcp on encrypted data in /.reserved/raw/ fails if the destination cluster does not have an
identical encryption key as the source. Therefore, in addition to configuring identical encryption zones on both the source and destination clusters, ensure that both the clusters have identical
encryption keys.
Alternatively, you need not configure encryption zones on the destination cluster, and perform distcp from the /.reserved/raw/ endpoint to the destination cluster. The data copied to the destination cluster in this format will remain encrypted until restored to the source cluster and
decrypted by using the source cluster's keys.




Copying data from encrypted locations
By default, distcp compares checksums provided by the filesystem to verify that data was successfully copied to the destination. When copying from an
encrypted location, the file system checksums will not match because the underlying block data is different. This is true whether or not the destination location is encrypted or unencrypted.
In this case, you can specify the -skipcrccheck and -update flags to avoid verifying checksums. When you use -skipcrccheck,
distcp checks the file integrity by performing a file size comparison, right after the copy completes for each file.





Deleting Encryption Zones

To remove an encryption zone, delete the encrypted directory:
Warning: This command deletes the entire directory and all of its contents. Ensure that the data is no longer needed before running this
command.
sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -rm -r -skipTrash /encryption_zone
Important: The Key Trustee KMS does not directly execute a key deletion (for example, it may perform a soft delete instead, or delay the
actual deletion to prevent mistakes). In these cases, errors may occur when creating or deleting a key using the same name after it has already been deleted.



Backing Up Encryption Keys

Warning: It is very important that you regularly back up your encryption keys. Failure to do so can result in
irretrievable loss of encrypted data.
If you are using the Java KeyStore KMS, make sure you regularly back up the Java KeyStore that stores the encryption keys. If you are using the Key Trustee KMS and Key Trustee Server,
see Backing Up and Restoring Key Trustee Server and Clients for instructions on backing up Key Trustee Server and Key Trustee
KMS.



Rolling Encryption Keys

Before attempting to roll an encryption key (also known as an encryption zone key, or EZ key), familiarize yourself with the concepts described in Cloudera Navigator Data Encryption Overview, and HDFS Transparent Encryption, as the material in these sections presumes you are familiar with the fundamentals of HDFS
transparent encryption and Cloudera data at rest encryption.
When you roll an EZ key, you are essentially creating a new version of the key (ezKeyVersionName). Rolling EZ keys regularly helps enterprises minimize the
risk of key exposure. If a malicious attacker were to obtain the EZ key and decrypt encrypted data encryption keys (EDEKs) into DEKs, they could gain the ability to decrypt HDFS files. Rolling an EZ
key ensures that all DEKs for newly-created files will be encrypted with the new version of the EZ key. The older EZ key version that the attacker obtained cannot decrypt these EDEKs. You may want to
roll the encryption key periodically, as part of your security policy or when an external security compromise is detected.
To roll an EZ key:

(Optional) Before rolling any keys, log in as HDFS Superuser and verify/identify the encryption zones to which the current key
applies. This operation also helps clarify the relationship between the EZ key and encryption zones, and, if necessary, makes it easier to identify more important, high priority zones:
$ hdfs crypto âlistZones
/ez key1
/ez2 key2
/user key1
The first column identifies the encryption zone paths; the second column identifies the encryption key name.
(Optional) You can verify that the files inside an encryption zone are encrypted using the hdfs crypto
-getFileEncryptionInfo command. Note the EZ key version name and value, which you can use for comparison and verification after rolling the EZ key.
$ hdfs crypto âgetFileEncryptionInfo âpath /ez/f
{cipherSuite: {name: AES/CTR/NoPadding, algorithmBlockSize: 16}. cryptoProtocolVersion:
CryptoProtocolVersion{description=âEncryption zonesâ, version=2, unknownValue=null}, edek: 373c0c2e919c27e58c1c343f54233cbd,
iv: d129c913c8a34cde6371ec95edfb7337, keyName: key1, ezKeyVersionName: 7mbvopZ0Weuvs0XtTkpGw3G92KuWc4e4xcTXl0bXCpF}
Log off as HDFS Superuser.
Log in as Key Administrator. Because keys can be rolled, a key can have multiple key versions, where each key version has its own key material (the actual secret bytes used during DEK
encryption and EDEK decryption). You can fetch an encryption key by either its key name, returning the latest version of the key, or by a specific key version.
Roll the encryption key (previously identified/confirmed by the HDFS Superuser in step 1. Here, the <key name> is key1:
hadoop key roll key1
This operation contacts the KMS and rolls the keys there. Note that this can take a considerable amount of time, depending on the number of key versions residing in the KMS.
Rolling key version from KeyProvider: org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.kms.LoadBalancingKMSClientProvider@5ea434c8
for keyName: key1
key1 has been successfully rolled.
org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.kms.LoadBalancingKMSClientProvider@5ea434c8 has been updated.

(Optional) Log out as Key Administrator, and log in as HDFS Superuser. Verify that new files in the encryption zone have a new EZ
key version.
Note: For performance reasons, the NameNode caches EDEKs, so after rolling an encryption key, you may not be able to see the new version encryption
key immediately, or at least until after the EDEK cache is consumed. Of course, the file decryption and encryption still works with these EDEKs. If you require that all files' DEKs in an encryption
zone are encrypted using the latest version encryption key, please re-encrypt the EDEKs.
$ hdfs crypto âgetFileEncryptionInfo âpath /ez/new_file
{cipherSuite: {name: AES/CTR/NoPadding, algorithmBlockSize: 16}. cryptoProtocolVersion:
CryptoProtocolVersion{description=âEncryption zonesâ, version=2, unknownValue=null}, edek: 9aa13ea4a700f96287cfe1349f6ff4f2,
iv: 465c878ad9325e42fa460d2a22d12a72, keyName: key1, ezKeyVersionName: 4tuvorJ6Feeqk8WiCfdDs9K32KuEj7g2ydCAv0gNQbY}
Alternatively, you can use KMS Rest API to view key metadata and key versions. Elements appearing in brackets should be replaced with your actual values. So in this case, before rolling a key, you
can view the key metadata and versions as follows:

$ curl -k --negotiate -u: "https://<KMS_HOSTNAME>:16000/kms/v1/key/<key-name>/_metadata"
{
  "name" : "<key-name>",
  "cipher" : "<cipher>",
  "length" : <length>,
  "description" : "<decription>",
  "created" : <millis-epoc>,
  "versions" : <versions> (For example, 1)
}

$ curl -k  --negotiate -u: "https://<KMS_HOSTNAME>:16000/kms/v1/key/<key-name>/_currentversion"
{
  "material" : "<material>",
  "name" : "<key-name>",
  "versionName" : "<versionName>" (For example, version 1)
}
Roll the key and compare the results:
$ hadoop key roll key1

Rolling key version from KeyProvider: KMSClientProvider[https://<KMS_HOSTNAME>:16000/kms/v1/]

  for key name: <key-name>

key1 has been successfully rolled.

KMSClientProvider[https://<KMS_HOSTNAME>/kms/v1/] has been updated.

$ curl -k  --negotiate -u: "https://<KMS_HOSTNAME>:16000/kms/v1/key/<key-name>/_currentversion"

{
  "material" : "<material>", (New material)
  "name" : "<key-name>",
  "versionName" : "<versionName>" (New version name. For example, version 2)
}

$ curl -k --negotiate -u: "https://<KMS_HOSTNAME>:16000/kms/v1/key/<key-name>/_metadata"
{
  "name" : "<key-name>",
  "cipher" : "<cipher>",
  "length" : <length>,
  "description" : "<decription>",
  "created" : <millis-epoc>,
  "versions" : <versions> (For example, version 2)
}





Re-encrypting Encrypted Data Encryption Keys (EDEKs)

Before attempting to re-encrypt an EDEK, familiarize yourself with the concepts described in Cloudera Navigator Data
Encryption Overview, and HDFS Transparent Encryption, as the material in this section
presumes you are familiar with the fundamentals of HDFS transparent encryption and Cloudera data at rest encryption.
When you re-encrypt an EDEK, you are essentially decrypting the original EDEK created by the DEK, and then re-encrypting it using the new (rolled) version of the EZ key (see Rolling Encryption Keys). The file's metadata, which is stored in the NameNode, is then updated with this new EDEK.
Re-encryption does not impact the data in the HDFS files or the DEKâthe same DEK is still used to decrypt the file, so re-encryption is essentially transparent.


Benefits and Capabilities

In addition to minimizing security risks, re-encrypting the EDEK offers the following capabilities and benefits:


Re-encrypting EDEKs does not require that the user explicitly re-encrypt HDFS files.
In cases where there are several zones using the same key, the Key Administrator has the option of selecting which zoneâs EDEKs are re-encrypted first.
The HDFS Superuser can also monitor and cancel re-encryption operations.
Re-encryption is restarted automatically in cases where you have a NameNode failure during the re-encryption operation.





Prerequisites and Assumptions

Before attempting to re-encrypt an EDEK, familiarize yourself with the concepts and rules described in Managing Encryption Keys and Zones.


It is recommended that you perform EDEK re-encryption at the same time that you perform regular cluster maintenance because the operation can adversely impact CPU resources on the
NameNode.




In Cloudera Manager, review the clusterâs NameNode status, which must be in âGood Healthâ. If the cluster NameNode does not have a status of âGood Healthâ, then do not proceed with the
re-encryption of the EDEK. In the Cloudera Manager WebUI menu, you can verify the status for the cluster NameNode, which must not be in Safe mode (in other words, the WebUI
should indicate âSafemode is offâ).


Running the re-encryption command without successfully verifying the preceding items will result in failures with errors.



Limitations

This section identifies limitations associated with the re-encryption of EDEKs.

CAUTION:
You cannot perform any rename operations within the encryption zone during re-encryption. If you attempt to perform a rename operation during EDEK re-encryption, you will
receive an IOException error.

EDEK re-encryption doesn't change EDEKs on snapshots, due to the immutable nature HDFS snapshots. Thus, you should be aware that after EZ key exposure, the Key Administrator must delete
snapshots.



Re-encrypting an EDEK

This scenario operates on the assumption that an encryption zone has already been set up for this cluster. For more details about creating an encryption zone, see Creating Encryption Zones.


Navigate to the cluster in which you will be rolling keys and re-encrypting the EDEK.
Log in as HDFS Superuser.
(Optional) To view all of the options for the hdfs crypto command:
$ hdfs crypto
[-createZone âkeyName <keyName> -path <path>]
[-listZones]
[-provisionTrash âpath <path>]
[-getFileEncryptionInfo âpath <path>]
[-reencryptZone <action> -path <zone>]
[-listReencryptionStatus]
[-help <command-name>]
Before rolling any keys, verify/identify the encryption zones to which the current key applies. This operation also helps clarify the relationship between the EZ key and encryption
zones, and, if necessary, makes it easier to identify more important, high priority zones:
$ hdfs crypto âlistZones
/ez     key1
The first column identifies the encryption zone path (/ez); the second column identifies the encryption key name (key1).
Exit from the HDFS Superuser account and log in as Key Administrator.
Roll the encryption key (previously identified/confirmed by the HDFS Superuser in step 4). Here, the <key name> is key1:
hadoop key roll key1
This operation contacts the KMS and rolls the keys. Note that this can take a considerable amount of time, depending on the number of key versions.
Rolling key version from KeyProvider: org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.kms.LoadBalancingKMSClientProvider@5ea434c8
for keyName: key1
key1 has been successfully rolled.
org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.kms.LoadBalancingKMSClientProvider@5ea434c8 has been updated.
Log out as Key Administrator, and log in as HDFS Superuser.
(Optional) Before performing the re-encryption, you can verify the status of the current key version being used (keyName). Then,
after re-encrypting, you can confirm that the EZ key version (ezKeyVersionName) and EDEK have changed:
$ hdfs crypto âgetFileEncryptionInfo âpath /ez/f
{cipherSuite: {name: AES/CTR/NoPadding, algorithmBlockSize: 16}. cryptoProtocolVersion:
CryptoProtocolVersion{description=âEncryption zonesâ, version=2, unknownValue=null}, edek: 9aa13ea4a700f96287cfe1349f6ff4f2,
iv: d129c913c8a34cde6371ec95edfb7337, keyName: key1, ezKeyVersionName: 7mbvopZ0Weuvs0XtTkpGw3G92KuWc4e4xcTXl0bXCpF}
After the EZ key has been rolled successfully, re-encrypt the EDEK by running the re-encryption command on the encryption zone:
hdfs crypto âreencryptZone âstart âpath /ez
The following information appears when the submission is complete. At this point, the NameNode is processing and re-encrypting all of the EDEKs under the /ez directory.
re-encrypt command successfully submitted for zone: /ez action:  START:
Depending on the number of files, the re-encryption operation can take a long time. Re-encrypting a 1Million EDEK file typically takes between 2-6 minutes, depending on the NameNode hardware. To
check the status of the re-encryption for the zone:
hdfs crypto âlistReencryptionStatus

False: the encryption operation has not been canceled.

False


Completion Time
The time at which the re-encryption operation completed.

Number of files re-encrypted
The number that appears in this column reflects only the files whose EDEKs have been updated. If
a file is created after the key is rolled, then it will already have an EDEK that has been encrypted by the new key version, so the re-encryption operation will skip that file. In other words, it's
possible for a "Completed" re-encryption to reflect a number of re-encrypted files that is less than the number of files actually in the encryption zone.
Note: In cases when you re-encrypt an EZ key that has already been re-encrypted and there are no new files, the number of files re-encrypted will be 0.

1


Number of failures
When 0, no errors occurred during the re-encryption operation. If larger than 0, then investigate the NameNode log,
and re-encrypt.
0


Last file Checkpointed
Identifies the current position of the re-encryption process in the encryption zone--in other words, the file that was
most recently re-encrypted.
0





(Optional) After the re-encryption completes, you can confirm that the EDEK and EZ Key Version Name values have changed:
$ hdfs crypto âgetFileEncryptionInfo âpath /ez/f
{cipherSuite: {name: AES/CTR/NoPadding, algorithmBlockSize: 16}. cryptoProtocolVersion:
CryptoProtocolVersion{description=âEncryption zonesâ, version=2, unknownValue=null}, edek: 373c0c2e919c27e58c1c343f54233cbd,
iv: d129c913c8a34cde6371ec95edfb7337, keyName: key1, ezKeyVersionName: ZMHfRoGKeXXgf0QzCX8q16NczIw2sq0rWRTOHS3YjCz }





Managing Re-encryption Operations

This section includes information that can help you manage various facets of the EDEK re-encryption process.

Cancelling Re-encryption
Only users with the HDFS Superuser privilege can cancel the EDEK re-encryption after the operation has started.
To cancel a re-encryption:

hadoop crypto -reencryptZone cancel -path <zone>


Rolling Keys During a Re-encryption Operation
While it is not recommended, it is possible to roll the encryption zone key version on the KMS while a re-encryption of that encryption zone is already in progress
in the NameNode. The re-encryption is guaranteed to complete with all DEKs re-encrypted, with a key version equal to or later than the encryption zone key version when the re-encryption command was
submitted. This means that, if initially the key version is rolled from v0 to v1, then a re-encryption command was submitted. If later on the KMS the key version is rolled again to v2, then all EDEKs
will be at least re-encrypted to v1. To ensure that all EDEKs are re-encrypted to v2, submit another re-encryption command for the encryption zone.
Rolling keys during re-encryption is not recommended because of the potential negative impact on key management operations. Due to the asynchronous nature of re-encryption, there is no
guarantee of when, exactly, the rolled encryption keys will take effect. Re-encryption can only guarantee that all EDEKs are re-encrypted at least on the EZ key version that existed when the
re-encryption command is issued.


Throttling Re-encryption Operations
With the default operation settings, you will not typically need to throttle re-encryption operations. However, in cases of excessive performance impact due to the re-encryption of large
numbers of files, advanced users have the option of throttling the operation so that the impact on the HDFS NameNode and KT KMS are minimized.
Specifically, you can throttle the operation to control the rate of the following:

The number of EDEKs that the NameNode should send to the KMS to re-encrypt in a batch (dfs.namenode.reencrypt.batch.size)
The number of threads in the NameNode that can run concurrently to contact the KMS. (dfs.namenode.reencrypt.edek.threads)
Percentage of time the NameNode read-lock should be held by the re-encryption thread (dfs.namenode.reencrypt.throttle.limit.handler.ratio)
Percentage of time the NameNode write-lock should be held by the re-encryption thread (dfs.namenode.reencrypt.throttle.limit.updater.ratio)


You can monitor the HDFS NameNode heap and CPU usage from Cloudera Manager.
