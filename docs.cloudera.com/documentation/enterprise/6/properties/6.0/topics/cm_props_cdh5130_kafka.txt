Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Kafka Brokers falls below the warning threshold. The check is unhealthy if the total percentage of "Healthy" and "Concerning" Kafka Brokers falls below the critical threshold.

Warning: 94.99 %, Critical: 49.99 %
KAFKA_KAFKA_BROKER_healthy_thresholds
false


Service Triggers
The configured triggers for this service. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific service.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the followig JSON formatted trigger fires if there are more than 10 DataNodes with more than 500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType = DataNode and last(fd_open) > 500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 10, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

non-existent topic automatically create the topic with the default replication factor and number of partitions.
auto.create.topics.enable
true
auto.create.topics.enable
false


Enable Automatic Leader Rebalancing
If automatic leader rebalancing is enabled, the controller tries to balance leadership for partitions among the brokers by
periodically returning leadership for each partition to the preferred replica, if it is available.
auto.leader.rebalance.enable
true
auto.leader.rebalance.enable
false


Enable Controlled Shutdown
Enables controlled shutdown of the broker. If enabled, the broker moves all leaders on it to other brokers before shutting itself
down. This reduces the unavailability window during shutdown.
controlled.shutdown.enable
true
controlled.shutdown.enable
false


Controlled Shutdown Maximum Attempts
Number of unsuccessful controlled shutdown attempts before executing an unclean shutdown. For example, the default value of 3 means
that the system will attempt a controlled shutdown 3 times before executing an unclean shutdown.

problems.
log.cleaner.dedupe.buffer.size
128 MiB
log.cleaner.dedupe.buffer.size
false


Log Compaction Delete Record Retention Time
The amount of time to retain delete messages for log compacted topics. Once a consumer has seen an original message you need to
ensure it also sees the delete message. If you removed the delete message too quickly, this might not happen. As a result there is a configurable delete retention time.
log.cleaner.delete.retention.ms

log.cleaner.delete.retention.ms
false


Enable Log Compaction
Enables the log cleaner to compact topics with cleanup.policy=compact on this cluster.
log.cleaner.enable
true
log.cleaner.enable
false


Log Cleaner Clean Ratio
Controls how frequently the log cleaner will attempt to clean the log. This ratio bounds the maximum space wasted in the log by
duplicates. For example, at 0.5 at most 50% of the log could be duplicates. A higher ratio will mean fewer, more efficient cleanings but will mean more wasted space in the log.

Number of Log Cleaner Threads
The number of background threads to use for log cleaning.
log.cleaner.threads
1
log.cleaner.threads
false


Log Flush Message Interval
The number of messages written to a log partition before triggering an fsync on the log. Setting this lower syncs data to disk more
often, but has a major impact on performance. Cloudera recommends use of replication for durability rather than depending on single-server fsync; however, this setting can be used to be extra
certain. If used in conjunction with log.flush.interval.ms, the log is flushed when either criteria is met.
log.flush.interval.messages

log.flush.interval.messages
false


Log Flush Time Interval
The maximum time between fsync calls on the log. If used in conjuction with log.flush.interval.messages, the log is flushed when
either criteria is met.

log.flush.scheduler.interval.ms
false


Maximum Message Size
The maximum size of a message that the server can receive. It is important that this property be in sync with the maximum fetch size
the consumers use, or else an unruly producer could publish messages too large for consumers to consume.

recommends using a higher setting for production (for example, 100-200).
offsets.topic.num.partitions
50
offsets.topic.num.partitions
false


Offset Commit Topic Replication Factor
The replication factor for the offset commit topic. A higher setting is recommended in order to ensure higher availability (for
example, 3 or 4) . If the offsets topic is created when there are fewer brokers than the replication factor, then the offsets topic is created with fewer replicas.
offsets.topic.replication.factor
3

replica.fetch.max.bytes
false


Allowed Replica Message Lag
If a replica falls more than this number of messages behind the leader, the leader removes the follower from the ISR and treats it
as dead. This property is deprecated in Kafka 1.4.0; higher versions use only replica.lag.time.max.ms.
replica.lag.max.messages
4000
replica.lag.max.messages
