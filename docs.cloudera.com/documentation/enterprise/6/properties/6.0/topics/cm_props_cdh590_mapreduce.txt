Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2,
exceptiontype: .* , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: WARN ]
log_event_whitelist
false


Process Swap Memory Thresholds
The health test thresholds on the swap memory usage of the process.

Warning: Any, Critical: Never
process_swap_memory_thresholds
false


Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

configuration for the role.

Warning: Never, Critical: Any

I/O Sort Factor
The number of streams to merge at the same time while sorting files. That is, the number of sort heads to use during the merge sort
on the reducer side. This determines the number of open file handles. Merging more files in parallel reduces merge sort iterations and improves run time by eliminating disk I/O. Note that merging
more files in parallel uses more memory. If 'io.sort.factor' is set too high or the maximum JVM heap is set too low, excessive garbage collection will occur. The Hadoop default is 10, but Cloudera
recommends a higher value. Will be part of generated client configuration.

I/O Sort Memory Buffer (MiB)
The total amount of memory buffer, in megabytes, to use while sorting files. Note that this memory comes out of the user JVM heap
size (meaning total user JVM heap - this amount of memory = total user usable heap space. Note that Cloudera's default differs from Hadoop's default; Cloudera uses a bigger buffer by default because
modern machines often have more RAM. The smallest value across all TaskTrackers will be part of generated client configuration.

I/O Sort Spill Percent
The soft limit in either the buffer or record collection buffers. When this limit is reached, a thread will begin to spill the
contents to disk in the background. Note that this does not imply any chunking of data to the spill. A value less than 0.5 is not recommended. The syntax is in decimal units; the default is 80% and

Capacity Scheduler Configuration Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)

<name>mapred.capacity-scheduler.queue.default.maximum-capacity</name> <value>-1</value> <description> maximum-capacity defines a limit beyond which a queue cannot use
the capacity of the cluster. This provides a means to limit how much excess capacity a queue can use. By default, there is no limit. The maximum-capacity of a queue can only be greater than or equal
to its minimum capacity. Default value of -1 implies a queue can use complete capacity of the cluster. This property could be to curtail certain jobs which are long running in nature from occupying
more than a certain percentage of the cluster, which in the absence of pre-emption, could lead to capacity guarantees of other queues being affected. One important thing to note is that
maximum-capacity is a percentage , so based on the cluster's capacity the max capacity would change. So if large no of nodes or racks get added to the cluster , max Capacity in absolute terms would
increase accordingly. </description> </property> <property> <name>mapred.capacity-scheduler.queue.default.supports-priority</name> <value>false</value>

resources allocated to a user at any given time, if there is competition for them. This user limit can vary between a minimum and maximum value. The former depends on the number of users who have
submitted jobs, and the latter is set to this property value. For example, suppose the value of this property is 25. If two users have submitted jobs to a queue, no single user can use more than 50%
of the queue resources. If a third user submits a job, no single user can use more than 33% of the queue resources. With 4 or more users, no user can use more than 25% of the queue's resources. A
value of 100 implies no user limits are imposed. </description> </property> <property>

Fair Scheduler Pool Name Property
Specify the 'jobconf' property that determines the pool that a job belongs in. The default is 'user.name' (one pool for each user).
If you want to use MapReduce's "queue" system to enable authorization for the Fair Scheduler, specify 'mapred.job.queue.name'. This requires adding the Fair Scheduler's pool names to
'mapred.queue.names' and users to submit jobs using the 'mapred.job.queue.name' property instead of the 'mapred.fairscheduler.pool' property. Note that 'mapred.fairscheduler.poolnameproperty' is used

Fair Scheduler Preemption
Enables Fair Scheduler preemption. If a pool's minimum share is not met for some period of time, the Fair Scheduler optionally
supports preemption of jobs in other pools. The pool will be allowed to kill tasks from other pools to make room to run. Preemption can be used to guarantee that production jobs are not starved while
also allowing the Hadoop cluster to be used for experimental and research jobs. In addition, a pool can also be allowed to preempt tasks if it is below half of its fair share for a configurable
timeout (generally set larger than the minimum share preemption timeout). When choosing tasks to kill, the Fair Scheduler picks the most-recently launched tasks from over-allocated jobs, to minimize
wasted computation. Preemption does not cause the preempted jobs to fail because Hadoop jobs tolerate losing tasks; it only makes them take longer to finish.

WeightAdjuster interface. There is currently one example implementation - NewJobWeightBooster, which increases the weight of jobs for their first 5 minutes to let short jobs finish faster. To use it,
set the weightadjuster property to the full classname, org.apache.hadoop.mapred.NewJobWeightBooster. NewJobWeightBooster itself provides two parameters for setting the duration and boost factor.
mapred.newjobweightbooster.factor: Factor by which new jobs weight should be boosted. Default is 3. mapred.newjobweightbooster.duration: Boost duration in milliseconds. Default is 300000 for 5
minutes.

Time Limit of JobTracker Job Status Persistence
The number of hours job status information is persisted in HDFS. The job status information will be available after it drops out of
the memory queue and between JobTracker restarts. If zero is specified for this property, the job status information is not persisted.

MapReduce Queue Names
Comma separated list of queues configured for the JobTracker in this service instance. Jobs are added to queues. Schedulers can
configure different scheduling properties for the queues specified in this list. You can configure queue properties that are common to all schedulers, by using the naming convention
'mapred.queue.$QUEUE-NAME.$PROPERTY-NAME' in this property (for example, 'mapred.queue.default.submit-job-acl'). The number of queues configured in this property depends on the type of scheduler
specified in 'mapred.jobtracker.taskScheduler'. The default scheduler JobQueueTaskScheduler supports a single queue only. Before adding more queues to this property, make sure that the scheduler in
'mapred.jobtracker.taskScheduler' supports multiple queues. This property can also be populated with the Fair Scheduler's pool names to enable authorization of the Fair Scheduler. This requires
setting 'mapred.fairscheduler.poolnameproperty' to 'mapred.job.queue.name' and users to submit jobs to the right queue by setting the 'mapred.job.queue.name' property in their jobs.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content:
.* is deprecated. Instead, use .* , alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Use .* instead , alert: false, rate: 0, exceptiontype: java.io.IOException , alert: false, rate:

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Service Triggers
The configured triggers for this service. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific service.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the followig JSON formatted trigger fires if there are more than 10 DataNodes with more than 500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType = DataNode and last(fd_open) > 500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 10, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

I/O Sort Factor (Client Override)
The number of streams to merge at once while sorting files. That is, the number of sort heads to use during the merge sort on the
reducer side. This determines the number of open file handles. Merging more files in parallel reduces merge sort iterations and improves run time by eliminating disk I/O. Note that merging more files
in parallel uses more memory. If 'io.sort.factor' is set too high or the maximum JVM heap is set too low, excessive garbage collection will occur. The Hadoop default is 10, but Cloudera recommends a
higher value. Will override value in client configuration.
io.sort.factor

override_io_sort_factor
false


I/O Sort Memory Buffer (MiB) (Client Override)
The total amount of memory buffer, in megabytes, to use while sorting files. Note that this memory comes out of the user JVM heap
size (meaning total user JVM heap - this amount of memory = total user usable heap space. Note that Cloudera's default differs from Hadoop's default; Cloudera uses a bigger buffer by default because
modern machines often have more RAM. Will override value in client configuration.
io.sort.mb

override_io_sort_mb

I/O Sort Record Percent (Client Override)
The percentage of 'io.sort.mb' dedicated to tracking record boundaries. If this value is represented as 'r', and 'io.sort.mb' is
represented as 'x', then the maximum number of records collected before the collection thread must block is equal to (r * x) / 4. The syntax is in decimal units; the default is 5% and is formatted
0.05. Will override value in client configuration.
io.sort.record.percent

override_io_sort_record_percent

I/O Sort Spill Percent (Client Override)
The soft limit in either the buffer or record collection buffers. When this limit is reached, a thread will begin to spill the
contents to disk in the background. Note that this does not imply any chunking of data to the spill. A value less than 0.5 is not recommended. The syntax is in decimal units; the default is 80% and
is formatted 0.8. Will override value in client configuration.

MapReduce Child Java Opts Base (Client Override)
Java opts for the TaskTracker child processes. The following symbol, if present, will be interpolated: @taskid@ is replaced by
current TaskID. Any other occurrences of '@' will go unchanged. For example, to enable verbose gc logging to a file named for the taskid in /tmp pass a value of: "-verbose:gc
-Xloggc:/tmp/@taskid@.gc". The configuration variable 'mapred.child.ulimit' can be used to control the maximum virtual memory of the child processes. Note that unlike Hadoop, Cloudera Manager
separates the child options into this setting and a separate setting just for the maximum heap size. Will override value in client configuration.

Default Number of Parallel Transfers During Shuffle (Client Override)
The default number of parallel transfers run by reduce during the copy (shuffle) phase. This number is calculated by the following
formula: min(number_of_nodes, n * min(number_of_cores_per_node, number_of_spindles_per_node)) where the n represents how many streams you want to run per core/spindle. A value of 10 for n is
