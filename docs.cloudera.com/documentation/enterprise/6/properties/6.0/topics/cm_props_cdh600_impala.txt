Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Enable Audit Collection
Enable collection of audit events from the service's roles.
navigator.audit.enabled
true

Audit Event Filter
Event filters are defined in a JSON object like the following: { "defaultAction" : ("accept", "discard"),
"rules" : [ { "action" : ("accept", "discard"), "fields" : [ { "name" : "fieldName", "match" : "regex" } ] } ] } A filter has a default action and a list of rules, in order of precedence. Each
rule defines an action, and a list of fields to match against the audit event. A rule is "accepted" if all the listed field entries match the audit event. At that point, the action declared by the
rule is taken. If no rules match the event, the default action is taken. Actions default to "accept" if not defined in the JSON object. The following is the list of fields that can be filtered for
Impala events:

userName: the user performing the action.
ipAddress: the IP from where the request originated.
operation: the Impala operation being performed.
databaseName: the databaseName for the operation.
tableName: the tableName for the operation.


navigator.event.filter

navigator_audit_event_filter
false


Audit Queue Policy
Action to take when the audit event queue is full. Drop the event or shutdown the affected process.
navigator.batch.queue_policy
DROP
navigator_audit_queue_policy
false


Audit Event Tracker
Configures the rules for event tracking and coalescing. This feature is used to define equivalency between different audit events.
When events match, according to a set of configurable parameters, only one entry in the audit list is generated for all the matching events. Tracking works by keeping a reference to events when they
first appear, and comparing other incoming events against the "tracked" events according to the rules defined here. Event trackers are defined in a JSON object like the following: { "timeToLive" : [integer], "fields" : [ { "type" : [string], "name" : [string] } ] } Where:

timeToLive: maximum amount of time an event will be tracked, in milliseconds. Must be provided. This defines how long, since it's first seen, an event will be tracked. A value of 0
disables tracking.
fields: list of fields to compare when matching events against tracked events.

Each field has an evaluator type associated with it. The evaluator defines how the field data is to be compared. The following evaluators are available:

value: uses the field value for comparison.
userName: treats the field value as a userName, and ignores any host-specific data. This is useful for environment using Kerberos, so that only the principal name and realm are
compared.

The following is the list of fields that can be used to compare Impala events:

operation: the Impala operation being performed.
username: the user performing the action.
ipAddress: the IP from where the request originated.
allowed: whether the operation was allowed or denied.
databaseName: the database affected by the operation.
tableName: the table affected by the operation.
objectType: the type of object affected by the operation.
privilege: the privilege associated with the operation.

Impala Query Aggregates
Controls the aggregate metrics generated for Impala queries. The structure is a JSON list of the attributes to aggregate and the
entities to aggregate to. For example, if the attributeName is 'hdfs_bytes_read' and the aggregationTargets is ['USER'] then the Service Monitor will create the metric
'impala_query_hdfs_bytes_read_rate' and, every ten minutes, will record the total hdfs bytes read for each user across all their Impala queries. By default it will also record the number of queries
issues ('num_impala_queries_rate') for both users and pool. For a full list of the supported attributes see the Impala search page. Note that the valid aggregation targets are USER, YARN_POOL, and
IMPALA (the service), and that these aggregate metrics can be viewed on both the reports and charts search pages.

Service Triggers
The configured triggers for this service. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific service.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the followig JSON formatted trigger fires if there are more than 10 DataNodes with more than 500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType = DataNode and last(fd_open) > 500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 10, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

LDAP BaseDN
This parameter is useful when authenticating against a non-Active Directory server, such as OpenLDAP. When set, this parameter is
used to convert the username into the LDAP Distinguished Name (DN), so that the resulting DN looks like uid=username,this parameter. For example, if this parameter
is set to "ou=People,dc=cloudera,dc=com", and the username passed in is "mike", the resulting authentication passed to the LDAP server look like "uid=mike,ou=People,dc=cloudera,dc=com". This
parameter is mutually exclusive with Active Directory Domain.
ldap_baseDN

ldap_baseDN
false


LDAP Pattern
When set, this parameter allows arbitrary mapping from usernames into a Distinguished Name (DN). The string specified must have a
placeholder named "#UID" inside it, and that #UID is replaced with the username. For example, you could mimic the behavior of LDAP BaseDN by specifying "uid=#UID,ou=People,dc=cloudera,dc=com". When
the username of "mike" comes in, it replaces the #UID and the result is "uid=mike,ou=People,dc=cloudera,dc=com". This option should be used when more control over the DN is needed. This parameter is
mutually exclusive with LDAP Domain and LDAP BaseDN.
ldap_bind_pattern

Active Directory Domain
This parameter is useful when authenticating against an Active Directory server. This value is appended to all usernames before
authenticating against AD. For example, if this parameter is set to "my.domain.com", and the user authenticating is "mike", then "mike@my.domain.com" is passed to AD. If this field is unset, the
username remains unaltered before being passed to AD.
