Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content:
.* is deprecated. Instead, use .* , alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Use .* instead , alert: false, rate: 0, exceptiontype: java.io.IOException , alert: false, rate:

Available Space Policy Balanced Preference
Only used when the DataNode Volume Choosing Policy is set to Available Space. Controls what percentage of new block allocations will
be sent to volumes with more available disk space than others. This setting should be in the range 0.0 - 1.0, though in practice 0.5 - 1.0, since there should be no reason to prefer that volumes with

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

DataNode Data Directory
Comma-delimited list of directories on the local file system where the DataNode stores HDFS block data. Typical values are
/data/N/dfs/dn for N = 1, 2, 3.... In CDH 5.7 and higher, these directories can be optionally tagged with their storage types, for example, [SSD]/data/1/dns/dn. HDFS supports the following storage
types: [DISK], [SSD], [ARCHIVE], [RAM_DISK]. The default storage type of a directory will be [DISK] if it does not have a storage type tagged explicitly. These directories should be mounted using the
noatime option, and the disks should be configured using JBOD. RAID is not recommended. Warning: Be very careful when modifying this property. Removing or changing entries can
result in data loss. To hot swap drives in CDH 5.4 and higher, override the value of this property for the specific DataNode role instance that has the drive to be hot-swapped; do not modify
the property value in the role group. See Configuring Hot Swap for DataNodes for more information.

Enable purging cache after reads
In some workloads, the data read from HDFS is known to be significantly large enough that it is unlikely to be useful to cache it in
the operating system buffer cache. In this case, the DataNode may be configured to automatically purge all data from the buffer cache after it is delivered to the client. This may improve performance
for some workloads by freeing buffer cache spare usage for more cacheable data. This behavior will always be disabled for workloads that read only short sections of a block (e.g HBase random-IO
workloads). This property is supported in CDH3u3 or later deployments.

Enable purging cache after writes
In some workloads, the data written to HDFS is known to be significantly large enough that it is unlikely to be useful to cache it

Number of read ahead bytes
While reading block files, the DataNode can use the posix_fadvise system call to explicitly page data into the operating system
buffer cache ahead of the current reader's position. This can improve performance especially when disks are highly contended. This configuration specifies the number of bytes ahead of the current
read position which the DataNode will attempt to read ahead. A value of 0 disables this feature. This property is supported in CDH3u3 or later deployments.
dfs.datanode.readahead.bytes

dfs_datanode_readahead_bytes

Enable immediate enqueuing of data to disk after writes
If this configuration is enabled, the DataNode will instruct the operating system to enqueue all written data to the disk
immediately after it is written. This differs from the usual OS policy which may wait for up to 30 seconds before triggering writeback. This may improve performance for some workloads by smoothing
the IO profile for data written to disk. This property is supported in CDH3u3 or later deployments.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2,
exceptiontype: .* , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: WARN ]

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2,
exceptiontype: .* , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: WARN ]

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2,

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for

Temporary Dump Directory
NFS clients often reorder writes. As a result, sequential writes can arrive at the NFS Gateway in random order. This directory is
used to temporarily save out-of-order writes before writing to HDFS. For each file, the out-of-order writes are dumped after they are accumulated to exceed certain threshold (e.g., 1MB) in memory.
Please make sure this directory has enough space. For example, if the application uploads 10 files with each having 100MB, it is recommended that this directory have roughly 1GB of space in case
write reorder happens (in the worst case) to every file.

Allowed Hosts and Privileges
By default, NFS Gateway exported directories can be mounted by any client. For better access control, update this property with a
list of host names and access privileges separated by whitespace characters. Host name format can be a single host, a Java regular expression, or an IPv4 address. The access privilege uses
rw to specify readwrite and ro to specify readonly access. If the access privilege is not provided, the default is read-only. Examples of
host name format and access privilege: "192.168.0.0/22 rw", "host.*.example.com", "host1.test.org ro".

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.

Audit Event Filter
Event filters are defined in a JSON object like the following: { "defaultAction" : ("accept", "discard"),
"rules" : [ { "action" : ("accept", "discard"), "fields" : [ { "name" : "fieldName", "match" : "regex" } ] } ] } A filter has a default action and a list of rules, in order of precedence. Each
rule defines an action, and a list of fields to match against the audit event. A rule is "accepted" if all the listed field entries match the audit event. At that point, the action declared by the
rule is taken. If no rules match the event, the default action is taken. Actions default to "accept" if not defined in the JSON object. The following is the list of fields that can be filtered for
HDFS events:

username: the user performing the action.
ipAddress: the IP from where the request originated.
command: the HDFS operation being performed.
src: the source path for the operation.
dest: the destination path for the operation.
permissions: the permissions associated with the operation.

The default HDFS audit event filter accepts all denied access, delete and rename events, and discards events that affects files in any of the staging directories (Hive, Spark, Impala), events that
affect files in /tmp directory, events that affect files in Cloudera Hive Canary directory, events generated by the internal Cloudera and Hadoop users (cloudera-scm, dr.who, hbase, hive, impala,
mapred, solr, and spark), and 'ls' actions performed by the hdfs user.

Audit Event Tracker
Configures the rules for event tracking and coalescing. This feature is used to define equivalency between different audit events.
When events match, according to a set of configurable parameters, only one entry in the audit list is generated for all the matching events. Tracking works by keeping a reference to events when they
first appear, and comparing other incoming events against the "tracked" events according to the rules defined here. Event trackers are defined in a JSON object like the following: { "timeToLive" : [integer], "fields" : [ { "type" : [string], "name" : [string] } ] } Where:

timeToLive: maximum amount of time an event will be tracked, in milliseconds. Must be provided. This defines how long, since it's first seen, an event will be tracked. A value of 0
disables tracking.
fields: list of fields to compare when matching events against tracked events.

Each field has an evaluator type associated with it. The evaluator defines how the field data is to be compared. The following evaluators are available:

value: uses the field value for comparison.
username: treats the field value as a user name, and ignores any host-specific data. This is useful for environment using Kerberos, so that only the principal name and realm are
compared.

The following is the list of fields that can be used to compare HDFS events:

operation: the HDFS operation being performed.
username: the user performing the action.
ipAddress: the IP from where the request originated.
allowed: whether the operation was allowed or denied.
src: the source path for the operation.
dest: the destination path for the operation.
permissions: the permissions associated with the operation.

The default event tracker for HDFS services defines equality by comparing the username, operation, and source path of the events.

Service Triggers
The configured triggers for this service. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific service.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the followig JSON formatted trigger fires if there are more than 10 DataNodes with more than 500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType = DataNode and last(fd_open) > 500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 10, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

DataNode Data Transfer Protection
SASL protection mode for secured connections to the DataNodes when reading or writing data. Value is the type of SASL protection to
be used for secured connections to the DataNode when reading or writing block data. Possible values are 'authentication', 'integrity' and 'privacy'. authentication means
authentication only and no integrity or privacy; integrity implies that only authentication and integrity are enabled; and privacy implies
all of authentication, integrity and privacy are enabled. If "Enable Data Transfer Encryption" is set to true, then it supersedes the setting for this parameter and enforces that all connections must
use a specialized encrypted SASL handshake. This property is ignored for connections to a DataNode listening on a privileged port. In this case, it is assumed that the use of a privileged port
establishes sufficient trust.
dfs.data.transfer.protection

dfs_data_transfer_protection
false


Enable Data Transfer Encryption
Enable encryption of data transfer between DataNodes and clients, and among DataNodes. When enabled, block data that is
read/written from/to HDFS will be encrypted on the wire. For effective data transfer protection, enable Kerberos authentication and pick privacy for "Hadoop RPC Protection".

Data Transfer Encryption Algorithm
Algorithm to encrypt data transfer between DataNodes and clients, and among DataNodes. If 3des or rc4 are chosen, the entire
communication is encrypted with that algorithm. In CDH 5.4 and higher, if AES/CTR/NoPadding is chosen, 3des is used for the initial key exchange, and then AES/CTR/NoPadding is used for the transfer
of data. This is the most secure option, and is recommended for clusters running CDH 5.4 or higher. It also requires that the "openssl-devel" package be installed on all machines in the cluster. When
this parameter is changed, a full, nonrolling restart of the cluster must be performed.

redaction rule. You can choose one of the preconfigured rules or add a custom rule. When specifying a custom rule, the Search field should contain a regular expression that will be matched against
the data. If a match is found, it is replaced by the contents of the Replace field.Trigger is an optional field. It can be used to specify a simple string to be searched in the data. If the string is
found, the redactor attempts to find a match for the Search regex. If no trigger is specified, redaction occurs by matching the Search regular expression. Use the Trigger field to enhance
performance: simple string matching is faster than regular expression matching.Test your rules by entering sample text into the Test Redaction Rules text box and clicking Test Redaction. If no rules
match, the text you entered is returned unchanged.
