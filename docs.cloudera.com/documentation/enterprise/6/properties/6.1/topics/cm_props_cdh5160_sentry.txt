Heap Dump Directory
Path to directory where heap dumps are generated when java.lang.OutOfMemoryError error is thrown. This directory is automatically
created if it does not exist. If this directory already exists, role user must have write access to this directory. If this directory is shared among multiple roles, it should have 1777 permissions.
The heap dump files are created with 600 permissions and are owned by the role user. The amount of free space in this directory should be greater than the maximum Java Process heap size configured
for this role.

Enable Metric Collection
Cloudera Manager agent monitors each service and each of its role by publishing metrics to the Cloudera Manager Service Monitor.
Setting it to false will stop Cloudera Manager agent from publishing any metric for corresponding service/roles. This is usually helpful for services that generate large amount of metrics which
Service Monitor is not able to process.

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

experiences I/O contention. Must be between 100 and 1000. Defaults to 1000 for processes not managed by Cloudera Manager.

Cgroup Memory Hard Limit
Hard memory limit to assign to this role, enforced by the Linux kernel. When the limit is reached, the kernel will reclaim pages
charged to the process. If reclaiming fails, the kernel may kill the process. Both anonymous as well as page cache pages contribute to the limit. Use a value of -1 B to specify no limit. By default
processes not managed by Cloudera Manager will have no limit.

Cgroup Memory Soft Limit
Soft memory limit to assign to this role, enforced by the Linux kernel. When the limit is reached, the kernel will reclaim pages
charged to the process if and only if the host is facing memory pressure. If reclaiming fails, the kernel may kill the process. Both anonymous as well as page cache pages contribute to the limit. Use
a value of -1 B to specify no limit. By default processes not managed by Cloudera Manager will have no limit.

Enable Audit Collection

Audit Event Filter
Event filters are defined in a JSON object like the following: { "defaultAction" : ("accept", "discard"),
"rules" : [ { "action" : ("accept", "discard"), "fields" : [ { "name" : "fieldName", "match" : "regex" } ] } ] } A filter has a default action and a list of rules, in order of precedence. Each
rule defines an action, and a list of fields to match against the audit event. A rule is "accepted" if all the listed field entries match the audit event. At that point, the action declared by the
rule is taken. If no rules match the event, the default action is taken. Actions default to "accept" if not defined in the JSON object. The following is the list of fields that can be filtered for
Sentry events:

operation: the Sentry operation being performed.
username: the user performing the action.
ipAddress: the IP from where the request originated.
allowed: whether the operation was allowed or denied.


navigator.event.filter

navigator_audit_event_filter
false


Audit Queue Policy
Action to take when the audit event queue is full. Drop the event or shutdown the affected process.
navigator.batch.queue_policy
DROP
navigator_audit_queue_policy
false


Audit Event Tracker
Configures the rules for event tracking and coalescing. This feature is used to define equivalency between different audit events.
When events match, according to a set of configurable parameters, only one entry in the audit list is generated for all the matching events. Tracking works by keeping a reference to events when they
first appear, and comparing other incoming events against the "tracked" events according to the rules defined here. Event trackers are defined in a JSON object like the following: { "timeToLive" : [integer], "fields" : [ { "type" : [string], "name" : [string] } ] } Where:

timeToLive: maximum amount of time an event will be tracked, in milliseconds. Must be provided. This defines how long, since it's first seen, an event will be tracked. A value of 0
disables tracking.
fields: list of fields to compare when matching events against tracked events.

Each field has an evaluator type associated with it. The evaluator defines how the field data is to be compared. The following evaluators are available:

value: uses the field value for comparison.
userName: treats the field value as a userName, and ignores any host-specific data. This is useful for environment using Kerberos, so that only the principal name and realm are
compared.

The following is the list of fields that can be used to compare Sentry events:

operation: the Sentry operation being performed.
username: the user performing the action.
ipAddress: the IP from where the request originated.
allowed: whether the operation was allowed or denied.

Healthy Sentry Server Monitoring Thresholds
The health test thresholds of the overall Sentry Server health. The check returns "Concerning" health if the percentage of "Healthy"
Sentry Servers falls below the warning threshold. The check is unhealthy if the total percentage of "Healthy" and "Concerning" Sentry Servers falls below the critical threshold.

Warning: 99.0 %, Critical: 51.0 %
sentry_sentry_server_healthy_thresholds
false


Service Triggers
The configured triggers for this service. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific service.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the followig JSON formatted trigger fires if there are more than 10 DataNodes with more than 500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType = DataNode and last(fd_open) > 500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 10, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.
