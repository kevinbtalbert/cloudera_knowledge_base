Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Instead, use .* , alert: false, rate: 0,
threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Use .* instead , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2, exceptiontype: .* , alert: false,
rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: WARN ]
log_event_whitelist
false


Process Swap Memory Thresholds
The health test thresholds on the swap memory usage of the process.

Warning: Any, Critical: Never
process_swap_memory_thresholds
false


Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2,
exceptiontype: .* , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: WARN ]

Warning: Any, Critical: Never

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2,
exceptiontype: .* , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: WARN ]
log_event_whitelist
false


Process Swap Memory Thresholds
The health test thresholds on the swap memory usage of the process.

Warning: Any, Critical: Never
process_swap_memory_thresholds
false


Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Alert On Transitions Out of Alerting Health
If set, the health events for transitions out of an alertable health level will also be considered an alert. For example, consider
an entity that is configured to alert when it has bad health. If that entity's health becomes bad, an alert will be generated. If this setting is enabled, an alert will also be generated when it
returns to good health. If this setting is disabled, then no alert will be generated when it returns to good health. Note that an entity must have enable_alerts set to true for health alerts to be

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Instead, use .* , alert: false, rate: 0,
threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Use .* instead , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2, exceptiontype: .* , alert: false,
rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: WARN ]

false


Process Swap Memory Thresholds
The health test thresholds on the swap memory usage of the process.

Warning: Any, Critical: Never
process_swap_memory_thresholds

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Time-Series Storage
The approximate amount of disk space dedicated to storing time series and health data. Once the store has reached its maximum
size, older data is deleted to make room for newer data. The disk usage is approximate because data is deleted only when the limit is reached.Note that Cloudera Manager stores time-series data at a
number of different data granularities, and these granularities have different effective retention periods. Specifically, Cloudera Manager stores metric data as both raw data points and ten-minutely,
hourly, six-hourly, daily, and weekly summary data points. Raw data consumes the bulk of the allocated storage space, weekly summaries the least. As such, raw data is retained for the shortest amount
of time, while weekly summary points are unlikely to ever be deleted.See the "Storage" tab on the 'Host Monitor' -> 'Charts Library' -> 'Host Monitor Storgae' page for more information on how
space is consumed within the Host Monitor. This tab also shows information about the amount of data retained and time window covered by each data granularity.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role
loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a
log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Instead, use .* , alert: false, rate: 0,
threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Use .* instead , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2, exceptiontype: .* , alert: false,
rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: WARN ]

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Audit Event Filter
Event filters are defined in a JSON object like the following: { "defaultAction" : ("accept", "discard"),
"rules" : [ { "action" : ("accept", "discard"), "fields" : [ { "name" : "fieldName", "match" : "regex" } ] } ] } A filter has a default action and a list of rules, in order of precedence. Each
rule defines an action, and a list of fields to match against the audit event. A rule is "accepted" if all the listed field entries match the audit event. At that point, the action declared by the
rule is taken. If no rules match the event, the default action is taken. Actions default to "accept" if not defined in the JSON object. The following is the list of fields that can be filtered for
NAVMS events:

operation: Navigator operation performed e.g. auditReport, savedSearch etc.
username: the user performing the action.
ipAddress: the IP from where the request originated.
allowed: whether the operation was allowed or denied.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role
loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a
log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Instead, use .* , alert: false, rate: 0,
threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Use .* instead , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2, exceptiontype: .* , alert: false,

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Extra Space Ratio for Indexing
Reports Manager uses an array to store HDFS directory tree during indexing. The size of this array is 3 * number of filesystem
objects in HDFS * (1 + extra space ratio). Increasing this ratio allows Reports Manager to create the directory tree faster, but consumes more memory. Also, extra space ratio must be set to a small
enough value so that size of the array is below the maximum allowed in Java, which is 2^31 - 1.

Heap Dump Directory
Path to directory where heap dumps are generated when java.lang.OutOfMemoryError error is thrown. This directory is automatically
created if it does not exist. If this directory already exists, role user must have write access to this directory. If this directory is shared among multiple roles, it should have 1777 permissions.
The heap dump files are created with 600 permissions and are owned by the role user. The amount of free space in this directory should be greater than the maximum Java Process heap size configured

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role
loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a
log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role
loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a
log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN,
content: .* is deprecated. Instead, use .* , alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Use .* instead , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2, exceptiontype: .* , alert:

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the

Time-Series Storage
The approximate amount of disk space dedicated to storing time series and health data. Once the store has reached its maximum
size, older data is deleted to make room for newer data. The disk usage is approximate because data is deleted only when the limit is reached.Note that Cloudera Manager stores time-series data at a
number of different data granularities, and these granularities have different effective retention periods. Specifically, Cloudera Manager stores metric data as both raw data points and ten-minutely,
hourly, six-hourly, daily, and weekly summary data points. Raw data consumes the bulk of the allocated storage space, weekly summaries the least. As such, raw data is retained for the shortest amount
of time, while weekly summary points are unlikely to ever be deleted.See the "Storage" tab on the 'Service Monitor' -> 'Charts Library' -> 'Service Monitor Storgae' page for more information on
how space is consumed within the Service Monitor. This tab also shows information about the amount of data retained and time window covered by each data granularity.

Service Triggers
The configured triggers for this service. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific service.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role
loads. It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a
log message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN,
content: .* is deprecated. Instead, use .* , alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Use .* instead , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2, exceptiontype: .* , alert:
false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: WARN ]

Warning: Any, Critical: Never

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.
