Heap Dump Directory
Path to directory where heap dumps are generated when java.lang.OutOfMemoryError error is thrown. This directory is automatically
created if it does not exist. If this directory already exists, role user must have write access to this directory. If this directory is shared among multiple roles, it should have 1777 permissions.
The heap dump files are created with 600 permissions and are owned by the role user. The amount of free space in this directory should be greater than the maximum Java Process heap size configured
for this role.

Automatically Restart Process
When set, this role's process is automatically (and transparently) restarted in the event of an unexpected failure.

true
process_auto_restart

Enable Metric Collection
Cloudera Manager agent monitors each service and each of its role by publishing metrics to the Cloudera Manager Service Monitor.
Setting it to false will stop Cloudera Manager agent from publishing any metric for corresponding service/roles. This is usually helpful for services that generate large amount of metrics which
Service Monitor is not able to process.

role except client configuration.

These arguments will be passed as part of the Java command line. Commonly, garbage collection flags, PermGen, or extra debugging flags
would be passed here.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content:
.* is deprecated. Instead, use .* , alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Use .* instead , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2, exceptiontype: .* , alert: false,
rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: WARN ]
log_event_whitelist
false


Process Swap Memory Thresholds
The health test thresholds on the swap memory usage of the process. This takes precedence over the host level threshold.

Warning: 200 B, Critical: Never
process_swap_memory_thresholds
false


Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Service Triggers
The configured triggers for this service. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific service.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the followig JSON formatted trigger fires if there are more than 10 DataNodes with more than 500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType = DataNode and last(fd_open) > 500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 10, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
