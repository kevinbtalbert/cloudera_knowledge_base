false


SequenceFile I/O Buffer Size
Size of buffer for read and write operations of SequenceFiles.
io.file.buffer.size
64 KiB
io_file_buffer_size
false


I/O Sort Factor
The number of streams to merge at the same time while sorting files. That is, the number of sort heads to use during the merge sort
on the reducer side. This determines the number of open file handles. Merging more files in parallel reduces merge sort iterations and improves run time by eliminating disk I/O. Note that merging
more files in parallel uses more memory. If 'io.sort.factor' is set too high or the maximum JVM heap is set too low, excessive garbage collection will occur. The Hadoop default is 10, but Cloudera
recommends a higher value. Will be part of generated client configuration.
mapreduce.task.io.sort.factor
64
io_sort_factor
false


I/O Sort Memory Buffer (MiB)
The total amount of memory buffer, in megabytes, to use while sorting files. Note that this memory comes out of the user JVM heap
size (meaning total user JVM heap - this amount of memory = total user usable heap space. Note that Cloudera's default differs from Hadoop's default; Cloudera uses a bigger buffer by default because
modern machines often have more RAM. The smallest value across all TaskTrackers will be part of generated client configuration.
mapreduce.task.io.sort.mb
256 MiB
io_sort_mb
false


I/O Sort Spill Percent
The soft limit in either the buffer or record collection buffers. When this limit is reached, a thread will begin to spill the
contents to disk in the background. Note that this does not imply any chunking of data to the spill. A value less than 0.5 is not recommended. The syntax is in decimal units; the default is 80% and
is formatted 0.8. Will be part of generated client configuration.
mapreduce.map.sort.spill.percent
0.8
io_sort_spill_percent
false


Use Compression on Map Outputs
If enabled, uses compression on the map outputs before they are sent across the network. Will be part of generated client
configuration.
mapreduce.map.output.compress
true
mapred_compress_map_output
false


Compression Codec of MapReduce Map Output
For MapReduce map outputs that are compressed, specify the compression codec to use. Will be part of generated client
configuration.
mapreduce.map.output.compress.codec

mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress.codec
org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.DefaultCodec
mapred_output_compression_codec
false


Compression Type of MapReduce Job Output
For MapReduce job outputs that are compressed as SequenceFiles, you can select one of these compression type options: NONE, RECORD or
BLOCK. Cloudera recommends BLOCK. Will be part of generated client configuration.
mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress.type
BLOCK
mapred_output_compression_type
false


Default Number of Parallel Transfers During Shuffle
The default number of parallel transfers run by reduce during the copy (shuffle) phase. This number is calculated by the following
formula: min(number_of_nodes, n * min(number_of_cores_per_node, number_of_spindles_per_node)) where the n represents how many streams you want to run per core/spindle. A value of 10 for n is

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content:
.* is deprecated. Instead, use .* , alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content: .* is deprecated. Use .* instead , alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 2, exceptiontype: .* , alert: false,

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.
{"alert": false, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "exceptiontype": ".*"}, {"alert": true, "rate": 1, "periodminutes": 1, "threshold":"ERROR"}In this
example, an event generated may not be promoted to alert if an exception is in the ERROR log message, because the first rule with alert = false will match.



version: 0, rules: [ alert: false, rate: 1, periodminutes: 1, threshold: FATAL , alert: false, rate: 0, threshold: WARN, content:

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Rules to Extract Events from Log Files
This file contains the rules that govern how log messages are turned into events by the custom log4j appender that this role loads.
It is in JSON format, and is composed of a list of rules. Every log message is evaluated against each of these rules in turn to decide whether or not to send an event for that message. If a log
message matches multiple rules, the first matching rule is used.. Each rule has some or all of the following fields:

alert - whether or not events generated from this rule should be promoted to alerts. A value of "true" will cause alerts to be generated. If not
specified, the default is "false".
rate (mandatory) - the maximum number of log messages matching this rule that can be sent as events every minute. If more
than rate matching log messages are received in a single minute, the extra messages are ignored. If rate is less than 0, the number of messages per minute is
unlimited.
periodminutes - the number of minutes during which the publisher will only publish rate events or fewer. If not specified,
the default is one minute
threshold - apply this rule only to messages with this log4j severity level or above. An example is "WARN" for warning level messages or higher.
content - match only those messages for which contents match this regular expression.
exceptiontype - match only those messages that are part of an exception message. The exception type must match this regular expression.

Example:

{"alert": false, "rate": 10, "exceptiontype": "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException"}This rule sends events to Cloudera Manager for every
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, up to a maximum of 10 every minute.

Role Triggers
The configured triggers for this role. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific role.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger configured for a DataNode fires if the DataNode has more than 1500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleName=$ROLENAME and last(fd_open) > 1500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Service Triggers
The configured triggers for this service. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific service.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the followig JSON formatted trigger fires if there are more than 10 DataNodes with more than 500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType = DataNode and last(fd_open) > 500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 10, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Controls the aggregate metrics generated for YARN applications. The structure is a JSON list of the attributes to aggregate and the
entities to aggregate to. For example, if the attributeName is 'maps_completed' and the aggregationTargets is ['USER'] then the Service Monitor will create the metric
'yarn_application_maps_completed_rate' and, every ten minutes, will record the total maps completed for each user across all their YARN applications. By default it will also record the number of
applications submitted ('apps_submitted_rate') for both users and pool. For a full list of the supported attributes see the YARN search page. Note that the valid aggregation targets are USER,
YARN_POOL, and YARN (the service), and that these aggregate metrics can be viewed on both the reports and charts search pages.
