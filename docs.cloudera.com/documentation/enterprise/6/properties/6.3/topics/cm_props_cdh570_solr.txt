Enable Audit Collection
Enable collection of audit events from the service's roles.

Audit Event Filter
Event filters are defined in a JSON object like the following: { "defaultAction" : ("accept", "discard"),
"rules" : [ { "action" : ("accept", "discard"), "fields" : [ { "name" : "fieldName", "match" : "regex" } ] } ] } A filter has a default action and a list of rules, in order of precedence. Each
rule defines an action, and a list of fields to match against the audit event. A rule is "accepted" if all the listed field entries match the audit event. At that point, the action declared by the
rule is taken. If no rules match the event, the default action is taken. Actions default to "accept" if not defined in the JSON object. The following is the list of fields that can be filtered for
Solr events:

operation: the Solr operation being performed.
username: the user performing the action.
ipAddress: the IP from where the request originated.
allowed: whether the operation was allowed or denied.


navigator.event.filter

navigator_audit_event_filter
false


Audit Queue Policy
Action to take when the audit event queue is full. Drop the event or shutdown the affected process.
navigator.batch.queue_policy
DROP
navigator_audit_queue_policy
false


Audit Event Tracker
Configures the rules for event tracking and coalescing. This feature is used to define equivalency between different audit events.
When events match, according to a set of configurable parameters, only one entry in the audit list is generated for all the matching events. Tracking works by keeping a reference to events when they
first appear, and comparing other incoming events against the "tracked" events according to the rules defined here. Event trackers are defined in a JSON object like the following: { "timeToLive" : [integer], "fields" : [ { "type" : [string], "name" : [string] } ] } Where:

timeToLive: maximum amount of time an event will be tracked, in milliseconds. Must be provided. This defines how long, since it's first seen, an event will be tracked. A value of 0
disables tracking.
fields: list of fields to compare when matching events against tracked events.

Each field has an evaluator type associated with it. The evaluator defines how the field data is to be compared. The following evaluators are available:

value: uses the field value for comparison.
userName: treats the field value as a userName, and ignores any host-specific data. This is useful for environment using Kerberos, so that only the principal name and realm are
compared.

The following is the list of fields that can be used to compare Solr events:

operation: the Solr operation being performed.
username: the user performing the action.
ipAddress: the IP from where the request originated.
allowed: whether the operation was allowed or denied.

Service Triggers
The configured triggers for this service. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the
health system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific service.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the followig JSON formatted trigger fires if there are more than 10 DataNodes with more than 500 file descriptors opened:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger",
"triggerExpression": "IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType = DataNode and last(fd_open) > 500) DO health:bad", "streamThreshold": 10, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for
more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Enable Sentry Authorization using Policy Files
Use Sentry to enable role-based, fine-grained authorization. This configuration enables Sentry using policy files. To enable Sentry
using Sentry service instead (supported in CDH 5.8 and later), add Sentry service as a dependency to Solr service. Sentry service provides concurrent and secure access to
authorization policy metadata and is recommended for enabling Sentry. Sentry with policy files is supported only on CDH 5 or later deployments. Sentry requires authentication to be turned on
for Solr.

Sentry User to Group Mapping Class
The class to use in Sentry authorization for user to group mapping. Sentry authorization may be configured to use either Hadoop
groups or local groups defined in the policy file. When configured with Hadoop groups, Sentry will ask the HDFS Namenode for group mapping for a given user to determine authorization access.

Active Directory Domain
This parameter is useful when authenticating against an Active Directory server. This value is appended to all usernames before
authenticating against AD. For example, if this parameter is set to "my.domain.com", and the user authenticating is "mike", then "mike@my.domain.com" is passed to AD. If this field is unset, the
username remains unaltered before being passed to AD.

Solr TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore File Location

Solr TLS/SSL Client Trust Store File
The location on disk of the trust store, in .jks format, used to confirm the authenticity of TLS/SSL servers that Solr might
connect to. This is used when Solr is the client in a TLS/SSL connection. This trust store must contain the certificate(s) used to sign the service(s) connected to. If this parameter is not provided,
the default list of well-known certificate authorities is used instead.


solr_https_truststore_file
false


Solr TLS/SSL Client Trust Store Password
The password for the Solr TLS/SSL Certificate Trust Store File. This password is not required to access the trust store; this field
can be left blank. This password provides optional integrity checking of the file. The contents of trust stores are certificates, and certificates are public information.


solr_https_truststore_password
false


LDAP BaseDN
This parameter is useful when authenticating against a non-Active Directory server, such as OpenLDAP. When set, this parameter is
used to convert the username into the LDAP Distinguished Name (DN), so that the resulting DN looks like uid=username,this parameter. For example, if this parameter
is set to "ou=People,dc=cloudera,dc=com", and the username passed in is "mike", the resulting authentication passed to the LDAP server look like "uid=mike,ou=People,dc=cloudera,dc=com". This
parameter is mutually exclusive with Active Directory Domain.

Enable LDAP TLS
If true, attempts to establish a TLS (Transport Layer Security) connection with an LDAP server that was specified with ldap://. Not
required when using an LDAP URL with prefix ldaps://, because that already specifies TLS. This option is also known as "Use StartTLS".

false
solr_ldap_enable_starttls
false


LDAP URL
The URL of the LDAP server. The URL must be prefixed with ldap:// or ldaps://. The URL can optionally specify a custom port, for
example: ldaps://ldap_server.example.com:1636. Note that usernames and passwords will be transmitted in the clear unless either an ldaps:// URL is used, or "Enable LDAP TLS" is turned on (where
available). Also note that encryption must be in use between the client and this service for the same reason.For more detail on the LDAP URL format, see RFC 2255 . A space-separated list of URLs can be entered; in this case the URLs will each be tried in turn until one replies.
