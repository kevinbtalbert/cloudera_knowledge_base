The health check thresholds for the available entropy on the host.

Warning: 100.0, Critical: 50.0
host_available_entropy_thresholds
false


Host Clock Offset Thresholds
The thresholds for the host clock offset health test. The test compares this threshold against the absolute value of the clock
offset reported by the host's NTP service from the 'ntpdc -np' or 'chronyc sources' command. Setting both the warning and critical threshold values to never turns off collection of the clock offset
by the Cloudera Manager Agent. If NTP is not in use, both threshold values should be set to never. Cloudera recommends using NTP for time synchronization of Hadoop clusters.

Warning: 3 second(s), Critical: 10 second(s)

Host Triggers
The configured triggers for this host. This is a JSON-formatted list of triggers. These triggers are evaluated as part as the health
system. Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed. Each trigger has the following fields:

triggerName (mandatory) - The name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific host.
triggerExpression (mandatory) - A tsquery expression representing the trigger.
streamThreshold (optional) - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition
fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire.
enabled (optional) - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger is not evaluated.
expressionEditorConfig (optional) - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the
Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here can lead to inconsistencies.

For example, the following JSON formatted trigger fires if the host wait time exceeds 500 ms:[{"triggerName": "sample-trigger", "triggerExpression": "IF (select await_time
where hostname=$HOSTNAME and last(await_time) > 500ms) DO health:concerning", "streamThreshold": 0, "enabled": "true"}]See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write
triggers using tsquery.The JSON format is evolving and may change and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases.

Parcel Directory
The directory that parcels will be installed into on the host(s). The download 'parcel-cache' directory will be placed next to this
directory on the filesystem. If the 'parcel_dir' variable is set in the Agent's config.ini file, it will override this value.

Memory Overcommit Validation Threshold
Threshold used when validating the allocation of RAM on a host. 0 means all of the memory is reserved for the system. 1 means none
is reserved. Values can range from 0 to 1.

Enable Cgroup-based Resource Management
Enables resource management using control groups (cgroups). When toggled, roles on the host must be restarted for cgroups to be
enabled or disabled. Per-resource controls are found in the configuration pages of role configuration groups and individual roles. Control groups are a feature of the Linux kernel, and support varies
by distribution; see the Cloudera Manager documentation for details.
