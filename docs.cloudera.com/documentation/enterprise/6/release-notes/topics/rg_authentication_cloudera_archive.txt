Authentication to the Cloudera Archive


As of February 1, 2021, access to CDH binaries for production purposes requires authentication. To access the binaries at the locations below, you must first have an active subscription
agreement and obtain a license key file along with the required authentication credentials (username and password).
The license key file and authentication credentials are provided in an email sent to customer accounts from Cloudera when a new license is issued. If you have an existing license with a
Cloudera Enterprise entitlement, you might not have received an email. In this instance you can identify the authentication credentials from the license key file. If you do not have access to the
license key, contact your account representative to receive a copy.
To identify your authentication credentials using your license key file, complete the following steps:

From cloudera.com, log into the cloudera.com account associated with the Cloudera Enterprise license and subscription agreement.
On the Cloudera CDH Download page, select the version that you want to install and click Get It Now!.
Scroll down to the Credentials Generator at the bottom of the page.
In the Generate Credentials text box, copy and paste the text of the “PGP Signed Message” within your license key file and click Get Credentials. The
credentials generator returns your username and password.


Note: Take note of the authentication credentials. You might need them during installation to complete tasks such as configuring a remote or local
package repository.

When you obtain your authentication credentials, use them to form the URLs below, where you can access the Cloudera CDH repository in the Cloudera Archive.
