Fixed Issues in CDH 6.0.0


See below for issues fixed in CDH 6.0.0, grouped by component:

Apache Accumulo
Apache Avro
Apache Crunch
Apache Flume
Apache Hadoop
Apache HBase
Apache Hive / HCatalog / Hive on Spark
Hue
Apache Impala
Apache Kafka
Apache Kudu
Apache Oozie
Apache Parquet
Apache Pig
Cloudera Search
Apache Sentry
Apache Spark
Apache Sqoop
Apache Zookeeper




Apache Accumulo

Running Apache Accumulo on top of a CDH 6.0.0 cluster is not currently supported. If you try to upgrade to CDH 6.0.0 you will be asked to remove the Accumulo service from your cluster.
Running Accumulo on top of CDH 6 will be supported in a future release.



Apache Avro

There are no notable fixed issues in this release.



Apache Crunch

There are no notable fixed issues in this release.



Apache Flume

There are no notable fixed issues in this release.



Apache Hadoop

HDFS


HADOOP-12267 - DistCp to S3a fails due to integer overflow in retry timer.




MapReduce 2 and YARN


YARN-4212 (CDH-31358) - Jobs in pool with DRF policy will not run if root pool is FAIR.
MAPREDUCE-6638 (CDH-37412) - Jobs with encrypted spills do not recover if the
Application Master goes down.
YARN-1558 - Moving jobs between queues not persistent after restart.





Apache HBase

In CDH 6.0.0, the default values for properties that are required to enable cell-level ACLs have changed. Previously, you needed to modify the properties to enable cell-level ACLs. In
CDH 6.0.0, you do not need to modify them. The properties and their new default values are listed below:

hbase.security.exec.permission.checks => true
hbase.security.access.early_out => false
hfile.format.version => 3
For information about the upstream fixes, see the Apache HBase JIRAs.
The following JIRA has also been closed:


HBASE-7621 - RemoteHTable now supports binary row keys with any character or byte by
properly encoding request URLs.





Apache Hive / HCatalog / Hive on Spark

In CDH 6.0, Hive fixed issues resulted in new features and incompatible changes. For details on these fixed issues, see the following sections of the CDH 6.0 Release Notes for Hive:

New Features in Hive CDH 6.0
Incompatible Changes in Hive CDH 6.0




Hue

There are no notable fixed issues in this release.



Apache Impala

There are no notable fixed issues in this release



Apache Kafka

Authenticated Kafka clients may impersonate other users

Authenticated Kafka clients may impersonate any other user via a manually crafted protocol message with SASL/PLAIN or SASL/SCRAM authentication when using the built-in PLAIN or SCRAM
server implementations in Apache Kafka.
Note that the SASL authentication mechanisms that apply to this issue are neither recommended nor supported by Cloudera. In Cloudera Manager (CM) there are four choices: PLAINTEXT, SSL, SASL_PLAINTEXT, and SASL_SSL. The SASL/PLAIN
option described in this issue is not the same as SASL_PLAINTEXT option in CM. That option uses Kerberos and is not affected. As a result it is highly unlikely that Kafka is susceptible to this issue
when managed by CM unless the authentication protocol is overridden by an Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve).
Products affected: CDK Powered by Apache Kafka
Releases affected: CDK 2.1.0 to 2.2.0, CDK 3.0.0
Users affected: All users
Detected by: Rajini Sivaram (rsivaram@apache.org)
Severity (Low/Medium/High):8.3 (High) (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H)
Impact:Privilege escalation.
CVE: CVE-2017-12610
Immediate action required: Upgrade to a newer version of CDK Powered by Apache Kafka where the issue has been fixed.
Addressed in release/refresh/patch: CDK 3.1, CDH 6.0 and higher
Knowledge article: For the latest update on this issue see the corresponding Knowledge article: TSB 2018-332: Two Kafka Security Vulnerabilities: Authenticated Kafka clients may impersonate other users and and may
interfere with data replication



Authenticated clients may interfere with data replication

Authenticated Kafka users may perform an action reserved for the Broker via a manually created fetch request interfering with data replication, resulting in data loss.
Products affected: CDK Powered by Apache Kafka
Releases affected: CDK 2.0.0 to 2.2.0, CDK 3.0.0
Users affected: All users
Detected by: Rajini Sivaram (rsivaram@apache.org)
Severity (Low/Medium/High):6.3 (Medium) (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)
Impact:Potential data loss due to improper replication.
CVE:CVE-2018-1288
Immediate action required: Upgrade to a newer version of CDK Powered by Apache Kafka where the issue has been fixed.
Addressed in release/refresh/patch: CDK 3.1, CDH 6.0 and higher
Knowledge article: For the latest update on this issue see the corresponding Knowledge article: TSB 2018-332: Two Kafka Security Vulnerabilities: Authenticated Kafka clients may impersonate other users and and may
interfere with data replication

Security Supportability

KAFKA-6258 - SSLTransportLayer should keep reading from the socket until either the buffer
is full or the socket has no more data.

KAFKA-5534 - The KafkaConsumer method offsetsForTimes should include partitions in result even if no offset could be found.
KAFKA-5512 - KafkaConsumer: High memory allocation rate when
idle.
KAFKA-4856 - Calling KafkaProducer.close() from multiple
threads may cause spurious error.
KAFKA-4767 - KafkaProducer is not joining its IO thread
properly.
