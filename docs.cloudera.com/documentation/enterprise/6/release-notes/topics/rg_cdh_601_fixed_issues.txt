Region Server occasionally fails when HDFS data transport encryption is enabled

In rare cases, an HBase RegionServer on a Hadoop Data Transfer Encryption enabled cluster (dfs.encrypt.data.transfer = true) may crash because it is not able to update the encryption
key.
Workaround: Restart the RegionServer.
Affected Versions: CDH 6.0.0
Fixed Versions: 6.0.1
Apache Issue: HBASE-21018
Cloudera Issue: CDH-71613



Prefetch sometimes doesn't work with encrypted file system

If HBase prefetch is enabled (hbase.rs.prefetchblocksonopen = true) on an encrypted HDFS cluster, HBase RegionServer may crash due to memory corruption.
Workaround: Disable HBase prefetch (hbase.rs.prefetchblocksonopen = false).
Affected Versions: CDH 6.0.0
Fixed Versions: 6.0.1
Apache Issue: HBASE-20403
Cloudera Issue: CDH-68666

all DFS admin commands.
HDFS-10240 - Fixed an issue where the race between close/recoverLease leads to

Apache Hive

Code Changes Should Not Be Required
The following fixes should not require code changes, but they contain improvements that might enhance your deployment:

HIVE-13696 - Modify fair-scheduler.xml and automatically update/validate jobs submitted to
fair-scheduler
HIVE-15387 - NPE in HiveServer2 webUI Historical SQL Operations section
HIVE-16483 - Hive on Spark should populate split-related configurations to HiveConf
HIVE-17213 - Hive on Spark: file merging doesn't work for union all
HIVE-18977 - Listing partitions returns different results with JDO and direct SQL
HIVE-19048 - Initscript errors are ignored
HIVE-19133 - HiveServer2 WebUI phase-wise performance metrics not showing correctly
HIVE-19202 - CBO failed due to NullPointerException in HiveAggregate.isBucketedInput()
HIVE-19251 - ObjectStore.getNextNotification with LIMIT should use less memory
HIVE-19259 - CREATE VIEW that uses UNION ALL fails with 'Table not found'
HIVE-19265 - Potential NPE returned instead of actual exception in Hive#copyFiles
HIVE-19424 - NPE In MetaDataFormatters
HIVE-19668 - HiveServer2 service hanging due to over 30% of the heap wasted by duplicate
org.antlr.runtime.CommonToken's and duplicate strings
HIVE-19752 - PerfLogger integration for critical Hive-on-S3 paths
HIVE-19870 - HCatalog dynamic partition query can fail if the table path is managed by
Sentry
HIVE-19891 - inserting into external tables with custom partition directories may cause data
loss
HIVE-20183 - Inserting from bucketed table can cause data loss if the source table contains
an empty bucket
HIVE-20226 - HMS getNextNotification throws exception when request maxEvents exceed table's
max_rows
HIVE-20345 - Drop database may hang if the tables get deleted from a different call



Hive Jobs Are Submitted to a Single Queue When Sentry is Deployed

Hive jobs are not submitted into the correct YARN queue when Hive is using Sentry because Hive does not use the YARN API to resolve the user or group of the job's original submitter.
This causes the job to be placed in a queue using the placement rules based on the Hive user. The HiveServer2 fair scheduler queue mapping used for "non-impersonation" mode does not handle the
primary-secondary queue mappings correctly.
Workaround: If you are a Hive and Sentry user, do not upgrade to CDH 6.0.0. This issue will be fixed as soon as possible. If you must use Hive and Sentry in
CDH 6.0.0, see YARN Dynamic Resource Pools Do Not Work with Hive When Sentry Is Enabled for additional workarounds.
Affected Version: CDH 6.0.0
Fixed Versions: CDH 6.0.1, CDH 6.1.0 and later
Cloudera Issue: CDH-51596




Hue

The following issue is fixed in CDH 6.0.1:


Queries from ImpalaDaemonApi failing when Impala is configured with webserver_htpassword

When webserver_htpassword_username and webserver_htpassword_password are used to authenticate the Impala web UIs, the Hue
JobBrowser Impala Queries' page returns a 404 error, even with Kerberos authentication.
Workaround: None
Fixed Versions: 6.0.1 6.1.0
Cloudera Issue: CDH-71138




Apache Impala

The following issues are fixed in CDH 6.0.1:

IMPALA-4908 - NULL floats with different value fields now compare equal.
IMPALA-7014 - Disabled stacktrace symbolisation by default.
IMPALA-7078 - Improved memory consumption of Avro scans of wide tables.
IMPALA-7145 - Fixed a memory leak in OpenSSL when spill-to-disk encryption is enabled.
IMPALA-7225 - REFRESH PARTITION on a single partition no longer resets its row count to
-1.
IMPALA-7330 - After LOAD DATA, Impala now only refreshes the affected partition.
IMPALA-7360 - Avro scanner sometimes skips blocks when skip marker is on the HDFS block
boundary.
IMPALA-7559 - Disabled Parquet stat filtering for UTC-normalized timestamp columns.

SOLR-11590 - Synchronize ZK connect/disconnect handling so that they are processed in linear
order
SOLR-12343 - JSON Field Facet refinement can return incorrect counts/stats for sorted
buckets
SOLR-12450 - Don't allow referal to external resources in various config files
SOLR-12516 - JSON range facets can incorrectly refine subfacets for buckets



CDH Upgrade fails to delete Solr data from HDFS

The CDH upgrade process fails to delete Solr data from HDFS and the recreated collections fail to be initialized due to the existing indexes.
Workaround: Perform the following steps after you run the CDH Upgrade wizard and before you finalize the HDFS
upgrade:

Log in to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
Go to the Solr service page.
Stop the Solr service and dependent services. Click Actions > Stop.
Click Actions > Reinitialize Solr State for Upgrade.
Click Actions > Bootstrap Solr Configuration.
Start the Solr and dependent services. Click Actions > Start.
Click Actions > Bootstrap Solr Collections.


Affected Versions: CDH 6.0.0
Fixed Versions: Cloudera Manager 6.0.1
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-47502



Solr Service reports stale configurations even after restart

Solr reports stale configurations, and the Solr Server role fails to start with the following error: Role failed to start due to error: The archive already contains creds.localjceks. The issue occurs if your deployment has Solr and HDFS uses LDAP Group Mapping.
Workaround: If you have a CDH 5 cluster and use LDAP Group Mapping, do not upgrade to CDH 6.0.0. If you have a CDH 6.0.0 cluster, disable LDAP Group
Mappings.
Affected Versions: Cloudera Manager 6.0.0 and CDH 6.0.0
Fixed Versions: Cloudera Manager 6.0.1
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-47321



Cloudera Search configuration migration script fails to detect incompatible SecureAdminHandlers request handler

The SecureAdminHandlers request handler is incompatible with Apache Solr 7, which is used in CDH 6. The Cloudera Search configuration migration script
fails to detect this incompatibility.
Workaround: Remove SecureAdminHandlers request handlers from the solrconfig.xml files of any
configuration set that uses them during the pre-upgrade
configuration migration.
Affected Versions: CDH 6.0.0
Fixed Versions: CDH 6.0.1
Cloudera Issue: CDH-72239
