Fixed Issues in CDH 6.1.1

Hue allows unsigned SAML assertions

If Hue receives an unsigned assertion, it continues to process it as valid. This means it is possible for an end-user to forge or remove the signature and manipulate a SAML assertion to
gain access without a successful authentication.
Products affected: Hue, CDH
Releases affected:

CDH 5.15.x and earlier
CDH 5.16.0, 5.16.1
CDH 6.0.x
CDH 6.1.x


User affected: All users who are using SAML with Hue.
CVE: CVE-2019-14775
Date/time of detection: January 2019
Detected by: Joel Snape
Severity (Low/Medium/High): High
Impact:
This is a significant security risk as it allows anyone to fake their access validity and therefore access Hue, even if they should not have access. In more detail: if Hue receives an
unsigned assertion, it continues to process it as valid. This means it is possible for an end-user to forge or remove the signature and manipulate a SAML assertion to gain access without a successful
authentication.
CVE: CVE-2019-14775
Immediate action required:

Upgrade (recommended): Upgrade to a version of CDH containing the fix.
Workaround: None


Addressed in release/refresh/patch:

CDH 5.16.2
CDH 6.2.0





XSS Cloudera Manager

Malicious Impala queries can result in Cross Site Scripting (XSS) when viewed in Cloudera Manager.
Products affected: Apache Impala
Releases affected:

Cloudera Manager 5.13.x, 5.14.x, 5.15.1, 5.15.2, 5.16.1
Cloudera Manager 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.1.0


Users affected: All Cloudera Manager Users
Date/time of detection: November 2018
Severity (Low/Medium/High): High
Impact: When a malicious user generates a piece of JavaScript in the impala-shell and then goes to the Queries tab of the Impala service in Cloudera
Manager, that piece of JavaScript code gets evaluated, resulting in an XSS.
CVE: CVE-2019-14449
Immediate action required: There is no workaround, upgrade to the latest available maintenance release.
Addressed in release/refresh/patch:

Cloudera Manager 5.16.2
Cloudera Manager 6.0.2, 6.1.1, 6.2.0, 6.3.0





CVE-2018-1296 Permissive Apache Hadoop HDFS listXAttr Authorization Exposes Extended Attribute Key/Value Pairs

AHDFS exposes extended attribute key/value pairs during listXAttrs, verifying only path-level search access to the directory rather than path-level read permission to the referent.
Products affected: Apache HDFS
Releases affected:

CDH 5.4.0 - 5.15.1, 5.16.0
CDH 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.1.0


Users affected: Users who store sensitive data in extended attributes, such as users of HDFS encryption.
Date/time of detection: Dcember 12, 2017
Detected by: Rushabh Shah, Yahoo! Inc., Hadoop committer
Severity (Low/Medium/High): Medium
Impact: HDFS exposes extended attribute key/value pairs during listXAttrs, verifying only path-level search access to the directory rather than path-level
read permission to the referent. This affects features that store sensitive data in extended attributes.
CVE: CVE-2018-1296
Immediate action required:

Upgrade: Update to a version of CDH containing the fix.
Workaround: If a file contains sensitive data in extended attributes, users and admins need to change the permission to prevent others from listing the directory that contains the
file.


Addressed in release/refresh/patch:

CDH 5.15.2, 5.16.1
CDH 6.1.1, 6.2.0





The Standby Resource Manager redirects /jmx and /metrics requests to the Active Resource Manager.

When ResourceManager high availability is enabled the Standby Resource Manager redirects /jmx and /metrics requests to the Active Resource Manager. This causes the following issues in
Cloudera Manager:

If Enable Kerberos Authentication for HTTP Web-Console is disabled: Cloudera Manager shows statistics for the wrong
server.
If Enable Kerberos Authentication for HTTP Web-Console is enabled: connection from the agent to the standby fails with
the HTTPError: HTTP Error 401: Authentication required error message. As a result, the health of the Standby Resource Manager will become bad.


Workaround: N/A
Affected Versions: CDH 6.0.x, CDH 6.1.0
Fixed Version: CDH 6.1.1
Cloudera Issue: CDH-76040



Hadoop LdapGroupsMapping does not support LDAPS for self-signed LDAP server

Hadoop LdapGroupsMapping does not work with LDAP over SSL (LDAPS) if the LDAP server certificate is self-signed. This use case is currently not supported even if Hadoop User Group
Mapping LDAP TLS/SSL Enabled, Hadoop User Group Mapping LDAP TLS/SSL Truststore, and Hadoop User Group Mapping LDAP TLS/SSL Truststore Password are filled properly.
Affected Versions: CDH 5.x and 6.0.x versions
Fixed Versions: CDH 6.1.0
Apache Issue: HADOOP-12862
Cloudera Issue: CDH-37926
