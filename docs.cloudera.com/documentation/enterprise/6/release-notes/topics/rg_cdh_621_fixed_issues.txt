Fixed Issues in CDH 6.2.1


CDH 6.2.1 fixes the following issues:

Data loss with restore snapshot
CDH users must not use Apache HBase's OfflineMetaRepair tool
Potential to bypass transaction and idempotent ACL checks in Apache Kafka
Kafka Broker Java configuration options in Cloudera Manager 6.2.0 are not applied to the broker JVM process
Oozie database upgrade fails when PostgreSQL version 9.6 or higher is used
GPU and Custom Resource Types Are Not Added to the YARN Client's Configuration File When Enabled
Error when executing Java classes from a CDH cluster running on Ubuntu 18
Hadoop LdapGroupsMapping does not support LDAPS for self-signed LDAP server
The Idempotent and Transactional Capabilities of Kafka are Incompatible with Sentry
WebHCat service cannot log
Attempt to move table between encryption zones corrupts metadata
Upstream Issues Fixed




Data loss with restore snapshot

The restore snapshot command causes data loss when the target table was split or truncated after snapshot creation.
Products affected: HBase
Releases affected:


CDH 6.0.x


CDH 6.1.x


CDH 6.2.0


CDH 6.3.0



User affected: Users relying on Restore Snapshot functionality.
Impact: Restored table could have missing data when split or truncate happened after snapshot creation.
Immediate action required: Update to a version of CDH containing the fix.
Workaround:Do not use Restore Snapshot. The same functionality can be achieved if the table is deleted and Clone Snapshot is used instead of restoring a
table’s state to the snapshot.
hbase> disable 'table'
hbase> drop 'table'
hbase> clone_snapshot 'snapshot_name', 'table'
hbase> enable 'table'
Addressed in release/refresh/patch:


CDH 6.2.1


CDH 6.3.2



Knowledge article: For the latest update on this issue see the corresponding Knowledge article: TSB 2020-379: Data loss with restore snapshot



CDH users must not use Apache HBase's OfflineMetaRepair tool

OfflineMetaRepair helps you to rebuild the HBase meta table from the underlying file system. This tool is often used to correct meta table corruption or loss. It is designed to work only
with hbase-1.x (CDH 5.x). Users must not run the OfflineMetaRepair tool against CDH 6.x since it uses hbase-2.x. If a user runs OfflineMetaRepair tool in CDH 6.x, then it will break or corrupt the
HBase meta table.
If you have already corrupted your meta table or you believe your meta table requires the use of something like the former OfflineMetaRepair tool, do not attempt any further changes,
contact Cloudera Support.
Products affected: CDH
Releases affected:


CDH 6.0.0, 6.0.1


CDH 6.1.0, 6.1.1


CDH 6.2.0


CDH 6.3.0



User affected: Clusters with HBase installed.
Impact: Cluster becomes inoperable.
Immediate action required: Update to a version of CDH containing the fix.
Workaround: Do not run OfflineMetaRepair tool.
Addressed in release/refresh/patch:


CDH 6.2.1


CDH 6.3.2



Knowledge article: For the latest update on this issue see the corresponding Knowledge article: TSB 2020-376: CDH users must not use Apache HBase's OfflineMetaRepair
tool



Potential to bypass transaction and idempotent ACL checks in Apache Kafka

It is possible to manually craft a Produce request which bypasses transaction and idempotent ACL validation. Only authenticated clients with Write permission on the respective topics are
able to exploit this vulnerability.
Products affected:

CDH
CDK Powered by Apache Kafka


Releases affected:


CDH versions 6.0.x, 6.1.x, 6.2.0


CDK versions 3.0.x, 3.1.x, 4.0.x



Users affected: All users who run Kafka in CDH and CDK.
Date/time of detection: September, 2018
Severity (Low/Medium/High):7.1 (High) (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H)
Impact: Attackers can exploit this issue to bypass certain security restrictions to perform unauthorized actions. This can aid in further attacks.
CVE: CVE-2018-17196
Immediate action required: Update to a version of CDH containing the fix.
Addressed in release/refresh/patch:


CDH 6.2.1, 6.3.2


CDK 4.1.0



Knowledge article: For the latest update on this issue see the corresponding Knowledge article: TSB 2020-378: Potential to bypass transaction and idempotent ACL checks in
Apache Kafka



Kafka Broker Java configuration options in Cloudera Manager 6.2.0 are not applied to the broker JVM process

Cloudera Manager allows the configuration of JVM option for Kafka brokers via the Additional Broker Java Options (broker_java_opts) service parameter. In
Cloudera Manager 6.2.0, when managing CDH 6.2.0 clusters, ‘broker_java_opts’ are ignored when starting the Kafka broker process, resulting in using default JVM configuration
options. This can lead to the following problems (depending on other environment variables):

Kafka broker process does not use the recommended garbage collector settings leading to poor performance and increased resource (heap memory) utilization.
Kafka broker process allows remote connection to JMX interface making the process vulnerable to remote code execution on the broker nodes.

Products affected: Apache Kafka
Affected version:

CDH 6.2.0
Cloudera Manager 6.2.0


Fixed version:

CDH 6.2.1, 6.3.0


For the latest update on this issue see the corresponding Knowledge article:TSB 2019-377: Kafka Broker Java configuration options in Cloudera Manager 6.2.0
are not applied to the broker JVM process Labels:



Oozie database upgrade fails when PostgreSQL version 9.6 or higher is used

Oozie database upgrade fails when PostgreSQL version 9.6 or higher is used due to a sys table change in PostgreSQL from version 9.5 to 9.6. The failure only happens if Oozie uses a JDBC
driver earlier than 9.4.1209.
Workaround:

After the parcels of the new version are distributed, replace the PostgreSQL JDBC driver with a newer one (version 9.4.1209 or higher) in the new parcel, at the following locations:

/opt/cloudera/parcels/${newparcel.version}/lib/oozie/lib/
/opt/cloudera/parcels/${newparcel.version}/lib/oozie/libtools/


Perform the upgrade.


Note: If you already started the upgrade and the process stops with an error message about missing columns, you can change the drivers at that
point of the process as well, and resume the upgrade.
If your cluster is installed from packages, you must change the drivers at the following locations:

/usr/lib/oozie/libtools/
/usr/lib/oozie/lib/


Note: You can change the driver after the packages installation, but before running the CDH upgrade wizard. You can also do it during the update
process, when the error occurs.
You can download the driver from the PostgreSQL JDBC driver homepage.
Affected Versions: CDH 6.0.0 and higher
Fixed Version: CDH 6.2.1 and higher
Cloudera Issue: CDH-75951



GPU and Custom Resource Types Are Not Added to the YARN Client's Configuration File When Enabled

When GPU or other custom resource type is configured in Cloudera Manager, the appropiate resource (for example yarn.io/gpu) is not added to the YARN client's configuration
(yarn-site.xml) file. As a result, jobs that use GPU or the configured custom resource type will fail.
Workaround: Add the appropriate resource manually to the YARN Client Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
yarn-site.xml:

In Cloudera Manager select YARN service and go to Configuration.
Search for YARN Client Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for yarn-site.xml
Add the following snippet:
<property>
<name>yarn.resource-types</name>
<value>yarn.io/gpu</value>
</property>


Affected Versions: CDH 6.2.0
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-49507



Error when executing Java classes from a CDH cluster running on Ubuntu 18

Using the hadoop command-line interface for executing Java classes that are not in the default package results in error messages similar to the following:
#hadoop org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration
/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-6.2.0-1.cdh6.2.0.p0.914039/bin/../lib/hadoop/libexec//hadoop-functions.sh: line 2366: HADOOP_ORG.APACHE.HADOOP.CONF.CONFIGURATION_USER: bad substitution
/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-6.2.0-1.cdh6.2.x.p0.914039/bin/../lib/hadoop/libexec//hadoop-functions.sh: line 2331: HADOOP_ORG.APACHE.HADOOP.CONF.CONFIGURATION_USER: bad substitution
/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-6.2.0-1.cdh6.2.x.p0.914039/bin/../lib/hadoop/libexec//hadoop-functions.sh: line 2426: HADOOP_ORG.APACHE.HADOOP.CONF.CONFIGURATION_OPTS: bad substitution
This issue occurs only in CDH 6.2 clusters running on Ubuntu 18 and the error messages can be safely ignored.
Workaround: Run the java command directly using hadoop classpath to get the classpath. For example, instead of
hadoop org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration, you can run java -cp `hadoop classpath`
org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.
Affected Versions: CDH 6.2.0
Fixed Versions: CDH 6.2.1
Apache Issue: HADOOP-16167



Hadoop LdapGroupsMapping does not support LDAPS for self-signed LDAP server

Hadoop LdapGroupsMapping does not work with LDAP over SSL (LDAPS) if the LDAP server certificate is self-signed. This use case is currently not supported even if Hadoop User Group
Mapping LDAP TLS/SSL Enabled, Hadoop User Group Mapping LDAP TLS/SSL Truststore, and Hadoop User Group Mapping LDAP TLS/SSL Truststore Password are filled properly.
Affected Versions: CDH 5.x and 6.0.x versions
Fixed Versions: CDH 6.1.0
Apache Issue: HADOOP-12862
Cloudera Issue: CDH-37926



The Idempotent and Transactional Capabilities of Kafka are Incompatible with Sentry

The idempotent and transactional capabilities of Kafka are not compatible with Sentry. The issue is due to Sentry being unable to handle authorization policies for Kafka transactions. As
a result, users cannot use Kafka transaction in combination with Sentry.
Workaround: Use the Sentry super user in applications where idempotent producing is a requirement or disable Sentry.
Affected Versions: CDK 4.0 and later, CDH 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.1.0, 6.1.1, 6.2.0, 6.3.0
Fixed Versions: CDH 6.2.1, 6.3.1
Apache Issue: N/A
Cloudera Issue: CDH-80606



WebHCat service cannot log

Any WebHCat commands referencing Hive are failing with error (main ERROR Cannot access RandomAccessFile java.io.IOException: Could not create directory
/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-6.2.x-XXX/lib/hive/logs).
Affected Versions: 6.1.0, 6.1.1, 6.2.0
Fixed Versions: 6.2.1, 6.3.0
Apache Issue: N/A
Cloudera Issue: CDH-77160



Attempt to move table between encryption zones corrupts metadata

An attempt to move a table between different encryption zones fails as expected, but the remaining table is unusable and can only be deleted. This fix prevents metadata corruption.
Affected Versions: 5.15.1, 5.16.2, 6.1.1, 6.2.0
Fixed Versions: 5.16.3, 6.2.1, 6.3.0
Apache Issue: N/A
