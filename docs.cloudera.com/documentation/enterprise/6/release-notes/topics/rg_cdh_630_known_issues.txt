Linux kernel security patch and CDH services crashes CVE-2017-10000364
Leap-Second Events




Linux kernel security patch and CDH services crashes CVE-2017-10000364

After applying a recent Linux kernel security patch for CVE-2017-1000364, CDH
services that use the JSVC set of libraries crash with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) error such as:
A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
SIGBUS (0x7) at pc=0x00007fe91ef6cebc, pid=30321, tid=0x00007fe930c67700

Cloudera services for HDFS and Impala cannot start after applying the patch.
Important: If you have not upgraded your Linux kernel using the distribution's patch for CVE-2017-1000364, do not apply the patch.
Commonly used Linux distributions are shown in the table below. However, the issue affects any CDH release that runs on RHEL, CentOS, Oracle Linux, SUSE Linux, or Ubuntu and that has had
the Linux kernel security patch for CVE-2017-1000364 applied.
If you have already applied the patch for your OS according to the advisories for CVE-2017-1000364, apply the kernel update that contains the fix for your operating system (some of which
are listed in the table). If you cannot apply the kernel update, you can workaround the issue by increasing the Java thread stack size as detailed in the steps below.

Workaround

If you cannot apply the kernel update, you can set the Java thread stack size to -Xss1280k for the affected services using the appropriate Java
configuration option or the environment advanced configuration snippet, as detailed below.
For role instances that have specific Java configuration options properties:


Log in to Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
Select Clusters > Impala, and then click the Configuration tab.
Type java in the search field to display Java related configuration parameters. The Java Configuration Options for Catalog
Server property field displays. Type -Xss1280k in the entry field, adding to any existing settings.
Click Save Changes.
Navigate to the HDFS service by selecting Clusters > HDFS.
Click the Configuration tab.
Click the Scope filter DataNode. The Java Configuration Options for DataNode field displays among the properties
listed. Enter -Xss1280k into the field, adding to any existing properties.
Click Save Changes.
Select the Scope filter NFS Gateway. The Java Configuration Options for NFS Gateway field displays among the
properties listed. Enter -Xss1280k into the field, adding to any existing properties.
Click Save Changes.
Restart the affected roles (or configure the safety valves in next section and restart when finished with all configurations).


For role instances that do not have specific Java configuration options:

Log in to Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
Select Clusters > Impala, and then click the Configuration tab.
Click the Scope filter Impala Daemon and Category filter Advanced.

Cloudera Issue: CDH-55771




Leap-Second Events


Note: The next leap-second event is unknown at
this time. The last leap-second event occurred on December 16, 2016 at 23:59:60 UTC.

Impact: After a leap-second event, Java applications (including CDH services) using older Java and Linux kernel versions, may consume almost 100% CPU. See
https://access.redhat.com/articles/15145.
Leap-second events are tied to the time synchronization methods of the Linux kernel, the Linux distribution and version, and the Java version used by applications running on affected
kernels.
Although Java is increasingly agnostic to system clock progression (and less susceptible to a kernel's mishandling of a leap-second event), using JDK 7 or 8 should prevent issues at the
CDH level (for CDH components that use the Java Virtual Machine).
Immediate action required:
(1) Ensure that the kernel is up to date.


RHEL6/7, CentOS 6/7 - 2.6.32-298 or higher


Oracle Enterprise Linux (OEL) - Kernels built in 2013 or later


SLES12 - No action required.


(2) Ensure that your Java JDKs are current (especially if the kernel is not up to date and cannot be upgraded).


Java 8 - No action required.



(3) Ensure that your systems use either NTP or PTP synchronization.
For systems not using time synchronization, update both the OS tzdata and Java tzdata packages to the tzdata-2016g version, at a minimum. For OS tzdata package updates, contact OS
support or check updated OS repositories. For Java tzdata package updates, see Oracle's Timezone Updater Tool.
Cloudera Issue: CDH-44788, TSB-189

Deprecated Properties
Hadoop Common
HDFS
MapReduce2 and YARN




Deprecated Properties

Several Hadoop and HDFS properties have been deprecated as of Hadoop 3.0 and later. For details, see Deprecated Properties.



Hadoop Common

KMS Load Balancing Provider Fails to invalidate Cache on Key Delete

The KMS Load balancing Provider has not been correctly invalidating the cache on key delete operations. The failure to invalidate the cache on key delete operations can result in the
possibility that data can be leaked from the framework for a short period of time based on the value of the hadoop.kms.current.key.cache.timeout.ms property. Its default value is 30,000ms. When the
KMS is deployed in an HA pattern the KMSLoadBalancingProvider class will only send the delete operation to one KMS role instance in a round-robin fashion. The code lacks a call to invalidate the
cache across all instances and can leave key information including the metadata and key stored (the deleted key) in the cache on one or more KMS instances up to the key cache timeout.
Apache issue:


HADOOP-17208


HADOOP-17304



Products affected:


CDH

Delete




HDFS

Possible HDFS Erasure Coded (EC) Data Files Corruption in EC Reconstruction

Cloudera has detected two bugs that can cause corruption of HDFS Erasure Coded (EC) files during the data reconstruction process.
The first bug can be hit during DataNode decommissioning. Due to a bug in the data reconstruction logic during decommissioning, some parity blocks may be generated with a content of all
zeros.
Usually the NameNode makes a simple copy of the block when re-replicating it during decommissioning. However, if a decommissioning DataNode is already assigned with more than the
replication streams hard limit (It can be set by using the dfs.namenode.replication.max-streams-hard-limit property. Its default value is 4.), the node will be treated
as busy and instead of performing a simple copy, the parity blocks may be reconstructed as all zeros.
Subsequently if any other data blocks in the same EC group are lost (due to node failure or disk failure), the reconstruction may use a bad parity block to generate bad data blocks. So,
once parity blocks are corrupted, any further reconstruction in the same block group can propagate further corruptions in the same block group.
The second issue occurs in a corner case when a DataNode times out in the reconstruction process. It will reschedule a read from another good DataNode. However, the stale DataNode reader
may have polluted the buffer and subsequent reconstruction which uses the polluted buffer will suffer from EC block corruption.
Products affected:

CDH
HDP
CDP Private Cloud Base


Releases affected: All Cloudera releases based on Apache Hadoop 3.0 and later

CDH 6.0.x
CDH 6.1.x
CDH 6.2.x
CDH 6.3.x
HDP 3.1.x
CDP 7.1.x


Users affected: A customer may be affected by this corruption if they are:

Using an affected version of the product.
Have enabled EC policy on one or more HDFS directories and have some EC files.
Decommissioned DataNodes after enabling the EC policy will increase the probability of corruption.
Rarely EC reconstructions can create dirty buffer issues which will lead to data corruption.


To determine whether you have any EC files on your cluster, run the following fsck command:
hdfs fsck / -files | grep "erasure-coded: policy="
/ectest/dirWithPolicy/sample-sales-1.csv 215 bytes, erasure-coded: policy=RS-3-2-1024k, 1 block(s): OK
If there are any file paths listed in the output of the above command, and if you have decommissioned DataNodes after creating those files, your EC files may have been affected by this
bug.
If no files were listed by the above command, then your data is not affected. However, if you plan to use EC or if you have enabled EC policy on any directory in the past, then we
strongly recommend requesting a hotfix from Cloudera.
Severity: High
Impact: With erasure coded files in the cluster, if you have done the decommission, the data files are potentially corrupted. HDFS/NameNode cannot
self-detect and self-recover the corrupted files. This is because checksums are also updated during reconstruction. So, the HDFS client may not detect the corruption while reading the affected
blocks, however applications may be impacted. Even in the case of normal reconstruction, the second dirty buffer issue can trigger corruption.
Workaround:

If EC is enabled, request for a hotfix immediately from Cloudera.
In case EC was enabled and decommission of DataNodes was performed in the past after enabling EC, Cloudera has implemented tools to check the possibility of corruption. Contact
Cloudera support in such a situation.
If no decommission was done in the past after enabling EC, then it is recommended not to perform decommission of DataNodes until the hotfix is applied.

Corruption in EC Reconstruction



HDFS Snapshot corruption

A fix to HDFS snapshot functionality caused a regression in the affected CDH releases. When a snapshot is deleted, internal data structure in the NameNode can become inconsistent and the
checkpoint operation on the Standby NameNode can fail.
Products affected: HDFS
Releases affected:

CDH 5.4.0 - 5.15.1, 5.16.0
CDH 6.0.0 - 6.2.1, 6.3.0, 6.3.1, 6.3.2


Users affected: Any clusters with HDFS Snapshots enabled
Impact: A fix to HDFS snapshot functionality caused a regression in the affected CDH releases. When a snapshot is deleted, internal data structure in the
NameNode can become inconsistent and the checkpoint operation on the Standby NameNode can fail.
Standby NameNode detects the inconsistent snapshot data structure and shuts itself down. To recover from this situation, the fsimage must be repaired and put back into both NameNodes'
fsimage directory for the Standby NameNode to start normally. The Active NameNode stays up. However no fsimage checkpoint is performed because the Standby NameNode is down.
This problem can also prevent snapshots from being deleted or files within snapshots being listed. The following is an example of a typical error:
hdfs dfs -deleteSnapshot /path snapshot_123
deleteSnapshot: java.lang.IllegalStateException
The recovery of the corrupt fsimage can result in the loss of snapshots.
Immediate action required:

Upgrade: Update to a version of CDH containing the fix.
Workaround: Alternatively, avoid using snapshots. Cloudera BDR uses snapshots automatically when the relevant directories are snapshottable. Hence, we strongly recommend avoiding the
upgrade to the affected releases if you are using BDR. For information and instructions, see Enabling and Disabling HDFS Snapshots.


Addressed in release/refresh/patch: CDH 6.3.3

OIV ReverseXML processor fails

The HDFS OIV ReverseXML processor fails if the XML file contains escaped characters.
Affected Versions: CDH 6.x
Apache Issue: HDFS-12828



HDFS NFS gateway and CDH installation (using packages) limitation

HDFS NFS gateway works as shipped ("out of the box") only on RHEL-compatible systems, but not on SLES or Ubuntu. Because of a bug in native versions of portmap/rpcbind, the HDFS NFS gateway does not work out of the box on SLES or Ubuntu systems when CDH has been installed from the command-line, using packages. It does work on
supported versions of RHEL-compatible systems on which rpcbind-0.2.0-10.el6 or later is installed, and it does work if you use Cloudera Manager to install CDH, or if
you start the gateway as root. For more information, see CDH and Cloudera Manager Supported
Operating Systems.
Workarounds and caveats:

On Red Hat and similar systems, make sure rpcbind-0.2.0-10.el6 or later is installed.
On SLES and Ubuntu systems, do one of the following:

Install CDH using Cloudera Manager; or
Start the NFS gateway as root; or
Start the
NFS gateway without using packages; or
You can use the gateway by running rpcbind in insecure mode, using the -i option, but keep in mind that this allows anyone
from a remote host to bind to the portmap.




Upstream Issue: 731542 (Red Hat), 823364 (SLES)



No error when changing permission to 777 on .snapshot directory

Snapshots are read-only; running chmod 777 on the .snapshots directory does not change this, but does not produce an error
(though other illegal operations do).
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: HDFS-4981



Snapshot operations are not supported by ViewFileSystem

Affected Versions: All CDH versions



Snapshots do not retain directories' quotas settings

Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: HDFS-4897



Permissions for dfs.namenode.name.dir incorrectly set

Hadoop daemons should set permissions for the dfs.namenode.name.dir (or dfs.name.dir) directories to drwx------ (700), but
in fact these permissions are set to the file-system default, usually drwxr-xr-x (755).
Workaround: Use chmod to set permissions to 700.
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: HDFS-2470



hadoop fsck -move does not work in a cluster with host-based Kerberos

Workaround: Use hadoop fsck -delete
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: None



Block report can exceed maximum RPC buffer size on some DataNodes

On a DataNode with a large number of blocks, the block report may exceed the maximum RPC buffer size.
Workaround: Increase the value ipc.maximum.data.length in hdfs-site.xml:
<property>
  <name>ipc.maximum.data.length</name>
  <value>268435456</value>
</property>
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: None




MapReduce2 and YARN

YARN Resource Managers will stay in standby state after failover or startup

On startup or failover the YARN Resource Manager will stay in the standby state due to a failure to load the recovery data. The failure is logged as a Null Pointer exception in the
YARN Resource Manager log:
ERROR org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.ResourceManager: Failed to load/recover state
java.lang.NullPointerException at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.fair.FairScheduler.addApplicationAttempt

This issue is fixed as YARN-7913.
Products affected: CDH with Fair Scheduler
Releases affected:


CDH 6.0.x


CDH 6.1.x


CDH 6.2.0, CDH 6.2.1


CDH 6.3.0, CDH 6.3.1, CDH 6.3.2, CDH 6.3.3



User affected:
Any cluster running the Hadoop YARN service with the following configuration:



Scheduler set to Fair Scheduler


The YARN Resource Manager Work Preserving Recovery feature is enabled. That includes High Available setups.



Impact:
On startup or failover the YARN Resource Manager will process the state store to recover the workload that is currently running in the cluster. The recovery fails with a “null pointer
exception” being logged.
Due to the recovery failure the YARN Resource Manager will not become active. In a cluster with High Availability configured the standby YARN Resource Manager will fail with the same
exception leaving both YARN Resource Managers in a standby state. Even if the YARN Resource Managers are restarted, they still stay in standby state.
Immediate action required:

Customers requiring an urgent fix who are using CDH 6.2.x or earlier: Raise a support case to request a new patch.
Customers on CDH 6.3.x: Upgrade to the latest maintenance release.


Addressed in release/refresh/patch:


CDH 6.3.4



Knowledge article: For the latest update on this issue see the corresponding Knowledge article: TSB 2020-408: YARN Resource Managers will stay in standby
state after failover or startup snapshot



Using OpenJDK 11 on CDH6.3 and above requires re-installation of YARN MapReduce Framework JARs

Because several Java internal APIs are removed in JDK11, using older versions of MR Framework JARs will fail MR/Hive jobs, with the following error:
```
2019-07-18 14:54:52,483 ERROR [main] org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.MRAppMaster: Error starting MRAppMaster
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: sun.nio.ch.DirectBuffer.cleaner()Lsun/misc/Cleaner;
    at org.apache.hadoop.crypto.CryptoStreamUtils.freeDB(CryptoStreamUtils.java:41)

    at org.apache.hadoop.crypto.CryptoInputStream.close(CryptoInputStream.java:320)
    at java.base/java.io.FilterInputStream.close(FilterInputStream.java:180)
```
Workaround:

Go to the YARN service.
Select Actions > Install YARN MapReduce Framework JARs and click Install YARN MapReduce Framework JARs
To verify, you will find the new MR Framework JARs under the MR Application Framework Path (default: /user/yarn/mapreduce/mr-framework/) For example:

```


Cloudera Bug: CDH-81350



NodeManager fails because of the changed default location of container executor binary

The default location of container-executor binary and .cfg files was changed to /var/lib/yarn-ce. It used to be /opt/cloudera/parcels/<CDH_parcel_version>. Because of this change, if you did not have the mount options -noexec and -nosuid set on /opt, the NodeManager can fail to start up as these options are set on /var.
Affected versions CDH 5.16.1, All CDH 6 versions
Workaround: Either remove the -noexec and -nosuid mount options on /var or change the container-executor binary and .cdf path using the CMF_YARN_SAFE_CONTAINER_EXECUTOR_DIR environment variable.



YARN's Continuous Scheduling can cause slowness in Oozie

When Continuous Scheduling is enabled in Yarn, this can cause slowness in Oozie due to long delays in communicating with Yarn. In Cloudera Manager 5.9.0 and higher, Enable Fair
Scheduler Continuous Scheduler is turned off by default.
Workaround: Turn off Enable Fair Scheduler Continuous Scheduling in Cloudera Manager YARN Configuration. To keep equivalent
benefits of this feature, turn on Fair Scheduler Assign Multiple Tasks.
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Cloudera Issue: CDH-60788



JobHistory URL mismatch after server relocation

After moving the JobHistory Server to a new host, the URLs listed for the JobHistory Server on the ResourceManager web UI still point to the old JobHistory Server. This affects existing
jobs only. New jobs started after the move are not affected.
Workaround: For any existing jobs that have the incorrect JobHistory Server URL, there is no option other than to allow the jobs to roll off the history
over time. For new jobs, make sure that all clients have the updated mapred-site.xml that references the correct JobHistory Server.
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: None



History link in ResourceManager web UI broken for killed Spark applications

When a Spark application is killed, the history link in the ResourceManager web UI does not work.
Workaround: To view the history for a killed Spark application, see the Spark HistoryServer web UI instead.
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: None
Cloudera Issue: CDH-49165



Routable IP address required by ResourceManager

ResourceManager requires routable host:port addresses for yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.address, and does not support using
the wildcard 0.0.0.0 address.
Workaround: Set the address, in the form host:port, either in the client-side configuration, or on the command line when you
submit the job.
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: None
Cloudera Issue: CDH-6808



Amazon S3 copy may time out

The Amazon S3 filesystem does not support renaming files, and performs a copy operation instead. If the file to be moved is very large, the operation can time out because S3 does not
report progress during the operation.
Workaround: Use -Dmapred.task.timeout=15000000 to increase the MR task timeout.
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: MAPREDUCE-972
Cloudera Issue: CDH-17955



GPU or Custom Resource Type User Jobs can Fail After Recovery

When a GPU or other custom resource goes offline when it has containers that use that particular resource and they have not reached completion, after the restart the application will
start to recover. However, if the resource is not available anymore the job that uses that resource will fail.
Workaround: N/A
Affected Versions: CDH 6.2.0, CDH 6.3.0
Cloudera Issue: CDH-77649



NodeManager Fails if GPU Use Is Enabled without any Configured GPU

When Enable GPU Usage is enabled for a NodeManager and there is no properly configured GPU device in that node, the NodeManager will not start.
Workaround: Disable Enable GPU Usage for that NodeManager in Cloudera Manager.
Affected Versions: CDH 6.2.0, CDH 6.3.0

Apache HBase Known Issues

Cloudera Navigator plugin impacts HBase performance

Navigator Audit logging for HBase access can have a big impact on HBase performance most noticeable during data ingestion.
Component affected: HBase
Products affected: CDH
Releases affected: CDH 6.x
Impact: 4x performance increase was observed in batchMutate calls after disabling Navigator Audit.
Severity: High
Workaround:

In Cloudera Manager, navigate to HBase > Configuration.
Find the Enable Audit Collection property and clear it.
Restart the HBase service.


Upgrade: Upgrade to CDP where Navigator is no longer used.



HBASE-25206: snapshot and cloned table corruption when original table is deleted

HBASE-25206 can cause data loss either through corrupting an existing hbase snapshot or destroying data that backs a clone of a previous snapshot.
Component affected: HBase
Products affected:

HDP
CDH
CDP


Releases affected:

CDH 6.x.x
HDP 3.1.5
CDP PVC Base 7.1.x
Cloudera Runtime (Public Cloud) 7.0.x
Cloudera Runtime (Public Cloud) 7.1.x
Cloudera Runtime (Public Cloud) 7.2.0
Cloudera Runtime (Public Cloud) 7.2.1
Cloudera Runtime (Public Cloud) 7.2.2


Users affected: Users of the affected releases.
Impact: Potential risk of Data Loss.
Severity: High
Workaround:

Make HBase do the clean up work for the splits:

Before dropping a table that has any snapshots, first ensure that any regions that resulted from a split have fully rewritten their data and cleanup has happened for the original host
region.
If there are any remaining children of a split that have links to their parent still, then we first need to issue a major compaction for those regions (or the entire table).
After doing the major compaction we need to ensure it has finished before proceeding. There should no longer be any split pointers (named like "<target
hfile>.<target region>").
Whether or not we needed to do a major compaction we must always tell the catalog janitor to run to ensure the hfiles from any parent regions are moved to the archive.
We must wait for the catalog janitor to finish.
At this point it is safe to delete the original table without data loss.


Manually do the archiving:

Alternatively, as a part of deleting a table we can manually move all of its files into the archive. First disable the table. Next make sure each region and family combination that is
present in the active data area is present in the archive. Finally move all hfiles and links from the active area to the archive.
At this point it is safe to drop the table.




Upgrade: Upgrade to a CDP version contianing the fix.

Addressed in release/refresh/patch: Cloudera Runtime 7.2.6.0

HBase Performance Issue

The HDFS short-circuit setting dfs.client.read.shortcircuit is overwritten to disabled by hbase-default.xml. HDFS short-circuit reads bypass access to data in HDFS by using a domain
socket (file) instead of a network socket. This alleviates the overhead of TCP to read data from HDFS which can have a meaningful improvement on HBase performance (as high as 30-40%).
Users can restore short-circuit reads by explicitly setting dfs.client.read.shortcircuit in HBase configuration via the configuration management tool for their product (e.g. Cloudera
Manager or Ambari).
Products affected:

CDP
CDH
HDP


Releases affected:

CDP 7.x
CDH 6.x
HDP 3.x


Impact: HBase reads with high data-locality will not execute as fast as previously. HBase random read performance is heavily affected as random reads are
expected to have low latency (e.g. Get, Multi-Get). Scan workloads would also be affected, but may be less impacted as latency of scans is greater.
Severity: High
Action required: The following workaround can be taken to enable short-circuit read.

Cloudera Manager:
HBase → Configurations → HBase (Service-wide) → HBase Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hbase-site.xml→
dfs.client.read.shortcircuit=true
dfs.domain.socket.path=< Add same value which is configured in hdfs-site.xml >

Ambari:
HBase → CONFIGS → Advanced → Custom hbase-site →
dfs.client.read.shortcircuit=true
dfs.domain.socket.path=< Add same value which is configured in hdfs-site.xml >



After making these configuration changes, restart the HBase service.
Cloudera will continue to pursue product changes which may alleviate the need to make these configuration changes.
For CDP 7.1.1.0 and newer, the metric shortCircuitBytesRead can be viewed for each RegionServer under the RegionServer/Server JMX metrics endpoint. When
short circuit reads are not enabled, this metric will be zero. When short circuit reads are enabled and the data locality for this RegionServer is greater than zero, the metric should be greater than
zero.

Default limits for PressureAwareCompactionThroughputController are too low

HDP and CDH releases suffer from low compaction throughput limits, which cause storefiles to back up faster than compactions can re-write them. This was originally identified upstream in
HBASE-21000.
Products affected:

HDP
CDH


Releases affected:

HDP 3.0.0 through HDP 3.1.2
CDH 6.0.x
CDH 6.1.x
CDH 6.2.x
CDH 6.3.0, 6.3.1, 6.3.2, 6.3.3


Users affected: Users of above mentioned HDP and CDH versions.
Severity: Medium
Impact: For non-read-only workloads, this will eventually cause back-pressure onto new writes when the blocking store files limit is reached.
Action required:

Upgrade: Upgrade to the latest release version: CDP 7.1.4, HDP 3.1.5, CDH 6.3.4
Workaround:

Set the hbase.hstore.compaction.throughput.higher.bound property to 104857600 and the hbase.hstore.compaction.throughput.lower.bound property to 52428800 in hbase-site.xml.
An alternative solution is to set the hbase.regionserver.throughput.controller property to org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.throttle.NoLimitThroughputController which will remove all compaction throughput limitations (which has been observed to cause other
pressure).

CDH users must not use Apache HBase's OfflineMetaRepair tool

OfflineMetaRepair helps you to rebuild the HBase meta table from the underlying file system. This tool is often used to correct meta table corruption or loss. It is designed to work only
with hbase-1.x (CDH 5.x). Users must not run the OfflineMetaRepair tool against CDH 6.x since it uses hbase-2.x. If a user runs OfflineMetaRepair tool in CDH 6.x, then it will break or corrupt the
HBase meta table.
If you have already corrupted your meta table or you believe your meta table requires the use of something like the former OfflineMetaRepair tool, do not attempt any further changes,
contact Cloudera Support.

Multiple HBase Services on the Same CDH Cluster is not Supported

Cloudera Manager does not allow to deploy multiple HBase services on the same host of an HDFS cluster as by design a DataNode can only have a single HBase service per host. It is
possible to have two HBase services on the same HDFS cluster but they have to be on different DataNodes, meaning that there will be one RegionServer per DataNode per HBase cluster. However, that
requires additional configuration, for example you have to pin /hbase_enc and /hbase to avoid the HDFS balancer to cluster. However, that
requires additional configuration, for example you have to pin /hbase_enc and /hbase to avoid the HDFS balancer to cause issues with data
locality.
If Cloudera Manager is not used, you can manage multiple configurations per host for different RegionServers that are part of different HBase clusters but that can lead to multiple
issues and difficult troubleshooting procedures. Thus, Cloudera does not support managing multiple HBase services on the same CDH cluster.



IOException from Timeouts

CDH 5.12.0 includes the fix HBASE-16604, where the internal scanner that retries in case of
IOException from timeouts could potentially miss data. Java clients were properly updated to account for the new behavior, but thrift clients will now see exceptions where the previous missing data
would be.
Workaround: Create a new scanner and retry the operation when encountering this issue.



IntegrationTestReplication fails if replication does not finish before the verify phase begins

During IntegrationTestReplication, if the verify phase starts before the replication phase
finishes, the test will fail because the target cluster does not contain all of the data. If the HBase services in the target cluster does not have enough memory, long garbage-collection pauses might
occur.
Workaround: Use the -t flag to set the timeout value before starting verification.
Cloudera Issue: None.



HDFS encryption with HBase

Cloudera has tested the performance impact of using HDFS encryption with HBase. The overall overhead of HDFS encryption on HBase performance is in the range of 3 to 4% for both read and
update workloads. Scan performance has not been thoroughly tested.



ExportSnapshot or DistCp operations may fail on the Amazon s3a://
protocol

ExportSnapshot or DistCP operations may fail on AWS when using certain JDK 8 versions, due to an incompatibility between the
AWS Java SDK 1.9.x and the joda-time date-parsing module.
Workaround: Use joda-time 2.8.1 or higher, which is included in AWS Java SDK 1.10.1 or higher.
Cloudera Issue: None.



An operating-system level tuning issue in RHEL7 causes significant latency regressions

There are two distinct causes for the regressions, depending on the workload:

For a cached workload, the regression may be up to 11%, as compared to RHEL6. The cause relates to differences in the CPU's C-state (power saving state) behavior. With the same
workload, the CPU is around 40% busier in RHEL7, and the CPU spends more time transitioning between C-states in RHEL7. Transitions out of deeper C-states add latency. When CPUs are configured to
never enter a C-state lower than 1, RHEL7 is slightly faster than RHEL6 on the cached workload. The root cause is still under investigation and may be hardware-dependent.
For an IO-bound workload, the regression may be up to 8%, even with common C-state settings. A 6% difference in average disk service time has been observed, which in turn seems to be
caused by a 10% higher average read size at the drive on RHEL7. The read sizes issued by HBase are the same in both cases, so the root cause seems to be a change in the EXT4 filesystem or the Linux
block IO later. The root cause is still under investigation.

Bug: None
Severity: Medium
Workaround: Avoid using RHEL 7 if you have a latency-critical workload. For a cached workload, consider tuning the C-state (power-saving) behavior of your
CPUs.



Export to Azure Blob Storage (the wasb:// or wasbs:// protocol) is not supported

CDH 5.3 and higher supports Azure Blob Storage for some applications. However, a null pointer exception occurs when you specify a wasb:// or wasbs:// location in the --copy-to option of the ExportSnapshot command or as the output directory (the second
positional argument) of the Export command.
Workaround: None.
Apache Issue: HADOOP-12717



AccessController postOperation problems in asynchronous operations

When security and Access Control are enabled, the following problems occur:

If a Delete Table fails for a reason other than missing permissions, the access rights are removed but the table may still exist and may be used
again.


If hbaseAdmin.modifyTable() is used to delete column families, the rights are not removed from the Access Control List (ACL) table. The postOperation is implemented only for postDeleteColumn().


If Create Table fails, full rights for that table persist for the user who attempted to create it. If another user later succeeds in creating the table,
the user who made the failed attempt still has the full rights.

Workaround: None

Hive Known Issues

Query with an empty WHERE clause problematic if vectorization is off

Specific WHERE clauses cause problems if vectorization is off. For example,
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT cint) FROM alltypesorc WHERE cstring1;
SELECT 1 WHERE 1;
If vectorization is turned on and no rules turn off the vectorization, queries run as expected.
Workaround: Rewrite queries with casts or equals.
Affected Versions: 6.3.x, 6.2.x, 6.1.x, 6.0.x
Apache Issue: HIVE-15408
Cloudera Issue: CDH-81649



Query with DISTINCT can fail if vectorization is on

A query can fail when vectorization is turned on, the query contains DISTINCT, and other rules do not turn off the vectorization. A query-specific error message appears, for example:

Error: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: SemanticException org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: The column KEY._col2:0._col0 is not in the vectorization context column map {KEY._col0=0, KEY._col1=1, KEY._col2=2}. (state=42000,code=40000)
Workaround: Turn off verctorization for such queries as follows:
set hive.vectorized.execution.enabled=false;
Affected Versions: 6.3.x, 6.2.x, 6.1.x, 6.0.x
Apache Issue: HIVE-19032
Cloudera Issue: CDH-81341



When vectorization is enabled on any file type (ORC, Parquet) queries that divide by zero using the modulo operator (%) return an error

When vectorization is enabled for Hive on any file type, including ORC and Parquet, if the query divides by zero using the modulo operator (%), it returns
the following error: Arithmetic exception [divide by] 0. For example, if you run the following query this issue is triggered: SELECT 100 %
column_c1 FROM table_t1; and the value in column_c1 is zero. The divide operator (/) is not affected by this issue.
Workaround: Disable vectorization for the query that is triggering this at either the session level by using the SET
statement or at the server level by disabling the property with Cloudera Manager. For information about how to enable or disable query vectorization, see Enabling Hive Query Vectorization.
Affected Versions: When query vectorization is enabled for Hive, this issue affects Hive ORC tables in all versions of CDH and affects Hive Parquet tables
in CDH 6.0 and later
Apache Issue: HIVE-19564
Cloudera Issue: CDH-71211



When vectorization is enabled for Hive on any file type (ORC, Parquet) queries that perform comparisons in the SELECT clause on large values in columns with the data
type of BIGINT might return wrong results

When vectorization is enabled for Hive on any file type, including ORC and Parquet, if the query performs a comparison operation between very large values in columns that are
BIGINT data types in the SELECT clause of the query, incorrect results might be returned. Comparison operators include ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >=. This issue does not
occur when the comparison operation is performed in the filtering clause of the query. This issue can also occur when the difference of values in such columns is out of range for a LONG (64-bit) data type. For example, if column_c1 stores 8976171455044006767 and column_c2 stores -7272907770454997143, a query such as SELECT column_c1 < column_c2 FROM table_test returns
true instead of false because the difference (8976171455044006767 - (-7272907770454997143)) is 1.6249079225499E19 which is greater than
9.22337203685478E18, which is the maximum possible value that a LONG (64-bit) data type can hold.
Workaround: Use a DECIMAL type instead of BIGINT for columns that might contain very large
values. Another option is to disable vectorization for the query that is triggering this at either the session level by using the SET statement or at the server level
by disabling the property with Cloudera Manager. For information about how to enable or disable query vectorization, see Enabling Hive Query Vectorization.
Affected Versions: When query vectorization is enabled for Hive, this issue affects Hive ORC tables in all versions of CDH and affects Hive Parquet tables
in CDH 6.0 and later
Apache Issue: HIVE_20207
Cloudera Issue: CDH-70996



Specified column position in the ORDER BY clause is not supported for SELECT * queries

When column positions are specified in ORDER BY clauses, they are not honored for SELECT * queries and an error is
returned as shown in the following example:

CREATE TABLE decimal_1 (id decimal(5,0));
SELECT * FROM decimal_1 ORDER BY 1 limit 100;
Error while compiling statement: FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10219]: Position in ORDER BY is not supported when using SELECT *
          
Instead the query must list out the columns it is selecting.
Affected Versions: CDH 6.0.0 and higher
Cloudera Issue: CDH-68550



DirectSQL with PostgreSQL

Hive doesn't support Hive direct SQL queries with PostgreSQL database. It only supports this feature with MySQL, MariaDB, and Oracle. With PostgresSQL, direct SQL is disabled as a
precaution, since there have been issues reported upstream where it is not possible to fallback on DataNucleus in the event of some failures, plus other non-standard behaviors. For more information,
see Hive Configuration Properties.
Affected Versions: All CDH versions

Cloudera Bug: CDH-81322



Logging differences create Supportability Issues

In the event you need Apache Hive support from Cloudera, the availability of logs is critical. Some CDH releases do not enable log4j2 logging for Hive by default. Because of this, logs
are not generated. Furthermore, the specified CDH releases are not configured to remove old log files to make room for new ones. This can cause the new logs to be lost. When Hive logs are missing,
Support cannot troubleshoot Hive problems efficiently.

Hive on Spark queries fail with "Timed out waiting for client to connect" for an unknown reason

If this exception is preceded by logs of the form "client.RpcRetryingCaller: Call exception...", then this failure is due to an unavailable HBase service. On a secure cluster,
spark-submit will try to obtain delegation tokens from HBase, even though Hive on Spark might not need them. So if HBase is unavailable, spark-submit throws an exception.
Workaround: Fix the HBase service, or set spark.yarn.security.tokens.hbase.enabled to false.

High DDL usage in Hue Impala Editor may issue flood of INVALIDATE Calls

Issuing DDL statements using Hue’s Impala editor or invoking Hue’s “Refresh Cache” function in the left-side metadata browser results in Hue issuing INVALIDATE METADATA calls to the
Impala service. This call is expensive and can result in a significant system impact, up to and including full system outage, when repeated in sufficient volume. This has been corrected in
HUE-8882.
Components affected:

Hue
Impala


Products affected:

Cloudera Enterprise 5
Cloudera Enterprise 6


Releases affected:

CDH 5.15.1, 5.15.2
CDH 5.16.x
CDH 6.1.1
CDH 6.2.x
CDH 6.3.0, 6.3.1, 6.3.2, 6.3.3


Users affected: End-users using Impala editor in Hue.
Severity: High
Impact: Users running DDL statements using the Hue Impala editor or invoking Hue’s Refresh Cache function causes INVALIDATE METADATA commands to be sent to
Impala. Impala’s metadata invalidation is an expensive operation and could cause impact on the performance of subsequent queries, hence leading to the potential for significant impact on the entire
cluster, including the potential for whole-system outage.
Action required:

CDH 6.x customers: Upgrade to CDH 6.3.4 that contains the fix.
CDH 5.x customers: Contact Cloudera Support for further assistance.

Hue Silently Disables StartTLS in LDAP Connections

There are two mechanisms to secure communication to an LDAP server. One is to use an ‘ldaps’ connection, where all traffic is encrypted inside a TLS tunnel - much like ‘https’. The other
is to use ‘StartTLS’, where traffic begins unencrypted in the “ldap” protocol and then upgrades itself to a TLS connection.
If StartTLS is enabled in the Hue configuration but the ‘ldap_cert’ parameter is not configured, then Hue silently disables StartTLS.
StartTLS will not be used for synchronization or import, even if StartTLS is enabled and the ‘ldap_cert’ parameter is set.
The result is that connections that the administrator assumes to be secured, using StartTLS, are not actually secure.
CVE: CVE-2019-19146
Date/time of detection: 22nd March, 2019
Detected by: Ben Gooley, Cloudera
Severity (Low/Medium/High): 8.8 High CVSS AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Table Browser Must Be Refreshed to View Tables Created with the Data Import Wizard

When you create a new table from a file by using the Data Import Wizard, the newly created table columns do not display in the Table Browser until you refresh it.
For example:


Create a table from the sample file web_logs_2.csv by clicking the plus sign in the left panel, which launches the Data Import Wizard:





After you define the table, click Submit to generate the new table:





After you generate the new table, you can see it listed on the left assist panel, but when you click the table name to display the columns, an error displays:





Workaround:


Click the information icon that is adjacent to the new table:





In the information window that opens, click the refresh icon in the upper right corner to view the table columns:



Using the refresh icon in the information window is the least expensive way to refresh the page so performance is not affected.


Affected Version(s): CDH 6.2.0
Cloudera Issue:CDH-77238

Impala Known Issues: Startup

These issues can prevent one or more Impala-related daemons from starting properly.


Impala requires FQDN from hostname command on kerberized clusters

The method Impala uses to retrieve the host name while constructing the Kerberos principal is the gethostname() system call. This function might not always
return the fully qualified domain name, depending on the network configuration. If the daemons cannot determine the FQDN, Impala does not start on a kerberized cluster.
Workaround: Test if a host is affected by checking whether the output of the hostname command includes the FQDN. On
hosts where hostname, only returns the short name, pass the command-line flag --hostname=fully_qualified_domain_name in the startup options of all Impala-related daemons.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-4978




Impala Known Issues: Crashes and Hangs

These issues can cause Impala to quit or become unresponsive.


Unable to view large catalog objects in catalogd Web UI

In catalogd Web UI, you can list metadata objects and view their details. These details are accessed via a link and printed to a string formatted using
thrift's DebugProtocol. Printing large objects (> 1 GB) in Web UI can crash catalogd.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-6841




Impala Known Issues: Performance

These issues involve the performance of operations such as queries or DDL statements.


Metadata operations block read-only operations on unrelated tables

Metadata operations that change the state of a table, like COMPUTE STATS or ALTER RECOVER PARTITIONS, may delay metadata
propagation of unrelated unloaded tables triggered by statements like DESCRIBE or SELECT queries.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-6671




Impala Known Issues: Security

These issues relate to security features, such as Kerberos authentication, Sentry authorization, encryption, auditing, and redaction.


Impala logs the session / operation secret on most RPCs at INFO level

Impala logs contain the session / operation secret. With this information a person who has access to the Impala logs might be able to hijack other users' sessions. This means
the attacker is able to execute statements for which they do not have the necessary privileges otherwise. Impala deployments where Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization is enabled may be
vulnerable to privilege escalation. Impala deployments where audit logging is enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging.
Restricting access to the Impala logs that expose secrets will reduce the risk of an attack. Additionally, restricting access to trusted users for the Impala deployment will
also reduce the risk of an attack. Log redaction techniques can be used to redact secrets from the logs. For more information, see the Cloudera Manager documentation.
For log redaction, users can create a rule with a search pattern: secret \(string\) [=:].*And the replacement could be for example: secret=LOG-REDACTED
This vulnerability is fixed upstream under IMPALA-10600
.

Impala does not support Heimdal Kerberos

Heimdal Kerberos is not supported in Impala.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-7072



System-wide auth-to-local mapping not applied correctly to Kudu service account

Due to system auth_to_local mapping, the principal may be mapped to some local name.
When running with Kerberos enabled, you may hit the following error message where <random-string> is some random string which doesn't match the
primary in the Kerberos principal.
WARNINGS: TransmitData() to X.X.X.X:27000 failed: Remote error: Not authorized: {username='<random-string>', principal='impala/redacted'} is not allowed to access DataStreamService

Workaround: Start Impala with the --use_system_auth_to_local=false flag to ignore the system-wide auth_to_local mappings configured in /etc/krb5.conf.
Affected Versions: CDH 5.15, CDH 6.1 and higher
Apache Issue: KUDU-2198




Impala Known Issues: Resources

These issues involve memory or disk usage, including out-of-memory conditions, the spill-to-disk feature, and resource management features.


Handling large rows during upgrade to CDH 5.13 / Impala 2.10 or higher

After an upgrade to CDH 5.13 / Impala 2.10 or higher, users who process very large column values (long strings), or have
increased the --read_size configuration setting from its default of 8 MB, might encounter capacity errors for some queries that previously worked.
Resolution: After the upgrade, follow the instructions in Handling Large Rows During Upgrade to CDH 5.13 / Impala 2.10 or Higher to check if your queries are affected by these changes and to modify your
configuration settings if so.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-6028



Configuration to prevent crashes caused by thread resource limits

Impala could encounter a serious error due to resource usage under very high concurrency. The error message is similar to:
F0629 08:20:02.956413 29088 llvm-codegen.cc:111] LLVM hit fatal error: Unable to allocate section memory!
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<boost::exception_detail::error_info_injector<boost::thread_resource_error> >'
Workaround:
In CDH 6.0 and lower versions of CDH, configure each host running an impalad daemon with the following settings:

echo 2000000 > /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
echo 2000000 > /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
echo 8000000 > /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count
In CDH 6.1 and higher versions, it is unlikely that you will hit the thread resource limit. Configure each host running an impalad daemon with the
following setting:
echo 8000000 > /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count
To make the above settings durable, refer to your OS documentation. For example, on RHEL 6.x:

Add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf:
vm.max_map_count=8000000
Run the following command:
sysctl -p


Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-5605



Breakpad minidumps can be very large when the thread count is high

The size of the breakpad minidump files grows linearly with the number of threads. By default, each thread adds 8 KB to the minidump size. Minidump files could consume significant disk
space when the daemons have a high number of threads.
Workaround: Add --minidump_size_limit_hint_kb=size to set a soft upper limit on the size of each minidump file. If the
minidump file would exceed that limit, Impala reduces the amount of information for each thread from 8 KB to 2 KB. (Full thread information is captured for the first 20 threads, then 2 KB per thread
after that.) The minidump file can still grow larger than the "hinted" size. For example, if you have 10,000 threads, the minidump file can be more than 20 MB.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-3509



Process mem limit does not account for the JVM's memory usage

Some memory allocated by the JVM used internally by Impala is not counted against the memory limit for the impalad daemon.
Workaround: To monitor overall memory usage, use the top command, or add the memory figures in the Impala web UI /memz tab to
JVM memory usage shown on the /metrics tab.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-691




Impala Known Issues: Correctness

These issues can cause incorrect or unexpected results from queries. They typically only arise in very specific circumstances.


Incorrect result due to constant evaluation in query with outer join

An OUTER JOIN query could omit some expected result rows due to a constant such as FALSE in another join
clause. For example:
explain SELECT 1 FROM alltypestiny a1
  INNER JOIN alltypesagg a2 ON a1.smallint_col = a2.year AND false
  RIGHT JOIN alltypes a3 ON a1.year = a1.bigint_col;
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Explain String                                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Estimated Per-Host Requirements: Memory=1.00KB VCores=1 |
|                                                         |
| 00:EMPTYSET                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-3094



% escaping does not work correctly in a LIKE clause

If the final character in the RHS argument of a LIKE operator is an escaped \% character, it does not match a
% final character of the LHS argument.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-2422



Crash: impala::Coordinator::ValidateCollectionSlots

A query could encounter a serious error if includes multiple nested levels of INNER JOIN clauses involving subqueries.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-2603




Impala Known Issues: Interoperability

These issues affect the ability to interchange data between Impala and other systems. They cover areas such as data types and file formats.


Queries Stuck on Failed HDFS Calls and not Timing out

In CDH 6.2 / Impala 3.2 and higher, if the following error appears multiple times in a short duration while running a query, it would mean that the connection between the impalad and the HDFS NameNode is in a bad state and hence the impalad would have to be restarted:
"hdfsOpenFile() for <filename> at backend <hostname:port> failed to finish before the <hdfs_operation_timeout_sec> second timeout " 
In CDH 6.1 / Impala 3.1 and lower, the same issue would cause Impala to wait for a long time or hang without showing the above error message.
Workaround: Restart the impalad in the bad state.
Affected Versions: All versions of Impala
Apache Issue: HADOOP-15720



Configuration needed for Flume to be compatible with Impala

For compatibility with Impala, the value for the Flume HDFS Sink hdfs.writeFormat must be set to Text, rather than its
default value of Writable. The hdfs.writeFormat setting must be changed to Text before creating data files
with Flume; otherwise, those files cannot be read by either Impala or Hive.
Resolution: This information has been requested to be added to the upstream Flume documentation.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Cloudera Issue: CDH-13199



Avro Scanner fails to parse some schemas

The default value in Avro schema must match the first union type. For example, if the default value is null, then the first type in the UNION must be "null".
Workaround: Swap the order of the fields in the schema specification. For example, use ["null", "string"] instead of
["string", "null"]. Note that the files written with the problematic schema must be rewritten with the new schema because Avro files have embedded schemas.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-635



Impala BE cannot parse Avro schema that contains a trailing semi-colon

If an Avro table has a schema definition with a trailing semicolon, Impala encounters an error when the table is queried.
Workaround: Remove trailing semicolon from the Avro schema.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-1024



Incorrect results with basic predicate on CHAR typed column

When comparing a CHAR column value to a string literal, the literal value is not blank-padded and so the comparison might fail when it should match.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-1652




Impala Known Issues: Limitations

These issues are current limitations of Impala that require evaluation as you plan how to integrate Impala into your data management workflow.


Set limits on size of expression trees

Very deeply nested expressions within queries can exceed internal Impala limits, leading to excessive memory usage.
Workaround: Avoid queries with extremely large expression trees. Setting the query option disable_codegen=true may reduce the
impact, at a cost of longer query runtime.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-4551



Impala does not support running on clusters with federated namespaces

Impala does not support running on clusters with federated namespaces. The impalad process will not start on a node running such a filesystem based on the
org.apache.hadoop.fs.viewfs.ViewFs class.
Workaround: Use standard HDFS on all Impala nodes.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-77



Hue and BDR require separate parameters for Impala Load Balancer

Cloudera Manager supports a single parameter for specifying the Impala Daemon Load Balancer. However, because BDR and Hue need to use different ports when connecting to the load
balancer, it is not possible to configure the load balancer value so that BDR and Hue will work correctly in the same cluster.
Workaround: To configure BDR with Impala, use the load balancer configuration either without a port specification or with the Beeswax port.
To configure Hue, use the Hue Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for impalad_flags to specify the load balancer address with the
HiveServer2 port.
Affected Versions: CDH versions from 5.11 to 6.0.1
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-46641




Impala Known Issues: Miscellaneous / Older Issues

These issues do not fall into one of the above categories or have not been categorized yet.


Unable to Correctly Parse the Terabyte Unit

Impala does not support parsing strings that contain "TB" when used as a unit for terabytes. The flags related to memory limits may be affected, such as the flags for scratch space and
data cache.
Workaround: Use other supported units to specify values, e.g. GB or MB.
Affected Versions: CDH 6.3.x and lower versions
Fixed Versions: CDH 6.4.0
Apache Issue: IMPALA-8829



A failed CTAS does not drop the table if the insert fails

If a CREATE TABLE AS SELECT operation successfully creates the target table but an error occurs while querying the source table or copying the data, the
new table is left behind rather than being dropped.
Workaround: Drop the new table manually after a failed CREATE TABLE AS SELECT.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-2005



Casting scenarios with invalid/inconsistent results

Using a CAST function to convert large literal values to smaller types, or to convert special values such as NaN
or Inf, produces values not consistent with other database systems. This could lead to unexpected results from queries.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-1821



Impala should tolerate bad locale settings

If the LC_* environment variables specify an unsupported locale, Impala does not start.
Workaround: Add LC_ALL="C" to the environment settings for both the Impala daemon and the Statestore daemon. See Modifying Impala Startup Options for details about modifying these environment settings.
Resolution: Fixing this issue would require an upgrade to Boost 1.47 in the Impala distribution.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Apache Issue: IMPALA-532





EMC Isilon Known Issues

CDH 6.0 is not currently supported on EMC Isilon.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions
Fixed Versions: CDH 6.3.1



Apache Kafka Known Issues


Topics Created with the "kafka-topics" Tool Might Not Be Secured

Topics that are created and deleted via Kafka are secured (for example, auto created topics). However, most topic creation and deletion is done via the kafka-topics tool, which talks directly to ZooKeeper or some other third-party tool that talks directly to ZooKeeper. Because security is the responsibility of ZooKeeper
authorization and authentication, Kafka cannot prevent users from making ZooKeeper changes. Anyone with access to ZooKeeper can create and delete topics. They will not be able to describe, read, or
write to the topics even if they can create them.
The following commands talk directly to ZooKeeper and therefore are not secured via Kafka:

kafka-topics.sh
kafka-configs.sh
kafka-preferred-replica-election.sh
kafka-reassign-partitions.sh





"offsets.topic.replication.factor" Must Be Less Than or Equal to the Number of Live Brokers

The offsets.topic.replication.factor broker configuration is now enforced upon auto topic creation. Internal auto topic creation will fail with a
GROUP_COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE error until the cluster size meets this replication factor requirement.



Requests Fail When Sending to a Nonexistent Topic with "auto.create.topics.enable" Set to True

The first few produce requests fail when sending to a nonexistent topic with auto.create.topics.enable set to true.
Workaround: Increase the number of retries in the Producer configuration setting retries.



Custom Kerberos Principal Names Cannot Be Used for Kerberized ZooKeeper and Kafka instances

When using ZooKeeper authentication and a custom Kerberos principal, Kerberos-enabled Kafka does not start.
Workaround: None. You must disable ZooKeeper authentication for Kafka or use the default Kerberos principals for ZooKeeper and Kafka.



Performance Degradation When SSL Is Enabled

Significant performance degradation can occur when SSL is enabled. The impact varies depending on your CPU, JVM version, and message size. Consumers are typically more affected than
producers.
Workaround: Configure brokers and clients with ssl.secure.random.implementation = SHA1PRNG. It often reduces this degradation
drastically, but its effect is CPU and JVM dependent.
Affected Versions: CDK 2.x and later
Fixed Versions: None
Apache Issue: KAFKA-2561
Cloudera Issue: None



The Idempotent and Transactional Capabilities of Kafka are Incompatible with Sentry

The idempotent and transactional capabilities of Kafka are not compatible with Sentry. The issue is due to Sentry being unable to handle authorization policies for Kafka transactions. As
a result, users cannot use Kafka transaction in combination with Sentry.
Workaround: Use the Sentry super user in applications where idempotent producing is a requirement or disable Sentry.
Affected Versions: CDK 4.0 and later, CDH 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.1.0, 6.1.1, 6.2.0, 6.3.0
Fixed Versions: CDH 6.2.1, 6.3.1
Apache Issue: N/A
Cloudera Issue: CDH-80606



Kafka Garbage Collection Logs are Written to the Process Directory


By default Kafka garbage collection logs are written to the CDH process directory. Changing the default path for these log files is currently unsupported.
Workaround: N/A
Affected Versions:All
Fixed Versions: N/A
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-43236




MirrorMaker Does Not Start When Sentry is Enabled

When MirrorMaker is used in conjunction with Sentry, MirrorMaker reports an authorization issue and does not start. This is due to Sentry being unable to authorize the kafka_mirror_maker principal which is automatically created.
Workaround: Complete the following steps prior to enabling Sentry:

Create the kafka_mirror_maker Linux user ID and the kafka_mirror_maker Linux group ID on the MirrorMaker hosts. Use the
following command:
useradd kafka_mirror_maker
Create the necessary Sentry rules for the kafka_mirror_maker group.
Note: Alternatively, you can add the kafka_mirror_maker user to super.users, this
bypasses authorization.



Affected Versions: CDH 6.0.0 and later
Fixed Versions: N/A
Apache Issue: N/A
Cloudera Issue: CDH-53706



The SentryKafkaAuthorizer throws an exception when describing ACLs via Kafka AdminClient

If Sentry contains Kafka authorization policies for any ConsumerGroup resource, Kafka authorization policies cannot be described and manipulated via Kafka
AdminClient. This is due to a conversion error in Sentry. The SentryKafkaAuthorizer throws the following exception when converting the
ConsumerGroup resource type between Sentry and Kafka libraries.

kafka.common.KafkaException: CONSUMERGROUP not a valid resourceType name. The valid names are Topic,Group,Cluster,TransactionalId,DelegationToken 
This issue impacts any application that uses the ACL manipulation methods of KafkaAdminClient in Sentry enabled environments.
Workaround: Remove authorization policies for Kafka consumer groups in Sentry.
Affected Versions: CDH 5.x, CDH 6.3.0, 6.3.1, 6.3.2
Fixed Versions: 6.3.3
Apache Issue: SENTRY-2535
Cloudera Issue: CDH-82457




Apache Kudu Known Issues

The following are known bugs and issues in Kudu. Note that this list is not exhaustive, and is meant to communicate only the most important known issues.


Kudu tablet server might crash in certain workflows where a tablet is dropped right after ALTER TABLE statement

DDL and DML operations can accumulate in the Kudu tablet replica's write ahead log (WAL) during normal operation. Upon the shutdown of a tablet replica (for example, right before
removing the replica), information on the accumulated operations (first 50) are printed into the tablet server's INFO log file.
A bug was introduced with the fix for KUDU-2690. The code contains a flipped if-condition that results in de-referencing of an invalid pointer while reporting on a pending ALTER TABLE
operation in the tablet replica's WAL. The issue manifests itself in kudu-tserver processes crashing with SIGSEGV (segmentation fault).
The occurrence of the issue is limited to scenarios which result in accumulating at least one pending ALTER TABLE operation in the tablet replica's WAL at the time when the tablet
replica is shut down. An example scenario is an ALTER TABLE request (for example, adding a column) immediately followed by a request to drop a tablet (for example, drop a range partition). Another
example scenario is shutting down a tablet server while it's still processing an ALTER TABLE request for one of its tablet replicas. A slowness in file system operations increases the chances for the
issue to manifest itself.
Apache issue: KUDU-2690
Component affected: Kudu
Products affected: CDH
Releases affected:

CDH 6.2.0, 6.2.1
CDH 6.3.0, 6.3.1, 6.3.2, 6.3.3


Users affected: Kudu clusters with the impacted releases.
Impact:In the worst case, multiple kudu-tserver processes can crash in a Kudu cluster, making data unavailable until the affected tablet servers are started
back.
Severity: High
Action required:

Workaround: Avoid dropping range partitions and tablets right after issuing ALTER TABLE request. Wait for the pending ALTER TABLE requests to complete
before dropping tablets or shutting down tablet servers.
Solution: Upgrade to CDH 6.3.4 or CDP


Knowledge article: For the latest update on this issue see the corresponding Knowledge article:
TSB 2020-449: Kudu tablet server might
crash in certain workflows where a tablet is dropped right after ALTER TABLE statement



You get "The user 'kudu' is not part of group 'hive' on the following hosts: " warning by the Host Inspector

If you are using fine grained authorization for Kudu, and you are also using Kudu-HMS integration with HDFS-Sentry sync, then you may get the "The user
'kudu' is not part of group 'hive' on the following hosts: " warning while upgrading to CDH 6.3.
Workaround: Run the following command on all the HMS servers:
usermod -aG hive kudu
Affected Versions: CDH 6.3 / Kudu 1.10



Longer Startup Times with a Large Number of Tablets

If a tablet server has a very large number of tablets, it may take several minutes to start up. It is recommended to limit the number of tablets per server to 1000 or fewer. The maximum
allowed number of tablets is 2000 per server. Consider this limitation when pre-splitting your tables. If you notice slow start-up times, you can monitor the number of tablets per server in the web
UI.
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions



Fault Tolerant Scan Memory Issue

Unlike regular scans, fault tolerant scans will allocate all required memory when the scan begins rather than as it progresses. This can be significant for big tablets. Moreover, this
memory usage isn't counted towards the tablet server's overall memory limit, raising the likelihood of the tablet server being out-of-memory killed by the kernel.
Affected Versions: CDH 6.2 / Kudu 1.9 and lower
Apache Issue: KUDU-2466

Affected Versions: All CDH 6 versions




Apache Oozie Known Issues

Oozie jobs fail (gracefully) on secure YARN clusters when JobHistory server is down

If the JobHistory server is down on a YARN (MRv2) cluster, Oozie attempts to submit a job, by default, three times. If the job fails, Oozie automatically puts the workflow in a
SUSPEND state.
Workaround: When the JobHistory server is running again, use the resume command to tell Oozie to continue the workflow
from the point at which it left off.
Affected Versions: CDH 5 and higher
Cloudera Issue: CDH-14623




Apache Parquet Known Issues

There are no known issues in Parquet.



Apache Phoenix Known Issues

The current release includes the following known issue:


Phoenix artifacts in the Maven repository have transitive dependencies on some unavailable artifacts

The Phoenix artifacts provided in the Maven repository have transitive dependencies on some artifacts that are not available either in the Apache central repository, the Cloudera
provided CDH repository, or the Cloudera provided Phoenix repository.
Workaround: When you add a dependency on any of the provided Maven Phoenix artifacts, you must exclude the org.glassfish.web:javax.servlet.jsp artifact.
For example:
<dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.phoenix</groupId>
            <artifactId>phoenix-core</artifactId>
            <version>5.0.0-cdh6.2.0</version>
            <exclusions>
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>org.glassfish.web</groupId>
                    <artifactId>javax.servlet.jsp</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
            </exclusions>
        </dependency>
Affected Versions: CDH 6.2.0, 6.2.1, 6.3.0
Cloudera Issue: CDH-81419




Apache Pig Known Issues

There are no known issues in this release.



Cloudera Search Known Issues

The current release includes the following known limitations:


Splitshard of HDFS index checks local filesystem and fails

When performing a shard split on an index that is stored on HDFS, SplitShardCmd still evaluates free disk space on the local file system of the server
where Solr is installed. This may cause the command to fail, perceiving that there is no adequate disk space to perform the shard split.
Workaround: None
Affected versions: All



Default Solr core names cannot be changed (limitation)

Although it is technically possible to give user-defined Solr core names during core creation, it is to be avoided in te context of Cloudera Search. Cloudera Manager expects core names
in the default "collection_shardX_replicaY" format. Altering core names results in Cloudera Manager being unable to fetch Solr metrics for the given core and this, eventually, may corrupt data
collection for co-located core, or even shard and server level charts.



Processing UpdateRequest with delegation token throws NullPointerException

When using the Spark Crunch Indexer or another client application which utilizes the SolrJ API to send Solr Update requests with delegation token authentication, the server side
processing of the request might fail with a NullPointerException.
Affected Versions: CDH 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.1.0, 6.1.1, 6.2.0, 6.2.1, 6.3.0, 6.3.1, 6.3.2
Fixed Version: CDH 6.3.3
Apache Issue: SOLR-13921
Cloudera Issue: CDH-82599



Solr service with no added collections causes the upgrade process to fail

CDH 5.x to CDH 6.x upgrade fails while performing the bootstrap collections step of the solr-upgrade.sh script with the error message:
Failed to execute command Bootstrap Solr Collections on service Solr
if there are no collections present in Solr.
Workaround: If there are no collections added to it, remove the Solr service from your cluster before you start the upgrade.
Affected Versions: CDH 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.1.0, 6.1.1, 6.2.0, 6.2.1, 6.3.0, 6.3.1, 6.3.2
Fixed Version: CDH 6.3.3
Cloudera Issue: CDH-82042



HBase Lily indexer might fail to write role log files

In certain scenarios the HBase Lily Indexer (Key-Value Store Indexer) fails to write its role log files.
Workaround: None
Affected Versions: CDH 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.1.0, 6.1.1, 6.2.0, 6.2.1, 6.3.0, 6.3.1, 6.3.2
Fixed Version: CDH 6.3.3
Cloudera Issue: CDH-82342



Adding a new indexer instance to HBase Lily Indexer fails with GSSException

When Kerberos authentication is enabled and adding a new indexer instance to HBase Lily Indexer (Key-Value Store Indexer), the authentication might fail when Lily is communicating to the
HBase Master process, throwing a similar Exception:
javax.security.sasl.SaslException: GSS initiate failed [Caused by GSSException: No valid credentials provided (Mechanism level: Failed to find any Kerberos tgt)]
Workaround: Ensure that the Lily indexer has a Sentry dependency configured by following these steps:

Go to Cloudera Manager > Key-Value Store indexer > Configuration.
Make sure the Sentry Service configuration option points to a Sentry service instance instead of none.

The workaround does not require defining any Sentry roles or privileges, it is just to trigger a code execution path which will authenticate the HBase service user.
Affected Versions: CDH 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.1.0, 6.1.1, 6.2.0, 6.2.1, 6.3.0, 6.3.1, 6.3.2
Fixed Version: CDH 6.3.3
Cloudera Issue: CDH-82566



Solr SQL, Graph, and Stream Handlers are Disabled if Collection Uses Document-Level Security

The Solr SQL, Graph, and Stream handlers do not support document-level security, and are disabled if document-level security is enabled on the collection. If necessary, these handlers
can be re-enabled by setting the following Java system properties, but document-level security is not enforced for these handlers:

SQL: solr.sentry.enableSqlQuery=true
Graph: solr.sentry.enableGraphQuery=true
Stream: solr.sentry.enableStreams=true

Workaround: None
Affected Versions: All CDH 6 releases
Cloudera Issue: CDH-66345



Collection Creation No Longer Supports Automatically Selecting A Configuration If Only One Exists

Before CDH 5.5.0, a collection could be created without specifying a configuration. If no -c value was specified, then:

If there was only one configuration, that configuration was chosen.
If the collection name matched a configuration name, that configuration was chosen.

Search for CDH 5.5.0 includes multiple built-in configurations. As a result, there is no longer a case in which only one configuration can be chosen by default.
Workaround: Explicitly specify the collection configuration to use by passing -c <configName> to solrctl collection --create.
Affected Versions: CDH 5.5.0 and higher
Cloudera Issue: CDH-34050



CrunchIndexerTool which includes Spark indexer requires specific input file format specifications

If the --input-file-format option is specified with CrunchIndexerTool, then its argument must be text, avro, or avroParquet, rather than a fully qualified class name.
Workaround: None
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-22190



The quickstart.sh file does not validate ZooKeeper and the NameNode on some operating systems

The quickstart.sh file uses the timeout function to determine if ZooKeeper and the NameNode are available. To ensure this
check can be complete as intended, the quickstart.sh determines if the operating system on which the script is running supports timeout.
If the script detects that the operating system does not support timeout, the script continues without checking if the NameNode and ZooKeeper are available. If your
environment is configured properly or you are using an operating system that supports timeout, this issue does not apply.
Workaround: This issue only occurs in some operating systems. If timeout is not available, the quickstart continues and final
validation is always done by the MapReduce jobs and Solr commands that are run by the quickstart.
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-19923



Field value class guessing and Automatic schema field addition are not supported with the MapReduceIndexerTool nor the HBaseMapReduceIndexerTool

The MapReduceIndexerTool and the HBaseMapReduceIndexerTool can be used with a Managed Schema created via NRT indexing of documents or via the Solr Schema API. However, neither tool
supports adding fields automatically to the schema during ingest.
Workaround: Define the schema before running the MapReduceIndexerTool or HBaseMapReduceIndexerTool. In non-schemaless mode, define in the schema using the
schema.xml file. In schemaless mode, either define the schema using the Solr Schema API or index sample documents using NRT indexing before invoking the tools. In
either case, Cloudera recommends that you verify that the schema is what you expect using the List Fields API command.
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-26856



The Browse and Spell Request Handlers are not enabled in schemaless mode

The Browse and Spell Request Handlers require certain fields be present in the schema. Since those fields cannot be guaranteed to exist in a
Schemaless setup, the Browse and Spell Request Handlers are not enabled by default.
Workaround: If you require the “Browse” and “Spell” Request Handlers, add them to the solrconfig.xml configuration file.
Generate a non-schemaless configuration to see the usual settings and modify the required fields to fit your schema.
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-19407



Enabling blockcache writing may result in unusable indexes

It is possible to create indexes with solr.hdfs.blockcache.write.enabled set to true. Such indexes may appear corrupt to
readers, and reading these indexes may irrecoverably corrupt indexes. Blockcache writing is disabled by default.
Workaround: None
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-17978



Users with insufficient Solr permissions may receive a "Page Loading" message from the Solr Web Admin UI

Users who are not authorized to use the Solr Admin UI are not given page explaining that access is denied, and instead receive a web page that never finishes loading.
Workaround: None
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-58276



Using MapReduceIndexerTool or HBaseMapReduceIndexerTool multiple times may produce duplicate entries in a collection.

Repeatedly running the MapReduceIndexerTool on the same set of input files can result in duplicate entries in the Solr collection. This occurs because the tool can only insert documents
and cannot update or delete existing Solr documents. This issue does not apply to the HBaseMapReduceIndexerTool unless it is run with more than zero reducers.
Workaround: To avoid this issue, use HBaseMapReduceIndexerTool with zero reducers. This must be done without Kerberos.
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-15441



Deleting collections might fail if hosts are unavailable

It is possible to delete a collection when hosts that host some of the collection are unavailable. After such a deletion, if the previously unavailable hosts are brought back online, the
deleted collection may be restored.
Workaround: Ensure all hosts are online before deleting collections.
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-58694



Saving search results is not supported

Cloudera Search does not support the ability to save search results.
Workaround: None
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-21162



HDFS Federation is not supported

Cloudera Search does not support HDFS Federation.
Workaround: None
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-11357



Solr contrib modules are not supported

Solr contrib modules are not supported (Morphlines, Spark Crunch indexer, MapReduce and Lily HBase indexers are part of the Cloudera Search product itself,
therefore they are supported).
Workaround: None
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-72658



Using the Sentry Service with Cloudera Search may introduce latency

Using the Sentry Service with Cloudera Search may introduce latency because authorization requests must be sent to the Sentry Service.
Workaround: You can alleviate this latency by enabling caching for the Sentry Service. For instructions, see: Enabling Caching for the Sentry Service.
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-73407



Solr Sentry integration limitation where two Solr deployments depend on the same Sentry service

If multiple Solr instances are configured to depend on the same Sentry service, it is not possible to create unique Solr Sentry privileges per Solr deployment. Since privileges are
enforced in all Solr instances simultaneously, you cannot add distinct privileges that apply to one Solr cluster, but not to another.
Workaround: None
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-72676



Collection state goes down after Solr SSL

If you enable TLS/SSL on a Solr instance with existing collections, the collections will break and become unavailable. Collections created after enabling TLS/SSL are not affected by this
issue.
Workaround: Recreate the collection after enabling TLS. For more information, see How to update existing collections in Non-SSL to SSL in
Solr.
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDPD-4139




Apache Sentry Known Issues

Sentry does not support Kafka topic name with more than 64 characters

A Kafka topic name can have 249 characters, but Sentry only supports topic names up to 64 characters.
Workaround: Keep Kafka topic names to 64 charcters or less.
Affected Versions: All CDH 5.x and 6.x versions
Cloudera Issue: CDH-64317



SHOW ROLE GRANT GROUP raises exception for a group that was never granted a role

If you run the command SHOW ROLE GRANT GROUP for a group that has never been granted a role, beeline raises an exception. However, if you run the same command for a group that does not
have any roles, but has at one time been granted a role, you do not get an exception, but instead get an empty list of roles granted to the group.
Workaround: Adding a role will prevent the exception.
Affected Versions:


CDH 5.16.0
CDH 6.0.0


Cloudera Issue: CDH-71694



GRANT/REVOKE operations could fail if there are too many concurrent requests

Under a significant workload, Grant/Revoke operations can have issues.
Workaround: If you need to make many privilege changes, plan them at a time when you do not need to do too many at once.
Affected Versions: CDH 5.13.0 and above
Apache Issue: SENTRY-1855
Cloudera Issue: CDH-56553



Creating large set of Sentry roles results in performance problems

Using more than a thousand roles/permissions might cause significant performance problems.
Workaround: Plan your roles so that groups have as few roles as possible and roles have as few permissions as possible.
Affected Versions: CDH 5.13.0 and above
Cloudera Issue: CDH-59010



Users can't track jobs with Hive and Sentry

As a prerequisite of enabling Sentry, Hive impersonation is turned off, which means all YARN jobs are submitted to the Hive job queue, and are run as the hive user. This is an issue because the YARN History Server now has to block users from accessing logs for their own jobs, since their own usernames are not associated with the
jobs. As a result, end users cannot access any job logs unless they can get sudo access to the cluster as the hdfs, hive or other admin users.
In CDH 5.8 (and higher), Hive overrides the default configuration, mapred.job.queuename, and places incoming jobs into the connected user's job queue, even
though the submitting user remains hive. Hive obtains the relevant queue/username information for each job by using YARN's fair-scheduler.xml file.
Affected Versions: CDH 5.2.0 and above
Cloudera Issue: CDH-22890



Column-level privileges are not supported on Hive Metastore views

GRANT and REVOKE for column level privileges is not supported on Hive Metastore views.
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: SENTRY-754



SELECT privilege on all columns does not equate to SELECT privilege on table

Users who have been explicitly granted the SELECT privilege on all columns of a table, will not have the permission to perform
table-level operations. For example, operations such as SELECT COUNT (1) or SELECT COUNT (*) will not work even if you have the
SELECT privilege on all columns.
There is one exception to this. The SELECT * FROM TABLE command will work even if you do not have explicit table-level access.
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: SENTRY-838



The EXPLAIN SELECT operation works without table or column-level privileges

Users are able to run the EXPLAIN SELECT operation, exposing metadata for all columns, even for tables/columns to which they weren't explicitly granted
access.
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: SENTRY-849



Object types Server and URI are not supported in SHOW GRANT ROLE roleName on OBJECT objectName

Workaround:Use SHOW GRANT ROLE roleNameto list all privileges granted to the role.
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: N/A
Cloudera Issue: CDH-19430



Relative URI paths not supported by Sentry

Sentry supports only absolute (not relative) URI paths in permission grants. Although some early releases (for example, CDH 5.7.0) might not have raised explicit errors when relative
paths were set, upgrading a system that uses relative paths causes the system to lose Sentry permissions.
Resolution: Revoke privileges that have been set using relative paths, and grant permissions using absolute paths before upgrading.
Affected Versions: All versions. Relative paths are not supported in Sentry for permission grants.




Absolute (Use this form)
Relative (Do not use this form)




hdfs://absolute/path/
hdfs://relative/path


s3a://bucketname/
s3a://bucketname








Apache Spark Known Issues

The following sections describe the current known issues and limitations in Apache Spark 2.x as distributed with CDH 6.1.x. In some cases, a feature from the
upstream Apache Spark project is currently not considered reliable enough to be supported by Cloudera.

Continue reading:

RDD.repartition() has different failure handling in Spark 2.4 and may cause job failures
Structured Streaming exactly-once fault tolerance constraints

RDD.repartition() has different failure handling in Spark 2.4 and may cause job failures

The RDD.repartition() transformation, which reshuffles data in the RDD randomly to create either more or fewer partitions and then balances it across the
partitions, was using a round-robin method to distribute data that caused incorrect answers to be returned for RDD jobs. This issue has been corrected, but it introduced a behavior change in RDD job
failure handling. Now, Spark actively fails a job if there is a fetch failure that was caused by a node failure after repartitioning.
Workaround: Use the RDD.checkpoint() method to save the intermediate RDD data to HDFS. First, call SparkContext.setCheckpointDir(directory: String) to set the checkpoint directory where the intermediate data will be saved. Note that the directory must be an HDFS path. Then mark
the RDD for checkpointing by calling RDD.checkpoint() when you use the RDD.repartition() transformation.
Apache Issue: SPARK-23243
Cloudera Issue: CDH-76413



Structured Streaming exactly-once fault tolerance constraints

In Spark Structured Streaming, the exactly-once fault tolerance for file sink is valid only for files that are in the manifest. These files are located in
the _spark_metadata subdirectory of the file sink output directory. Only process files that have file names starting with digits. Other
temporary files can also appear in this directory, but they should not be processed. Typically, these temporary file file names start with a period (".").
You can list the valid manifest files, excluding the temporary files, by using a command like the following, which assumes your output directory is located at /tmp/output. As the appropriate user, run the following command to list the valid manifest files:

hadoop fs -ls /tmp/output/_spark_metadata/[0-9]*
      
Workaround: None
Affected Versions: CDH 6.1.0 and higher
Cloudera Issue: CDH-75191



Spark SQL does not respect size limit for the varchar type

Spark SQL treats varchar as a string (that is, there no size limit). The observed behavior is that Spark reads and writes these columns as regular strings;
if inserted values exceed the size limit, no error will occur. The data will be truncated when read from Hive, but not when read from Spark.
Workaround: None
Affected Versions: CDH 5.5.0 and higher
Apache Issue: SPARK-5918
Cloudera Issue: CDH-33642



Spark SQL does not prevent you from writing key types not supported by Avro tables

Spark allows you to declare DataFrames with any key type. Avro supports only string keys and trying to write any other key type to an Avro table will fail.
Workaround: None
Affected Versions: CDH 5.5.0 and higher
Cloudera Issue: CDH-33648



Spark SQL does not support timestamp in Avro tables

Workaround: None
Affected Versions: CDH 5.5.0 and higher
Cloudera Issue: CDH-33649



Dynamic allocation and Spark Streaming

If you are using Spark Streaming, Cloudera recommends that you disable dynamic allocation by setting spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled to false when running streaming applications.



Limitation with Region Pruning for HBase Tables

When SparkSQL accesses an HBase table through the HiveContext, region pruning is not performed. This limitation can result in slower performance
for some SparkSQL queries against tables that use the HBase SerDes than when the same table is accessed through Impala or Hive.
Workaround: None
Affected Versions: All
Cloudera Issue: CDH-56330



Running spark-submit with --principal and --keytab arguments does not work
in client mode

The spark-submit script's --principal and --keytab arguments do not work with Spark-on-YARN's
client mode.
Workaround: Use cluster mode instead.
Affected Versions: All



The --proxy-user argument does not work in client mode

Using the --proxy-user argument in client mode does not work and is not supported.
Workaround: Use cluster mode instead.
Affected Versions: All



History link in ResourceManager web UI broken for killed Spark applications

When a Spark application is killed, the history link in the ResourceManager web UI does not work.
Workaround: To view the history for a killed Spark application, see the Spark HistoryServer web UI instead.
Affected Versions: All CDH versions
Apache Issue: None
Cloudera Issue: CDH-49165



ORC file format is not supported

Currently, Cloudera does not support reading and writing Hive tables containing data files in the Apache ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) format from Spark applications. Cloudera recommends
using Apache Parquet format for columnar data. That file format can be used with Spark, Hive, and Impala.




Apache Sqoop Known Issues

Column names cannot start with a number when importing data with the --as-parquetfile
option.

Currently, Sqoop is using an Avro schema when writing data as a parquet file. The Avro schema requires that column names do not start with numbers, therefore Sqoop is renaming
the columns in this case, prepending them with an underscore character. This can lead to issues when one wants to reuse the data in other tools, such as Impala.
Workaround: Rename the columns to comply with Avro limitations (start with letters or underscore, as specified in the Avro documentation).
Cloudera Issue: None



MySQL JDBC driver shipped with CentOS 6 systems does not work with Sqoop

CentOS 6 systems currently ship with version 5.1.17 of the MySQL JDBC driver. This version does not work correctly with Sqoop.
Workaround: Install version 5.1.31 of the JDBC driver as detailed in Installing the JDBC Drivers
for Sqoop 1.
Affected Versions: MySQL JDBC 5.1.17, 5.1.4, 5.3.0
Cloudera Issue: CDH-23180



MS SQL Server "integratedSecurity" option unavailable in Sqoop

The integratedSecurity option is not available in the Sqoop CLI.
Workaround: None
Cloudera Issue: None



Sqoop1 (doc import + --as-parquetfile) limitation with KMS/KTS Encryption at Rest

Due to a limitation with Kite SDK, it is not possible to use (sqoop import --as-parquetfile) with KMS/KTS Encryption zones. See the following example.
sqoop import --connect jdbc:db2://djaxludb1001:61035/DDBAT003 --username=dh810202 --P --target-dir /data/hive_scratch/ASDISBURSEMENT --delete-target-dir -m1 --query "select disbursementnumber,disbursementdate,xmldata FROM DB2dba.ASDISBURSEMENT where DISBURSEMENTNUMBER = 2011113210000115311 AND \$CONDITIONS" -hive-import --hive-database adminserver -hive-table asdisbursement_dave --map-column-java XMLDATA=String --as-parquetfile

Workaround: If you use the Parquet Hadoop API based implementation for importing into Parquet, specify a --target-dir which
is the same encryption zone as the Hive warehouse directory.
If you use the Kite Dataset API based implementation, use an alternate data file type, for example text or avro.
Apache Issue: SQOOP-2943
Cloudera Issue: CDH-40826



Doc import as Parquet files may result in out-of-memory errors

Out-of-memory (OOM) errors can be caused in the following two cases:

With many very large rows (multiple megabytes per row) before initial-page-run check (ColumnWriter)
When rows vary significantly by size so that the next-page-size check is based on small rows and is set very high followed by many large rows


Workaround: None, other than restructuring the data.
Apache Issue: PARQUET-99
