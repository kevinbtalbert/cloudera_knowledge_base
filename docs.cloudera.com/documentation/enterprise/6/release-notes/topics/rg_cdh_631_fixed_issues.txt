Fixed Issues in CDH 6.3.1


CDH 6.3.1 fixes the following issues:

Hue Silently Disables StartTLS in LDAP Connections
The Idempotent and Transactional Capabilities of Kafka are Incompatible with Sentry
Upstream Issues Fixed




Hue Silently Disables StartTLS in LDAP Connections

There are two mechanisms to secure communication to an LDAP server. One is to use an ‘ldaps’ connection, where all traffic is encrypted inside a TLS tunnel - much like ‘https’. The other
is to use ‘StartTLS’, where traffic begins unencrypted in the “ldap” protocol and then upgrades itself to a TLS connection.
If StartTLS is enabled in the Hue configuration but the ‘ldap_cert’ parameter is not configured, then Hue silently disables StartTLS.
StartTLS will not be used for synchronization or import, even if StartTLS is enabled and the ‘ldap_cert’ parameter is set.
The result is that connections that the administrator assumes to be secured, using StartTLS, are not actually secure.
CVE: CVE-2019-19146
Date/time of detection: 22nd March, 2019
Detected by: Ben Gooley, Cloudera
Severity (Low/Medium/High): 8.8 High CVSS AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
Products affected: CDH
Releases affected:

CDH 5.x
CDH 6.1.0
CDH 6.1.1
CDH 6.2.0
CDH 6.2.1
CDH 6.3.0


Users affected: All users who are using StartTLS enabled in the Hue configuration when using LDAP as Authentication Backend to login in Hue.
Impact: Sensitive data exposure.
Immediate action required:

Upgrade (recommended): Update to a version of CDH containing the fix.
Workaround: Use “ldaps” instead of “ldap” and StartTLS.


Addressed in release/refresh/patch: CDH 6.3.1 and above
Knowledge article: For the latest update on this issue see the corresponding Knowledge article: TSB 2020-371: Hue Silently Disables StartTLS in LDAP Connections



The Idempotent and Transactional Capabilities of Kafka are Incompatible with Sentry

The idempotent and transactional capabilities of Kafka are not compatible with Sentry. The issue is due to Sentry being unable to handle authorization policies for Kafka transactions. As
a result, users cannot use Kafka transaction in combination with Sentry.
Workaround: Use the Sentry super user in applications where idempotent producing is a requirement or disable Sentry.
Affected Versions: CDK 4.0 and later, CDH 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.1.0, 6.1.1, 6.2.0, 6.3.0
Fixed Versions: CDH 6.2.1, 6.3.1
Apache Issue: N/A
Cloudera Issue: CDH-80606
