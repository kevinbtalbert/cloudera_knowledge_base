Fixed Issues in CDH 6.3.2


CDH 6.3.2 fixes the following issue:

Kudu cannot distribute libnuma (dependency of memkind)
Java client doesn't verify channel bindings during connection negotiation
Potential to bypass transaction and idempotent ACL checks in Apache Kafka




Kudu cannot distribute libnuma (dependency of memkind)

In this release the NVM cache implementation in Kudu has been changed to dynamically link memkind at runtime using dlopen().
Affected Versions: CDH 6.3.0, 6.3.1
Fixed Versions: 6.3.2
Apache Issue: KUDU-2990 - If you want support for Kudu's NVM
(non-volatile memory) block cache, then you must install the memkind library by running one of the following commands for the corresponding platform:



RHEL/CentOS:
sudo yum install memkind
Ubuntu or Debian:
sudo apt-get install libmemkind0
SLES:
sudo zypper install memkind


Note: For Kudu’s NVM block cache to work properly, the memkind library should be of version 1.8.0 or newer.

If the memkind package provided with the Linux distribution is too old, you can build and install it from source by using the following commands:

RHEL/CentOS:
sudo yum install numactl-libs numactl-devel
git clone https://github.com/memkind/memkind.git
cd memkind
./build.sh --prefix=/usr
sudo yum remove memkind
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
Ubuntu or Debian:
sudo apt-get install libnuma1 libnuma-dev
git clone https://github.com/memkind/memkind.git
cd memkind
./build.sh --prefix=/usr
sudo apt-get remove memkind
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
SLES:
sudo zypper install numactl-libs numactl-devel
git clone https://github.com/memkind/memkind.git
cd memkind
./build.sh --prefix=/usr
sudo zypper remove memkind
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig








Java client doesn't verify channel bindings during connection negotiation

Affected Versions: CDH 6.3.0, 6.3.1
Fixed Versions: 6.3.2
Apache Issue: KUDU-3014 - Fixed a bug in the connection
negotiation code of the Kudu Java client. Now the Kudu Java client verifies the channel binding information while negotiating connections to Kudu servers.



Potential to bypass transaction and idempotent ACL checks in Apache Kafka

It is possible to manually craft a Produce request which bypasses transaction and idempotent ACL validation. Only authenticated clients with Write permission on the respective topics are
able to exploit this vulnerability.
Products affected:

CDH
CDK Powered by Apache Kafka


Releases affected:


CDH versions 6.0.x, 6.1.x, 6.2.0


CDK versions 3.0.x, 3.1.x, 4.0.x



Users affected: All users who run Kafka in CDH and CDK.
Date/time of detection: September, 2018
Severity (Low/Medium/High):7.1 (High) (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H)
Impact: Attackers can exploit this issue to bypass certain security restrictions to perform unauthorized actions. This can aid in further attacks.
CVE: CVE-2018-17196
Immediate action required: Update to a version of CDH containing the fix.
Addressed in release/refresh/patch:


CDH 6.2.1, 6.3.2


CDK 4.1.0

Apache Kafka
