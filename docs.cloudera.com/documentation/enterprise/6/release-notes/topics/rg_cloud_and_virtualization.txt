Supported Configurations with Virtualization and Cloud Platforms

This section lists supported cloud and virtualization platforms for deploying Cloudera software. The linked reference architectures are not replacements for statements of support, but
are guides to assist with deployment and sizing options.


Amazon Web Services

For information on deploying Cloudera software on a Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure, see the Cloudera Enterprise Reference Architecture for AWS
Deployments.



Google Cloud Platform

For information on deploying Cloudera software on a Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, see the Cloudera Enterprise Reference Architecture for Google Cloud
Platform Deployments.



Microsoft Azure

For information on deploying Cloudera software on a Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure, see the Cloudera Enterprise Reference Architecture for Azure Deployments.


Support Limitations for CDH and Cloudera Manager in Microsoft Azure



Virtual machines must use Cloudera-published CentOS 6.x/7.x OS Images or Red Hat published 6.x/7.x Images. Red Hat images must include bootstrapped configuration as specified in the
Azure Bootstrap Scripts folder in the Cloudera Director GitHub
repository.
Master Node Services must use Azure Premium Storage Disks for persistent storage.
The VM local temporary disk must not be used for any persistent data for HDFS, Kudu, or other services.
Microsoft Azure Storage - Block Blob (previously known as Windows Azure Storage
Blob, accessed via wasb:// URI’s) is only supported for backups using Hadoop’s DistCP. Other services are not supported running directly against Azure Storage block blobs.






VMware

For information on deploying Cloudera software on a VMware-based infrastructure, see the Reference
architecture for deploying on VMware.
Recommendation when deploying on VMware in the current release:

Use the part of Hadoop Virtual Extensions that has been implemented in HADOOP-8468. This
will prevent data loss when a physical node that hosts two or more DataNodes goes down.




Red Hat OpenStack Platform (OSP) 11

For information on deploying Cloudera software on RedHat OpenStack Platform (OSP) 11, see Reference Architecture for Deploying CDH 5.x on Red Hat OSP 11.
For information on deploying Cloudera software on RedHat OpenStack Platform (OSP) 11 with Ceph storage, see Reference Architecture for Deploying Cloudera Enterprise 5.x on Red Hat
OpenStack Platform 11 with Red Hat Ceph Storage 2.x.
