Auto-TLS support for commands like Oozie's Upload Sharelib

Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-47084



CDH upgrade fails with checkJavaComponent(DbHostHeartbeat.java:177)

Fixed a Java version parsing issue during Cloudera Manager upgrade.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-47620



CDH 6.0.0 upgrade validator fails when no Sentry service is available

Fixed an issue that occurs when upgrading CDH 5 clusters with a Keystore Indexer but no Sentry service. A validator shows an empty error message in a popup when trying to upgrade to CDH
6.0.0. Note that when Sentry Policy File is enabled, users must either disable it or add a Sentry service in order for the policy file to be migrated automatically.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-47617



Agent install fails with "Installing hue-plugins package"

Fixed an issue where a CDH 6.0.0 installation with packages fails.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-47105

Fixed an issue where where Solr index files were not getting deleted from HDFS during the upgrade process. This causes Solr to fail to start since files have an old index scheme.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-47502



Cloudera Manager wizard shows CDH 5.15.0 as a package choice

Fixed an issue where CDH 5.15.0 was shown as a valid package choice for Cloudera Manager 6.0.0. For more information about valid CDH versions for Cloudera Manager 6.0.0, see Upgrade paths.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-47200



Host inspector shows psycopg2 version error even after psycopg2-2.6.2 is installed

Fixed an issue where hosts that run Redhat, Centos, or OEL showed incorrect host inspector results for the Python version check and for psycopg2 version check.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-47217



Fix display vcore and memory values when they are not integers

Fixed the display of vcore and memory values to support values other than integers.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-47271



Upgrade Service Inspector shows it passed, but the solr check failed

Fixed issue where the "Service Inspector" on the upgrade page was showing Solr in good health even though Solr had failures.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-46958
