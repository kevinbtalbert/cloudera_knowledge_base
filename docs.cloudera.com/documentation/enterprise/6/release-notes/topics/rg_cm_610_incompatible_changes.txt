Incompatible Changes in Cloudera Manager 6.1


See below for incompatible changes in Cloudera Manager 6.1.0:

API Name Changes




API Name Changes

HDFS_CLIENT_CONFIG_JAVA_OPTS has hbase in the template name

Changed the API name to fix the wrong name in the parameter.




Old Name
New Name




hbase_client_java_opts
hdfs_client_java_opts




This parameter configures the Client Java Configuration Options found under the HDFS Gateway role configuration. Any API scripts or cluster templates referencing these old names need to
be updated to use the new names.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-24569



Fix typos in a "detecton_window" API names

Changed the API names to fix typos in the following parameters:




Old Name
New Name




hbase_active_master_detecton_window
hbase_active_master_detection_window


hdfs_active_namenode_detecton_window
hdfs_active_namenode_detection_window


mapreduce_active_jobtracker_detecton_window
mapreduce_active_jobtracker_detection_window


yarn_active_resourcemanager_detecton_window
yarn_active_resourcemanager_detection_window




These parameters tune the behavior of health test checking. The affected entities are: HBase Master, HDFS NameNode, MapReduce JobTracker, YARN ResourceManager. Any API scripts or cluster
templates referencing these old names need to be updated to use the new names.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-39223



Roles-related Cloudera Manager API endpoints are now accessed using RolesResource

For API documentation and the new, Swagger-based API client, roles can be accessed from Roles Resource instead of Services Resource. This does not change the roles endpoint and does not
impact those accessing the Cloudera Manager API endpoints directly using tools like curl.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-47787



Typo in HiveServer2 load balancer API name

Fixed typos in the following parameter. This change affects Hive services when Hive Server 2 is configured for High Availability.


API Names


Old Name
New Name




hiverserver2_load_balancer
hiveserver2_load_balancer




Any API scripts or cluster templates referencing these old names will need to be updated to use the new names.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-33266
