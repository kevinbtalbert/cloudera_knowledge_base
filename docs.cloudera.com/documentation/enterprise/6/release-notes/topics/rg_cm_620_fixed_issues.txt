Default thresholds for swap warnings are too low

The default process swap size warning threshold has been increased from 0 to 200Mb. A new host level configuration property, Default Process Swap Memory
Thresholds, has been added for process swap size alert thresholds. This allows for bulk updates of process level alerts that use the default settings.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-44904



Service name auto-generation code is broken, causing a constraint violation

Fixed an issue where Cloudera Manager incorrectly auto-generated the Service Display Name when adding services.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-48672



Hive replication does not copy an empty database

Empty databases without metadata or Hive/Impala UDFs are now replicated during Hive replication.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-47224



Cluster template import causes state corruption

Fixed an issue with importing Cluster Templates. When hosts that are used in another cluster are, by mistake, specified in the template, then these hosts are dissociated with their
cluster and the cluster is left in an invalid state and beyond repair.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-48680



Summary and full views in the Replication API display the same result

Fixed an issue where using the Cloudera Manager API to return a summary view for a replication job returns a summary with limited information instead of the full view.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-47182



Setting displayName in cluster template does not impact display name

Fixed an issue where setting the display name for a service using a cluster template did not change the service name.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-46056



Server fails to contact agent when TLS is on

Fixed an issue with TLS encryption. When TLS encryption is enabled for agent-server communication, but no key and certificate is configured for an agent host, then the agent might
erroneously report that it is serving the agent status server (port 9000) over HTTPS when it is not. This caused failures during diagnostic bundle collection.
To configure the agent status server to use HTTPS, configure the agent with a client_cert_file and client_key_file in the /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini file.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-48958



Host inspector incorrectly reports bad version of PSYCOPG2

Fixed an issue where the Host Inspector may incorrectly report that an incompatible version of PSYCOPG2 was in use.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-48649



Diagnostic bundle has zero-length agent log .zip files

Fixed an issue where zero-length agent log .zip files were included in diagnostic bundles.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-49208



Import/Export cluster deployment through API for inbuilt/custom roles

Fixed an issue where using the Cloudera Manager API to import and export deployments failed when using custom roles.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-48104



Cannot negotiate TLS to Cloudera Manager Admin Console on OpenJDK 1.8 on Centos 7.2

Fixed an issue where older versions of OpenJDK may not implement certain TLS ciphers, causing an inability to log into the Cloudera Manager Admin Console when TLS is enabled. Either
upgrade the version of OpenJDK, or allow Cloudera Manager to use less secure ciphers by editing /etc/default/cloudera-scm-server and uncommenting the line that contains "export
CMF_OVERRIDE_TLS_CIPHERS=".
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-49578



YARN jobs failure when using encrypted shuffle

On some operating systems, the default file mask may cause the Auto-TLS truststore file to not be world-readable, causing YARN jobs to fail when encrypted shuffle is enabled. This issue
has been fixed.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-48731



Uploading a valid license via the Cloudera Manager API Swagger client returns 500 Server Error

Fixed the update_license() method in ClouderaManagerResourceApi in the Cloudera Manager Python Swagger-based API client that allows updating the license file for Cloudera Manager.
Without the fix, the update_license() method fails with the following error: "No multipart with content id license found" HTTP error 500.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-49116



Syntax highlighting for Java API client docs is broken

Fixed an issue with syntax highlighting for the Cloudera Manager Java API client SDK documentation.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-49406



Disable Hive > Actions > Update Hive Metastore NameNodes if high availability is not enabled for HDFS

Fixed an issue where re-running the Update Hive Metastore NameNodes Command when HDFS High Availability was disabled corrupted the URI paths in Hive tables by appending an additional
port number.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-46970



Cloudera Navigator Limitation when using Virtual Private Clusters

Navigator does not capture auditing and lineage information from Compute clusters in version 6.2.0.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-48694



Upgrade CDH screen does not list all the databases that need to be backed up

When you run the Upgrade Cluster wizard to upgrade from CDH 6.1 to 6.2, Hive now appears in the list of databases to be backed up.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-49314



dfs.client.read.shortcircuit needs to be set correctly for each Impala instance

When Impala daemons are not co-located with a DataNode, Advanced Configuration Snippets are no longer necessary to disable short circuit reads when using CDH 6.2 or higher.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-46971



Maven dependency issue for jaxrs

Fixed an issue where some of the Cloudera Manager API endpoints stopped working in version 6.1.0.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-49159



Java runtime error when setting static pool through Cloudera Manager

Fixed a RuntimeException that occurs when configuring Static Pools in Cloudera Manager.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-48476



Snapshot Policies screen hangs

Fixed an issue where the Snapshots Policies screen in the Cloudera Manager Admin Console hangs when there are scheduled replications with snapshots.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-49511



Make sure Spark app log collection works with authentication on

Fixed several issues with the YARN diagnostic bundle, which could not collect Spark event logs when SSL or Kerberos authentication was enabled for the Spark History Server.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-39280



New compile lock related configuration values to Cloudera Manager

The following HiveServer2 configuration parameters for compile locking have been added:

hive.driver.parallel.compilation
hive.driver.parallel.compilation.global.limit


Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-47503



Add pre-upgrade confirmation box to HBase upgrade

Added two checkboxes to the HBase upgrade screen for validating co-processors and tables.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-48815



Diagnostic bundle creation slows down Cloudera Managers

Fixed an issue where running a diagnostic bundle command slows down other commands running in Cloudera Manager.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-49233



Broken Link on Replication History page

Fixed a broken link on the Replication History page to the respective YARN jobs.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-29486
