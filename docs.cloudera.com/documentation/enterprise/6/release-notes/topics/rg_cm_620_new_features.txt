Virtual Private Clusters - Separation of Compute and Storage services

A Virtual Private Cluster uses the Cloudera Shared Data Experience (SDX) to simplify deployment of both on-premise and cloud-based applications and enable workloads running in different
clusters to securely and flexibly share data.
A new type of cluster is available in CDH 6.2, called a Compute cluster. A Compute cluster runs computational services such as Impala, Spark, or YARN but you
configure these services to access data hosted in another Regular CDH cluster, called the Base cluster. Using this architecture you can separate compute and storage resources in
a variety of ways to flexibly maximize resources.
See Virtual Private Clusters and Cloudera SDX.



Ubuntu 18 Support

Support for Ubuntu 18.04 has been added for Cloudera Manager and CDH 6.2 and higher.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-48410



Backup and Disaster Recovery (BDR)

Hive Direct Replication to S3/ADLS Backed Cluster

BDR now supports Hive direct replication from on-premise to S3/ADLS clusters and metadata replication to the Hive Metastore.
Using a single replication process, BDR enables Hive data to be pulled from HDFS to S3/ADLS clusters and use the "Hive-on-cloud" mode, where the target Hive Metastore updates the table
locations to point to S3/ADLS clusters. This process facilitates easy data migration and synchronisation between the cloud and on-premise clusters.
For more information, see Hive/Impala Replication.



Replication to and from ADLS Gen2

You can now replicate HDFS files and Hive data to and from Microsoft ADLS Gen2. To use ADLS Gen2 as the source or destination, you must add Azure credentials to Cloudera Manager. Note
that the URI format for ADLS Gen2 is not the same as ADLS Gen1. For ADLS Gen2 use the following URI format: abfs[s]://<file_system>@<account_name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<path>/.




Hosts

Duplicate Host Detection and Hostname Migration

Cloudera Manager now detects and rejects duplicate hosts from joining a cluster and gracefully tolerates > changes in hostnames for managed hosts, better supporting automated
deployments




Installation

Accumulo Initialization

An Initialize Accumulo checkbox now displays in the Installation wizard.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-48619



JDBC URL for the Hive Metastore Database Connection

You can now specify a JDBC URL when establishing a connection from the Hive service to a supported backend database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or OracleDB). Enter the JDBC URL on the Setup
Database page in the Create Cluster and Create Service wizards in Cloudera Manager.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-48668




Licensing

Start and Deactivation Dates for Cloudera Enterprise Licenses

Cloudera Enterprise licenses now include a start date and a deactivation date. Enterprise-only features are enabled on the start date and will be disabled after the deactivation date. If
you install the license before the start date, a banner displays in the Cloudera Manager Admin console showing the number of days until the license becomes effective.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-47500



Enhanced License Enforcement - Node Limit

When an Enterprise license expires, Cloudera Manager reverts to the Express version. This includes enforcing a maximum of 100 nodes across all CDH 6 clusters.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-48611



Enhanced License Enforcement - Feature Availability

Features only available with a Cloudera Enterprise license are turned off after the deactivation date has passed. For legacy licenses that do not have a deactivation date, the features
are turned off on the expiration date.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-46864



Enhanced License Enforcement - KMS Configuration

Cloudera Manager will not allow KMS configuration changes after the deactivation date specified in the new license file although the KMS will remain functional. For legacy licenses, the
deactivation date defaults to the expiration date specified in the license.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-48501




Cloudera Manager API

Cross-Cluster Network Bandwidth Test

Cloudera Manager now has an API to test network bandwidth between clusters, helping determine if the infrastructure is suitable for separating storage and compute services.
For more information, see the following entries in the Cloudera
Manager REST API documentation:

POST /cm/commands/clustersPerfInspector
ApiClustersPerfInspectorArgs
ApiPerfInspectorBandwidthArgs





API for Managing Expiring Cloudera Manager Sessions
