New Features and Changes in Cloudera Manager 6.3.0


The following sections describe new and changed features for Cloudera Manager 6.3.0:

OpenJDK 11 support for Cloudera Manager and CDH 6.3 and higher
Cloudera Manager Kerberos support for FreeIPA and Red Hat Identity Manager
SPNEGO/Kerberos support for Cloudera Manager Admin Console and API
Cloudera Manager Server certificate expiration monitoring and alerting
Auto-TLS Support for Root CA
Service and Host Monitor configurations for Garbage Collection
New Configuration Parameters for JournalNode Syncer
New Kafka configuration parameters and metrics
Simplified enabling Kerberos through Cloudera Manager templates
Cluster Administrator role can now create and delete Data Context
New YARN Configuration Parameter
Kudu integration with Sentry
Network Performance Inspector now includes a bandwidth test
Kafka support in Compute Clusters
Improved Backup and Disaster Log Retention behaviour
Filtered HDFS NameNode and Hive MetaStore role logs included with BDR diagnostic bundles
Option to disable metric rollup




OpenJDK 11 support for Cloudera Manager and CDH 6.3 and higher

You can now use OpenJDK 11 with Cloudera Enterprise 6.3.
See:

Manually Migrating to OpenJDK
Manually Installing OpenJDK
Supported JDKs


When you install OpenJDK 11 in your cluster, it uses the G1GC method for garbage collection for most services, which may require tuning to avoid overcommitting memory. See Tuning JVM Garbage Collection.
OPSAPS-50993, OPSAPS-49390, OPSAPS-51643



Cloudera Manager Kerberos support for FreeIPA and Red Hat Identity Manager

Cloudera Manager now supports FreeIPA and RedHat Identity Manager as a Kerberos KDC type. See Step 4: Enabling Kerberos Using the Wizard
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-45833, OPSAPS-51348



SPNEGO/Kerberos support for Cloudera Manager Admin Console and API

The Cloudera Manager Admin Console and API now support Kerberos authentication (using SPNEGO). Only clients that can use SPNEGO (such as curl) are supported. The Swagger and Python SDKs
for Cloudera Manager do not support SPNEGO.
With SPNEGO enabled, the Swagger-based Java and Python SDKs, as well as the older deprecated Java SDK, can still authenticate using HTTP Basic Authentication. The older deprecated Python
SDK cannot. Do not enable SPNEGO if you are relying on the deprecated Python client for any operations.
You can enable SPNEGO/Kerberos authentication for the Cloudera Manager Admin Console and API by going to Settings > Administration > External Authentication > "Enable
SPNEGO/Kerberos Authentication for the Admin Console and API" and checking the box. This requires a restart of Cloudera Manager to take effect. It also requires that Kerberos is enabled.
For more information, see Configuring External Authentication and Authorization for Cloudera Manager.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-49753, OPSAPS-24297



Cloudera Manager Server certificate expiration monitoring and alerting

Cloudera Manager now alerts you 60 days before the Cloudera Manager Server TLS certificate expires. You can view and modify the threshold values by searching for Expiry in the Cloudera Management Service configuration page.
Note: The TLS certificate expiry alert applies only to the Cloudera Manager Server certificate. It does not alert on upcoming certificate
expirations for certificates used by other services.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-35977



Auto-TLS Support for Root CA

For new cluster installations, auto-TLS can create and use an intermediate CA for an existing internal root CA. This creates a chain of trust to your existing internal root CA, and
allows internal hosts that trust your root CA to access cluster web resources without browser security warnings.
This feature is not supported for existing clusters.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-50063



Service and Host Monitor configurations for Garbage Collection

The Cloudera Manager Host monitor and Service Monitor now use G1GC garbage collection by default. You can change this by adding Java options in the Java
Configuration Options for Host Monitor and Java Configuration Options for Service Monitor configuration properties (Go to Clusters > Cloudera Management Service and search for "java". See Tuning JVM Garbage Collection.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-50123



New Configuration Parameters for JournalNode Syncer

Enable JournalNode Syncer has been added for CDH 6.3 and later. When enabled, a JournalNode will periodically synchronize edit logs with other
JournalNodes.
Shared Edits Directory has been added for HDFS JournalNodes when High Availability is enabled, which allows the JournalNode Syncer to start and work
correctly.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-51249



New Kafka configuration parameters and metrics

New Kafka configurations and default values are now available in Cloudera Manager when using the CDK 4 Kafka distribution:

num.network.threads=8
num.recovery.threads.per.data.dir=1
num.replica.fetchers=4 (default changed from 1)


New metrics:

broker
broker level topic
controller
fetch session cache
log cleaner
network
replica manager
session expire listener
zookeeper client


Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-49741



Simplified enabling Kerberos through Cloudera Manager templates

Added a new section called enableKerberos to the instantiator section of Cloudera Manager templates. For examples:
"instantiator": { 
    "clusterName": "test", 

     "enableKerberos": { 
         "datanodeTransceiverPort" : <optional/default 1004>, 
         "datanodeWebPort" : <optional/default 1006> 
      }, 
      . 
      . 
This enables Kerberos on all the services in the template.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-49704



Cluster Administrator role can now create and delete Data Context

Users with the Cluster Administrator role who can access only the base clusters in Virtual Private Cloud setups can now create and delete Data Contexts.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-49478



New YARN Configuration Parameter

A new YARN configuration parameter, Enable Container Launch Debug Information, has been added and is disabled by default. Previously, this configuration
had to be made using the NodeManager Advanced Configuration Snippet for yarn-site.xml.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-50709



Kudu integration with Sentry

Cloudera Manager can now configure Kudu integration with Sentry.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-50359



Network Performance Inspector now includes a bandwidth test

You can now test the bandwidth between clusters using the Network Performance Inspector. See Inspecting
Network Performance
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-49682



Kafka support in Compute Clusters

You can now add the Kafka service to a compute cluster. Kafka will share the Sentry service across multiple Kafka instances.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-49165



Improved Backup and Disaster Log Retention behaviour

When you are using a custom log location for BDR replication, automatic log expiration now purges these custom replication logs and metadata files, based on their purge settings. To
maintain information for each replication schedule, it is important that user set valid paths for HDFS that are writable by an existing user.
OPSAPS-50880



Filtered HDFS NameNode and Hive MetaStore role logs included with BDR diagnostic bundles

Filtered HDFS NameNode and Hive MetaStore role logs originating from both source and target clusters are now included in replication diagnostic bundles. The logs can be filtered based
on these criteria:

Earliest start and latest end timestamps for all the replication runs within a diagnostic bundle
The configured log level (defaults to INFO) on both the source and destination clusters for HDFS and Hive replication jobs.


The following role logs are included:

HDFS NameNode (for HDFS and Hive replication jobs)
Hive MetaStore (Hive replication)


Both source and destination role logs will be capped to a maximum of 201 MBs (this is the normal CDH role log size).
You configure these log collections using the following Advanced configuration snippets:

HDFS Replication Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hdfs-site.xml
Hive Replication Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hive-site.xml


Enter the following configuration parameters in the appropriate Advance Configuration Snippet for Hive or HDFS (default values are in brackets):

SKIP_HIVE_LOG_COLLECTION [false]
SKIP_HDFS_LOG_COLLECITON [false]
LOG_LEVEL [INFO]
LOG_SEARCH_TIMEOUT_MILLIS [300000]
LOG_ROLE_RESULT_LIMIT [10000]
LOG_TOTAL_BYTES_LIMIT [210763776]


Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-49988



Option to disable metric rollup

You can now disable rollup of metrics over time. This can help increase performance of the Service Monitor. See Disabling
Metric rollup.
Cloudera Issue: OPSAPS-50149
