Fixed Issues in Cloudera Manager 6.3.3


The following sections describe issues fixed in Cloudera Manager 6.3.3:

Cloudera Manager agent logs are not showing the correct timezone in the timestamp
Cloudera Manager API with SPENGO authentication is failing
Chart positions are not preserved in the cluster homepage dashboard
Upgrade from CDH 5 to CDH 6 fails with a decommissioned host in bad health
JMX authentication fails for Kafka with OpenJDK 11
Cloudera Manager Diagnostic Bundle Redaction is not working as expected
Unknown field "keepHostTemplates" breaks existing Cloudera Manager API clients




Cloudera Manager agent logs are not showing the correct timezone in the timestamp

Log entries in the cloudera-scm-agent.log log file now display timestamps with the correct offset based on the timezone of the host.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-53925



Cloudera Manager API with SPENGO authentication is failing

Fixed an issue when both SAML and SPNEGO were enabled at the same time as external authentication options, SPNEGO login did not work.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-53563



Chart positions are not preserved in the cluster homepage dashboard

Fixed an issue where the chart position customizations are not saved.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-53562



Upgrade from CDH 5 to CDH 6 fails with a decommissioned host in bad health

Fixed an issue that caused upgrades to fail when a cluster has a decommissioned host that has a Bad health status.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-53303


File Descriptor leak in Cloudera Manager Agent Status Server using TLS

Fixes a file descriptor leak by the Cloudera Manager Agent's HTTP status server when Auto-TLS is enabled. The fix applies to all supported operating systems, except for Redhat 6-based
systems. Customers running on Redhat 6 should either upgrade to Redhat 7, or disable Agent TLS .(Go to Administration > Settings > Security > Use TLS Encryption for Agents.)
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-, OPSAPS-53158




JMX authentication fails for Kafka with OpenJDK 11

Fixed an issue where using JDK 11 with authentication enabled for JMX, clients such as Service Monitor and JConsole are unable to connect.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-52793


Cloudera Manager Server will not start on Ubuntu 18.04 or 16.04

Fixes a "no such file or directory" error for /opt/cloudera/cm/bin/cm-server-pre when installing Cloudera Manager using the installer.bin proof-of concept installer on Ubuntu 18.04 or 16.04.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-52687


Errors When Enabling Credential Regeneration for Active Directory Accounts Using Cloudera Manager

Fixed an error condition that occurred when the Active Directory Delete Accounts on Credential Regeneration property is enabled that caused a failure
when regenerating credentials.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-52277





Cloudera Manager Diagnostic Bundle Redaction is not working as expected

Redaction of log files in diagnostics bundle collection has been fixed.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-51948



Unknown field "keepHostTemplates" breaks existing Cloudera Manager API clients

HostTemplates were missing from clusters created using a ClusterTemplate. This has been fixed by adding a new attribute, keepHostTemplates to the
ApiClusterTemplateInstantiator endpoint. Cloudera Manager Java clients created before Cloudera Manager 6.1.0 will fail when encountering the new attribute in results.
These clients must update to the Cloudera Manager 6.1.0 (or higher) client, to prevent this failure.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-50252


Small diagnostic bundle uploads from Cloudera Manager failed for customers in Japan/Europe/US

Fixed an issue to avoid failure of diagnostics bundle uploads due to the following TimeoutException:
java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: Read timeout to proxy/<IP address>:8080 of 60000 ms
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-49351
