Known Issues and Limitations in Cloudera Manager 6.3.3


The following sections describe known issues and limitations for Cloudera Manager 6.3.3:

Cloudera Manager 6.x issue with the service role Resume
Upgrades to Cloudera Manager 6.3 Fail with Hive Cloud replication schedules
BDR - Hive restore failing during import




Cloudera Manager 6.x issue with the service role Resume

If a selected service role on a node is restarted and fails, and the customer clicks the "Resume" button in Cloudera Manager, the service role on all of the nodes will be restarted
concurrently.
Products affected: Cloudera Manager
Releases affected:

Cloudera Manager 5.5 and later
Cloudera Manager 6.0 until 6.3.3
Cloudera Manager 7.1.x


Users affected: Users with admin role in Cloudera Manager can impact end users of the service.
Impact:In production clusters this can result in a cluster-wide service outage; Already observed for the YARN service and the HDFS service in a few
clusters.
Severity: High
Action required:

A workaround exists where instead of performing a restart we recommend performing a stop/start of the services.
Issue is fixed in CM-6.3.4, CM-7.2.1 and above.


Knowledge article: For the latest update on this issue see the corresponding Knowledge article: Cloudera Customer Advisory: Cloudera Manager 6.x issue with service role
Resume



Upgrades to Cloudera Manager 6.3 Fail with Hive Cloud replication schedules

If you have any Hive Replication Schedules that replicate to a cloud destination, delete these replication schedules before continuing with the upgrade. You can re-create these
Replication Schedules after the Cloudera Manager upgrade is complete.
Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-54117



BDR - Hive restore failing during import

When the table filter used during hive cloud restore is different from the table filter used to create the hive cloud backup, the import step fails with the table not found error.
Currently it impacts only the cloud restore scenario.
Products affected: Cloudera Manager
Releases affected:

Cloudera Manager 5.15, 5.16
Cloudera Manager 6.1.x
Cloudera Manager 6.2.x
Cloudera Manager 6.3.x


Users affected: BDR, Hive cloud restore, where restore uses a subset of tables from the exported tables
Impact:

Limited, the hive cloud restore all tables works properly.
The hive cloud restore from the hive cloud backup created prior to Cloudera Manager 5.15 would work without any problem.
No other BDR functionality is affected.


Immediate action required:

Workaround: Not available. Importing specific tables would fail. Impoting ALL tables would continue to work properly.
Upgrade: Upgrade to a Cloudera Manager version containing the fix.


Addressed in release/refresh/patch: Cloudera Manager 7.0 and higher versions
