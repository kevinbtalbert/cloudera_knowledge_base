What's New in Cloudera Manager 6.3.4



New configurable threshold for retention of
stale processes information in the Cloudera Manager database.
Stale processes are ones that have been stopped. Cloudera Manager removes information about these stale processes from the Cloudera Manager Database after a configurable number of
days. You can configure the number of days with the STALE_PROCESS_THRESHOLD configuration parameter under Administration > Settings > Support.
API to evict old audit table entries on
demand
Cloudera Manager Audit records now can be periodically set for truncation. An admin user can now schedule this command to run, set a batch size of old records to be truncated and
configure Cloudera Manager to only keep audit records by number of days.
Go to Administration > Settings > Support and search for Audit. Edit any of the following parameters:

Last login audit
Audit Records batch eviction size
Audit Records Eviction Control
Audit Records Eviction Frequency
Audit Records Life Time



Diagnostic Bundle improvement - Increase
number of Archivers and their respective timeouts
Cloudera Manager now anticipates the number of archivers and their respective timeouts based on the size of the cluster it manages. The archivers are used when diagnostic bundle
collection occurs. You can also configure the following parameters to tune this behavior. Go to Administration > Settings > Support and search for "Diagnostic Bundle Scale Factor". The Scaling factor is directly proportional to the time taken to
collect diagnostic bundle. Increase this value to reduce the timeouts during data collection
Cloudera Bug:
OPSAPS-57532: Impala Thrift profile processing optimization
Executing query monitoring is 100 times faster and memory consumption of this functionality is 100 times reduced.
Restructure index creation process in
Reports Manager
Reports Manager fsimage indexing time is reduced, so it can handle large fsimages in reasonable time.
Improve log scanning scalability in
clusterstats
Fixed completed Impala query monitoring for large query profiles by improving log scanning scalability.
New configuration in Telemetry Publisher
allowing the users to limit the amount of data exported in a given hour.
Enhanced to have Telemetry Publisher to show the chart with the amount of data exported by Cloudera Manager to Workload Experience Manager (WXM).
Add a configuration to Telemetry Publisher allowing the users to limit the amount of data exported in a given hour. Added the configuration "telemetry.databus.exportedDataThresholdPerHour" to Telemetry Publisher. The default behaviour will be as it is today. This configuration can be provided by the customers if they
want to control the amount of data exported by Telemetry Publisher in one hour. The Telemetry publisher verifies the amount of data exported in the last one hour and if it crosses the specified
threshold amount in bytes, it will skip exporting of the data till next hour.
Add tracer parameters to Monitor
service
Tracer parameters are included in monitor service parameters.
Create new CM metrics for HBase 2.0 JMX RIT
metrics
These HBase metrics are available in CM now:


regions_in_transition_duration_num_ops
regions_in_transition_duration_min
regions_in_transition_duration_max
regions_in_transition_duration_mean
regions_in_transition_duration_25th_percentile
regions_in_transition_duration_median
regions_in_transition_duration_75th_percentile
regions_in_transition_duration_90th_percentile
regions_in_transition_duration_95th_percentile
regions_in_transition_duration_98th_percentile
regions_in_transition_duration_99th_percentile
regions_in_transition_duration_99_9th_percentile



HBase 2.0 JMX SCAN metrics changed
ue to a HBase 2.0 change these metrics are no longer available in CM with CDH6+ :

scan_next_rate
scan_next_size_75th_percentile
scan_next_size_95th_percentile
scan_next_size_99th_percentile
scan_next_size_max
scan_next_size_mean
scan_next_size_median
scan_next_size_min
scan_size_75th_percentile
scan_size_95th_percentile
scan_size_99th_percentile
scan_size_max scan_size_mean
scan_size_median
scan_size_min
scan_size_rate
scan_time_75th_percentile
scan_time_95th_percentile
scan_time_99th_percentile
scan_time_max scan_time_mean
scan_time_median scan_time_min
scan_time_rate
