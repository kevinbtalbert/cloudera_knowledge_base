Cloudera Manager 6 Version and Download Information

Cloudera Manager is available in the following releases:

Cloudera Manager 6.3.4 is the current release of Cloudera Manager.
Cloudera Manager 6.3.3 is the previous release of Cloudera Manager.


The 64-bit packages listed here support both Cloudera Express with its extensive set of monitoring and management features, and Cloudera
Enterprise with additional functionality. A 60-day trial can be enabled to provide access to the full set of Cloudera Enterprise Cloudera
Enterprise features. Cloudera Enterprise can be enabled permanently with the appropriate license. To obtain a Cloudera
Enterprise license, fill in this form or call 866-843-7207.
Important: As of February 1, 2021, all downloads of CDH and Cloudera Manager require a username and password and use a modified URL. You must
use the modified URL, including the username and password when downloading the repository contents described below. You may need to upgrade Cloudera Manager to a newer version that uses the modified
URLs.
This can affect new installations, upgrades, adding new hosts to a cluster, adding a cluster and adding new services to a cluster.
For more information, see Updating an existing CDH/Cloudera Manager deployment to access downloads with authentication.



Authentication to the Cloudera Archive

As of February 1, 2021, access to Cloudera Manager binaries for production purposes requires authentication. To access the binaries at the locations below, you must first have an active
subscription agreement and obtain a license key file along with the required authentication credentials (username and password).
The license key file and authentication credentials are provided in an email sent to customer accounts from Cloudera when a new license is issued. If you have an existing license with a
Cloudera Enterprise entitlement, you might not have received an email. In this instance you can identify the authentication credentials from the license key file. If you do not have access to the
license key, contact your account representative to receive a copy.
To identify your authentication credentials using your license key file, complete the following steps:

From cloudera.com, log into the cloudera.com account associated with the Cloudera Enterprise license and subscription agreement.
On the
https://cloudera.com/downloads/cdh.html
Cloudera CDH Download page, select the version that you want to install and click Get It Now!.
Scroll down to the Credentials Generator at the bottom of the page.
In the Generate Credentials text box, copy and paste the text of the “PGP Signed Message” within your license key file and click Get Credentials. The credentials generator returns your username and password.


Note: Take note of the authentication credentials. You might need them during installation to complete tasks such as configuring a remote or local
package repository, or installing Cloudera Manager packages using a package manager such as YUM, APT, or other tools that you might be using in your environment.

When you obtain your authentication credentials, use them to form the URLs below, where you can access the Cloudera Manager repository in the Cloudera Archive.
