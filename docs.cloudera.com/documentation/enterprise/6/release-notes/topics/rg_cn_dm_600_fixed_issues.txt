Issues Fixed in Cloudera Navigator 6.0.0


The following sections describe the issues fixed in the data management components of Cloudera Navigator 6.0.0:

Trust Store password encrypted
Automated clean-up when Navigator Metadata Server storage directory is cleared
Web Server and Platform version disclosure removed
Security headers improved with Cache-Control
Less Secure Credentials Protection Policy could expose Azure credentials in audit logs
Multi-cluster support for Hive lineage
Table-to-HDFS links were not established when Navigator supported multiple, high-availability clusters
Accurate dashboard metric for New Queries Executed




Trust Store password encrypted

In previous releases, when Cloudera Manager starts Navigator Metadata Server role, it passed trust store password un-encrypted. In this release, when configured to use TLS, the trust
store password is encrypted when passed between Cloudera Manager and Navigator.
Cloudera Issue: NAV-6382



Automated clean-up when Navigator Metadata Server storage directory is cleared

When Navigator Metadata Server role starts, it now checks if the Solr storage directory is empty or not. If it is empty, this check resets the ordinal numbers and starts a new Navigator
maintenance history record in the Navigator Metadata Server database.
Cloudera Issue: NAV-6267



Web Server and Platform version disclosure removed

This release includes a change to omit the server and platform versions from the web server response header.
Cloudera Issue: NAV-6019



Security headers improved with Cache-Control

This release includes Cache-Control cookie headers with the setting "no-cache" to ensure that no browser content is cached. Navigator Metadata Server, the web server for the Navigator
console, already uses the no-cache Cache-Control header for API interactions. This change extends the security coverage to additional content such as JavaScript.
Cloudera Issue: NAV-6018



Less Secure Credentials Protection Policy could expose Azure credentials in audit logs

When you use Cloudera Manager to configure the ADLS Connector service using the Less Secure option for the Credentials Protection Policy, it is possible for Hive audit logs to include
Microsoft Azure credentials. If you are using Navigator Audit Server, these credentials may appear in audit reports. To mitigate this problem, make sure that access to Hive logs is appropriately
controlled and that Navigator users with Auditing Viewer roles are cleared to have access to the Hive credentials.
Cloudera Issue: NAV-5861



Multi-cluster support for Hive lineage

When there were multiple Hive MetaStore (HMS) sources associated with a single Hive service, the method Navigator used to determine the source was not accurate, resulting in Impala and
Spark extractors creating lineage relations that referred to the wrong sources and cross-cluster lineage relations were not generated.
Cloudera Issue: NAV-5859



Table-to-HDFS links were not established when Navigator supported multiple, high-availability clusters

When Navigator extracts metadata for multiple clusters and when the clusters were configured for high availability operation, Navigator does not correctly link tables to their HDFS
backing data. The result is that lineage between Hive tables and their physical data are not created. In addition, some Hive table metadata that is derived from the backing files is not
available.
You may see errors in the log such as the following:
2018-02-19 09:01:32,999 ERROR com.cloudera.nav.persist.impl.CompositeLinker [CDHExecutor-0-CDHUrlClassLoader@01010d7e]: Internal error while linking.java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: expected one element but was: <com.cloudera.nav.core.model.Source@b22e68ba, com.cloudera.nav.core.model.Source@5b1bac2c>
Cloudera Issue: NAV-5749



Accurate dashboard metric for New Queries Executed

In some situations, the data reported for the Navigator Dashboard item New Queries Executed was shown to be larger than the actual number when Impala
queries were included in the metrics. This problem has been resolved.
Cloudera Issue: NAV-5742
