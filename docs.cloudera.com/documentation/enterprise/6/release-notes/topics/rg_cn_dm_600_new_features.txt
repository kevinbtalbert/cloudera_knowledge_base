New Features in Cloudera Navigator 6.0.0


The following sections describe what's new and what has changed in the data management components of Cloudera Navigator 6.0.0:

HDFS Analytics disabled by default
Navigator Metadata is now called "Properties"
Pre-register metadata for operations
Navigator version numbering now corresponds to Cloudera Manager versions
Hive Metastore instances identified using UUIDs
Preventing concurrent logins
Name and description lengths increased




HDFS Analytics disabled by default

The HDFS Analytics available in the Navigator console is now disabled by default.
To enable the HDFS Analytics, set the following properties in the Cloudera Management Service configuration:

Set navigator.analytics.enabled to be true in the Navigator Audit Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
cloudera-navigator.properties.
Set nav.analytics.audit.enabled to be true in the Navigator Metadata Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
cloudera-navigator.properties.

Cloudera Issue: NAV-6372



Navigator Metadata is now called "Properties"

Some of the Navigator terminology has changed in this release.


Old Term
New Term


Metadata
Property


Managed Metadata
Managed Property


Custom Metadata
User-defined Property


User-defined metadata" continues to include properties and tags; we encourage customers to migrate from tags to managed properties. For more information, see Navigator Business Metadata.
Cloudera Issue: NAV-6149



Pre-register metadata for operations

Applications can now pre-register operations in Navigator Metadata Server using a POST /entities REST call with a generated operation source ID. For
details on generating the ID before making the POST call, see the Navigator SDK example:
https://github.com/cloudera/navigator-sdk/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/com/cloudera/nav/sdk/examples/hivelineage/CustomHiveLineageCreator.java#L50
Cloudera Issue: NAV-5940



Navigator version numbering now corresponds to Cloudera Manager versions

As of Cloudera Manager version 6, Cloudera Navigator version numbering tracks with the Cloudera Manager numbering. In this new system, the release that follows Navigator 2.x will be
Navigator 6.x. Specifically, functionality from Navigator 2.13
Navigator releases associated with Cloudera Manager 5.x will continue with the previous numbering sequence.
Cloudera Issue: NAV-5368



Hive Metastore instances identified using UUIDs

Navigator used a combination of the Hive HMS database connection URL and driver name configuration values to uniquely identify the HMS and entities source from that HMS. This way of
identifying the Hive source could change unexpectedly in cases where the database is migrated to another server.
Fresh installations of Navigator 6.x use the UUID in the metastore database as a unique identifier. In this way, multiple HMS instances can be uniquely identified even in cases where the
data is coming from the same backing database.
For new installations, the Hive database UUID will identify the HMS sources. However, Navigator will continue to use the database URL as the Hive source identifier when deployments are
upgraded from the Navigator from Cloudera Manager 5.x releases.
Cloudera Issue: NAV-4602



Preventing concurrent logins

An option is now available to limit the number of simultaneous sessions authenticated against the same user name. The property nav.max.concurrent.sessions
takes an integer value as a limit; set the value to -1 (default) to turn off the limit. To change the default behavior, in Cloudera Manager, add the property with a new value to the "Navigator
Metadata Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for cloudera-navigator.properties." Restart the Navigator Metadata Server to apply the change.
Cloudera Issue: NAV-6020



Name and description lengths increased

This release increases the number of characters stored for entity names and descriptions in Navigator Metadata Server:

Name length was 40 characters and is now 500.
Description length was 500 and is now not limited.

Cloudera Issue: NAV-6228
