Issues Fixed in Cloudera Navigator 6.3.3


The following sections describe the issues fixed in the data management components of Cloudera Navigator 6.3.3:

Audit of HDFS set owner commands can include new owner name
Navigator UI does not propagate errors from an identity provider on logout failures
Security improvements




Audit of HDFS set owner commands can include new owner name

Like all audit events, the HDFS audit event for a setOwner transaction records the 'Owner' as the name of the user running the command. There was no audit
information to indicate the new owner of the file or directory affected. This change allows you to enable collection of the new owner name in the audit event's 'Operation' text.
To enable this change, put the following in the NameNode Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hdfs-site.xml:
cloudera.navigator.audit.hdfs.setOwner.addTarget=true
With this change activated, searches in Navigator Audits or API calls with Operation == setOwner need to be changed to use "LIKE" instead of equal,
Operation *==* setOwner to account for the additional metadata in the Operation text field.
Cloudera issue: NAV-7238



Navigator UI does not propagate errors from an identity provider on logout failures

Previously, exceptions in the interaction between the Navigator web server (Jetty) and an IDP would allow errors to be sent to the Navigator user interface as a stack trace. This problem
was apparent when Navigator logins were configured to user SAML and there was an error when a user logged out of Navigator. In this release, the error continues to be captured in the Navigator
Metadata Server log but is not displayed in the browser.
Cloudera issue: NAV-7218



Security improvements

This release includes security improvements for Navigator Audit Server including setting X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" in the response header to prevent browsers from MIME-sniffing a
response and being fooled into treating uploaded content as an executable or dynamic HTML file.
Cloudera issue: NAV-6180
