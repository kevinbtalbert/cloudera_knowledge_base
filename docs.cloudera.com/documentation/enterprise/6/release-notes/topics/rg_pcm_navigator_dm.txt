Product Compatibility Matrix for Cloudera Navigator

This matrix contains compatibility information across versions of Cloudera Navigator, Cloudera Manager, and CDH. For detailed information on each release, see Cloudera Navigator documentation. For details on services supported by Navigator in the latest release, see:

Audit: Operations by Component

Limitations:

Actions taken against Hive using the Hive CLI are not audited. Therefore if you have enabled auditing you should disable the Hive CLI to prevent actions against

In simple authentication mode, the username in log events is the username passed in the HiveServer2 connect command. If you do not pass a username in the connect command, the username
is log events is anonymous.
