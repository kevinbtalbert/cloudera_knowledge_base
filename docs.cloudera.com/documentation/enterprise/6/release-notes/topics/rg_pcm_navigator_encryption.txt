Product Compatibility Matrix for Cloudera Navigator Encryption

Cloudera Navigator encryption comprises several components. See Cloudera Navigator
Data Encryption Overview for more information on the components, concepts, and architecture involved in encrypting data.

See below for the individual compatibility matrices for each component:

Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server
Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee KMS
Cloudera Navigator HSM KMS
Cloudera Navigator Key HSM
Cloudera Navigator Encrypt




Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server

Because of a change in the ports used by Key Trustee Server, Navigator Encrypt versions lower than 3.7 and Key Trustee KMS versions lower than 5.4 are not supported in Key Trustee Server
5.4 and higher.

Key Trustee Server: Recommended Hardware and Supported Distributions
Recommended Hardware and Supported Distributions
Key Trustee Server must be installed on a dedicated server or virtual machine (VM) that is not used for any other purpose. The backing PostgreSQL database must be installed on the same
host as the Key Trustee Server, and must not be shared with any other services. For high availability, the active and passive Key Trustee Servers must not share physical resources. See Resource Planning for Data at Rest Encryption for more information.
The recommended minimum hardware specifications are as follows:

Processor: 1 GHz 64-bit quad core
Memory: 8 GB RAM
Storage: 20 GB on moderate- to high-performance disk drives

Key Trustee KMS: Recommended Hardware and Supported Distributions
The recommended minimum hardware specifications are as follows:

Processor: 2 GHz 64-bit quad core
Memory: 16 GB RAM
Storage: 40 GB on moderate- to high-performance disk drives

The Key Trustee KMS workload is CPU-intensive. Cloudera recommends using machines with capabilities equivalent to your NameNode hosts, with Intel CPUs that support AES-NI for optimum performance. Also, Cloudera strongly recommends that you
enable TLS for both the HDFS and the Key Trustee KMS services to prevent the passage of plain text key material between the KMS and HDFS data nodes.

Cloudera Navigator Key HSM

Cloudera Navigator Key HSM must be installed on the same host as Key Trustee Server. Although Key HSM is compatible across all versions of Key Trustee Server, Cloudera strongly
recommends also upgrading Key HSM after you upgrade Key Trustee Server. See Installing Cloudera Navigator Key HSM and Upgrading Cloudera Navigator Key HSM for more information.

Key HSM: Recommended Hardware and Supported Distributions
The following are prerequisites for installing Navigator Key HSM:

Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or higher with Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files:

JCE for Java SE 8
Note: JDK 1.8u161 and higher enable unlimited strength encryption by default, and do not require
policy files.

OpenJDK 11
Note: The Thales JCE libraries do not support Java 11, so running Key HSM with Thales on OpenJDK 11 is unsupported.



A supported HSM device:

Thales (formerly Safenet) Luna

v6

HSM firmware version: 6.2.1
HSM software version: 5.2.3-1




v7

HSM firmware version: 7.0.3
HSM software version: 7.2.0




SafeNet KeySecure

HSM firmware version: 6.2.1
HSM software version: 8.0.1, 8.1.0, 8.7.0


Thales nSolo, nConnect

HSM firmware version: 11.4.0
Client software version: 2.28.9cam136

Note: Thales Key HSM is unsupported because the Thales client Java libraries do not support Java 11.

AWS CloudHSM

Client software version: 1.1.1




Key Trustee Server 3.8 or higher
Important: You must install Key HSM on the same host as Key Trustee Server.


Root access is required to install Navigator Key HSM.

Cloudera Navigator Encrypt

Note: Cloudera Enterprise, with the exception of Cloudera Navigator Encrypt, is supported on platforms with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)
enabled and in enforcing mode. Cloudera is not responsible for SELinux policy development, support, or enforcement. If you experience issues running Cloudera software
with SELinux enabled, contact your OS provider for assistance.
If you are using SELinux in enforcing mode, Cloudera Support can request that you disable SELinux or change the mode to permissive to rule out SELinux as a factor when investigating reported issues.

Supported command-line interpreters:

sh (Bourne)
bash (Bash)
dash (Ubuntu)

Note: Navigator Encrypt does not support installation or use in chroot
environments.

Network Requirements
For new Navigator Key Trustee Server installations, Navigator Encrypt initiates TCP traffic over port 11371 (HTTPS) to the Key Trustee Server.
For upgrades, Navigator Encrypt initiates TCP traffic over ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to the Navigator Key Trustee Server.


Internet Access
You must have an active connection to the Internet to download many package dependencies, unless you have internal repositories or mirrors containing the dependent packages.


Maintenance Window
Data is not accessible during the encryption process. Plan for system downtime during installation and configuration.


Administrative Access
To enforce a high level of security, all Navigator Encrypt commands require administrative (root) access (including installation and configuration). If you do not have administrative
privileges on your server, contact your system administrator before proceeding.


Package Dependencies
Navigator Encrypt requires these packages, which are resolved by your distribution package manager during installation:

dkms
keyutils
ecryptfs-utils
libkeytrustee
navencrypt-kernel-module
openssl
lsof
gcc
cryptsetup

These packages may have other dependencies that are also resolved by your package manager. Installation works with gcc, gcc3, and gcc4.
