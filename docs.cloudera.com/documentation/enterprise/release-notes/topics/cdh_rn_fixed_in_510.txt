Issues Fixed in CDH 5.10.0


CDH 5.10.0 fixes the following issues.

Apache Hadoop Common
Apache HBase
Apache HDFS
Hue
Apache Oozie
Upstream Issues Fixed




Apache Hadoop Common

Have Hadoop use commons-daemon version from root pom


Apache Commons Daemon 1.0.3 has been removed in favor of Apache Commons Daemon 1.0.13.




Apache HBase

HBase shell commands correctly return missing namespace name

In prior releases, passing a non-existent namespace with GRANT and REVOKE commands to the HBase shell returned an error message displaying the user name, rather than the name of the
namespace. In this release, the error message correctly displays the missing namespace name. This change is a result of an underlying change to the error handling for the HBase shell; specifically,
the boolean namespace_exists? method now returns false when the namespace is not found, rather than the NamespaceNotFoundException.




Apache HDFS

fsck should also report decommissioning replicas

Bug: HDFS-7933
Cloudera Bug: CDH-47416
The output of HDFS fsck now also contains information about decommissioning replicas.



du reports false used space after appending to snapshotted files and deleting them

Bug: HDFS-7933
Cloudera Bug: CDH-40502
Disk usage summaries previously incorrectly counted files twice if they had been renamed (including files moved to Trash) since the last snapshot. Summaries now include current data plus
snapshot data that is no longer under the directory either due to deletion or being moved outside of the directory.
Fixed in Versions: 5.10, 5.10, 5.11.0



ACL inheritance conflicts with umaskmode

Bug: HDFS-6962
Cloudera Bug: CDH-26136
Previously, HDFS ACLs applied the client umask to the permissions when inheriting default ACLs from the parent directory. This differs from the POSIX ACL
specification. HDFS can now ignore the client umask to comply with the POSIX ACL specification.
Because this is a backward-incompatible change, this behavior is disabled by default. To enable it, set dfs.namenode.posix.acl.inheritance.enabled to true in hdfs-site.xml.




Hue

HUE-4541, CDH-44287 - Support Kerberos mutual authentication across HUE


HUE-4969, CDH-34544 - Support HiveServer2 + SASL (hive.server2.thrift.sasl.qop=”auth-conf”)

HUE-3079, CDH-41093 - Display YARN jobs and logs from JHS when not in RM

Cloudera Bug: OPSAPS-34608 - Support Oracle DB connectivity for CDH package installations





SQL Editor and General UX



HUE-5070, CDH-40886 - Stabilize Import documents
HUE-4032, CDH-44094 - Improve Sample Popup performance
HUE-4073 - Optimize SQL Assist rendering for large scrolls
HUE-4039 - Refine Autocompleter results
HUE-4726, CDH-35007 - Improve viewing Parquet formatted data






Apache Oozie

After enabling HA, Oozie may fail to start due to "NoSuchFieldError: EXTERNAL_PROPERTY

Bug: HIVE-1640
Cloudera Bug: CDH-42408
This issue happens in rare cases. Due to an incompatibility with the version of Jackson used by Oozie and Hive, and depending on the order that jars are
loaded into Oozie's classpath, Oozie may fail to start.
