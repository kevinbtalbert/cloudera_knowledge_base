Issues Fixed in CDH 5.13.2


CDH 5.13.2 fixes the following issues.

Hive Replications Can Fail Intermittently
Secure Impala-Kudu clusters need to be restarted frequently
Apache Hadoop MapReduce Job History Server (JHS) vulnerability
HUE
Apache Oozie Server Vulnerability
Upstream Issues Fixed




Hive Replications Can Fail Intermittently

This issue, which was also reported in TSB-2018-276, is fixed in CDH 5.13.2.
For further details, see the original Known Issue.



Secure Impala-Kudu clusters need to be restarted frequently

Due to Kudu-2264, secure, long-running Impala clusters on CDH 5.13.x and later will be unable to interact with Kudu tables after some time because the Kudu client used by Impala will no
longer be able to authenticate with Kudu. The problem starts after the client's ticket can no longer be renewed, which is typically after 7 days. Restarting the Impala service will allow Impala to
work with Kudu again.
Impala will begin failing to read or write Kudu tables with errors in the Impala daemon logs resembling:

Products Affected: Impala
Releases Affected: CDH 5.13.0, CDH 5.13.1, and CDH 5.14.0
Users Affected: Users running a secure cluster with Impala and Kudu.
Severity: Medium
Impact: Impala will not be able to query or write to Kudu tables until the service is restarted. The Impala service will need to be restarted periodically
in order to continue being able to work with Kudu tables.
Immediate action required: To work around the issue, users can restart the Impala service at least once per ticket renewal period. This period is typically
7 days.
Addressed in release: CDH 5.13.2, CDH 5.13.3, and CDH 5.14.2



Apache Hadoop MapReduce Job History Server (JHS) vulnerability

CVE: CVE-2017-15713
Immediate action required: Upgrade to a release where the issue is fixed.
Addressed in release/refresh/patch: CDH 5.13.2, 5.14.2, 5.15.0



HUE

Group sync fails when a non-standard (not uid) user_name_attr is used

Group sync fails when a non-standard (not uid) user_name_attr is used. For example, if a customer user "LDAP User Attribute" is used sync fails for users where the users uid value does
not match the user_name_attr defined in the configuration. There is also a "... is not JSON serializable" error when running "Sync LDAP Users/Groups"
Bug: CDH-61984




Apache Oozie Server Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the Oozie Server allows a cluster user to read private files owned by the user running the Oozie Server process.
Products affected: Oozie
Releases affected: All releases prior to CDH 5.12.0, CDH 5.12.0, CDH 5.12.1, CDH 5.12.2, CDH 5.13.0, CDH 5.13.1, CDH 5.14.0

Detected by: Daryn Sharp and Jason Lowe of Oath (formerly Yahoo! Inc)
Severity: (Low/Medium/High) High
Impact: The vulnerability allows a cluster user to read private files owned by the user running the Oozie Server process. The malicious user can construct a
workflow XML file containing XML directives and configuration that reference sensitive files on the Oozie server host.
CVE: CVE-2017-15712
Immediate action required: Upgrade to release where the issue is fixed.
Addressed in release/refresh/patch: CDH 5.13.2, 5.14.2

HDFS

Cannot re-encrypt an encryption zone if a previous re-encryption on it was canceled

When canceling a re-encryption on an encryption zone, the status of the re-encryption would continue to show "Processing". When this occurred, future re-encrypt commands for this
encryption zone failed inside the NameNode, and the re-encryption never completed.

Issues Fixed in CDH 5.13.0


CDH 5.13.0 fixes the following issues.

Sqoop 1
Upstream Issues Fixed in 5.13.0




Sqoop 1

Sqoop does not support Hive metastore HA for Parquet format

If the Hive metastore (HMS) is configured for high availability (HA), the value of the hive.metastore.uris property in /etc/hive/conf.cloudera.HIVE-1/hive-site.xml contains a list of URIs instead of one URI. For example:
<value>thrift://hive-1.example.com:9083,thrift://hive-2.example.com:9083,thrift://hive-3.example.com:9083</value>
Sqoop uses Kite for Parquet file handling and Kite does not support HMS HA. Using Kite, Sqoop takes the first URI from the hive.metastore.uris list and
uses that to connect to the HMS. If that address is not available, the Sqoop command fails.
This issue occurs when you use the following Sqoop arguments with the sqoop-import command: --hive-import and --as-parquetfile.
