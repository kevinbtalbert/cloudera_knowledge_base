Issues Fixed in CDH 5.14.x


The following topics describe issues fixed in CDH 5.14.x, from newest to oldest release. You can also review What's New in
CDH 5.14.x or Known Issues in CDH 5.

Issues Fixed in CDH 5.14.4
Issues Fixed in CDH 5.14.3

Issues Fixed in CDH 5.14.1
Issues Fixed in CDH 5.14.0




Issues Fixed in CDH 5.14.4


CDH 5.14.4 fixes the following issues.

Hadoop YARN Privilege Escalation CVE-2016-6811
Apache HBase potential privilege escalation for user of HBase “Thrift 1” API Server over HTTP CVE-2018-8025
Zip Slip Vulnerability CVE-2018-8009
Apache HiveQL SELECT STRUCT fails with RuntimeException
Apache Hive vulnerabilities CVE-2018-1282 and CVE-2018-1284
Upstream Issues Fixed




Hadoop YARN Privilege Escalation CVE-2016-6811

Fixed a vulnerability in Hadoop YARN that allows a user who can escalate to the yarn user the ability to possibly run arbitrary commands as the root user. CVE-2016-6811



Apache HBase potential privilege escalation for user of HBase “Thrift 1” API Server over HTTP CVE-2018-8025

CVE-2018-8025 describes an issue in Apache HBase that affects the optional "Thrift 1" API server when running over HTTP. There is a race-condition that could lead to authenticated
sessions being incorrectly applied to users, e.g. one authenticated user would be considered a different user or an unauthenticated user would be treated as an authenticated user.
Products affected: HBase Thrift Server
Releases affected:

CDH 5.4.x - 5.12.x
CDH 5.13.0, 5.13.1, 5.13.2, 5.13.3
CDH 5.14.0, 5.14.2, 5.14.3
CDH 5.15.0


Fixed versions: CDH 5.14.4
Users affected: Users with the HBase Thrift 1 service role installed and configured to work in “thrift over HTTP” mode. For example, those using Hue with
HBase impersonation enabled.
Severity: High
Potential privilege escalation.
CVE: CVE-2018-8025
Immediate action required: Upgrade to a CDH version with the fix, or, disable the HBase Thrift-over-HTTP service. Disabling the HBase Thrift-over-HTTP
service will render Hue impersonation inoperable and all HBase access via Hue will be performed using the “hue” user instead of the authenticated user.
Knowledge article: For the latest update on this issue see the corresponding Knowledge article - TSB: 2018-315: Potential privilege escalation for user of
HBase “Thrift 1” API Server over HTTP



Zip Slip Vulnerability CVE-2018-8009

“Zip Slip” is a widespread arbitrary file overwrite critical vulnerability, which typically results in remote command execution. It was discovered and responsibly disclosed by the Snyk
Security team ahead of a public disclosure on June 5, 2018, and affects thousands of projects.
Cloudera has analyzed our use of zip-related software, and has determined that only Apache Hadoop is vulnerable to this class of vulnerability in CDH 5. This has been fixed in upstream
Hadoop as CVE-2018-8009.



Apache HiveQL SELECT STRUCT fails with RuntimeException

The HiveQL query SELECT STRUCT("x",null); fails in CDH 5.10.0 onward and returns the following compilation error:

Error while compiling statement: FAILED: RuntimeException
java.lang.RuntimeException: Hive internal error: conversion of void to void not
supported yet.
        
This has been fixed in CDH 5.14.4 (CDH-67208) and later and now HiveQL queries like SELECT STRUCT("x",null); run successfully.



Apache Hive vulnerabilities CVE-2018-1282 and CVE-2018-1284

This security bulletin, TSB 2018-299, covers two vulnerabilities that have
been addressed in CDH 5.14.4 and later:

CVE-2018-1282: JDBC driver is susceptible to SQL injection attack if the input parameters are not properly cleaned
CVE-2018-1284: Hive UDF series UDFXPathXXXX allows users to pass carefully crafted XML to access arbitrary files


For further details, see the original Known Issue for Hive.

For further details, see the original Known Issue.



Crash due to CHECK failure during compactions: pv_delete_redo != nullptr

This issue, which was also reported in TSB-2018-298, is fixed in CDH 5.13.3
and 5.14.2. For further details, see the original Known Issue.



Secure Impala-Kudu clusters need to be restarted frequently

Due to Kudu-2264, secure, long-running Impala clusters on CDH 5.13.x and later will be unable to interact with Kudu tables after some time because the Kudu client used by Impala will no
longer be able to authenticate with Kudu. The problem starts after the client's ticket can no longer be renewed, which is typically after 7 days. Restarting the Impala service will allow Impala to
work with Kudu again.
Impala will begin failing to read or write Kudu tables with errors in the Impala daemon logs resembling:

Products Affected: Impala
Releases Affected: CDH 5.13.0, CDH 5.13.1, and CDH 5.14.0
Users Affected: Users running a secure cluster with Impala and Kudu.
Severity: Medium
Impact: Impala will not be able to query or write to Kudu tables until the service is restarted. The Impala service will need to be restarted periodically
in order to continue being able to work with Kudu tables.
Immediate action required: To work around the issue, users can restart the Impala service at least once per ticket renewal period. This period is typically
7 days.
Addressed in release: CDH 5.13.2, CDH 5.13.3, and CDH 5.14.2

tokens.
KUDU-2044 - Tombstoned tablets no longer report metrics.
KUDU-2173 - Fixed a bug in the C++ client which could cause tablets to be erroneously pruned,
or skipped, during certain scans, resulting in fewer results than expected being returned from queries. The bug only affected tables whose range partition columns are a proper prefix of the primary

ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256 TLSv1.2 Kx=ECDH Au=RSA Enc=AES(128) Mac=SHA256
AES256-GCM-SHA384 TLSv1.2 Kx=RSA Au=RSA Enc=AESGCM(256) Mac=AEAD
