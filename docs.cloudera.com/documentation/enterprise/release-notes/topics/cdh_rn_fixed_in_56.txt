Issues Fixed in CDH 5.6.x


The following topics describe issues fixed in CDH 5.6.x, from newest to oldest release. You can also review What's New In CDH
5.6.x or Known Issues in CDH 5.

Issues Fixed in CDH 5.6.1
Issues Fixed in CDH 5.6.0




Issues Fixed in CDH 5.6.1


CDH 5.6.1 fixes the following issues.

Apache Hadoop
Apache HBase
Upstream Issues Fixed




Apache Hadoop

FSImage may get corrupted after deleting snapshot

Bug: HDFS-9406
Cloudera Bug: CDH-33224
When deleting a snapshot that contains the last record of a given INode, the fsimage may become corrupt because the create list of the snapshot diff in the previous snapshot and the
child list of the parent INodeDirectory are not cleaned.




Apache HBase

The ReplicationCleaner process can abort if its connection to ZooKeeper is inconsistent

Bug: HBASE-15234
If the connection with ZooKeeper is inconsistent, the ReplicationCleaner may abort, and the following event is logged by the HMaster:
WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.master.ReplicationLogCleaner: Aborting ReplicationLogCleaner
because Failed to get list of replicators
Unprocessed WALs accumulate.
The seekBefore() method calculates the size of the previous data block by assuming that data blocks are contiguous, and HFile v2 and higher store Bloom
blocks and leaf-level INode blocks with the data. As a result, reverse scans do not work when Bloom blocks or leaf-level INode blocks are present when HFile v2 or higher is used.
Workaround: Restart the HMaster occasionally. The ReplicationCleaner restarts if necessary and process the unprocessed
WALs.
