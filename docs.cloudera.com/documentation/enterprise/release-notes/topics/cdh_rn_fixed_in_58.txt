Upstream Issues Fixed




Kerberized HS2 with LDAP authentication fails in a multi-domain LDAP case

In CDH 5.7, Hive introduced a feature to support HS2 with Kerberos plus LDAP authentication; but it broke compatibility with multi-domain LDAP cases on CDH 5.7.x and C5.8.x versions.
Affected Versions: CDH 5.7.1, CDH 5.8.0, and CDH 5.8.1
Fixed in Versions: CDH 5.7.2 and higher, CDH 5.8.2 and higher
Bug: HIVE-13590.
Workaround: None.



Apache Oozie

Oozie Web Console returns 500 error when Oozie server runs on JDK 8u75 or higher

Bug: OOZIE-2533

The Oozie Web Console returns a 500 error when the Oozie server is running on JDK 8u75 and higher. The Oozie server still functions, and you can use the Oozie command line, REST API,
Java API, or the Hue Oozie Dashboard to review status of those jobs.

Issues Fixed in CDH 5.8.0


CDH 5.8.0 fixes the following issues.

Apache Flume
Flume fully compatible with Kafka 2.x
Apache HBase
Apache Hive
Hue
Cloudera Distribution of Apache Kafka
Apache Oozie
Apache Sentry
Apache ZooKeeper




Apache Flume


Flume fully compatible with Kafka 2.x

In release CDH 5.8.0, Flume is fully compatible with Kafka 2.x, including support for security features.



Apache HBase

Premature EOF detected in a WAL During Replication

Cloudera Bug: CDH-38113
During the parsing of a write-ahead log (WAL) during replication, an InvalidProtobufException can occur while reading the source RegionServer WAL, if
EOF (end-of-file) is incorrectly detected before the actual end of the file. HBase stops reading the WAL after the EOF, and does not parse any bytes which occur after
the EOF, causing data loss.
To work around this problem, Cloudera has patched HBase. HBase in CDH 5.8.0 and higher detect whether unparsed bytes exist after the EOF, and if so, the
WAL is reset and re-read from the beginning, to attempt a clean read-through.
In testing, a single reset has been sufficient to work around observed data loss. However, the above change will retry a given WAL file indefinitely. On each attempt, a log message
such as this will be emitted at the WARN level:
Processing end of WAL file '{}'. At position {}, which is too far away from
reported file length {}. Restarting WAL reading
Additional log detail are emitted at the TRACE level about file offsets seen while handling recoverable errors.



Batch Get after Batch Put Does Not Fetch All Cells

Bug: HBASE-15811
Cloudera Bug: CDH-40344
A batch Get after a batch Put could fail to fetch cells that were written by the Get, resulting in a "read-your-writes" failure. This bug was exacerbated by high load on the client.



Read Replica Failure For PUT Operation During Region Transition

Cloudera Bug: CDH-39758
When the patch for HBASE-10794 was applied in CDH 5.4.4, a new bug was introduced, where, if the primary RegionServer becomes unavailable (for any reason, even a graceful shutdown),
while a client is performing PUTs on that region, subsequent PUTs will fail.



Latency Metrics Inaccurate for MultiGet Operations

Bug: HBASE-15673
Cloudera Bug: CDH-39422
Latency values are written after each row is processed. However, if MultiGet is enabled, some rows are not counted in the metrics. This causes the metrics
for the 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles to be reported as 0.



Inconsistent Behavior Among DeleteColumnFamilyProcedure, CreateTableProcedure, and ModifyTableProcedure

Bug: HBASE-15456
Cloudera Bug: CDH-12345
If there is only one family in the table, DeleteColumnFamilyProcedure will fail. When hbase.table.sanity.checks is set to
false, the HMaster logs a warning, but CreateTableProcedure and ModifyTableProcedure will now fail, where
before they logged a warning, but succeeded. This makes the behavior of all three methods consistent.



Failed hbase-spark Bulk Loads Leave Files Behind

Bug: HBASE-15271
Cloudera Bug: CDH-38145
When using the bulk load helper provided by the hbase-spark module, output files are now written into temporary files and only made available when the
executor has successfully completed. Previously, failed executors would leave files behind, and these files would be picked up by subsequent bulk load commands, and spurious copies of some cells were
written.

With Sentry enabled, only Hive admin users have access to YARN job logs
As a prerequisite of enabling Sentry, Hive impersonation is turned off, which means all YARN jobs are submitted to the Hive job queue, and are run as the hive user. This is an issue because the YARN History Server now has to block users from accessing logs for their own jobs, since their own usernames are not associated with the
jobs. As a result, end users cannot access any job logs unless they can get sudo access to the cluster as the hdfs, hive or other admin users.
In CDH 5.8 (and higher), Hive overrides the default configuration, mapred.job.queuename, and places incoming jobs into the connected user's job queue, even
though the submitting user remains hive. Hive obtains the relevant queue/username information for each job by using YARN's fair-scheduler.xml file.




Hue

Cannot query the customers table in Hue

Bug: HUE-3040
Cloudera Bug: CDH-33974
To query the customers table, users must re-create the parquet data for compatibility.




Cloudera Distribution of Apache Kafka

CDH 5.7 is not compatible with Cloudera Distribution of Apache Kafka 1.x

Cloudera Distribution of Apache Kafka 1.x is compatible with CDH 5.4+.




Apache Oozie

PySpark does not work from the Oozie Spark Action

Bug: OOZIE-2482
Cloudera Bug: CDH-36349
The Spark Action would typically fail with a message like, "key not found: SPARK_HOME," but other error messages were possible. After the fix, the Spark Action has the necessary changes
to successfully run PySpark jobs. See Oozie Spark Action
Extension for more details and an example. Cloudera makes the PySpark dependencies available.




Apache Sentry

Security


Sentry does not check privileges on the URI used for the CREATE INDEX LOCATION '/path' command
Bug: SENTRY-1231
The CREATE INDEX LOCATION '/path' command would succeed even if a user did not have the required URI privileges for the /path.


Upgraded libthrift to version 0.9.3 due to a security vulnerability
Cloudera Bug: CDH-40034
For details on the security vulnerability in the Apache Thrift client libraries, see THRIFT-3231.




Hive Binding


INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY command does not work correctly
Bug: SENTRY-922
The INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY command would write table data into an HDFS directory (hdfs://path/), even if privileges are
granted only for the local directory (file://path/).


INSERT INTO no longer requires URI privilege on partition locations
Bug: SENTRY-1095
The INSERT INTO Hive command adds location information to the partition description. Usually if location information is included, you must ensure that the
user has privileges on the corresponding URI. However, in this case, since the partition locations are under the table directory and can be easily generated, these requirements have been relaxed.


Change default value of sentry.hive.server
Bug: SENTRY-1112
The default value for sentry.hive.server was changed from server1 to an empty string.




Sentry Service


Sentry's Oracle upgrade scripts fails with ORA-00955
Bug: SENTRY-1066
Sentry upgrade scripts for Oracle would fail with error, ORA-00955, because during the upgrade, the script inadvertently creates an index with the same name as the constraint being
dropped. The script will now run DROP INDEX before it adds the constraint again and completes the schema upgrade successfully.


grantServerPrivilege() and revokeServerPrivilege() should treat '*' and 'ALL' as synonyms
Bug: SENTRY-1252
The grantServerPrivilege() and revokeServerPrivilege() methods should treat * and
ALL as synonyms when an action is not explicitly specified. Previously, if grantServerPrivilege() was called without an action, and
followed up with a revokeServerPrivilege() invocation with an action such as ALL, the server-level privilege would not be revoked. This
fix only applies to privileges that are granted after upgrading to CDH 5.8.




Sentry Debugging


Error in Hive Metastore Plugin (renameAuthzObject) log messages
Bug: SENTRY-1169
The renameAuthzObject plugin prints log messages with old path names in place of new path names.





Apache ZooKeeper

Upgrade Netty Due to Security Vulnerabilities

Bug: ZOOKEEPER-2450
Cloudera Bug: CDH-39988
Netty was upgraded from version 3.2.2 to 3.10.5 to resolve security vulnerabilities.



Fix Privacy Violation in Login.java

Bug: ZOOKEEPER-2405
Cloudera Bug: CDH-36673
In Login.java, getTGT() was logging confidential information in DEBUG mode. After the fix, only principals are logged.
