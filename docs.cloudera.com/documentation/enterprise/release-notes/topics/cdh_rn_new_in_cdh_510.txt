What's New In CDH 5.10.0

Apache HBase



Replication debugging functionality has been added.


G1 Garbage Collection performance has been improved.





Apache Hive



HIVE-14269 : Enhanced write performance for Hive tables stored on
Amazon S3.
See Tuning Apache Hive Performance on the Amazon S3 Filesystem in CDH.





Hue



HUE-4560: Auto-configure Hue connectivity to S3 for all components.
See How to Enable S3 Cloud Storage in Hue.





Apache Impala

See New Features in Impala 2.8.x / CDH 5.10.x.



Apache Oozie

OOZIE-2225 In addition to the filter parameters name, user, group, status, frequency and unit, Oozie now supports a wild card parameter that matches a partial name, a partial user, or a complete ID.
For example, a query with text='asdf' would return all jobs that satisfy ANY of the following conditions.

job.name.contains(text)
job.user.contains(text)
job.id = text





Cloudera Search


The solrctl command can be run in debug mode using the --debug or --trace parameters.




YARN


Expose maxResources per user in YARN Dynamic Resource Pools
YARN Dynamic Resource Pools now supports default capacity limits (Max Resources) that automatically apply to all child
pools of any resource pool. You can control the YARN resources available to any user or group on the cluster by configuring these settings on a parent pool, and then use placement rules to
auto-create child pools per user or group.

UX improvements in the Pools page
Improvements include:

Every input row is now clickable and takes the user to that input field in the edit dialog.
Split vcores (min/max) and memory (min/max) into min resources and max resources.
Renamed Configuration Sets tab to Resource Limits.
