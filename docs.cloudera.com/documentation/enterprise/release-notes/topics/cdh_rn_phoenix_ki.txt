Apache Phoenix Known Issues

Potential deadlock on region opening with secondary index recovery

Distributed deadlock happens in clusters with a moderate number of regions for the data tables, secondary index tables.
Products affected: Phoenix
Releases affected:Phoenix 4.14.1 parcel
User affected: Users of Phoenix with secondary indexes
Severity (Low/Medium/High): Medium
Impact: Deadlock on region opening
Immediate action required/workaround:
Make the following configuration changes in HBase:
1) Set hbase.master.startup.retainassign to false
2) Increase the value of hbase.regionserver.executor.openregion.threads and restart cluster should bring up cluster.
If you continue to encounter issues, tune the following assignment manager parameters to match the count of regions for faster assignments:

hbase.assignment.threads.max
hbase.master.namespace.init.timeout
hbase.master.wait.on.regionservers.mintostart
hbase.bulk.assignment.threshold.regions
hbase.bulk.assignment.threshold.servers
