Apache Sqoop Known Issues

MySQL JDBC driver shipped with CentOS 6 systems does not work with Sqoop

CentOS 6 systems currently ship with version 5.1.17 of the MySQL JDBC driver. This version does not work correctly with Sqoop.
Bug: None
Affected Versions: MySQL JDBC 5.1.17, 5.1.4, 5.3.0
Cloudera Bug: CDH-23180
Workaround: Install version 5.1.31 of the JDBC driver as detailed in Installing the JDBC Drivers for Sqoop 1 (Sqoop 1) or Configuring Sqoop 2
(Sqoop 2).



MS SQL Server "integratedSecurity" option unavailable in Sqoop

The integratedSecurity option is not available in the Sqoop CLI.
Bug: None
Workaround: None



Sqoop 1

Sqoop does not support Hive metastore HA for Parquet format

If the Hive metastore (HMS) is configured for high availability (HA), the value of the hive.metastore.uris property in /etc/hive/conf.cloudera.HIVE-1/hive-site.xml contains a list of URIs instead of one URI. For example:
<value>thrift://hive-1.example.com:9083,thrift://hive-2.example.com:9083,thrift://hive-3.example.com:9083</value>
Sqoop uses Kite for Parquet file handling and Kite does not support HMS HA. Using Kite, Sqoop takes the first URI from the hive.metastore.uris list and
uses that to connect to the HMS. If that address is not available, the Sqoop command fails.
This issue occurs when you use the following Sqoop arguments with the sqoop-import command: --hive-import and --as-parquetfile.
Bug: CDH-57895
Affected Versions: CDH 5.12.x and below.
Fixed in Versions: CDH 5.13 and higher.
Cloudera Bug: CDH-57895
Workaround: None.



Sqoop1 Metastore job tool ignores overrides

Sqoop job command option overrides are being ignored due to SQOOP-2896. The exec action should let you override arguments in a saved job by passing
options after --, as in:

sqoop job --exec job -- options_to_override>

However, the values in options_to_override are not being passed to the saved job. Sqoop jobs that use overrides can break or execute incorrectly, as
shown in the example below.

sqoop job --create my_eval_query â€“- eval --connect jdbc:mysql://fqdn.example.com:3306/db --username user --password password --query "select * from t1"

This command executes the job defined in my_eval_query and returns the rows in the table:
sqoop job --exec my_eval_query
c1  c2           c3
1   2017-02-17   row data 1
2   2017-02-17   row data 2
3   2017-02-17   row data 3
In this next run below, the override query is ignored. The job uses the original parameters stored for the job and returns the same rows as before rather than the single row where
column c1 = 2:
sqoop job --exec my_eval_query -- --query  "select * from t1 where c1 = 2"
c1  c2           c3
1   2017-02-17   row data 1
2   2017-02-17   row data 2 <--- Only this row should be returned
3   2017-02-17   row data 3
Affected releases: CDH 5.8.0, 5.8.1, 5.8.3, 5.8.4; CDH 5.9.0, 5.9.1; CDH 5.10.0
Bug: SQOOP-2896
Cloudera Bug: CDH-51101
Fixed in Versions: CDH 5.8.5, CDH 5.9.2, CDH 5.9.3, CDH 5.10.1, CDH 5.10.2, CDH 5.11.0 (and higher) releases.



Sqoop1 (doc import + --as-parquetfile) limitation with KMS/KTS Encryption at Rest

Due to a limitation with Kite SDK, it is not possible to use (sqoop import --as-parquetfile) with KMS/KTS Encryption zones. See the following example.
sqoop import --connect jdbc:db2://djaxludb1001:61035/DDBAT003 --username=dh810202 --P --target-dir /data/hive_scratch/ASDISBURSEMENT --delete-target-dir -m1 --query "select disbursementnumber,disbursementdate,xmldata FROM DB2dba.ASDISBURSEMENT where DISBURSEMENTNUMBER = 2011113210000115311 AND \$CONDITIONS" -hive-import --hive-database adminserver -hive-table asdisbursement_dave --map-column-java XMLDATA=String --as-parquetfile

16/12/05 12:23:46 INFO mapreduce.Job: map 100% reduce 0%
16/12/05 12:23:46 INFO mapreduce.Job: Job job_1480530522947_0096 failed with state FAILED due to: Job commit failed: org.kitesdk.data.DatasetIOException: Could not move contents of hdfs://AJAX01-ns/tmp/adminserver/.temp/job_1480530522947_0096/mr/job_1480530522947_0096 to hdfs://AJAX01-ns/data/RetiredApps/INS/AdminServer/asdisbursement_dave
<SNIP>
Caused by: org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException(java.io.IOException): /tmp/adminserver/.temp/job_1480530522947_0096/mr/job_1480530522947_0096/5ddcac42-5d69-4e46-88c2-17bbedac4858.parquet can't be moved into an encryption zone.
Cloudera Bug: CDH-40826 and SQOOP-2943
Workaround: Use an alternate data file type, for example text or avro.



Doc import as Parquet files may result in out-of-memory errors

Out-of-memory (OOM) errors can be caused in the following two cases:

With many very large rows (multiple megabytes per row) before initial-page-run check (ColumnWriter)
When rows vary significantly by size so that the next-page-size check is based on small rows and is set very high followed by many large rows


Bug: PARQUET-99
Cloudera Bug: CDH-50896
Workaround: None, other than restructuring the data.



Hive, Pig, and Sqoop 1 fail in MRv1 tarball due to incorrect HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME setting

This issue affects tarball installations only.
Bug: None
Cloudera Bug: CDH-6640. Fixed for packages only: CDH-6648.
Workaround: For MRv1 only, manually edit as follows:

Change the path for the Hadoop MapReduce home setting in /etc/default/hadoop from:
export HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME=/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce
to:
export HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME=/usr/lib/hadoop-0.20-mapreduce
Remove /usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce from the HADOOP_CLASSPATH.





Sqoop 2

Sqoop 2 client cannot be used with a different version of the Sqoop 2 server

The Sqoop 2 client and server must be running the same CDH version.
Cloudera Bug: CDH-11901
Workaround: Make sure all Sqoop 2 components are running the same version of CDH.



Sqoop 2 upgrade may fail if any job's source and destination links point to the same connector

For example, the links for the job shown in the following output both point to generic-jdbc-connector:
sqoop:000> show job --all
