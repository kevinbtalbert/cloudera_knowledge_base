CDH 5 Packaging and Tarball Information


Each CDH release series is made up of a collection of CDH project packages that are known to work together. The package version numbers of the CDH projects in each CDH release are
listed in the following table.
Important: When installing CDH from Cloudera tarballs, note that certain features of Hadoop have not been
included in the tarballs and will only be available if you have the native libraries present.
To see the details of all the changes and bug-fixes for a given component in a given release, make sure you read the Changes file as well as the Release Notes, following the links in the
tables below.

Important: As of February 1, 2021, all downloads of CDH and Cloudera Manager require a username and password and use a modified URL. You must
use the modified URL, including the username and password when downloading the repository contents described below. You may need to upgrade Cloudera Manager to a newer version that uses the modified
URLs.
This can affect new installations, upgrades, adding new hosts to a cluster, adding a cluster and adding new services to a cluster.
For more information, see Updating an existing CDH/Cloudera Manager deployment to access downloads with authentication.



Examples of Versions

Cloudera packages are designed to be transparent and easy to customize. CDH 5 packages are labeled using the following format:
component-base_version+cdh_version+patch_level
where,

component-base_version is the version of the open-source component included in the CDH package
cdh_version is the version of the CDH package
patch_level is the number of source commits applied on top of the base version forked from the Apache Hadoop branch. The list of source commits includes
all backports and all non-functional changes such as CDH packaging and branding commits. Note that the number of commits does not indicate the number of functional changes or bug fixes in the
release. For example, a commit may be used to amend a version number or make other non-functional changes. The list of actual patches that will match the count is found inside the CDH tarball's
../cloudera/patches/ directory. All of the source commits Cloudera has applied is also available in source form in that directory.

For example:





Package


Component


Branch


Base Version


CDH Version


Patch Level






hadoop-2.3.0+cdh5.1.0+795


hadoop


2.3


2.3.0


5.1.0


795




hue-3.6.0+cdh5.1.0+86


hue


3.6 


3.6.0


5.1.0


86




parquet-1.2.5+cdh5.1.0+130


parquet


1.2


1.2.5


5.1.0


130









CDH Package Manifests

Both the CDH patched source and packages contain explicit information about Cloudera modifications. For example, in the patched source there is a top-level cloudera directory with:

A CHANGES.cloudera.txt file that lists all the changes to the pristine source
A patches directory that contains every patch Cloudera has applied to the pristine source. All Cloudera patches are released with an Apache 2.0
license.
A files directory for files Cloudera created from scratch, such as man pages and configuration files. All Cloudera files are released with an Apache 2.0
license.
A README.cloudera file that explains explicitly how to recreate the patches source from the pristine source.




Build and Release Numbering

If you are installing CDH 5 with a package manager, you will also see build and release information as part of the file name. The build and package release fields follow the patch level:
for example, hbase-0.98.1+cdh5.1.0+64-1.cdh5.1.0.p0.34.el6.x86_64.rpm. The suffix -1.cdh5.1.0.p0.34.el6.x86_64 represents:

the base of the release field (1)
the CDH release (cdh5.1.0)
the customer patch identifier (p0 — which will be 0 for all regular CDH releases but will increment for customer patches)
the build number (34)
the distribution (el6 = RHEL/CentOs 6, el5 = RHEL/Centos 5, sles11 = SLES 11)
the processor architecture (x86_64, noarch, i386, amd_64).
noarch means the packages are not architecture-specific.




External Documentation

Cloudera provides documentation for CDH as a whole, whether your CDH cluster is managed by Cloudera Manager or not. In addition, you may find it useful to refer to documentation for
the individual components included in CDH. Where possible, these links point to the main documentation for a project, in the Cloudera release archive. This ensures that you are looking at the correct
documentation for the version of a project included in CDH. Otherwise, the links may point to the project's main site.
