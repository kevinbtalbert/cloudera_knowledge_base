Updating an existing CDH/Cloudera Manager deployment to access downloads with authentication

Access to Cloudera Manager binaries for production purposes requires authentication. To access the binaries at the locations below, you must first have an active subscription agreement
and obtain a license key file along with the required authentication credentials (username and password).
If your deployment was not installed using authenticated downloads and if you need to add hosts to an existing cluster, or add new clusters, you must follow the steps in this topic to
configure your deployment to access the downloads.
Note that as of February 1, 2021, the download URLs on archive.cloudera.comhave changed. They are the same as the previous URLs, except that /p is added to the URL, after archive.cloudera.com. Depending on where you use the URL, you may also need to prepend your credentials to the URL. The
instructions below contain that information. For example:
https://username:password@archive.cloudera.com/p/...
For a complete list of download URLs, see:

Cloudera Manager 5.x Version and Download
Information
CDH 5.x Download Information




Add hosts to an existing cluster
See

Add hosts to an existing cluster managed by Cloudera Manager using parcels,
below.
Add hosts to an existing cluster managed by Cloudera Manager using
packages


Add a new cluster
If you are adding a CDH cluster that is the same version of CDH as another cluster managed by the same instance of Cloudera Manager, no further action is required. To add a new cluster
with a different supported version of CDH, see

Adding a Cluster to an existing Cloudera Manager deployment using Parcels,
below.
Adding a Cluster to an existing Cloudera Manager deployment using
Packages


New Installations
You must use the new URLs and include your username and password to access downloads for a new installation. See Cloudera Installation
Guide.
Upgrades
You must use the new URLs and include your username and password to access downloads for the upgrade. See the Cloudera Enterprise Upgrade Guide.


If your deployment was installed or upgraded using authenticated downloads, no further action is needed.

Obtain Credentials
The license key file and authentication credentials are provided in an email sent to customer contacts from Cloudera when a new license is issued. If you have an existing
license with a CDP Private Cloud Base Edition entitlement, you might not have received an email. In this instance you can identify the authentication credentials from the license key file. If you do
not have access to the license key, contact your account representative to receive a copy.
The license key file and authentication credentials are provided in an email sent to customer accounts from Cloudera when a new license is issued. If you have an existing license with a
Cloudera Enterprise entitlement, you might not have received an email. In this instance you can identify the authentication credentials from the license key file. If you do not have access to the
license key, contact your account representative to receive a copy.
To identify your authentication credentials using your license key file, complete the following steps:

From cloudera.com, log into the cloudera.com account associated with the Cloudera Enterprise license and subscription agreement.
On the Cloudera CDH Download page, select the version that you want to install and click Get It Now!.
Scroll down to the Credentials Generator at the bottom of the page.
In the Generate Credentials text box, copy and paste the text of the “PGP Signed Message” within your license key file and click Get Credentials. The
credentials generator returns your username and password.


Note: Take note of the authentication credentials. You will need them during installation to complete tasks such as configuring a remote or local
package repository.

When you obtain your authentication credentials, use them to form the URLs below, where you can access the Cloudera repositories in the Cloudera Archive.


Prepare your deployment
There are two options for access to the downloads:

Option A: Upgrade Cloudera Manager and configure the package manager

Upgrade Cloudera Manager to one of the versions listed below. (If you are using Cloudera Manager 6.3.3 or higher, you do not need to upgrade.) Cloudera
Manager is compatible with any version of CDH that is equal to lower than the Cloudera Manager version. The versions of Cloudera Manager shown below have been updated to use authenticated downloads:


Cloudera Manager Upgrades for authenticated downloads


Current Cloudera Manager
version

Upgrade Cloudera Manager
to this version





5.0.0 - 5.16.2
5.16.2.4505




Note: You do not need to upgrade CDH.
To upgrade Cloudera Manager:

Go to the interactive Cloudera Enterprise Upgrade
guide page for upgrading Cloudera Manager.
In the form at the top of the page, select the current version of your Cloudera Manager deployment.
Select the appropriate new version of Cloudera Manager from the table above.

Select the operating system, database, and Navigator status.


Follow the remaining steps on the page to upgrade the Cloudera Manager server and agents.



Configure your operating system package manager (yum, zypper, or apt-get) to access the public Cloudera repositories at archive.cloudera.com. See the following links;

.


Option B: Use a local package and/or parcel repository

Use a local package and /or parcel repository. If your cluster does not have access to the internet, this is the only option.

Download the contents of the repository for your version of the software from archive.cloudera.com using your username and password.
Do one of the following:

Create a local package repository (for Cloudera Manager and CDH clusters installed using packages). See the following
links:
