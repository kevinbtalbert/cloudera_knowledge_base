Component Versions

For a complete list of the individual component versions, see the manifest.json file in the parcel directory for your chosen release. The component
version numbers are the same in parcels as the package distributions for each release.

Go to https://username:password@archive.cloudera.com/p/cdh5/parcels/.
Open the directory for your release (for example, /cdh5/parcels/5.9.0).
Open the manifest.json file.


For each component, the pkg_version is a concatenation of <upstream_version>+<cdh_version>+<number_of_patches_on_upstream_release>.
For example, in /cdh5/parcels/5.9.0/manifest.json, this entry for Hadoop shows an upstream version is 2.6.0, the CDH ` version is 5.9.0, and there have
been 1,799 patches to the upstream version in the 2.6.0 release.
{
  "pkg_version": "2.6.0+cdh5.9.0+1799",
  "pkg_release": "1.cdh5.9.0.p0.30",
  "name": "hadoop",
  "version": "2.6.0-cdh5.9.0"
}
