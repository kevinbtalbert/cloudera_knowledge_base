Issues Fixed in Cloudera Navigator HSM KMS 5.14.0

 For details about what is new in this release, see New Features and Changes in Cloudera Navigator HSM KMS.



Issues Fixed in Cloudera Navigator HSM KMS 5.13.0


Failure creating keys after Metastore restart.
Previously, stopping or restarting the HSM KMS Metastore role while the HSM KMS Proxy role remained running resulted in stale metastore connections and errors such the following: "FATAL:
terminating connection due to administrator command."
Cloudera Bug: KT-4912




Issues Fixed in Cloudera HSM KMS 5.12.1


Key version number information now reported correctly by Hadoop key list -metadata operation after key roll.
Previously, after the key roll operation, the key's version number remained the same. Now, rather than returning a hard-coded version number on keys loaded from metastore, that
information is returned dynamically.
Cloudera Bug: KT-5044


Key description is not synchronized with the second metastore
When the description option was specified as the argument in a Hadoop key create command, then the description information was stored only on the KMS
instance that responded to the create request. The description metadata was not synchronized to the other KMS instances in the role group. This issue did not affect normal key operations.
Cloudera Bug: KT-5042




Issues Fixed in Cloudera Navigator HSM KMS 5.12.0

This is the first release of Cloudera Navigator HSM KMS and consequently, there are no fixed issues. For details about what is new in this release, see New Features and Changes in Cloudera Navigator HSM KMS.
