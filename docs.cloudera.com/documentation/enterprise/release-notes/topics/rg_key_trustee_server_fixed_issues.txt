Issues Fixed in Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server 5.15.0


ktbackup.sh script not rolling GPG encrypted files
Encrypted backup tarballs have an additional .gpg file extension after .tar to indicate that they are encrypted
(.tar.gpg). When the ktbackup.sh script searched for files to roll, it only sought files that ended in .tar, so it was not rolling the encrypted backup tarballs. The script has been updated to account for the .tar.gpg extension for encrypted backups,
and now rolls them as expected.
Cloudera Bug: KT-6107



Issues Fixed in Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server 5.14.0


Malicious user can access database used to store HDFS encryption zone keys
This vulnerability, which impacted Key Trustee Server, allowed anyone with access to the host on which Key Trustee Server is running to use a non-libpq based connection driver to connect
to the Postgres database used by Key Trustee Server without specifying a password.
The keys stored in the database are encrypted, which means access to data could not be gained by this method. However, the vulnerability could provide a way for someone to alter
encryption zone key metadata, delete the encryption zone keys, or delete the contents of the entire database.
Cloudera Bug: DOCS-2788

Issues Fixed in Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server 5.8.0


Key Trustee Server logs superfluous error during registration
When you register a client to the Key Trustee Server, the following error message appears in the Key Trustee Server log:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/keytrustee/server/webapp.py", line 2151, in lookup
    return hkp.lookup(g.hkpdb, app.config['LOCAL_FINGERPRINT'])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/keytrustee/server/hkp.py", line 72, in lookup
    raise wzex.BadRequest("Operation not specified.")
BadRequest: 400: Operation not specified.




Issues Fixed in Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server 5.7.0


Email messages from Key Trustee Server use hostname instead of fully qualified domain name
Email sent from Key Trustee Server includes a link that uses the Key Trustee Server short name instead of the fully qualified domain name.


Host Inspector displays the wrong version of Key Trustee Server
Host Inspector displays the wrong Key Trustee Server version, showing the Key Trustee KMS version instead.


Key Trustee Server supports weak RC4 ciphers for TLS
Key Trustee Server supports weak RC4 ciphers for TLS connections, potentially allowing clients to negotiate a weaker connection.


The ktadmin keyhsm command fails with M2Crypto error
Running the ktadmin keyhsm --server https://khsm01.example.com:9090 --trust command fails with the following error:
M2Crypto.X509.X509Error: 140405990356800:error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line:pem_lib.c:703:Expecting: CERTIFICATE



Issues Fixed in Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server 5.5.2

After enabling synchronous replication, the Passive Database role fails to start when restarting the Key Trustee Server service in Cloudera Manager.


Key Trustee Server using CherryPy allows SSLv3
Key Trustee Server using CherryPy as the web backend allows SSLv3 connections, which are considered insecure.


Key Trustee Server sends wrong command in email notification
When you register a client, Key Trustee Server sends an email notification with a command to import the Key Trustee Server GPG key. The command uses the hkp protocol and port 80. The correct protocol is hkps and the correct port is 11371.


Enabling synchronous replication fails if python-ordereddict is not installed
On Key Trustee Server hosts where the python-ordereddict package is not installed, enabling synchronous replication fails, and the Passive Database role
fails to start. The stderr.log file for the DB_ACTIVE-setup process (/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/ID-keytrustee_server-DB_ACTIVE-setup/logs/stderr.log contains the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "aux/prop2x.py", line 14, in <module>
    from ordereddict import OrderedDict
ImportError: No module named ordereddict


Key Trustee Server does not respond to requests
On systems with low entropy, local fingerprint generation fails during setup, but Cloudera Manager reports no issues with the Key Trustee Server service. Subsequent attempts to use Key
Trustee Server fail with an error similar to the following in the Key Trustee Server log:

Cannot register a client with Key Trustee Server after registering GPG public key
After creating an organization, the organization administrator receives a link to register a GPG key. If the administrator registers the GPG key before any clients are registered with
the organization, all subsequent registrations with that organization fail.


Starting Key Trustee Server with --daemonize option fails
Starting Key Trustee Server with the command keytrustee-server start --daemonize fails with the following error:
2015-04-01 05:33:26,843 - cherrypy.error - ERROR - [01/Apr/2015:05:33:26] ENGINE Error in 'start' listener <bound method Daemonizer.start of <cherrypy.process.plugins.Daemonizer object at 0x1e71490>>

Starting Key Trustee Server when it is already running updates keytrustee.pid file
If you try to start Key Trustee Server when it is already running, the /var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee/keytrustee.pid file is updated with the new
process ID (PID). The new process fails to start, but the keytrustee.pid retains the new PID, and service commands fail with the
following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/keytrustee-server", line 136, in <module>
    main()
  File "/usr/bin/keytrustee-server", line 131, in main

keytrustee.exceptions.KeytrusteeError: Invalid PID path: /var/lib/keytrustee/.keytrustee/keytrustee.pid


Starting Key Trustee Server while the port is in use fails silently
If you try to start Key Trustee Server while the port is in use (for example, due to a stale process or another process using the port), the process appears to start successfully, but
ends shortly after with no indication to the user. The Key Trustee Server log contains the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/cherrypy/process/wspbus.py", line 235, in start
    self.publish('start')
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/cherrypy/process/wspbus.py", line 215, in publish
    raise exc

Starting Key Trustee Server as a user other than keytrustee fails
Starting Key Trustee Server as a user other than keytrustee (for example, as root or another super user) fails.




Issues Fixed in Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee Server 5.4.9


Cannot register a client with Key Trustee Server after registering GPG public key
After creating an organization, the organization administrator receives a link to register a GPG key. If the administrator registers the GPG key before any clients are registered with
the organization, all subsequent registrations with that organization fail.

Passive Database role sometimes fails to start when starting the Key Trustee Server service
Starting or restarting the Key Trustee Server service attempts to start the Active Database role and Passive Database role. If the Active Database has not completed starting up when the
Passive Database attempts to start, the Passive Database fails to start.


For parcel-based installations, client and path environments must be manually configured
Users cannot use Key Trustee Server command-line utilities without configuring the path and setting environment variables.


Initializing high availability Key Trustee Servers fails if SSH communication fails
Initializing the active Key Trustee Server fails if the active Key Trustee Server cannot reach the passive Key Trustee Server over the default SSH port (22).


Enabling synchronous replication for high availability Key Trustee Servers fails
Running the ktadmin enable-synchronous-replication command does not properly configure synchronous replication in Key Trustee Server 5.4.0.
