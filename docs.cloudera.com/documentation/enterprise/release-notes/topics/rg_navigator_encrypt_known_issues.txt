Known Issues and Workarounds in Cloudera Navigator Encrypt


Navigator Encrypt will not build on RHEL kernel 3.10.0-862.14.4
The Navigator Encrypt kernel module will not build on RHEL kernel 3.10.0-862.14.4. This impacts new installations, and existing installations that are upgrading to kernel
3.10.0-862.14.4. This issue prevents the navencrypt-mount service from running and Navigator Encrypt mount points from being accessible.
Affected Versions: 3.15.1
Fixed in Version: 3.16.0
Cloudera Bug: KT-6677
Workaround: Upgrade to Navigator Encrypt 3.16.0 before upgrading to RHEL kernel 3.10.0-862.14.4.


Interactive console does not support UUID and datastore options
The Interactive console does not support UUID (3.13 and later) and datastore options (3.14.0 and earlier).
Affected Versions: Navigator Encrypt versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16.
Fixed in Version: None
Cloudera Bug: DOCS-2505
Workaround: None.

Fixed in Version: Navigator Encrypt 3.14.0 (option deprecated)
Cloudera Bug: KT-5113
Workaround: Execute a temporal command such as cp /data/encrypted /destination/path to temporarily add the process (for
example, cp) to the ACLs.


Navigator Encrypt progress bar random display anomaly
When running the navencrypt-move command, the graphic display of progress randomly breaks. This display anomaly does not impact the
move operation and there is no data loss. This is a graphic display issue only, and is not related to the move command operation being performed.
When the display issue occurs, it appears as follows:

Moving from: '/local/mnt/navencrypt/mount/mysql/local/mnt/mis/mysql/2net_kernel'
Moving to: '/local/mnt/mis/mysql/2net_kernel'
100% [====/usr/sbin/navencrypt-move: line 462: printf: write error: Interrupted system call
100% [=======================================================>] [ 72.06 GB]
Affected Versions: CDH: 5.3.0, 5.4.0, 5.5.0, 5.6.0, 5.7.0, 5.8.0, 5.9.0, 5.10.0, 5.11.0, 5.12.0/Navigator Encrypt: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12,
3.13
Fixed in Version: CDH 5.15.0/Navigator Encrypt 3.15
Cloudera Bug: KT-5093
Workaround: None.


The navencrypt status --integrity command does not detect loop devices properly

Affected Versions: CDH 5.8.0/Navigator Encrypt 3.10.
Fixed in Version: CDH 5.10.0/Navigator Encrypt 3.11.
Cloudera Bug: KT-3174
Workaround: None.

3.10.0-514.2.2.el7.x86_64
3.10.0-514.16.1.el7.x86_64
3.10.0-514.10.2.el7.x86_64

Note that this is not specific to a particular platform; rather, it is specific only to the kernels listed here.
Affected Versions: CDH 5.9.0/Navigator Encrypt: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
Fixed in Version: CDH 5.11.0/Navigator Encrypt 3.13
