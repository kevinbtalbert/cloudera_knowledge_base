CDH 5 and Cloudera Manager 5 Requirements and Supported Versions

In an enterprise data hub, Cloudera Manager and CDH interact with several products such as Apache Accumulo, Apache Impala, Hue, Cloudera Search, and Cloudera Navigator. This guide
provides information about which major and minor release version of a product is supported with which release version of CDH and Cloudera Manager.
Compatibility across different release versions of Cloudera Manager and CDH must be taken into account, especially when carrying out install/upgrade procedures.
JDK compatibility also varies across different Cloudera Manager and CDH versions. Certain versions of CDH 5 are compatible with both JDK 7 and JDK 8. In such cases, ensure all your
services are deployed on the same major version. For example, you should not run Hadoop on JDK 7 while running Sqoop on JDK 8. Additionally, since Cloudera does not support mixed environments, all
nodes in your cluster must be running the same major JDK version. Cloudera supports Oracle JDKs and, starting with Cloudera Enterprise 5.16, OpenJDK. For more information about the supported JDK versions, see CDH
and Cloudera Manager Supported JDK Versions.

CDH Requirements for Cloudera Manager

Cloudera uses the following versioning convention: major.minor.maintenance. If a cluster runs Cloudera Manager 5.14.0, the major version is 5; the minor version is 14; and the
maintenance version is 0.
The Cloudera Manager minor version must always be equal to or greater than the CDH minor version. Older versions of Cloudera Manager might not support features in newer versions of
CDH.
For example, Cloudera Manager 5.12.0 can manage CDH 5.12.2 because the minor versions are equal. Cloudera Manager 5.12.0 cannot manage CDH 5.14.0 because the Cloudera Manager minor
version, 12, is less than the CDH minor version, 14.
Important: Using Cloudera Manager 6.0.x to manage a CDH 5.15.x or CDH 5.16 cluster is not a supported configuration.



CDH and Cloudera Manager Supported Operating Systems

Note: Cloudera sometimes certifies OS releases between Cloudera Enterprise releases. When this occurs, the following tables are updated. This means
that although an OS release might not be supported at the time of a Cloudera Enterprise release, it can be supported later.

CDH 5.x provides 64-bit packages for select versions of RHEL-compatible, SLES, Ubuntu, and Debian operating systems.

CDH and Cloudera Manager 5.0.x Supported Operating Systems


Important:
In order to be covered by Cloudera Support:

All CDH hosts in a logical cluster must run on the same major OS release.
Cloudera supports a temporarily mixed OS configuration during an OS upgrade project.
Cloudera Manager must run on the same OS release as one of the CDH clusters it manages.


Cloudera recommends running the same minor release cross-cluster. However, the risk caused by running different minor OS releases is considered lower than the risk of running different
major OS releases.
CDSW Gateway hosts may use RHEL/Centos 7.2, subject to some restrictions. See Operating System Support for
CDSW Gateway Hosts (CDH 5.11 and higher only)

Points to note:

Cloudera strongly discourages using RHEL 5 for new installations.
RHEL / CentOS / OL 6.9 is supported in C5.7 and higher. In C5.7.x through 5.11.0, it has a known
cipher issue (that is resolved in 5.11.1).
Red Hat only supports specific upgrades from RHEL 6 to 7. Contact your OS vendor and review What are
the supported use cases for upgrading to RHEL 7?
SLES hosts running Cloudera Manager agents must use SLES SDK 11 SP1.
Cloudera does not support CDH cluster deployments in Docker containers.
Cloudera is not responsible for developing or supporting SELinux policies. For more information, see CDH and
Cloudera Manager Networking and Security Requirements.
Apache Kudu OS Requirements - Kudu is supported only on a subset of the operating systems supported by CDH and Cloudera Manager. For details, refer
Supported Operating Systems (Kudu 1.2.0 / CDH 5.10.x and higher).
Cloudera Data Science Workbench OS Requirements - Cloudera Data Science Workbench is supported only on a subset of the operating systems supported by CDH
and Cloudera Manager. For details, refer the CDSW documentation.

Filesystem Requirements

Supported Filesystems

The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is designed to run on top of an underlying filesystem in an operating system. Cloudera recommends that you use either of the following
filesystems tested on the supported operating systems:

ext3: This is the most tested underlying filesystem for HDFS.
ext4: This scalable extension of ext3 is supported in more recent Linux releases.
Important: Cloudera does not support in-place upgrades from ext3 to ext4. Cloudera recommends that you format disks as ext4 before using them
as data directories.

XFS: This is the default filesystem in RHEL 7.

Kudu Filesystem Requirements - Kudu is supported on ext4 and XFS. Kudu requires a kernel version
and filesystem that supports hole punching. Hole punching is the use of the fallocate(2) system call with the FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE option
set. For more details, see Kudu troubleshooting - Error During Hole
Punch Test.



File Access Time

Linux filesystems keep metadata that record when each file was accessed. This means that even reads result in a write to the disk. To speed up file reads, Cloudera recommends that you
disable this option, called atime, using the mount option in /etc/fstab:
/dev/sdb1 /data1 ext4 defaults,noatime 0
Apply the change without rebooting:
mount -o remount /data1


Filesystem Mount Options

The filesystem mount options have a sync option that allows you to write synchronously.
However, using the sync option will lead to poor performance for services that write data to disks, such as HDFS, YARN, Kafka and Kudu. In CDH most writes
are already replicated. Therefore, having synchronous writes to disks is unnecessary, expensive, and not worth the added safety it provides.
NFS and NAS options must not be used as DataNode Data Directory mounts, not even when using Hierarchal Storage features.




CDH and Cloudera Manager Supported Databases

Cloudera Manager and CDH come packaged with an embedded PostgreSQL database for use in a non-production environment. The embedded PostgreSQL database is not supported in production
environments. For production environments, you must configure your cluster to use external databases.
In most cases (but not all), Cloudera supports versions of MariaDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL that are native to each supported Linux distribution.
After installing a database, upgrade to the latest patch and apply appropriate updates. Available updates may be specific to the operating system on which it is installed.
Notes:

Use UTF8 encoding for all custom databases.
For MySQL 5.6 and 5.7, you must install the MySQL-shared-compat or MySQL-shared package. This is required for the Cloudera Manager Agent
package installation.
MySQL GTID-based replication is not supported.
Both the Community and Enterprise versions of MySQL are supported, as well as MySQL configured by the AWS RDS service.
Cloudera supports Oracle Exadata and RAC instances when they serve as backend databases for CDH components without high availability. Cloudera software is architected with the
assumption of a single database instance, and supports normal operations between Cloudera Enterprise and Oracle Exadata (or RAC) in such an environment. Cloudera cannot reasonably test and certify on
each strategy for each RDBMS. Cloudera expects HA solutions for RDBMS to be transparent to Cloudera software, and therefore are not supported and debugged by Cloudera. It is the responsibility of the
customer to provision, configure, and manage the RDBMS HA deployment, so that Cloudera software behaves exactly as it would when interfacing with a single, non-HA service. Cloudera will support and
help customers troubleshoot issues when a cluster has HA enabled. While diagnosing database-related problems in Cloudera components, customers may be required to temporarily disable or bypass HA
mechanisms for troubleshooting purposes. If an HA-related issue is found, it is the responsibility of the customer to engage with the database vendor so that a solution to that issue can be
found.


Important: When you restart processes, the configuration for each of the services is redeployed using information saved in the Cloudera
Manager database. If this information is not available, your cluster cannot start or function correctly. You must schedule and maintain regular backups of the Cloudera Manager database to recover the
cluster in the event of the loss of this database. For more information, see Backing Up
Databases.

CDH and Cloudera Manager Supported JDK Versions

Note: A Java optimization called compressed oops (ordinary object pointers) enables a 64-bit JVM to
address heap sizes up to about 32 GB using 4-byte pointers. For larger heap sizes, 8-byte pointers are required. This means that a heap size slightly less than 32 GB can hold more objects than a heap
size slightly more than 32 GB.
If you do not need more than 32 GB heap, set your heap size to 31GB or less to avoid this issue. If you need 32 GB or more, set your heap size to 48 GB or higher to account for the
larger pointers. In general, for heap sizes above 32 GB, multiply the amount of heap you need by 1.5.

Only 64 bit JDKs are supported. Oracle JDK 7
is supported across all versions of Cloudera Manager 5 and CDH 5. Oracle JDK 8 is supported in Cloudera Enterprise 5.3.x and higher.
OpenJDK 8 is supported in Cloudera Enterprise 5.16.1 and higher.
Oracle JDK 9 is not supported in any Cloudera Manager or CDH version.
Unless specifically excluded, Cloudera supports later updates to a major JDK release from the release that support was introduced. For example, Oracle JDK 8u102 was released prior to CDH
5.9, but is supported in CDH 5.3 and higher because support for Oracle JDK 8 was added in CDH 5.3. Cloudera excludes or removes support for select Java updates when security is jeopardized.
Running CDH nodes within the same cluster on different JDK releases is not supported. JDK release across a cluster needs to match the patch level.

Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Requirement

If you are using CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 or higher, or Ubuntu, you must install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy File on all cluster hosts (including gateway hosts). This is to ensure that JDK uses the same default
encryption type (aes256-cts) as that used by Red Hat/CentOS operating systems, Kerberos, and the rest of the CDH cluster.
On a managed deployment, Cloudera Manager can install the JCE on hosts. For unmanaged deployments, use the installation instructions in the README.txt
file included in jce_policy-x.zip.

JCE for Java SE 7
For JDK 1.8.0_150 (and lower) - JCE for Java SE 8


Enabling Unlimited Strength Encryption for JDK 1.8.0_151 (and later)


As of JDK 1.8.0_151, unlimited strength encryption can be enabled using the java.security file as documented in the JDK 1.8.0_151 release notes. You do not need to install the JCE policy
files.


As of JDK 1.8.0_161, unlimited strength encryption has been enabled by default. No further action is required.

Cloudera Manager Resource Requirements

Cloudera Manager requires the following resources:

Disk Space

Cloudera Manager Server

5 GB on the partition hosting /var.
500 MB on the partition hosting /usr.
For parcels, the space required depends on the number of parcels you download to the Cloudera Manager Server and distribute to Agent hosts. You can download multiple parcels of the
same product, of different versions and different builds. If you are managing multiple clusters, only one parcel of a product/version/build/distribution is downloaded on the Cloudera Manager
Server—not one per cluster. In the local parcel repository on the Cloudera Manager Server, the approximate sizes of the various parcels are as follows:

CDH 5 (which includes Impala and Search) - 1.5 GB per parcel (packed), 2 GB per parcel (unpacked)
Impala - 200 MB per parcel
Cloudera Search - 400 MB per parcel




Cloudera Management Service -The Host Monitor and Service Monitor databases are stored on the
partition hosting /var. Ensure that you have at least 20 GB available on this partition.
Agents - On Agent hosts, each unpacked parcel requires about three times the space of the downloaded parcel on the Cloudera Manager Server. By default,
unpacked parcels are located in /opt/cloudera/parcels.


RAM - 4 GB is recommended for most cases and is required when using Oracle databases. 2 GB might be sufficient for non-Oracle deployments with fewer than
100 hosts. However, to run the Cloudera Manager Server on a machine with 2 GB of RAM, you must tune down its maximum heap size (by modifying -Xmx in
/etc/default/cloudera-scm-server). Otherwise the kernel might kill the Server for consuming too much RAM.
Python - Cloudera Manager requires Python 2.4 or higher (but is not compatible with Python 3.0 or higher). Hue in CDH 5 and package installs of CDH 5
require Python 2.6 or 2.7. All supported operating systems include Python version 2.4 or higher. Cloudera Manager is compatible with Python 2.4 through the latest version of Python 2.x. Cloudera
Manager does not support Python 3.0 and higher.
Perl - Cloudera Manager requires perl.
python-psycopg2 package - Cloudera Manager 5.8 and higher has a new dependency on the package python-psycopg2. This package
is not available in standard SLES 11 and SLES 12 repositories. You need to add this repository or install it manually to any machine that runs the Cloudera Manager Agent before you install or upgrade
Cloudera Manager.
If the Cloudera Manager Server and Agent run on the same host, install the Cloudera Manager Server first and then add the python-psycopg2 repository or
package. After adding the repository or package, install the Cloudera Manager Agent.
Download the python-psycopg2 repository or package from the following URL by selecting the correct SLES version: https://software.opensuse.org/package/python-psycopg2.

iproute package - Cloudera Manager 5.12 and higher has a new dependency on the iproute
package. Any machine that runs the Cloudera Manager Agent requires the package. Which version you need depends on the operating system:


iproute package


Operating System
iproute version




CentOS 6.x
iproute-2.6


CentOS 7.x
iproute-3.10


RHEL 6.x
iproute-2.6


RHEL 7.x
iproute-3.10


SLES 11 SP3
iproute2-2.6


SLES 11 SP4
iproute2-3.0


SLES 12 and 12 SP1
iproute2-3.12


SLES 12 SP4
iproute2-4.4










CDH and Cloudera Manager Networking and Security Requirements

The hosts in a Cloudera Manager deployment must satisfy the following networking and security requirements:

Networking Protocols Support
CDH requires IPv4. IPv6 is not supported and must be disabled.
Note: Contact your OS vendor for help disabling IPv6.

See also Configuring Network Names.

Multihoming Support
– Multihoming CDH or Cloudera Manager is not supported outside specifically certified Cloudera partner appliances. Cloudera finds that current Hadoop architectures
combined with modern network infrastructures and security practices remove the need for multihoming. Multihoming, however, is beneficial internally in appliance form factors to take advantage of
high-bandwidth InfiniBand interconnects.
Although some subareas of the product may work with unsupported custom multihoming configurations, there are known issues with multihoming. In addition, unknown issues
may arise because multihoming is not covered by our test matrix outside the Cloudera-certified partner appliances.

Entropy
Data at rest encryption requires sufficient entropy to ensure randomness.
See entropy requirements in Data at Rest Encryption Requirements.

Cluster hosts must have a working network name resolution system and correctly formatted /etc/hosts file. All cluster hosts must have properly configured
forward and reverse host resolution through DNS. The /etc/hosts files must:

Contain consistent information about hostnames and IP addresses across all hosts
Not contain uppercase hostnames
Not contain duplicate IP addresses

Cluster hosts must not use aliases, either in /etc/hosts or in configuring DNS. A properly formatted /etc/hosts file should
be similar to the following example:
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
192.168.1.1 cluster-01.example.com cluster-01
192.168.1.2 cluster-02.example.com cluster-02
192.168.1.3 cluster-03.example.com cluster-03 
In most cases, the Cloudera Manager Server must have SSH access to the cluster hosts when you run the installation or upgrade wizard. You must log in using a root account or an account
that has password-less sudo permission. For authentication during the installation and upgrade procedures, you must either enter the password or upload a public and private key pair for the root or
sudo user account. If you want to use a public and private key pair, the public key must be installed on the cluster hosts before you use Cloudera Manager.
Cloudera Manager uses SSH only during the initial install or upgrade. Once the cluster is set up, you can disable root SSH access or change the root password. Cloudera Manager does not
save SSH credentials, and all credential information is discarded when the installation is complete.

If single user mode is not enabled, the Cloudera Manager Agent runs as root so
that it can make sure the required directories are created and that processes and files are owned by the appropriate user (for example, the hdfs and mapred users).
No blocking is done by Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux).
Note: Cloudera Enterprise, with the exception of Cloudera Navigator Encrypt, is supported on platforms with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)
enabled and in enforcing mode. Cloudera is not responsible for SELinux policy development, support, or enforcement. If you experience issues running Cloudera software
with SELinux enabled, contact your OS provider for assistance.
If you are using SELinux in enforcing mode, Cloudera Support can request that you disable SELinux or change the mode to permissive to rule out SELinux as a factor when investigating reported issues.


No blocking by iptables or firewalls; port 7180 must be open because it is used to access Cloudera Manager after installation. Cloudera Manager communicates using specific ports, which
must be open.
For RHEL and CentOS, the /etc/sysconfig/network file on each host must contain the hostname you have just set (or verified) for that host.
Cloudera Manager and CDH use several user accounts and groups to complete their tasks. The set of user accounts and groups varies according to the components you choose to install. Do
not delete these accounts or groups and do not modify their permissions and rights. Ensure that no existing systems prevent these accounts and groups from functioning. For example, if you have
scripts that delete user accounts not in a whitelist, add these accounts to the list of permitted accounts. Cloudera Manager, CDH, and managed services create and use the following accounts and
groups:

Product Compatibility Matrix for CDK Powered By Apache Kafka

CDK Powered By Apache Kafka is currently distributed as a package and in a parcel that is independent of the CDH parcel. The parcel integrates with Cloudera Manager using a Custom
Service Descriptor (CSD). Using the latest features of Kafka sometimes requires a newer version of Cloudera Manager and/or CDH that supports the feature. This matrix describes the compatibility
between CDK Powered by Apache Kafka and Cloudera Manager and CDH.

Kafka Client-Broker Compatibility across Kafka Versions

Maintaining compatibility across different Kafka clients and brokers is a common issue. This can occur as part of any of the following scenarios:

Upgrading your Kafka cluster without upgrading your Kafka clients
Using a third-party application that produces to or consumes from your Kafka cluster
Having a client program communicating with two or more Kafka clusters (e.g. consuming from one cluster and producing to a different cluster)
Using Flume or Spark as a Kafka consumer

In these cases, it is important to understand client/broker compatibility across Kafka versions. Here are general rules that apply:

Newer Kafka brokers can talk to older Kafka clients. The reverse is not true.
Changes in either the major part or the minor part of the upstream version major.minor determines whether the
client and broker are compatible.

As a result, the general pattern for upgrading Kafka from version A to version B is:

Change Kafka server.properties to refer to version A.
Upgrade the brokers to version B and restart the cluster.
Upgrade the clients to version B.
After all the clients are upgraded, change the properties from the first step to version B and restart the cluster.




Kafka Client Versions Used by Apache Flume in CDH

Flume has an embedded Kafka client which it uses to talk to Kafka clusters. Since the generally accepted practice is to have the broker running the same or newer version as the client, a
CDH Flume version requires being matched to a minimum Kafka version. This matrix lists the CDK Powered By Apache Kafka (CDK) client versions used by Apache Flume in CDH, as well as the underlying
Apache Kafka base version. For more information about CDK, see the Cloudera Distribution
of Kafka Documentation.

Product Compatibility Matrix for Apache Kudu

This matrix contains compatibility information across versions of Kudu and CDH/Cloudera Manager. Starting with Apache Kudu 1.5.0 / CDH 5.13.0, Kudu is fully integrated into CDH and ships
as part of the CDH parcel and packages.
Documentation for Kudu 1.5.0 / CDH 5.13.x (and higher) can be found at Apache Kudu Guide. Documentation for all lower versions can be found at Apache Kudu 1.4.0
(and lower).

Supported Operating Systems (Kudu 1.2.0 / CDH 5.10.x and higher)

Starting in CDH 5.13, Kudu supports the same OSs and versions as Cloudera Manager and CDH with the following exceptions.

RHEL 5 is not supported.
Ubuntu 12 is not supported.
Debian 7 is not supported.
macOS

10.10 Yosemite, 10.11 El Capitan, and 10.12 Sierra are supported.
Pre-built macOS packages are not provided.


Microsoft Windows is not supported.

For a complete list of supported versions, see CDH and Cloudera Manager
Supported Operating Systems.



Filesystem Requirements

Kudu is supported on ext4 and XFS. Kudu requires a kernel version and filesystem that supports hole punching. Hole punching is the use of the fallocate(2) system call with the FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE option set. For more details, see Kudu troubleshooting - Error During Hole Punch Test.



nscd Recommendation

Although not a strict requirement, it's highly recommended that you use nscd to cache both DNS name resolution and static name resolution for Kudu. See
Troubleshooting Kudu for more information.



JDK Requirements


JDK 7
JDK 8
Note that Spark 2.2 (and higher) requires Java 8 at runtime even though the Kudu Spark 2.x integration is Java 7 compatible. Spark 2.2 is the default dependency version as of Kudu 1.5.0
/ CDH 5.13.





Hardware Requirements


Kudu currently requires a CPU that supports the SSSE3 and SSE4.2 instruction sets. If you are to run Kudu inside a VM, enable SSE4.2 pass-through to pass through SSE4.2 support into
the VM.
One or more hosts to run Kudu masters. You should have either one master (provides no fault tolerance), three masters (can tolerate one failure), or five masters (can tolerate two
failures).
One or more hosts to run Kudu tablet servers. With replication, a minimum of three tablet servers is necessary.
Storage - If solid state storage is available, storing Kudu WALs on such high-performance media might significantly improve latency when Kudu is
configured for its highest durability levels.





Product Compatibility Matrix for Cloudera Navigator

This matrix contains compatibility information across versions of Cloudera Navigator, Cloudera Manager, and CDH. For detailed information on each release, see Cloudera Navigator documentation.
Note:
Cloudera Navigator requires HiveServer2 for complete governance Hive queries. Cloudera Navigator does not capture audit events for queries that are run on HiveServer1/Hive CLI, and
lineage is not captured for certain types of operations that are run on HiveServer1.
HiveServer1 and Hive CLI are deprecated in CDH 5. If you use Cloudera Navigator to capture auditing, lineage, and metadata
for Hive operations, upgrade to HiveServer2 if you have not done so already.

Audit Events).
Minimum Supported Service Version




HDFS


Operations that access or modify a file's or directory's data or metadata
Operations denied due to lack of privileges


CDH 5.0.0


HBase


In simple authentication mode, if the HBase Secure RPC Engine property is false (the default), the username in log events is UNKNOWN. To see a meaningful username:

Click the HBase service.
Click the Configuration tab.
Select Service-wide > Security.
Set the HBase Secure RPC Engine property to true.
Save the change and restart the service.




CDH 5.0.0


Hive


Operations (except grant, revoke, and metadata access only) sent to HiveServer2
Operations denied due to lack of privileges

Limitations:

Actions taken against Hive using the Hive CLI are not audited. Therefore if you have enabled auditing you should disable the Hive CLI to prevent actions against
Hive that are not audited.
In simple authentication mode, the username in log events is the username passed in the HiveServer2 connect command. If you do not pass a username in the connect command, the username
is log events is anonymous.


CDH 5.0.0


Hue


Operations (except grant, revoke, and metadata access only) sent through the Beeswax Server
User operations such as log in, log out, add and remove user, add and remove LDAP group, add and remove user from LDAP group

Data at Rest Encryption Requirements

Encryption comprises several components, each with its own requirements.
Data at rest encryption protection can be applied at a number of levels within Hadoop:


OS filesystem-level
Network-level
HDFS-level (protects both data at rest and in transit)


This section contains the various hardware and software requirements for all encryption products used for Data at Rest Encryption.
For more information on supported operating systems, see Product Compatibility Matrix for Cloudera Navigator
Encryption.
For more information on the components, concepts, and architecture for encrypting data at rest, see Encrypting Data at
Rest.

Entropy Requirements
See Entropy Requirements.


Cloudera Manager Requirements
Installing and managing Key Trustee Server using Cloudera Manager requires Cloudera Manager 5.4.0 and higher. Key Trustee Server does not require Cloudera Navigator Audit Server or
Metadata Server.


umask Requirements
Key Trustee Server installation requires the default umask of 0022.


Network Requirements
For new Key Trustee Server installations (5.4.0 and higher) and migrated upgrades (see Migrate Apache Web Server to CherryPy for more information), Key Trustee Server requires the following TCP ports to be
opened for inbound traffic:

11371
Clients connect to this port over HTTPS.

11381 (PostgreSQL)
The passive Key Trustee Server connects to this port for database replication.


For upgrades that are not migrated to the CherryPy web server, the pre-upgrade port settings are preserved:

80
Clients connect to this port over HTTP to obtain the Key Trustee Server public key.

443 (HTTPS)
Clients connect to this port over HTTPS.

5432 (PostgreSQL)
The passive Key Trustee Server connects to this port for database replication.




TLS Certificate Requirements
To ensure secure network traffic, Cloudera recommends obtaining Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates specific to the hostname of your Key Trustee Server. To obtain the
certificate, generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Key Trustee Server host. The CSR must be signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
After the certificate has been verified and signed by the CA, the Key Trustee Server TLS configuration requires:

The CA-signed certificate
The private key used to generate the original CSR
The intermediate certificate/chain file (provided by the CA)

Cloudera recommends not using self-signed certificates. If you use self-signed certificates, you must use the --skip-ssl-check parameter when registering
Navigator Encrypt with the Key Trustee Server. This skips TLS hostname validation, which safeguards against certain network-level attacks. For more information regarding insecure mode, see Registration Options.




Product Compatibility Matrix for Cloudera Navigator Encryption

Cloudera Navigator encryption comprises several components. See Cloudera Navigator
Data Encryption Overview for more information on the components, concepts, and architecture involved in encrypting data.
Although the version numbers differ between some Cloudera Navigator encryption components and Cloudera Enterprise, the encryption component releases are generally coordinated with
Cloudera Enterprise releases. See the following table for information on which component versions correspond with a given Cloudera Enterprise release.
Note: The following table is not a compatibility matrix. It lists the Cloudera Navigator encryption component versions that were released around
the same time as the corresponding Cloudera Enterprise release.

Key Trustee KMS


Key Trustee KMS: Recommended Hardware and Supported Distributions
The recommended minimum hardware specifications are as follows:


Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 7 or higher with Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files:

JCE for Java SE 7
JCE for Java SE 8
Note: JDK 1.8u161 and higher enable unlimited strength encryption by default, and do not require
policy files.






Processor: 2 GHz 64-bit quad core
Memory: 16 GB RAM
Storage: 40 GB on moderate-to high-performance disk drives

The Key Trustee KMS workload is CPU-intensive. Cloudera recommends using machines with capabilities equivalent to your NameNode hosts, with Intel CPUs that support AES-NI for optimum performance. Also, Cloudera strongly recommends that you
enable TLS for both the HDFS and the Key Trustee KMS services to prevent the passage of plain text key material between the KMS and HDFS data nodes.

Cloudera Navigator Encrypt

Note: Cloudera Enterprise, with the exception of Cloudera Navigator Encrypt, is supported on platforms with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)
enabled and in enforcing mode. Cloudera is not responsible for SELinux policy development, support, or enforcement. If you experience issues running Cloudera software
with SELinux enabled, contact your OS provider for assistance.
If you are using SELinux in enforcing mode, Cloudera Support can request that you disable SELinux or change the mode to permissive to rule out SELinux as a factor when investigating reported issues.

Supported command-line interpreters:

sh (Bourne)
bash (Bash)
dash (Debian)

Note: Navigator Encrypt does not support installation or use in chroot
environments.

Network Requirements
For new Navigator Key Trustee Server (5.4.0 and higher) installations, Navigator Encrypt initiates TCP traffic over port 11371 (HTTPS) to the Key Trustee Server.
For upgrades and Key Trustee Server versions lower than 5.4.0, Navigator Encrypt initiates TCP traffic over ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to the Navigator Key Trustee Server.


Internet Access
You must have an active connection to the Internet to download many package dependencies, unless you have internal repositories or mirrors containing the dependent packages.


Maintenance Window
Data is not accessible during the encryption process. Plan for system downtime during installation and configuration.


Administrative Access
To enforce a high level of security, all Navigator Encrypt commands require administrative (root) access (including installation and configuration). If you do not have administrative
privileges on your server, contact your system administrator before proceeding.


Package Dependencies
Navigator Encrypt requires these packages, which are resolved by your distribution package manager during installation:

dkms
keyutils
ecryptfs-utils
libkeytrustee
navencrypt-kernel-module
openssl
lsof
gcc
cryptsetup

These packages may have other dependencies that are also resolved by your package manager. Installation works with gcc, gcc3, and gcc4.

Product Compatibility Matrix for Apache Sentry

Sentry enables role-based, fine-grained authorization for HiveServer2 and provides classic database-style authorization for Hive, Cloudera Impala and Cloudera Search. You can use either
the Sentry service (introduced in Cloudera Manager 5.1.0 and CDH 5.1.0) or the policy file approach to secure your data.
Note: It's possible for a single cluster to use both the Sentry service (for Hive and Impala) and Sentry policy files (for Solr).

Supported Replication Scenarios
In Cloudera Manager 5, replication is supported between CDH 5 or CDH 4 clusters. The following tables describe support for HDFS and Hive/Impala replication. The versions listed in the
table are the lowest version of Cloudera Manager and CDH required to perform the replication. For example, replication with TLS/SSL enabled on Hadoop services on the source and destination clusters
requires Cloudera Manager and CDH version 5.0 or higher on the source and destination.
The tables below list the supported replication scenarios:
Note: BDR supports replication scenarios where TLS is enabled for non-Hadoop services (Hive/Impala) and TLS is disabled Hadoop services (such as
HDFS,YARN, and MapReduce) if the Cloudera Manager and CDH versions are a supported replication scenario.

Supported Replication Scenarios for Clusters using Isilon Storage

Note the following when scheduling replication jobs for clusters that use Isilon storage:

As of CDH 5.8 and higher, Replication is supported for clusters using Kerberos and Isilon storage on the source or destination cluster, or both. See Configuring Replication with Kerberos and Isilon. Replication between clusters using Isilon storage and Kerberos is not supported in CDH 5.7.
Make sure that the hdfs user is a superuser in the Isilon system. If you specify alternate users with the Run As option
when creating replication schedules, those users must also be superusers.
Cloudera recommends that you use the Isilon root user for replication jobs. (Specify root in the Run As field when creating replication schedules.)
Select the Skip checksum checks property when creating replication schedules.
Clusters that use Isilon storage do not support snapshots. Snapshots are used to ensure data consistency during
replications in scenarios where the source files are being modified. Therefore, when replicating from an Isilon cluster, Cloudera recommends that you do not replicate Hive tables or HDFS files that
could be modified before the replication completes.


See Using CDH with Isilon Storage.




Supported Configurations with Virtualization and Cloud Platforms

This section lists supported cloud and virtualization platforms for deploying Cloudera software. The linked reference architectures are not replacements for statements of support above,
but are guides to assist with deployment and sizing options.


Amazon Web Services

For information on deploying Cloudera software on a Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure, see the Cloudera Enterprise Reference Architecture for AWS
Deployments.



Google Cloud Platform

For information on deploying Cloudera software on a Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, see the Cloudera Enterprise Reference Architecture for Google Cloud
Platform Deployments.



Microsoft Azure

For information on deploying Cloudera software on a Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure, see the Cloudera Enterprise Reference Architecture for Azure Deployments.


Support Limitations for CDH and Cloudera Manager in Microsoft Azure



Virtual machines must use Cloudera-published CentOS 6.x/7.x OS Images or Red Hat published 6.x/7.x Images. Red Hat images must include bootstrapped configuration as specified in the
Azure Bootstrap Scripts folder in the Cloudera Director GitHub
repository.
Master Node Services must use Azure Premium Storage Disks for persistent storage.
The VM local temporary disk must not be used for any persistent data for HDFS, Kudu, or other services.
Microsoft Azure Storage - Block Blob (previously known as Windows Azure Storage
Blob, accessed via wasb:// URI’s) is only supported for backups using Hadoop’s DistCP. Other services are not supported running directly against Azure Storage block blobs.






VMware

For information on deploying Cloudera software on a VMware-based infrastructure, see the Reference
architecture for deploying on VMware.
Recommendation when deploying on VMware in the current release:

Use the part of Hadoop Virtual Extensions that has been implemented in HADOOP-8468. This
will prevent data loss when a physical node that hosts two or more DataNodes goes down .




Red Hat OpenStack Platform (OSP) 11

For information on deploying Cloudera software on RedHat OpenStack Platform (OSP) 11, see Reference Architecture for Deploying CDH 5.x on Red Hat OSP 11.
For information on deploying Cloudera software on RedHat OpenStack Platform (OSP) 11 with Ceph storage, see Reference Architecture for Deploying Cloudera Enterprise 5.x on Red Hat OpenStack
