Host names required by AMPs
If you are using a non-transparent proxy in AWS, then you need to allow the following
  host names in order for AMPs to work.

*.storage.googleapis.com
*.raw.githubusercontent.com
*.pypi.org
*.pythonhosted.org
*.github.com

These host names should be specified in the proxy, along with any other endpoints that are needed for your workspace.
