Creating New AMPs
One great use for AMPs is to showcase reference examples specific to your business by
  creating your own AMPs in-house. Once a data science project has been built in Cloudera Machine Learning, you can package it and have the Cloudera Machine Learning Admin add it to the AMP Catalog. 
Each individual AMP requires a project metadata file, which defines the environmental resources
   needed by the AMP, and the setup steps to install the AMP in a Cloudera Machine Learning workspace. See AMP Project Specification for
   details.
noteYou can store your AMPs in a git repo hosted on Github, Github Enterprise, or GitLab servers
   (not limited to github.com or gitlab.com.) Additionally, only simple authentication is supported,
   such as passing an API key, or including the username and password, as part of the URL. If
   additional authentication steps are required, then that git host is not supported.
You can also look at an example for a Cloudera AMP, such as: .project-metadata.yaml.
