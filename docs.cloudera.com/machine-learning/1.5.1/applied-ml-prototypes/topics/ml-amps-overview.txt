Applied ML Prototypes (AMPs)
Applied ML Prototypes (AMPs) provide reference example machine learning projects in Cloudera Machine Learning. More than simplified quickstarts or tutorials, AMPs are
  fully-developed expert solutions created by Cloudera’s research arm, Fast Forward
  Labs.
noteAMPs are not supported for air gap environments.
These solutions to common problems in the machine learning field demonstrate how to fully use
   the power of Cloudera Machine Learning. AMPs show you how to create Cloudera Machine Learning projects to solve your own use cases.
AMPs are available to install and run from the Cloudera Machine Learning
   user interface. As new AMPs are developed, they will become available to you for your study and
   use. 
noteIn an airgapped installation, the default AMPs catalog included at installation and default
   AMPs may be inaccessible. Consider creating an custom AMPs catalog. See Custom AMP Catalog
   for more information.



Using AMPs
It’s simple to get started with AMPs.

Log in to your Cloudera Machine Learning workspace, and in the left panel
     click AMPs. 
Click on an AMP tile to read its description.
Click Configure Project and provide any configuration values required
     by the AMP. The Description field explains how to determine these
     configuration values. After you click Launch Project, the installation
     process may take several minutes.
When the installation is complete, click Overview to read the
     documentation for the AMP and explore the code and project structure.

noteIf nothing appears in the AMPs panel, an administrator may need to
    reconfigure and refresh the catalog. In Site Administration > AMPs, click Refresh. The administrator can also refresh
    periodically to add newly developed AMPs to the panel.
