cdswctl Command Line Interface Client

Cloudera Machine Learning ships with a CLI client that you can download from the Cloudera
      Machine Learning web UI. The cdswctl client allows you to perform the
      following tasks:
Logging in
Creating an SSH endpoint
Listing sessions that are starting or running
Starting or stopping a session
Creating a model
Building and deploying models
Listing model builds and model deployments
Checking the status of a deployment
Redeploying a model with updated resources
Viewing the replica logs for a model
Other actions, such as creating a project, require you to use the Cloudera Machine
      Learning web UI. For information about the available commands, run the following command:
      cdswctl --help

Download and Configure cdswctlThis topic describes how to download the cdswctl     CLI client and configure your SSH public key to authenticate CLI access to     sessions. Initialize an SSH EndpointThis topic describes how to establish an SSH endpoint for Cloudera Machine     Learning.Log into cdswctlThis topic describes how to log into cdswctl. Prepare to manage models using the model CLIBefore you can start using the model CLI to automate model deployment or to perform         any other tasks, you must install the scikit-learn machine learning library for Python         through the Cloudera Machine Learning web UI.Create a model using the CLIThis         topic describes how to create models using the model CLI.Build and deployment commands for modelsModels have separate parameters for builds and deployments. When a model is built, an         image is created. Whereas, the deployment is the actual instance of the model. You can list         model builds and deployment, and monitor their state using from model CLI client         (cdswctl).Deploy a new model with updated resourcesYou can republish a previously-deployed model in a new serving environment with an     updated number of replicas or memory/CPU/GPU allocation by providing the model build ID of the     model you want to rebuild.View replica logs for a modelWhen a model is deployed, Cloudera Machine Learning enables you to specify the number         of replicas that must be deployed to serve requests. If a replica crashes or fails to come         up, you can diagnose it by viewing the logs for every replica using the model         CLI.
