View replica logs for a model
When a model is deployed, Cloudera Machine Learning enables you to specify the number
        of replicas that must be deployed to serve requests. If a replica crashes or fails to come
        up, you can diagnose it by viewing the logs for every replica using the model
        CLI.

Obtain the modelReplicaId by using the following
                    command:

cdswctl models listReplicas --modelDeploymentId=<model_deployment_ID>

where the model_deployment_ID is the ID of a successfully
                    deployed model.

To view the replica logs, run the following command:

cdswctl models getReplicaLogs --modelDeploymentId=<model_deployment_ID> --modelReplicaId="<replica_ID>" --streams=stdout

For example:
                    cdswctl models getReplicaLogs --modelDeploymentId=2 --modelReplicaId="petal-length-predictor-1-2-6d6496b467-hp6tz" --streams=stdout
The valid values for the streams parameter are
                        stdout and stderr.
