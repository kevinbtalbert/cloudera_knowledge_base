Initialize an SSH Endpoint
This topic describes how to establish an SSH endpoint for Cloudera Machine
    Learning.
 Creating an SSH endpoint is also the
      first step to configuring a remote editor for an ML workspace.
Create a configuration file at:
            $HOME/.cdsw/config.yaml. The contents of
            config.yaml should be:
username: <username>
url: <ML_workspace_url>
auth:
  authtype: 1
  basic: null
  apikey: <your_legacy_api_key>
To collect the values for these fields, first log in to your CML
            workspace using SSO:
username: The username with which you are
                logged into the CML workspace. Found in the top right corner of
                your ML workspace. 
url: The complete URL used to access the CML
                workspace. For example:
                  https://ml-<randomly-generated-cluster-name>
apikey: Go to User Settings >  API Keys. Copy the value of the Legacy API Key to this
                field.

Create a local SSH endpoint to Cloudera Machine Learning. Run
          the following
            command:cdswctl ssh-endpoint -p <project_name> [-c <CPU_cores>] [-m <memory_in_GB>] [-g <number_of_GPUs>] [-r <runtime ID> ]
The command uses the following defaults for optional parameters:
CPU cores: 1
Memory: 1 GB
GPUs: 0
For example, the following command starts a session for the user
              milton under the customerchurn project with .5
            cores, .75 GB of memory, 0 GPUs, and the Python3 kernel:
            cdswctl ssh-endpoint -p customerchurn -c 0.5 -m 0.75To
            create an SSH endpoint in a project owned by another user or a team, for example
              finance, prepend the username to the project and separate them with a
            forward
          slash:cdswctl ssh-endpoint -p finance/customerchurn -c 0.5 -m 0.75This
          command creates session in the project customerchurn that belongs to the
          team finance.
Information for the SSH endpoint appears in the output:
            ...
You can SSH to it using

    ssh -p <some_port> cdsw@localhost
...
Open a new command prompt and run the outputted command from
          the previous
          step:ssh -p <some_port> cdsw@localhostFor
          example:ssh -p 9750 cdsw@localhostYou
          will be prompted for the passphrase for the SSH key you entered in the
          ML workspace web UI.Once you are connected to the
          endpoint, you are logged in as the cdsw user and can
          perform actions as though you are accessing the terminal through the
          web UI. Test the connection.If you run ls,
          the project files associated with the session you created are shown.
          If you run whoami, the command returns the
            cdsw user.Leave the SSH endpoint running as long as you want to use a
          local IDE.
