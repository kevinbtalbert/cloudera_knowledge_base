Prepare to manage models using the model CLI
Before you can start using the model CLI to automate model deployment or to perform
        any other tasks, you must install the scikit-learn machine learning library for Python
        through the Cloudera Machine Learning web UI.

You must perform this task through the Cloudera Machine Learning web UI.


Create a new project with Python through the web UI.
Python provides sample files that you can use to create models using
                    CLI.

To start a new session, go to the Sessions page from the
                    left navigation panel and click new session.

                    and click Launch Session.
A new “Untitled Session” is created.

From the input prompt, install the scikit-learn machine learning library for
                    Python by running the following command:

!pip3 install sklearn


Open the fit.py file available within your project from the
                    left navigation panel.
You can use the fit.py file to create a fitted model which
                    creates a model.pkl file that you can use to deploy the actual
                    model. 

Run the fit.py file by clicking Run > Run all.
The model.pkl directory is created that you can see within
                    your project on the left navigation pane.

Close the session by clicking Stop.
