Accessing Environmental Variables from Projects
This topic shows you how to access environmental variables from
    your code. 
Environmental variables are injected into every engine launched for a
        project, contingent on the scope at which the variable was set (global,
        project, etc.). The following code samples show how to access a sample
        environment variable called DATABASE_PASSWORD from
        your project code. 
R
database.password <- Sys.getenv("DATABASE_PASSWORD")
Python
import os
database_password = os.environ["DATABASE_PASSWORD"]
Scala
System.getenv("DATABASE_PASSWORD")
Appending Values to Environment Variables:
You can also set environment variables to append to existing values
        instead of replacing them. For example, when setting the
          LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable, you can set the value to
          LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/set.
