Configuring the Engine Environment
This section describes some of the ways you can configure engine environments to meet
    the requirements of your projects. 
Install Additional Packages
For information on how to install any additional required packages and
        dependencies to your engine, see Installing Additional Packages. 

Environmental Variables
For information on how environmental variables can be used to configure
        engine environments in Cloudera Machine Learning, see Engine Environment Variables. 

Configuring Shared Memory Limit for Docker Images
You can increase the shared memory size for the sessions, experiments, and jobs running
        within an Engine container within your project. For Docker, the default size of the
        available shared memory is 64 MB.
To increase the shared memory limit: 
From the web UI, go to Projects > Project Settings > Engine > Advanced Settings
Specify the shared memory size in the Shared Memory Limit
            field.
Click Save Advanced Settings to save the configuration and
            exit.

This mounts a volume with the tmpfs file system to
          /dev/shm and Kubernetes will enforce the given limit. The maximum
        size of this volume is the half of your physical RAM in the node without the swap.
