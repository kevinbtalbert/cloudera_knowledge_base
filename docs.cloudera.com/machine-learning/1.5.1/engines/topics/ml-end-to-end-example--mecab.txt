End-to-End Example: MeCab
This topic walks you through a simple end-to-end example on how to
    build and use custom engines.This section demonstrates how to customize the Cloudera Machine Learning base engine image to include the MeCab (a Japanese text tokenizer) library.
    This is a sample Dockerfile that adds MeCab to the Cloudera Machine Learning base image. # Dockerfile

FROM docker.repository.cloudera.com/cloudera/cdsw/engine:13-cml-2021.02-1
RUN rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y -q mecab \
                          libmecab-dev \
                          mecab-ipadic-utf8 && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN cd /tmp && \
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/neologd/mecab-ipadic-neologd.git && \
    /tmp/mecab-ipadic-neologd/bin/install-mecab-ipadic-neologd -y -n -p /var/lib/mecab/dic/neologd && \
    rm -rf /tmp/mecab-ipadic-neologd
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install mecab-python==0.996To use this image on your Cloudera Machine Learning project,
        perform the following steps.
 Build a new image with the
            Dockerfile.docker build --network=host -t <company-registry>/user/cdsw-mecab:latest . -f Dockerfile

Push the image to your company's Docker
            registry.docker push <your-company-registry>/user/cdsw-mecab:latest

Whitelist the image,
              <your-company-registry>/user/cdsw-mecab:latest.
            Only a site administrator can do this. Go to
                  Admin > Engines
              and add
                <company-registry>/user/cdsw-mecab:latest to
              the list of whitelisted engine images. 



Ask a project administrator to set the new image as the default
              for your project. Go to the project Settings, click
                Engines, and select
                company-registry/user/cdsw-mecab:latest from
              the dropdown.
You should now be able to run this project on the
            customized MeCab engine.
