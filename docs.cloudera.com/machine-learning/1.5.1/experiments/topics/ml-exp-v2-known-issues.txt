Known issues and limitations
CML has the following known issues and limitations with experiments and
  MLflow.

CML currently supports only Python for experiment tracking.
Experiment runs cannot be created from MLFlow on sessions using Legacy Engine. Instead,
    create a session using an ML Runtime.
The version column in the runs table is empty for every run. In a future release, this will
    show a git commit sha for projects using git.
There is currently no mechanism for registering a model to a Model Registry. In a future
    release, you will be able to register models to a Model Registry and then deploy Model
    REST APIs with those models.
Browsing an empty experiment will display a spinner that doesn’t go away.
Running an experiment from the workbench (from the dropdown menu) refers to legacy
    experiments and should not be used going forward.
Tag/Metrics/Parameter columns that were previously hidden on the runs table will be
    remembered, but CML won’t remember hiding any of the other columns (date, version,
    user, etc.)
Admins can not browse all experiments. They can only see their experiments on the
    global Experiment page.
Performance issues may arise when browsing the run details of a run with a lot of metric
    results, or when comparing a lot of runs.
Runs can not be deleted or archived.
