Enabling model governance
You must enable governance to capture and view information about your ML projects,
        models, and builds centrally from Apache Atlas (Data Catalog) for a given environment. If
        you do not select this option while provisioning workspaces, then integration with Atlas
        won't work.


Go to Cloudera Machine Learning and click Provision
                        Workspace on the top-right corner.

Enter the workspace name and other details.

Click Advanced Options.

Select Enable Governance.
