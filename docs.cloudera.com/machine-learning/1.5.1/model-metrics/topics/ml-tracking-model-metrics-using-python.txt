Tracking metrics for deployed models
When you have finished developing your metrics tracking code and the code that
        consumes the metrics, simply deploy the predict function from
            predict_with_metrics.py as a model. No code changes are
        necessary.
Calls to read_metrics, track_delayed_metrics,
                and track_aggregate_metrics need to be changed to take the CRN of
            the deployed model, build or deployment. These CRNs can be found in the model’s
                Overview page.
Calls to the call_model function also requires the model’s access key
                (model_access_key in use_model_metrics.py) from the model’s
                Settings page. If authentication has been enabled for the model
            (the default), a model API key for the user (model_api_token in
                use_model_metrics.py) is also required. This can be obtained from
            the user's Settings page.
