Creating a new version of a Model Registry
 You can easily create a new version of a registered model.

      Projects page.

Select the project that contains the model for which you want to create a new
     version.

Click Experiments in the left navigation pane and select the
     experiment that contains the model you want to register.
The system displays the Experiment Detail page.

Select the run that contains the model you want to register.

Scroll down the page to find the Artifacts section and click
      model.

Click Register Model.

From the Name field, choose the model for which you want to create a
     new version.

Click OK.

 You can also create a new model version using MLflow SDK.
   Simply run the Python code to register a model again with the same model_name. This will create
   an additional version for the model_name.
