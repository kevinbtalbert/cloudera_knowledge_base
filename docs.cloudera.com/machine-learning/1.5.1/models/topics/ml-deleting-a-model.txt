Deleting a Model


important

You must stop all active deployments before you delete a model. If
            not stopped, active models will continue serving requests and
            consuming resources even though they do not show up in Cloudera Machine Learning UI.
Deleted models are not actually removed from disk. That is, this
            operation will not free up storage space. 



Go to the model Overview >  Settings. Click Delete Model.
Deleting a model removes all of the model's builds and its
            deployment history from Cloudera Machine Learning.

You can also delete specific builds from a model's history by going
            to the model's Overview > Build page.
