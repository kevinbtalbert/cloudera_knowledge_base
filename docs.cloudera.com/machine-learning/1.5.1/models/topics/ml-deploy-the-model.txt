Deploy the Model
This topic shows you how to deploy the model using the predict.py
        script from the Python template project. 

The predict.py script contains the predict function
                that accepts petal length as input and uses the model built in the previous step to
                predict petal width.


Navigate to the Iris project's Overview > Models page.

Click New
                        Model and fill out the fields. Make sure you use the Python 3
                    kernel. For example: 




Deploy the model.

Click on the model to go to its Overview page. As the model builds you can track progress on
                    the Build page. Once deployed, you can see the replicas deployed on
                    the Monitoring page. 

To test the model, use the Test
                        Model widget on the model's Overview page.
