Deploying a model from the destination Project page
 You can deploy a model one or more times to create different versions of the model. You
  can also deploy a model you created in one workspace to a different workspace. 

Navigate to the Project you want to deploy to. 

Click Model Deployment in the left navigation pane.

Make sure you have clicked the Deploy registered model checkbox at
     the top of the window.

Select the registered model you want to deploy from the Deploy Registered
      Model field.

If you enable authentication, you will need to enter an API key to access and use the model
     in the case you have deployed the model to a shared project.

Select Deploy Model at the bottom of the window.
