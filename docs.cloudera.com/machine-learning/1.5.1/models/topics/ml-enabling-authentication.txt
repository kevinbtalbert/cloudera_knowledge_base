Enabling authentication
Restricting access using API keys is an optional feature. By default, the “Enable
  Authentication” option is turned on. However, it is turned off by default for the existing models
  for backward compatibility. You can enable authentication for all your existing
  models.
To enable authentication, go to Projects > Models > Settings and check the Enable Authentication option.
noteIt can take up to five minutes for the system to update.
