Experiments
This topic introduces you to experiments, and the challenge this feature aims to
    solve.
Cloudera Machine Learning allows data scientists
      to run batch experiments that track different versions of code, input
      parameters, and output (both metrics and files). 

Challenge
As data scientists iteratively develop models, they
        often experiment with datasets, features, libraries, algorithms, and
        parameters. Even small changes can significantly impact the resulting
        model. This means data scientists need the ability to iterate and repeat
        similar experiments in parallel and on demand, as they rely on
        differences in output and scores to tune parameters until they obtain
        the best fit for the problem at hand. Such a training workflow requires
        versioning of the file system, input parameters, and output of each
        training run.
Without versioned experiments you would need intense process rigor to
        consistently track training artifacts (data, parameters, code, etc.), and even then it might
        be impossible to reproduce and explain a given result. This can lead to wasted time and
        effort during collaboration, not to mention the compliance risks introduced. 

Solution
Cloudera Machine Learning uses experiments to facilitate ad-hoc batch
        execution and model training. Experiments are batch executed workloads
        where the code, input parameters, and output artifacts are versioned.
        This feature also provides a lightweight ability to track output data,
        including files, metrics, and metadata for comparison.
