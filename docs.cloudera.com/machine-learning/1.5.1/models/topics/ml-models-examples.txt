Example - Model Training and Deployment (Iris)
This topic uses Cloudera Machine Learning's built-in Python
    template project to walk you through an end-to-end example where we use
    experiments to develop and train a model, and then deploy it using Cloudera
    Machine Learning.This example uses the canonical 
Iris
 dataset from Fisher and Anderson to build a model that
      predicts the width of a flowerâ€™s petal based on the petal's length.
The scripts for this example are available in the
        Python template project that ships with Cloudera Machine Learning.
        First, create a new project from the Python template:

Once you've created the project, go to the project's
          Files page.
        The following files are used for the demo:


cdsw-build.sh - A custom build script
              used for models and experiments. Pip installs our dependencies, primarily the scikit-learn library.



fit.py - A model
              training example to be run as an experiment. Generates the model.pkl file that
              contains the fitted parameters of our model.



predict.py - A
              sample function to be deployed as a model. Uses model.pkl produced by
                fit.py to make
              predictions about petal width.
