Registering a model using MLflow SDK
 You can register a model using the user interface or the MLFlow SDK.
Using MLflow SDK to register a model
Registering a model enables you to track your model and upload and share the model.
    Registering a model stores the model archives in the model registry with a version tag. The
    first time you register a model, Model Registry automatically creates a model repository with
    the first version of the model. 


To register a model using MLFlow SDK, specify the registered_model_name
     and assign a value: 

mlflow.<model_flavor>.log_model()

For example:

mlflow.sklearn.log_model(lr, "model", registered_model_name="ElasticnetWineModel")


 If you run the Python code again with the same model_name it will create
     an additional version for the model_name.
