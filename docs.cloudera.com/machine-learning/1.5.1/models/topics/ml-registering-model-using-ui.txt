 You can register a model using the Model Registry user interface or the MLFlow
  SDK.
Using the Model Registry user interface to register a model
Registering a model enables you to track your model and upload and share the model.
        Registering a model stores the model archives in the model registry with a version tag. The
        first time you register a model, Model Registry automatically creates a model repository
        with the first version of the model. 

You must have permission to access a project in which the model
      is created before you can register the model.

Click Projects in the left navigation pane to display the
      Projects page. 

Select the project that contains the model that you want to register.
CML displays all of the models under the specific project along with their source,
          deployment status, replicas, memory and a drop-down function for actions that can be made
          pertaining to that model for deployment. 

Click the Experiments tab in the left navigation pane and select the
     experiment that contains the model you want to register. 

Select the model you want to register.
CML displays the Experiment Run Details page.





Select the run that contains the  model you want to register. 

Select Register Model to begin the registration process.
Model Registry displays the Registry Modeldialog box.

Enter the name of your registered model.
You can also enter optional information for the description, version notes, and version
     tags. 

Click OK to complete the registration.
