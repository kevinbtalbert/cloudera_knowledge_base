Testing Calls to a Model


Cloudera Machine Learning provides two ways to test calls to a model:

Test Model Widget

On each model's Overview page, Cloudera Machine Learning provides a widget
              that makes a sample call to the deployed model to ensure it is receiving input and
              returning results as expected. 



Sample Request Strings

On the model Overview page, Cloudera Machine Learning also provides
              sample curl and POST request strings that you can use to test calls to the model.
              Copy/paste the curl request directly into a Terminal to test the
              call.
Note that these sample requests already include the example input values you entered
              while building the model, and the access key required to query the model.
