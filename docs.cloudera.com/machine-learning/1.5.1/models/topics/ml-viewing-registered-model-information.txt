Viewing Details for Model Registry
 You can view the information for your registered models using Model
        Registry.

Select Model Registry from the left
                                        navigation pane.
On the main Model Registry page, you
                                        can see all the models currently registered, their
                                        respective owners, location of creation, and the last
                                        updated time, if known. 

You can use the filter bar at the top of the window to filter
                                        the list of model registries by name, status, and
                                        environment name.
