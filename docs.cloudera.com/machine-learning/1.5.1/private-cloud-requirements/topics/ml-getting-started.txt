Get started with CML on Private Cloud
To get started as a user with Cloudera Machine Learning on your Private Cloud, follow
        the steps described below. They will show you how to set up a Project and work on some
        data.

Make sure the Admin creates a new Workspace for you. If you are an Admin, see: Provision an ML Workspace.  noteMake
                    sure that an Admin user logs into the Workspace first.


Log in to your workspace. On the Workspaces tab, click
                        Launch Workspace.

Next, create a Project. See: Creating a Project. 

Once you have a Project, run a Session to start your work. See: Launch a Session.
                

Test your access to the base cluster (Data Lake). See: CDP-DC cluster connectivity
                    test.

You can then run a Model. Learn about Models here: Creating and Deploying a Model.
                

When you are finished with your workspace, your Admin can remove it, as
                    described here: Removing ML Workspaces.
