GPU node setup
In Kubernetes, you can taint nodes to affect how the node is scheduled. You can ensure
  that nodes that have a GPU are reserved exclusively for CML workloads that require a
  GPU.
To reserve a GPU node, assign a taint to the node.
Openshift
On Openshift, specify the node taint nvidia.com/gpu: true:NoSchedule for any
    nodes that host GPUs and are required to be used only for GPU workloads.

ECS
On ECS, set the node taint nvidia.com/gpu: true:NoSchedule in one of the
    following three ways: 
During ECS installation: After adding the GPU host(s) to Cloudera Manager but prior to
      creation of the ECS cluster, visit the Host Configuration page, select
      the Dedicated GPU Node for Data Services checkbox and
       Save the configuration. Repeat for all hosts on which the taint is
      desired. Then, proceed with installation via the Add Cluster
      wizard.
During ECS upgrade: After upgrading Cloudera Manager (if applicable), set the host
      configuration as described above on one or more hosts in the ECS cluster. Then, proceed with
      upgrade via the Upgrade Cluster wizard. 
Independently of ECS install or upgrade: Set the host configuration as described above on
      one or more hosts in the ECS cluster. Redeploy the client configuration on the ECS cluster.
      Finally, run the Reapply All Settings to Cluster command on the ECS
      service, which can be found in the Service Actions menu.
