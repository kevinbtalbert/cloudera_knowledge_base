Differences Between Public and Private Cloud
There are some differences in Cloudera Machine Learning functionality between Public and
  Private Cloud. 


Feature
Public Cloud
Private Cloud 1.5.x 



CML application control plane (infrastructure containers and workload
       containers)
Control plane is hosted on public cloud servers.
Control plane is hosted on customerâ€™s cluster.


Storage - CML internal state data (database, images, logs)
EBS on AWS, Azure Disks on Azure.
Software Defined Storage System, such as Ceph or Portworx.


Storage - User project files
EFS on AWS, external NFS on Azure.
Internal NFS storage is recommended.


Autoscaling
CPU/GPU nodes scale up and down as needed.
Autoscaling concept is different; Private Cloud shares a pooled set of resources among
       workloads.


Logging
Per-workspace diagnostic bundles can be downloaded from the workspace.
Diagnostic bundles are not supported at Workspace level, but can be downloaded from the
       control plane at the cluster level.


Monitoring dashboards
Provides four dashboards. 
Provides two dashboards, for K8s Container and K8s
        Cluster.


NFS support
AWS uses EFS; Azure requires external NFS.
Internal NFS is recommended, external NFS is supported.


TLS support
TLS access to workspaces is supported.
TLS access is supported, but requires manual setup of certificate and other
       steps.


Hadoop Authentication
Uses FreeIPA
User needs to provide credentials to communicate with the CDP Private Base
       cluster.


Remote Access
Available from each workspace.
Not available in the workspace. Instead, the environment's kubeconfig
       file may be downloaded from Environments using the Download
        Kubernetes configuration action for the specified environment.


Roles
MLAdmin, MLUser
The corresponding roles are: EnvironmentAdmin,
        EnvironmentUser
