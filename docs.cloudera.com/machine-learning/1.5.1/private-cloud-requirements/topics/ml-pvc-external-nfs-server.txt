Using an External NFS Server
You can install an NFS server that is external to the cluster.

Currently, NFS version 4.1 is the recommended protocol to use for CML. The NFS client
                within CML must be able to mount the NFS storage with default options, and also
                assumes these export options:
                rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_all_squash,no_subtree_check



Before creating a CML workspace, the storage administrator must create a directory
                that will be exported to the cluster for storing ML project files for that
                workspace. Either a dedicated NFS export path, or a subdirectory in an existing
                export must be specified for each workspace. 
Each CML workspace needs a unique directory that does not have files in it from a
                different or previous workspace. For example, if 10 CML workspaces are expected, the
                storage administrator will need to create 10 unique directories. Either one NFS
                export and 10 subdirectories within it need to be created, or 10 unique exports need
                to be created.
For example, to use a dedicated NFS share for a workspace named “workspace1” from 
                NFS server “nfs_server”, do the following:
            


Create NFS export directory “/workspace1”. 

Change ownership for the exported directory


CML accesses this directory as a user with a UID and GID of 8536. 
                            Therefore, run chown 8536:8536 /workspace1


Make the export directory group-writeable and set the GID:  chmod g+srwx
                            /workspace1



Provide the NFS export path nfs_server:/workspace1 when prompted by 
                    the CML Control Plane App while creating the workspace.

To use a subdirectory in an existing NFS share, say nfs_server:/export, 
                    do the following:


Create a subdirectory /export/workspace1


Change ownership: chown 8536:8536 /export/workspace1


Set GID and make directory group writeable: chmod g+srwx
                            /export/workspace1


Provide the export path nfs_server:/export/workspace1 when prompted by
                            the CML Control Plane App.

NFS share sizing
CML workloads are sensitive to latency and IO/s instead of throughput.
The minimum recommended file share size is 100 GB. The file share must support online volume
   capacity expansion. It must provide at least the following performance characteristics:

IO / s
3100

Throughput rate
110.0 MiBytes/s
