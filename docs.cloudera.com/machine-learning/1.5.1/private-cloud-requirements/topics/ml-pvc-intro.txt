Introduction to Private Cloud

With the Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) service, data scientists and partners can build and
   run machine learning experiments and workloads in a secure environment. CML on Private Cloud
   provides an identical experience to CML on Public Cloud, but running in your own on-premises data
   center.
Cloudera Machine Learning enables you to:
  
Easily onboard a new tenant and provision an ML workspace in a shared OpenShift or ECS
     environment.
Enable data scientists to access shared data on CDP Private Cloud Base and CDW.
Leverage Spark-on-K8s to spin up and down Spark clusters on demand.
