Limitations on Private Cloud
There are some limitations to keep in mind when you are working with Cloudera Machine
  Learning on Private Cloud. 
The following features are not yet supported in CML Private Cloud:
Logging is limited, and diagnostic bundles for each workspace cannot be downloaded from the
     workspace UI. Instead, diagnostic bundles for the entire cluster can be downloaded from the
     control plane. 
Monitoring on Private Cloud does not support node-level resource metrics, hence only
            K8s Cluster and K8s Container dashboards
          are available.
CML does not support the NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) feature.
