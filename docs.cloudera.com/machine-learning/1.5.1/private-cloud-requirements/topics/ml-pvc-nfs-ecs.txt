Internal Network File System on ECS
On ECS, NFS is part of the overall installation, and no additional setup steps are
  required. 
The internal NFS does not have a backup feature. 
Storage provisioner change
On ECS, Longhorn is used as the underlying storage provisioner for any new internal workspace
    on CDP 1.5.0. A storage class named longhorn with csi driver set to
    driver.longhorn.io must exist in the cluster for new internal workspaces to
    get provisioned. Each workspace will have separate 1 TB internal storage.
Internal workspaces running on CDP 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 use the NFS server provisioner as the
    storage provisioner. These workspaces when upgraded to 1.5.0 will continue to run with NFS
    Provisioner. However, NFS server provisioner is deprecated now and will not be supported in the
    1.5.1 release. So, customers are expected to migrate their 1.5.0 upgraded workspace from NFS
    server provisioner to Longhorn if they want to continue using the same workspace in 1.5.1 as
    well. If not, then customers should create a new 1.5.0 workspace and migrate their existing
    workloads to that before the 1.5.1 release.



noteThere is no change in the underlying storage of external NFS backed workspaces and these
       can be simply upgraded to 1.5.0.
