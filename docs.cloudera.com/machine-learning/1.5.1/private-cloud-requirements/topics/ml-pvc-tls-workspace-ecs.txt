Deploy an ML Workspace with Support for TLS on ECS
On ECS, you can provision an ML workspace with TLS enabled, so that the workspace is
        accessible via https.
You need to obtain a certificate from the Certificate Authority used by your
            organization. This may be an internal certificate authority. Additionally, you need a
            computer with CLI access to the cluster, and with kubectl
            installed.

Provision an ML workspace. See Provision an ML Workspace for more
                    information.
noteEnsure you select Enable TLS.

Obtain the .crt and .key files for the
                    certificate from your Certificate Authority.
The certificate URL is generally of the form:
                        <workspaceid>.<cluster>.<domain>.com.
                    Assuming an example URL for the certificate of
                        ml-30b43418-53c.cluster.yourcompany.com, check that the
                    certificate correctly shows the corresponding Common Name (CN) and Subject
                    Alternative Names (SAN): 
CN: ml-30b43418-53c.cluster.yourcompany.com
SAN: *.ml-30b43418-53c.cluster.yourcompany.com
SAN: ml-30b43418-53c.cluster.yourcompany.com


Create or replace a Kubernetes secret inside the previously provisioned ML
                    workspace namespace, then automatically upload the certificate.
Login to the Ecs Server
                    role host and execute the following commands to accomplish these steps:


cd /opt/cloudera/parcels/ECS/bin/


./cml_utils.sh -h
Optional: A helper prompt appears, with explanation for the next
                            command.


./cml_utils.sh upload-cert -n <namespace> -c
                                <path_to_cert> -k <path_to_key>
For example: ./cml_utils.sh upload-cert -n bb-tls-1 -c
                                /tmp/ws-cert.crt -k /tmp/ws-key.key
noteTo find the <namespace> of the workspace, go
                                to the Machine Learning Workspaces UI, and in
                                the Actions menu for the workspace, select
                                    View Workspace Details.
                                    Namespace is shown on the
                                    Details tab.



In Site Administration > Security > Root CA configuration, add the root CA certificate to the workspace.
For example:
                        https://ml-def88113-acd.apps.nf-01.os4cluster.yourcompany.com/administration/security
