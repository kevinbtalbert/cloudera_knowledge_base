Deploy an ML Workspace with Support for TLS
You can provision an ML workspace with TLS enabled, so that it can be accessed via
        https. 

You need to obtain a certificate from the Certificate Authority used by your
                organization. This may be an internal certificate authority. 
Additionally, you need a computer with CLI access to the cluster, and with
                    kubectl installed.


Provision the ML Workspace. Follow the procedure Provisioning ML
                    Workspaces.
noteEnsure you select Enable TLS.

Obtain the .crt and .key files for the
                    certificate from your Certificate Authority.
The certificate URL is generally of the form:
                        <workspaceid>.<cluster>.<domain>.com.
                    Assuming an example URL for the certificate of
                        ml-30b43418-53c.cluster.yourcompany.com, check that the
                    certificate correctly shows the corresponding Common Name (CN) and Subject
                    Alternative Names (SAN): 
CN: ml-30b43418-53c.cluster.yourcompany.com
SAN: *.ml-30b43418-53c.cluster.yourcompany.com
SAN: ml-30b43418-53c.cluster.yourcompany.com


Create a Kubernetes secret inside the previously provisioned ML workspace
                    namespace, and name the secret cml-tls-secret.
On a machine with access to the .srt and .key files above, and access to the OpenShift cluster,
                        run this command: kubectl create secret tls cml-tls-secret
                            --cert=<pathtocrt.crt> --key=<pathtokey.key> -o yaml
                            --dry-run | kubectl -n <cml-workspace-namespace> create -f
                            -
You can replace or update certificates in the secret at any time.

In Admin > Security > Root CA configuration, add the root CA certificate to the workspace.
For example:
                        https://ml-def88113-acd.cluster.yourcompany.com/administration/security"
                    

The command creates routes to reflect the new state of ingress and secret, and
            enables TLS.
