Creating a project from a password-protected Git repo
You can create projects in CML by replicating the project files from a Git repo. The Git
  repo can be public, or it can be private, accessed by SSH or HTTPS authentication. 
When you create a project, you can choose to create it from a Git repository. In the
    New Project page, under Initial Setup, choose the
    Git tab. Paste the Git URL in Git URL of Project. 
There are two ways to authenticate a password-protected repo: SSH and HTTPS. The SSH key is
   automatically generated by CML for each user or team account. 
To clone a repo with SSH:

Make sure you have a public SSH key added to your Github account. For more information, see
     Adding an SSH Key to GitHub.
In the Git interface, select Code > SSH and copy the URL.
Paste the URL into Git URL of Project. It should appear similar to
     git@github.com:someuser/somerepo.git.

To clone a repo with HTTPS:

In the Git interface, select Code > SSH and copy the URL.
Paste the URL into Git URL of Project.
Insert the repo username and password into the URL, like
    so: https://<username>:<password>@github.com/someuser/somerepo.git

Continue with creating the project, and the files will be imported from the Git repository.
