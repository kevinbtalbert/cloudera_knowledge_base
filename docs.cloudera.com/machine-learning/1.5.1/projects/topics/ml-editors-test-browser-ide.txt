Test a Browser IDE in a Session Before Installation
This process can be used to ensure that a browser IDE works as
    expected before you install it to a project or to a customized engine image.
    This process is not meant for browser IDEs that require root permission to
    install, such as RStudio.
These steps are only required if you want
      to use an editor that does not come preinstalled as part of the default
      engine image. Perform the following steps to configure an editor for your
      session:
Ensure that your browser accepts pop-up windows and cookies
          from Cloudera Machine Learning web UI.Open the Cloudera Machine Learning web UI.Go to your project and launch a session with the kernel of your
          choice and the Workbench editor. Alternatively,
          open an existing session.In the interactive command prompt or terminal for the session,
          install the editor you want to use. See the documentation for your
          editor for specific instructions.For example:

Jupyter Lab


Python 3
The following example command installs Jupyter Lab for
                      Python
                      3:!pip3 install jupyterlab



After the installation completes, enter the command to start
          the server for the notebook on the port specified in the
            CDSW_APP_PORT environment variable on IP
          address 127.0.0.1.For example, the
          following command starts the server for Jupyter Lab on the port
          specified in the CDSW_APP_PORT environment
          variable:!/home/cdsw/.local/bin/jupyter-lab --no-browser --ip=127.0.0.1 --port=${CDSW_APP_PORT} --NotebookApp.token= --NotebookApp.allow_remote_access=True --log-level=ERROR
Click on the grid icon in the top right. You
          should see the editor in the drop-down menu. If you select the editor,
          it opens in a new browser tab.
