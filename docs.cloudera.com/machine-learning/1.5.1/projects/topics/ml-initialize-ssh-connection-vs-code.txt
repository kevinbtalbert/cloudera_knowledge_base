Initialize an SSH Connection to Cloudera Machine Learning for VS
    Code
The following task describes how to establish an SSH endpoint for Cloudera Machine Learning. Creating an SSH endpoint is the first step to
    configuring a remote editor for Cloudera Machine Learning.

Log in to Cloudera Machine Learning with the CLI client.
cdswctl login -n <username> -u http(s)://cdsw.your_domain.comFor
          example, the following command logs the user sample_user into the
              https://cdsw.your_domain.com
          deployment:cdswctl login -n sample_user -u https://cdsw.your_domain.com

Create a local SSH endpoint to Cloudera Machine Learning. 
Run the following command:
cdswctl ssh-endpoint -p <username>/<project_name> [-c <CPU_cores>] [-m <memory_in_GB>] [-g <number_of_GPUs>] [-r <runtime ID> ]If
            the project is configured to use ML runtimes, the -r parameter must be
            specified, otherwise it must be omitted. To retrieve the Runtime ID, use the following
            command:cdswctl runtimes listSee Using ML runtimes with
              cdswctl documentation page for more information.The command uses the
            following defaults for optional parameters:
CPU cores: 1
Memory: 1 GB
GPUs: 0
For example, the following command starts a session for the logged-in user
              sample_user under the customerchurn project with .5
            cores, .75 GB of memory, 0 GPUs, and the Python3 kernel:
            cdswctl ssh-endpoint -p customerchurn -c 0.5 -m 0.75To
            create an SSH endpoint in a project owned by another user or a team, for example
              finance, prepend the username to the project and separate them with a
            forward
          slash:cdswctl ssh-endpoint -p finance/customerchurn -c 0.5 -m 0.75This
          command creates session in the project customerchurn that belongs to the
          team finance.

Information for the SSH endpoint appears in the output:
            ...
You can SSH to it using

    ssh -p <some_port> cdsw@localhost
...


Open a new command prompt and run the outputted command from the previous step:
ssh -p <some_port> cdsw@localhostFor
          example:ssh -p 7847 cdsw@localhostYou will
          be prompted for the passphrase for the SSH key you entered in the Cloudera Machine Learning web UI.
The public key could be rejected when the new ssh key pair is
          generated with a special name such as id_rsa_systest. If the public key
          is rejected, you must add the following information to the ~/.ssh/config
           file:
Host * 
          AddKeysToAgent yes 
          StrictHostKeyChecking no 
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_cdswctl

Once you are connected to the endpoint, you are logged in as the cdsw
          user and can perform actions as though you are accessing the terminal through the Cloudera Machine Learning web UI. 

Test the connection.
If you run ls, the project files associated with the session you
          created are shown. If you run whoami, the command returns the
            cdsw user.
Once you are connected, you should see something like
          this:$ cdswctl ssh-endpoint -p ml-at-scale -m 4 -c 2
Forwarding local port 7847 to port 2222 on session bhsb7k4eqmonap62 in project finance/customerchurn.
You can SSH to the session using

    ssh -p 7847 cdsw@localhost

Add an entry into your SSH config file.
For example:

$ cat ~/.ssh/config
Host cdsw-public
    HostName localhost
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    User cdsw
    Port 7847

HostName is always localhost and User is always
          cdsw. You get the Port number from Step 2.
