Launch a Session
Sessions allow you to perform actions such as run R or Python code. They also provide
        access to an interactive command prompt and terminal. This topic demonstrates how to launch
        a new session.Navigate to your project's Overview page. 
 Click New Session. 

 Check the settings for your session:

You see the following settings:


Editor
Selects the Editor; currently only Workbench is supported and
                                therefore the selector is static.
Kernel
Selects the Kernel. Initially only Python Runtimes are
                                supported.
Engine Image
Displays the Advanced tab in
                                    Project Settings and allows you to set
                                environment variables and the shared memory limit. 




You can modify the engine image used
                        by this session:


By Engine Image, click
                                Configure.
Cloudera Machine Learning displays the Project
                                Settings page.


Select the Runtime/Engine tab.


Next to Default Engine, select ML
                                Runtime or Legacy Engine.


Click Save Engine. 



Specify your Resource Profile.
This attribute will define how many vCPUs and how much memory will be reserved
                    to run the workload (for example, session including the runtime itself). The
                    minimum configuration is 1vCPU and 2 GB memory. 

 Click Start Session.
The command prompt at the bottom right of your browser window will turn
                    green when the engine is ready. Sessions typically take between 10 and 20
                    seconds to start.
