Modifying Project Settings 
Project contributors and administrators can modify aspects of the project environment
    such as the engine used to launch sessions,
    the environment variables, and to create SSH tunnels to access external resources. 

Switch context to the account where the project was created. 

Click Projects.

From the list of projects, select the one to modify.

Click Project Settings to open the Project Settings dashboard.


General
Modify the project name, description, visibility (privacy settings), and owner on
                this page. For Project Owner, only individual users (not Teams) can be assigned, and
                only a Administrator can change the owner. noteAfter the
                  owner is changed, the previous owner will not be able to see the project, unless
                  they are added as a Collaborator.
Engine
Cloudera Machine Learning ensures that your code is always run with the specific
                engine version you selected. You can also select the engine version and add
                third-party editors here.

Environment Variables - If there are any environmental variables that
                    should be injected into all the engines running this project, you can add them
                    to this page. For more details, see Engine Environment Variables. 
Ephemeral Storage Settings - Ephemeral storage space is scratch space a
                    CML session, job, application or model can use. For more information, see
                      Ephemeral storage. 
Shared Memory Limit - You can specify additional shared memory
                    available to sessions running with the project. noteYou can specify additional
                      shared memory available to sessions running with the project. The maximum size
                      of this volume is the half of your physical RAM in the node, not including
                      memory used for swap.

SSH Tunnels
In some environments, external databases and data sources reside behind
                restrictive firewalls. Cloudera Machine Learning provides a convenient way to
                connect to such resources using your SSH key. For instructions, see SSH
                  Keys.
Data Connections
Data Connections connect projects to data sources. For more information, see
                  Data connection management.
Delete Project
This page can only be accessed by project administrators. Remember that deleting a
                project is irreversible. All files, data, sessions, and jobs are removed.
