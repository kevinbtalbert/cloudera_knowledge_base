Limiting files in Explorer view
You can limit the number of files shown in the Explorer view.
If you end up with many of .[something] directories, in
        /home/cdsw, it can be difficult to navigate. 

If you add the **/.* pattern to the Files: Exclude setting, it will
          hide all those files and directories.
