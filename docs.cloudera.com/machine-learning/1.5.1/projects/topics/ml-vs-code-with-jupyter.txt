(Optional) Using VS Code with Jupyter
You can use VS Code with Jupyter Notebooks.
You can work on Jupyter Notebooks within VS Code. This gives
      you all the great code completion, syntax highlighting and documentation hints that are part
      of the VS Code experience and the interactivity of a Jupyter Notebook. Any changes you make to
      the Notebook will be reflected on the CDSW / CML server and can be viewed online using Jupyter
      Notebook as a browser based editor.

Because of the way CML uses
          the internal networking and port forwarding of Kubernetes, when VS Code launches a Jupyter
          Server it binds to the wrong address and access is blocked. You therefore have to launch
          your own Jupyter Server and tell VS code to connect to that. 


The first setting you need to set is the Python > Data Science: Jupyter Server URI
              setting. Set this to http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=[some-token].



Then you need to open a terminal to launch a Jupiter Notebook server. 
You can launch it using: /usr/local/bin/jupyter-notebook —no-browser
                —ip=127.0.0.1 —NotebookApp.token=[some-token] —NotebookApp.allow_remote_access=True
              .
This creates a Jupyter server that any new Notebooks you launch will run in. 




After you install the Jupyter Notebooks, you can use it inside VS Code.



Another feature that you can use with VS Code is running a temporary Notebook for
          executing random code snippets. Select code you want to run, right click and click
            Run Current File in Python Interactive Window.
This is less robust though and will create many Untitled*.ipynb
          files in your home directory.
