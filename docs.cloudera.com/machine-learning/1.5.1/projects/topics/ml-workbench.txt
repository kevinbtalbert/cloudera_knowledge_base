Native Workbench Console and Editor
The workbench console provides an interactive environment tailored for data science,
      supporting R, Python and Scala. It currently supports R, Python, and Scala engines. You can
      use these engines in isolation, as you would on your laptop, or connect to your CDH
      cluster.
The workbench UI includes four primary components:

An editor where you can edit your scripts.
A console where you can track the results of your analysis.
A command prompt where you can enter commands interactively.
A terminal where you can use a Bash shell.
