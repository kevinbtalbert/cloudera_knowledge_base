Access Keys for Models
Each model in Cloudera Machine Learning has a unique access key associated with it.
    This access key is a unique identifier for the model.
Models deployed using Cloudera Machine Learning are not public. In order to call an active
      model your request must include the model's access key for authentication (as demonstrated in
      the sample calls above). 
To locate the access key for a model, go to the model Overview page
      and click Settings. 


important
Only one access key per model is active at any time. If you regenerate the access key,
          you will need to re-distribute this access key to users/applications using the model. 
Alternatively, you can use this mechanism to revoke access to a model by regenerating the
          access key. Anyone with an older version of the key will not be able to make calls to the
          model.
