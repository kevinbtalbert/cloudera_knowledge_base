What's New
CDP Private Cloud 1.5.1 includes the following features for Cloudera Machine
    Learning.
New features

CDSW to CML Migration GA
CML installations on CDSW can now be migrated to CML workspaces.
Backup/Restore on PVC TP
Backup and Restore of workspaces is now available on
            Private Cloud, for both OCP and ECS clusters. This feature allows taking backups of
            workspaces and rolling back to earlier versions of a workspace.
Model Registry
The Model Registry stores and manages machine learning models
            and associated metadata, such as the model's version, dependencies, and performance. The
            registry enables MLOps and facilitates the development, deployment, and maintenance of
            machine learning models in a production environment.
Disable Engines
Starting with version 1.5.1, Legacy Engines are disabled by
            default on the workspace level. On upgraded workspaces, selecting this option disables
            Legacy Engines and changes all existing project types to ML Runtime.
Migration Preflight checklist
Added the capability to validate the pre-reqs
            checklist before migration to ensure prerequisites are met before proceeding with
            migration.
Iceberg v2 Support
Iceberg v2 is now supported in a new Runtime Addon. See
            the CDE Spark documentation for support details.
Spark 3 pushdown
Spark 3 pushdown to CDP Base functionality is supported.  
Ozone addon integration
Ozone object storage is now supported as a backend
            storage provider.
Free IPA certification
All CML functionality is certified on clusters using
            Free IPA, for both OCP and ECS clusters.
