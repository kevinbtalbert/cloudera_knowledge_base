DSE-19496 The log4j build dependency is removed for the Scala ML Runtime. Once this
        ML Runtimes version is deployed, the user interface will always point to this latest version
        of the 2021.09.02 Scala Runtime to run workloads using the Scala kernel (until a newer
        version is released). Users will not be able to select the originally released 2021.09 Scala
        Runtime.
