Version 2022.04
New features


Powered By Jupyter (PBJ) Workbench (Preview) - The
          Powered By Jupyter (PBJ) Workbench features the classic workbench UI backed by the
          open-source Jupyter protocol pre-packaged in an ML Runtime image. Users can easily choose
          this Runtime when launching a session. The open-source Jupyter infrastructure eliminates
          the dependency on proprietary CML code when building a Docker image, allowing runtime
          images to be built with open standards. The first PBJ Workbench Runtimes are available as
          Tech Preview. 
The Global Registry for npm is set to https://registry.npmjs.org/ in all of our
          runtimes. With this change, customers can use npm install in their Dockerfiles, when they
          build custom runtimes on top of ours. 


noteRAPIDS Runtimes are now an optional extension of the Cloudera ML Runtime distribution. The
      RAPIDS images will no longer be distributed automatically. Administrators can Register them in
      the Runtime Catalog.
