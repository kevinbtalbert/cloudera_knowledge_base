Major features and updates for ML Runtimes.
This release is available with ML Runtimes version 2022.11
noteNew ML Runtime releases are automatically added to the deployment, if
      internet connection is available.
Version 2022.11
New features


PBJ (Powered by Jupyter) Runtime GA: PBJ Runtimes were previously available as a Tech
          Preview only. In ML Runtimes 2022.11 the PBJ Runtimes are available to all users (GA). The
          following PBJ Runtimes are included: 
Python 3.7
Python 3.8
Python 3.9 
R 3.6
R 4.0
R 4.1
These PBJ Runtimes are available on Cloudera Public Cloud (from 2022.10-1) and
            Cloudera Private Cloud (from 1.5.0) form factors, but are not available on CDSW.
            The new PBJ Runtimes appear on the Runtime Selector elements when users start new
            workloads. Their usage is the same as the non-PBJ Runtimes, apart from Models. Models
            require the usage of a new library called cml for Python and R,
            that was introduced in Cloudera Public Cloud (2022.10-1) and the upcoming Private Cloud
            (1.5.0) versions. Usage of cml with regard to models is
            detailed here: PBJ Runtimes and ModelsExamples can be
            found here: Example models with PBJ Runtimes.


Fixed Issues

 DSE-22433 Upgrade numpy version in Python runtimes to resolve issues.
DSE-22374 Reduced log level to WARN log level can be manipulated through the
          HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER environment variable. This is set to
          WARN,console in order to keep console logging, while reducing log
        level from INFO to WARN.
DSE-22251 Add flextable dependencies to R Runtimes Added flextable dependencies
          (libfontconfig1-dev, libcairo2-dev) to R runtimes. Added two OS
        libraries so flextable can be installed and used in CML.

Known issues

The CUDA version (11.4.1) being used to build Nvidia GPU Runtimes is not supported by
        newer Torch versions (1.13+).Workaround: Use Torch versions up to
          1.12.1.Cloudera Bug: DSE-24038
When installing sparklyr for R, the installation will succeed, but
        importing the library in the same session will fail. This happens, because earlier versions
        of dependent packages (vctrs, lifecycle,
          rlang, cli) are already loaded in the R session,
        therefore newer versions cannot be loaded.Workaround: Start a new session, import
          and use sparklyr there.Cloudera Bug: DSE-23762
