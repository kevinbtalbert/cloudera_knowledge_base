Adding Spark to ML Runtime Sessions
You can add Spark to ML Runtime Sessions using the ML Runtimes Addons. Both Spark and
    Hadoop CLI are enabled when you enable Spark. 

To add Spark to sessions run on projects using ML Runtimes images:


You can view all available ML Runtime addons by selecting the Site
            Administration>Runtime/Engine tab and viewing Runtime
            Addons.

Start a New Session for an ML Runtimes project.

Click the Enable Spark option, then select the Spark version.
        

Click Start Session. 

You can now run a Spark job for your session.
The Logs tab displays the executors in your Spark job. 

After you start a Spark job, you can access the Spark UI by clicking the
            Spark UI button at the top of the Session
          window.
