Build the New Docker Image
This topic shows you how to use Docker to build a custom
    image.A new custom Docker image can be built on any host where Docker binaries are installed, source
        images are available, and OS repositories and other package repositories are available. To
        install these binaries, run the following command on the host where you want to build the
        new image:docker build -t <image-name>:<tag> . -f DockerfileIf your Dockerfile makes any outside connection (for example, apt-get,
          update, pip install, curl), you must
        add the --network=host option to the build command:
        docker build --network=host -t <image-name>:<tag> . -f Dockerfile
