ML Runtimes Environment Variables List
The following table lists Cloudera Machine Learning environment
    variables that you can use to customize your project environments. These can be set either as a
    site administrator or within the scope of a project or a job.


Environment Variable
Description




MAX_TEXT_LENGTH


Maximum number of characters that can be displayed in a
                  single text cell. By default, this value is set to 800,000 and
                  any more characters will be truncated.

Default: 800,000




SESSION_MAXIMUM_MINUTES


Maximum number of minutes a session can run before it times
                  out.

Default: 60*24*7 minutes (7 days)

Maximum Value: 35,000 minutes




JOB_MAXIMUM_MINUTES


Maximum number of minutes a job can run before it times
                  out.

Default: 60*24*7 minutes (7 days)

Maximum Value: 35,000 minutes




IDLE_MAXIMUM_MINUTES


Maximum number of minutes a session can remain idle before it
                  exits. 

Default: 60 minutes

Maximum Value: 35,000 minutes



Per-Engine Environmental Variables: In addition to the previous table, there are some
        more built-in environmental variables that are set by the Cloudera Machine Learning application itself and do not need to be modified
        by users. These variables are set per-engine launched by Cloudera Machine Learning and only apply within the scope of each engine. 

Environment Variable
Description




CDSW_PROJECT


The project to which this engine belongs.




CDSW_ENGINE_ID


The ID of this engine. For sessions, this appears in your
                  browser's URL bar.




CDSW_MASTER_ID


If this engine is a worker, this is the
                    CDSW_ENGINE_ID of its master.




CDSW_MASTER_IP


If this engine is a worker, this is the IP address of its
                  master.



CDSW_PUBLIC_PORT

noteThis property is deprecated. See
                    CDSW_APP_PORT and
                    CDSW_READONLY_PORT for alternatives. 
A port on which you can expose HTTP services in the engine
                  to browsers. HTTP services that bind
                    CDSW_PUBLIC_PORT will be available in
                  browsers at:
                    http(s)://<$CDSW_ENGINE_ID>.<$CDSW_DOMAIN>.
                  By default, CDSW_PUBLIC_PORT is set to
                    8080. 
A direct link to these web services will be available from the grid icon in the
                  upper right corner of the Cloudera Machine Learning web
                  application, as long as the job or session is still running. For more details, see
                    Accessing Web User Interfaces from Cloudera Machine Learning.
In Cloudera Machine Learning, setting
                    CDSW_PUBLIC_PORT to a non-default port number is not supported. 



CDSW_APP_PORT

A port on which you can expose HTTP services in the engine
                  to browsers. HTTP services that bind
                    CDSW_APP_PORT will be available in browsers
                  at:
                    http(s)://<$CDSW_ENGINE_ID>.<$CDSW_DOMAIN>.
                  Use this port for applications that grant some control to the
                  project, such as access to the session or terminal. 
A direct link to these web services will be available from the grid icon in the
                  upper right corner of the Cloudera Machine Learning web application as long as the
                  job or session runs. Even if the web UI does not have authentication, only
                  Contributors and those with more access to the project can access it. For more
                  details, see Accessing Web User Interfaces from Cloudera Machine Learning. 
Note that if the Site Administrator has enabled
                    Allow only session creators to run commands
                      on active sessions, then the UI is only
                    available to the session creator. Other users will not be able
                    to access it.
Use 127.0.0.1 as the IP.



CDSW_READONLY_PORT

A port on which you can expose HTTP services in the engine
                  to browsers. HTTP services that bind
                    CDSW_READONLY_PORT will be available in
                  browsers at:
                    http(s)://<$CDSW_ENGINE_ID>.<$CDSW_DOMAIN>.
                  Use this port for applications that grant read-only access to
                  project results. 
A direct link to these web services will be available to users with from the
                  grid icon in the upper right corner of the Cloudera Machine Learning web application as long as the job or
                  session runs. Even if the web UI does not have authentication, Viewers and those
                  with more access to the project can access it. For more details, see
                    Accessing Web User Interfaces from Cloudera Machine Learning.
Use 127.0.0.1 as the IP.




CDSW_DOMAIN


The domain on which Cloudera Machine Learning is being
                  served. This can be useful for iframing services, as demonstrated in
                    Accessing Web User Interfaces from Cloudera Machine Learning.




CDSW_CPU_MILLICORES


The number of CPU cores allocated to this engine, expressed
                  in thousandths of a core.




CDSW_MEMORY_MB


The number of megabytes of memory allocated to this
                  engine.




CDSW_IP_ADDRESS


Other engines in the Cloudera Machine Learning cluster
                  can contact this engine on this IP address.
