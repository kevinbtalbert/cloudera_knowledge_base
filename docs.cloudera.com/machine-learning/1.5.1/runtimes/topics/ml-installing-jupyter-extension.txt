Installing a Jupyter extension
Extensions modify the appearance or behaviour of Jupyter applications (including
    JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook). 
You must install any files necessary for JupyterLab, including
      configuration, customization, extensions, and kernels, into /home/cdsw for
      each project. 
noteAny Jupyter Extension that is not specifically designed for JupyterLab should work
          fine with Jupyter Notebook, which is preinstalled in Legacy Engine engine:14.


The following example installs the ipython-sql extension. This extension
        adds a %sql magic command that allows you to communicate directly with any
        database supported by SQLAlchemy.


Launch a JupyterLab session.

Open a terminal and run the following command:

pip install ipython-sql


noteThe previous command is only an example for installing
            ipython-sql.


Open a notebook or console and run the following command:

%load_ext sql


You can now use the %sql magic command to
      connect to a particular database, and the %%sql magic command to create a
      cell containing an SQL query to run against that database. See the JupyterLab documentation
      for additional information on Jupyter magic commands.
