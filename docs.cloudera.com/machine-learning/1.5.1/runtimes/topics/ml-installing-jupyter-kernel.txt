Installing a Jupyter kernel
Jupyter kernels are “connections” through which a notebook (or other part of
    JupyterLab) can talk to a particular interpreter. CDSW includes one kernel in each JupyterLab
    Runtime: Python 3.6, Python 3.7, or Python 3.8. 
Jupyter kernels are “connections” through which a notebook (or other part of JupyterLab)
        can talk to an interpreter. ML Runtimes come with a Jupyter kernel for Python 3.6, 3.7 or
        3.8 preinstalled, but you may also install Jupyter kernels for bash or
        JavaScript/TypeScript.
bash
The following example describes how to enable a bash kernel in a particular project.

Launch a JupyterLab session.
Open a terminal window and run the following command:
pip install bash_kernel
python -m bash_kernel.install



You should now have the option to launch bash notebooks and consoles.

JavaScript and TypeScript
The following example describes how to enable JavaScript and TypeScript kernels in a
        particular project. .

Customize your PATH environment variable:
Navigate to Project Settings/Advanced.
Set PATH to $HOME/node_modules/.bin:$PATH.

Launch a JupyterLab session.
Open a terminal window and run the following command:
npm install tslab
tslab install



You should now have the option to launch JavaScript and TypeScript notebooks and
        console.
