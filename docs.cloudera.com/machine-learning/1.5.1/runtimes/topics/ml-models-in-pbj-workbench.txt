PBJ Runtimes and Models
The PBJ (Powered by Jupyter) Runtime enables a wide variety of language kernels to be
  run as CML workloads. Model workloads are currently only supported for Python and R
  kernels.
A new library, cml,  is added to Runtime based Python and R workloads
   automatically and includes mostly the same functionality as the old cdsw library.
In non-PBJ Runtimes, you could point to a Python or R function and run it as a model. PBJ
   Runtimes open up the possibilities for users to create their own Runtimes and places few
   restrictions on how to do that. PBJ technology utilizes the Jupyter
    kernelgateway to communicate with language kernels and aims to be language
   independent in the future.
Migrating from the cdsw to cml library
PBJ Runtimes currently includes two supported languages, Python and R. There are new function
    wrappers or decorators, described below, that must be used in order to allow previously written
    model code to function in a PBJ Runtime. It is important to note that these support decorators
    or wrappers are transparent, that is, they have no effect, in non-PBJ workloads and non-model
    workloads.

Library availability
In CML, The cdsw and s libraries are available in different
    runtime and engine types.


Runtime / Engine type
Library availablility



Legacy Engine
cdsw


Classic Runtime
cdsw, cml


PBJ Runtime
cml


noteThe cml library is now used by default, instead of the
     cdsw library. However, if a project was created on a previous CML release, it
    might use the deprecated cdsw library. Code using the cdsw
    library will not run on a PBJ Runtime. Code running on PBJ Runtimes must use the
     cml library.
