ML Runtimes versus Legacy Engine
While Runtimes and the Legacy Engine are both container images that contain the Linux
    OS, interpreter(s), and libraries, ML Runtimes keeps the images small and improves performance,
    maintenance, and security.
noteLegacy Engines are deprecated since June 2021 and will be removed in a
      future release. Starting with version 1.5.1, on new workspaces Legacy Engines are disabled by
      default and no Legacy Engine image is registered in the workspace. Cloudera recommends using
      ML Runtimes for all new projects, and urges customers to migrate existing Engine-based
      projects to ML Runtimes.
Runtimes and the Legacy Engine serve the same basic goal: they are container images that
      contain a complete Linux OS, interpreter(s), and libraries. They are the environment in which
      your code runs. However, ML Runtimes design keeps the images small, which improves
      performance, maintenance, and security.
There is one Legacy Engine. The Engine is monolithic. It contains the machinery necessary to
      run sessions using all four Engine interpreter options that Cloudera currently supports
      (Python 2, Python 3, R, and Scala) and a much larger set of UNIX tools including LaTeX. The
      Conda package manager was available in the Legacy Engine. Conda is not available in ML
      Runtimes.
Runtimes are the future of CML. There are many Runtimes. Currently each Runtime contains a
      single interpreter (for example, Python 3.8, R 4.0) and a set of UNIX tools including
        gcc. Each Runtime supports a single UI for running code (for example, the
      Workbench or JupyterLab).
To migrate from Legacy Engine to Runtimes, you'll need to modify your project settings. See
        Modifying Project Settings for more information.
Disable Engines
Starting with version 1.5.1, Legacy Engines are disabled by default on the workspace level. This
      setting is accessible in Site Administration > Runtime > Disable Engines. Select this checkbox on upgraded workspaces to disable Legacy Engines and
      change all existing project types to ML Runtime. Disabling Legacy Engines prohibits changing
      the project type to Legacy Engine.
This has the following effect for workloads using Legacy Engine kernels:

Model builds cannot be redeployed
Applications cannot be restarted
Jobs cannot be started, scheduled jobs will fail
Sessions cannot be started

To re-enable Legacy Engines go to Site Administration > Runtime and deselect the Disable Engines checkbox under
        Engine Images.
Jupyter
Our Python Runtimes support JupyterLab, a general purpose IDE from the Jupyter project. The
      engine supports Jupyter Notebook, a simpler UI focused on Notebooks. If you prefer the simpler
      Notebook UI, choose Classic Notebook from the JupyterLab
        Help menu. To further customize the JupyterLab experience on CML see
        Using Editors for ML Runtimes.
Build dependencies
Runtimes generally include fewer UNIX tools than the Legacy Engine. This means you are more
      likely to find that you cannot install a Python or R package because the Runtime is missing a
      build dependency such as a library. This should not happen often with Python. Most Python
      packages are distributed as precompiled “wheels”, so there are no build dependencies. It is
      more likely to happen with R packages because precompiled packages are not available for our
      architecture. We have tried to cover most common use cases, but if you find you cannot build
      something, then please contact customer support. 
Using pip to install libraries in Python
To install a Python library from within Workbench or JupyterLab we recommend you use
        %pip (for example, %pip install sklearn.
        %pip is a “magic” command that is guaranteed to point to the right version
      of pip. This is a good habit to get into, as it will work outside CML. Note you do not need to
      add “3” to install a Python 3 library. 
If you prefer to use the pip executable directly, both pip and
        pip3 work. This is because Runtimes do not include Python 2. Like any shell
      command, precede it with “!” to run it from within Workbench or JupyterLab (for example,
        !pip install sklearn. In the Legacy Engine you must use
        pip3 to install Python 3 packages and the %pip magic
      command is not supported. 
Python paths
Python Runtimes include preinstalled Python packages at
        /usr/local/lib/python/<version>/site-packages. The pre-installed
      packages and versions are documented in Pre-Installed Packages in ML
      Runtimes.
When you use pip, you install packages into the current project (not a runtime image) at
         /home/cdsw/.local/lib/python/<version>/site-packages. This means you
      need to reinstall packages if you change Python versions.
In most cases, you can install a newer version of a package preinstalled in
        /usr/local into your project. For example, we preinstall numpy and you can
      install a newer version. But there are some exceptions to this: if you install
        matplotlib, ipykernel, or its dependencies
        (ipython, traitlets, jupyter_client, and
        tornado) then you may break your ability to launch sessions.
If you accidentally install these packages (or you see unexpected behavior when you switch a
      project from Legacy Engine to Runtimes), the simplest solution is to delete
        /home/cdsw/.local/lib/python and reinstall your project’s dependencies from
      the project overview page. 
R paths
R Runtimes include preinstalled R packages at /usr/local/lib/R/library/. The
      pre-installed packages and versions are documented in Pre-Installed Packages in ML
        Runtimes. 
When you use install.packages(), you install packages into the current
      project (not a runtime image) at /home/cdsw/.local/lib/R/<version>/library
      (for example, $R_LIBS_USER). This means you need to reinstall packages if you
      change R versions.
Note the R project package path in Legacy Engines. If you use engines, you install packages
        to /home/cdsw/R. The change to
        /home/cdsw/.local/lib/R/<version>/library was made to support multiple
      versions of R.
In most cases, you can install a newer version of a package preinstalled
        /usr/local into your project. For example, we preinstall
        ggplot2 and you can install a newer version. But there are two exceptions
      to this. If you install Cairo or RServe they may break your ability to launch sessions.
If you accidentally install these packages (or you see unexpected behavior when you switch a
      project from Legacy Engine to Runtimes), the simplest solution is to delete
        /home/cdsw/.local/lib/python and reinstall your project’s dependencies from
      the project overview page.
