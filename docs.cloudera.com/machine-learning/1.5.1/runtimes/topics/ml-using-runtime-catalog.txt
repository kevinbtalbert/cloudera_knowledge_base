Using Runtime Catalog
You can use the Runtime catalog to list all runtimes that are available for your
    deployment.
The Runtime Catalog lists information about each of the
      available runtimes. Information includes the editor and kernel supported by the runtime along
      with the edition, version, and a brief description.

Click Runtime Catalog in the left Navigation bar to display a
          list of all available runtimes.
