Team Key
Team SSH keys provide a useful way to give an entire team access
    to external resources such as databases or GitHub repositories (as described
    in the next section). 
Like Cloudera Machine Learning users, each Cloudera Machine Learning team has an associated SSH key. You can access the public key
        from the team's account settings. Click Account,
        then select the team from the drop-down menu at the upper right corner
        of the page.
When you launch a console in a project owned by a team,
      you can use that team's SSH key from within the console.
