Adding a Collaborator
Project Owners can add Collaborators to a project.

The Project Owner performs these steps:


Go to Collaborators, and enter the user id in the Search
                    box.

Choose the user id, and click
                    Add. The user or team is added with their role
                    displayed.

Now, when the Business User logs in, they are able to access the Applications under
            this project.
