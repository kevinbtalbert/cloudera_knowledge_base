Application Polling EndpointCloudera Docs
Application Polling Endpoint
The CML server periodically polls applications for their status. The default polling
  endpoint is the root endpoint ( / ), but a custom polling endpoint can be
  specified if the server or other application has difficulty with the default endpoint.
When creating or modifying an application, you can specify a new value for the
    CDSW_APP_POLLING_ENDPOINT environmental variable. Just replace the default
   value / that is shown. For more information, see Analytical
    Applications.
You can also set the environmental value in Project Settings > Advanced. In this case, any setting made here can be overridden by settings in a given
   application. However, settings made in Project Settings > Advanced also apply when polling sessions.
