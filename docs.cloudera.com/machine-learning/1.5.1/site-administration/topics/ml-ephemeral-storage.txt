Ephemeral storage
Ephemeral storage space is scratch space a CML session, job, application or model can
  use. This feature helps in better scheduling of CML pods, and provides a safety valve to ensure
  runaway computations do not consume all available scratch space on the node.
By default, each user pod in CML is allocated 0 GB of scratch space, and it is allowed to use
   up to 10 GB. These settings can be applied to an entire site, or on a per-project basis.
Change Site-wide Ephemeral Storage Configuration
In Site Administration > Settings > Advanced, you can see the fields to change
    the ephemeral storage request (minimum) and maximum limit.




Override Site-wide Ephemeral Storage Configuration
If you want to customize the ephemeral storage settings, you can do so on a per-project basis.
    Open your project, then click on Project Settings > Advanced and adjust the ephemeral storage
    parameters.




AWS Known Issues
There is a known issue with the cluster autoscaler that affects autoscaling from 0->1 if a
    non-zero value for Ephemeral Storage Request is set. This affects both
    CPU and GPU node groups of the CML workspace. The autoscaler throws the following error when
    this happens:
pod didn't trigger scale-up: 1 Insufficient ephemeral-storage
This is occurring even though the nodes in the CML autoscaling groups have sufficient
    ephemeral storage space in their group templates. See this github issue for details. Even though the issue is closed, the problem still
    persists.
The issue only affects node groups that have [0, x] autoscaling range.
Set the Ephemeral Storage Request value to 0 in both the site-wide and
    project settings if you run into this issue.
