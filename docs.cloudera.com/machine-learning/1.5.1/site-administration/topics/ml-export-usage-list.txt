Export Usage List
You can export a list of sessions and workloads. You can either download a complete
        list of workloads or you can filter the workloads by date to download a more concise
        list.

Select Site Administration in the navigation pane.

Select the Usage tab.

If you want a list of workloads specific to a date range, you can filter the
                    list of workloads by setting the Date Range.

Select Export Usage List to download the list of
                    workloads.

The list downloads to your computer as a .csv file.
