Monitoring User Events
This topic shows you how to  query the PostgresSQL database that is
    embedded within the Cloudera Machine Learning deployment to monitor or
    audit user events. 
Querying the PostgresSQL database that is
      embedded within the Cloudera Machine Learning deployment requires
      root access to the Cloudera Machine Learning Master host.
SSH to the Cloudera Machine Learning Master host and log
          in as root. For example, the following
          command connects to cdsw-master-host. as
            root:ssh root@cdsw-master-host.yourcdswdomain.comGet the name of the database pod:
kubectl get pods -l role=db
The command returns information similar to the following
            example:NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-86bbb69b54-d5q88   1/1     Running   0          4h46m
Enter the following command to log into the database as the
            sense user: 
 kubectl exec <database pod> -ti -- psql -U sense
For example, the following command logs in to the database on pod
               db-86bbb69b54-d5q88:
            kubectl exec db-86bbb69b54-d5q88 -ti -- psql -U sense
You are logged into the database as the
            sense user.Run queries against the user_events
          table.For example, run the following query to view the
          most recent user
          event:select * from user_events order by created_at DESC LIMIT 1The
          command returns information similar to the
          following:
id          | 3658
user_id     | 273
ipaddr      | ::ffff:127.0.0.1
user_agent  | node-superagent/2.3.0
event_name  | model created
description | {"model":"Simple Model 1559154287-ex5yn","modelId":"50","userType":"NORMAL","username":"DonaldBatz"}
created_at  | 2019-05-29 18:24:47.65449Optionally, you can export the user events to a CSV file for
          further analysis:
Copy the user_events table to a CSV
              file:

copy user_events to '/tmp/user_events.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;


Find the container that the database runs on:
docker ps | grep db-86bbb
The command returns output similar to the
              following:
              c56d04bbd58 c230b2f564da "docker-entrypoint..." 7 days ago Up 7 days k8s_db_db-86bbb69b54-fcfm6_default_8b2dd23d-88b9-11e9-bc34-0245eb679f96_0The
              first entry is the container ID.
Copy the user_events.csv file out
              of the container into a temporary directory on the Master
              host:docker cp <container ID>:/tmp/user_events.csv /tmp/user_events.csvFor
              example:
              docker cp 8c56d04bbd58:/tmp/user_events.csv /tmp/user_events.csv
Use SCP to copy
            /tmp/user_events.csv from the Cloudera Machine Learning Master host to a destination of your
              choice.For example, run the following command on your
              local machine to copy user_events.csv to a
              local directory named
              events:scp root@cdsw-master-host.yourcdswdomain.com:/tmp/user_events.csv /local/directory/events/
