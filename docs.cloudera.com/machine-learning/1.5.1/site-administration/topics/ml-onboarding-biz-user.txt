Onboarding Business Users
There are two procedures required for adding Business Users to CML. First, an Admin
        ensures the Business User has the correct permissions, and second, a Project Owner adds the
        Business User as a Collaborator.

Make sure the user is already assigned in your external identity provider, such as
                LDAP.


The Admin user performs these steps:


In Environments, select the correct environment where
                    the ML workspace is hosted.

In Manage Access, search for the user, and add the
                        ML Business User role. Make sure the user does not
                    already have a higher-level permission, such as ML Admin
                    or ML User, either through a direct role assignment or a
                    group membership.

Click Update Roles.

Inside the ML Workspace, go to Site Administration > Users, and click Synchronize Users. This adds
                    the necessary Users defined at the Environment level to the Workspace, and
                    updates any role changes that have been made.

Add the ML Business User as a Collaborator to a
            Project.
