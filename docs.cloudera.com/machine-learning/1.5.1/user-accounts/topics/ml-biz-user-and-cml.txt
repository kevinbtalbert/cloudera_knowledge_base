Business Users and CML
A user is treated as a Business User inside of CML if they are granted the
   MLBusinessUser role on the Environment of the given ML Workspace. Inside of the
  Workspace, a Business User is able to access and view applications, but does not have privileges
  to access any other workloads in the Workspace.
Logging in as a Business User
When you log in as a Business User, the only page you see is the
     Applications page. The page shows any applications associated with any
    projects that you have been added to as a Collaborator, even though you do not have rights to
    access the other assets associated with those projects. 
In order for applications to appear in your view, contact the Project Owner to add you as a
    Collaborator to the project. If you have not been added to any projects, or none of the projects
    that you have been added to have applications, the Applications page
    displays the message, You currently donâ€™t have any applications.
