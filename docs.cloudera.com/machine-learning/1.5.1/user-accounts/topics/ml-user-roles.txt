User Roles
Users in Cloudera Machine Learning are assigned one or more of the following
  roles.
There are two categories of roles: environment resource roles, which apply to a given CDP
   environment, and workspace resource roles, which apply to a single workspace. To use workspace
   resource roles, you may need to upgrade the workspace or create a new workspace.
If a user has more than one role, then the role with the highest level of permissions takes
   precedence. If a user is a member of a group, it may gain additional roles through that
   membership.
Environment resource roles


MLAdmin: Grants a CDP user the ability to create and delete Cloudera
      Machine Learning workspaces within a given CDP environment. MLAdmins also have Administrator
      level access to all the workspaces provisioned within this environment. They can run
      workloads, monitor, and manage all user activity on these workspaces. They can also add the
      MLUser and MLBusinessUser roles to their assigned environment. This user also needs the
      account-level role of IAMViewer, in order to access the environment
       Manage Access page. To create or delete workspaces, this user also
      needs the EnvironmentAdmin role.
MLUser: Grants a CDP user the ability to view Cloudera Machine
      Learning workspaces provisioned within a given CDP environment. MLUsers will also be able to
      run workloads on all the workspaces provisioned within this environment.
MLBusinessUser: Grants permission to list Cloudera Machine Learning
      workspaces for a given CDP environment. MLBusinessUsers are able to only view applications
      deployed under the projects that they have been added to as a Business User.
