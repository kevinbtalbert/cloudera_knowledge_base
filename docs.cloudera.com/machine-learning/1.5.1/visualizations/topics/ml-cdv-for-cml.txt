Cloudera Data Visualization for ML
Cloudera Data Visualization enables you to explore data and communicate insights across
    the whole data lifecycle by using visual objects. The fast and easy self-service data
    visualization streamlines collaboration in data analytics through the common language of
    visuals.
Using this rich visualization layer enables you to accelerate advanced data
      analysis. The web-based, no-code, drag-and-drop user interface is highly intuitive and enables
      you to build customized visualizations on top of your datasets, build dashboards and
      applications, and publish them anywhere across the data lifecycle. This solution allows for
      customization and collaboration, and it provides you with a dynamic and data-driven insight
      into your business.
Cloudera Data Visualization is integrated with Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) in all form
      factors. You can use the same visualization tool for structured, unstructured/text, and ML
      analytics, which means deeper insights and more advanced dashboard applications. You can
      create native data visualizations to provide easy predictive insights for business users and
      accelerate production ML workflows from raw data to business impact.
