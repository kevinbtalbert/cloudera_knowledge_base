Built-in CML Visualizations
You can use built-in CML tools to create data visualizations  including simple plots,
  saved images, HTML and iFrame visualizations, and grid displays. 


Simple PlotsCloudera Machine Learning supports using simple plot to     create data visualizations.Saved ImagesYou can display images within your reports.HTML VisualizationsYour code can generate and display HTML in Cloudera Machine Learning.IFrame VisualizationsMost visualizations require more than basic HTML. Embedding HTML directly in your     console also risks conflicts between different parts of your code. The most flexible way to     embed a web resource is using an IFrame.Grid DisplaysCloudera Machine Learning supports built-in grid displays of     DataFrames across several languages.Documenting Your AnalysisCloudera Machine Learning supports Markdown documentation of     your code written in comments.
