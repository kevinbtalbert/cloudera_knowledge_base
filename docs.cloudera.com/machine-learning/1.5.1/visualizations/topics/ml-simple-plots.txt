Simple Plots
Cloudera Machine Learning supports using simple plot to
    create data visualizations.To create a simple plot, run a console in your favorite language and paste in the following
        code sample:
R
# A standard R plot 
plot(rnorm(1000)) 

# A ggplot2 plot 
library("ggplot2") 
qplot(hp, mpg, data=mtcars, color=am, 
facets=gear~cyl, size=I(3), 
xlab="Horsepower", ylab="Miles per Gallon")
Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random
plt.plot([random.normalvariate(0,1) for i in xrange(1,1000)])Cloudera Machine Learning processes each line of code
        individually (unlike notebooks that process code per-cell). This means
        if your plot requires multiple commands, you will see incomplete plots
        in the workbench as each line is processed.To get around this behavior, wrap all your plotting commands in one
        Python function. Cloudera Machine Learning will then process the
        function as a whole, and not as individual lines. You should then see
        your plots as expected.
