How to upgrade CML workspaces (ECS)
Upgrading workspaces from CML Private Cloud 1.5.0 to 1.5.1 is easy.
To upgrade a workspace that uses an external NFS to version 1.5.1, in the Workspace UI, just
      click the Upgrade button located next to the workspace name. This works
      for upgrading workspaces from version 1.4.1 or 1.5.0 to version 1.5.1.
To upgrade a workspace that uses an internal NFS to version 1.5.1, in the Workspace UI, just
      click the Upgrade button located next to the workspace name. This only
      works for version 1.5.0 workspaces.
For older workspaces (version 1.4.1) that use an internal NFS, first upgrade the workspace to
      version 1.5.0 using the manual procedure described in Upgrade CML workspaces version
        1.4.1 to 1.5.0 (ECS), then use the Upgrade button.
