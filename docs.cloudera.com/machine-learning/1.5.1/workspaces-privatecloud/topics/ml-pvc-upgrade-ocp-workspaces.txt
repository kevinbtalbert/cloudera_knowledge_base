Upgrading workspaces from CML Private Cloud 1.5.0 to 1.5.1 is easy.
To upgrade a workspace that uses an external NFS to version 1.5.1, in the Workspace UI, just
       click the Upgrade button located next to the workspace name. This works
       for upgrading workspaces from version 1.4.1 or 1.5.0 to version 1.5.1.

       click the Upgrade button located next to the workspace name. This only
       works for version 1.5.0 workspaces.
For older workspaces (version 1.4.1) that use an internal NFS, first upgrade the workspace to
       version 1.5.0 using the manual procedure described in Upgrade CML workspaces version
         1.4.1 to 1.5.0 (OCP), then use the Upgrade button.
