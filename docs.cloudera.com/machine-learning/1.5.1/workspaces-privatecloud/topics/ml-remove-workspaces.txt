Removing ML Workspaces
This topic describes how to remove an existing ML workspace and clean up any cloud
    resources associated with the workspace. Currently, only CDP users with both the MLAdmin
    role and the EnvironmentAdmin account role can remove workspaces. 

Log in to the CDP web interface.

Click ML Workspaces.

Click on the Actions icon and select Remove Workspace. 


Force Delete - This property is not required by default. You should
              first attempt to remove your workspace with this property disabled. 

Enabling this property deletes the workspace from CDP but does not guarantee that
                the underlying kubernetes resources used by the workspace are cleaned up properly.
                Go to you kuberknetes administration console to make sure that the resources have
                been successfully deleted.




Click OK to confirm.
