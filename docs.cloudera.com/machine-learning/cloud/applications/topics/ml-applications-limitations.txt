Limitations with Analytical Applications
This topic lists all the limitations associated with the
    Applications feature. 


Port availabilityCloudera Machine Learning exposes only 2 ports per workload.
            Therefore, you can run a maximum of 2 web applications simultaneously, on these ports: 
CDSW_APP_PORT
CDSW_READONLY_PORT
By default, third-party browser-based editors run on
              CDSW_APP_PORT. Therefore, for projects that are already using
            browser-based editors, you are left with only one other port to run applications on:
              CDSW_READONLY_PORT.
