Add a catalog
The collection of AMPs available to end users can draw from one or more sources. For
        example, you might have an internal company catalog in addition to the default Cloudera
        catalog. The catalog must be provided with a catalog file and one or more project metadata
        YAML files.
Specify Catalog File URL if your git hosting service allows
            you to access the raw content of the repo without authenticating. (That is, the source
            files can be retrieved with a curl command, and do not require logging into a web page).
            Otherwise, specify the Git Repository URL. To use a git
            repository as a catalog source, the catalog file and the AMP files must be in a
            repository that can be cloned with git clone without authentication. 

As an Administrator, go to Site Administration > AMPs.

Select Git Repository URL or Catalog File
                        URL to specify a new source. Paste or enter the URL to the new
                    source, and file name for the catalog file if necessary.

Click Add Source.
The catalog YAML file is loaded, and the projects found there are displayed in
                        Catalog Entries.

If there are projects that are not yet ready for use, or that should not be
                    displayed in the catalog, deselect Enabled in the
                        Catalog Entries.
