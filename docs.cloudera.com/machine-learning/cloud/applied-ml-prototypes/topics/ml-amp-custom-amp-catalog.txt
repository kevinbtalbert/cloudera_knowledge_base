Custom AMP Catalog
An AMP catalog is a collection of AMPs that can be added to a workspace as a group. Cloudera Machine Learning ships with the Cloudera AMP catalog, containing AMPs
    developed by Cloudera Fast Forward Labs, but you can also create and add your own catalog,
    containing AMPs developed by your organization.
To create an AMP catalog, you need to create a YAML file called the catalog file. This file is
      hosted on GitHub or another git server. This could be either a public or a private git
      server.
The catalog file contains information about each AMP in the catalog, and provides a link to the
   AMP repository itself. The catalog file specification is shown in Catalog File
    Specification.
You can also look at the Cloudera catalog file for an example. To view the file, click directly
   on the URL for Cloudera in Catalog Sources.
For more details on creating the AMPs that you will include in your catalog, see Creating
    New AMPs.
One use case you might consider is creating a fork of the Cloudera AMP catalog, in order to
      host it internally. In this case, you will need to edit the URLs in the catalog and project
      metadata files to point to the appropriate internal resources.
