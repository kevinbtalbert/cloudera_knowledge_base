Build and deployment commands for models
Models have separate parameters for builds and deployments. When a model is built, an
        image is created. Whereas, the deployment is the actual instance of the model. You can list
        model builds and deployment, and monitor their state using from model CLI client
        (cdswctl).
Listing a model
To list the models, run the following
                command:cdswctl models list

Monitoring the status of the model
To monitor the status of the build for a particular model, use the following
                command:cdswctl models listBuild --modelId <model_ID> --projectId <project_ID>
You can use the --latestModelDeployment flag to get the build for
                the latest deployment.

Listing a deployment
To list the deployment for a particular model, run the following
                command:cdswctl models listDeployments --modelId <model_ID>

Checking the status of a deployment
To check the status of your deployment, run the following
                command:cdswctl models listDeployments --statusSet=deployed
Following is a list of arguments for the statusSet parameter:
deployed
deploying
failed
pending
stopping
stopped
noteYou can use the parameter more than once in a command to check multiple
                    statuses of your deployed models. For example,
                    cdswctl models listDeployments --statusSet=deployed --statusSet=stopped --statusSet=failed
