Log into cdswctl
This topic describes how to log into cdswctl. 

Open the Model CLI client.

Run the following command while specifying the actual values for the variables:

cdswctl login -u <workspace_url> -n <username> -y <legacy_api_key>

where
workspace_url is the workspace URL including the protocol
              (http(s)://domain.com)
username is your user name on the workspace
legacy_api_key is the API key that you can obtain from the
              Cloudera Machine Learning UI. Go to Settings > API Keys and copy the Legacy API Key (and not the
                API Key).

To see more information about the login command parameters, run
          cdswctl login --help
If all goes well, then you'll see "Login
          succeeded".
