Create a Dockerfile for the Custom Image
This topic shows you how to create a Dockerfile for a custom
    image.

The first step when building a customized image is to create a
        Dockerfile that specifies which packages you would like to install in
        addition to the base image. 
For example, the following Dockerfile installs the
          beautifulsoup4 package on top of the base Ubuntu
        image that ships with Cloudera Machine Learning. 
# Dockerfile

# Specify a Cloudera Machine Learning base image
FROM docker.repository.cloudera.com/cloudera/cdsw/engine:13-cml-2021.02-1

# Update packages on the base image and install beautifulsoup4
RUN apt-get update
RUN pip install beautifulsoup4 && pip3 install beautifulsoup4
