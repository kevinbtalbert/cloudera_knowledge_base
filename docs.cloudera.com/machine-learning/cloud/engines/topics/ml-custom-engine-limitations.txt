Limitations
This topic lists some limitations associated with custom engines. 


Cloudera Machine Learning only
            supports customized engines that are based on the Cloudera Machine Learning base image.


Cloudera Machine Learning does not support creation of custom
            engines larger than 10 GB.
Cloudera Bug: DSE-4420


Cloudera Machine Learning does
            not support pulling images from registries that require Docker
            credentials.
Cloudera Bug: DSE-1521


The contents of certain pre-existing standard
            directories such as /home/cdsw,
              /tmp, and so on, cannot be modified
            while creating customized engines. This means any files saved in
            these directories will not be accessible from sessions that are
            running on customized engines.
Workaround: Create a new custom directory in the Dockerfile
            used to create the customized engine, and save your files to that
            directory.
