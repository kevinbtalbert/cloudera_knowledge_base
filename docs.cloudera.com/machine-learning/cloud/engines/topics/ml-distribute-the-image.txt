Distribute the Image
This topic explains the different methods that can be used to
    distribute a custom engine to all the hosts.Once you have built a new custom engine, use one of the following
      ways to distribute the new image to all your Cloudera Machine Learning hosts:
Push the image to a public registry such as DockerHub

For instructions, refer the Docker documentation docker push and
                  Push images to Docker Cloud.

Push the image to your company's Docker registry

When using this method, make sure to tag your image with the
                  following schema:
docker tag <image-name> <company-registry>/<user-name>/<image-name>:<tag>
Once the image has been tagged properly, use the following
                  command to push the image:
docker push <company-registry>/<user-name>/<image-name>:<tag>
The MeCab example at the end of this topic uses this method.
