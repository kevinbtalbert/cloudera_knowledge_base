Set up a custom repository location
You can set up a custom default location for Python and R code package repositories.
  This is especially useful for air-gapped clusters that are isolated from the PIP and CRAN
  repositories on the public internet.
Python PIP repository
Custom PIP repositories can be set as default for all engines at a site or project level. The
    environmental variables can be set at the Project or Site level. If the values are set at the
    Site level, they can be overridden at the Project level.

Set the environmental variables at the appropriate level.
For Site level, go to: Site Administration > Engine
For Project level, go to: Project Settings > Engine

To set a new default URL for the PIP index, enter:
    
PIP_INDEX_URL = <new url>
PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL = <new url>



CRAN repository
Custom CRAN repositories must be set in a session or as part of a custom engine.
    To set a new default URL for a CRAN repository, set the following in the 
    /home/cdsw/.Rprofile file:
options(repos=structure(c(CRAN="<mirror URL>")))
