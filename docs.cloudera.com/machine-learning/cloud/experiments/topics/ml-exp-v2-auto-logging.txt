Automatic Logging
Automatic logging allows you to log metrics, parameters, and models without the need for an
  explicit log statement.
You can perform autologging two ways:

Call mlflow.autolog() before your training code. This will enable
    autologging for each supported library you have installed as soon as you import it.
Use library-specific autolog calls for each library you use in your code. See below for
    examples.

For more information about the libraries supported by autologging, see Automatic Logging.
