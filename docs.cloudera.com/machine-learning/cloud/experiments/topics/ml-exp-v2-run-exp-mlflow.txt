Running an Experiment using MLflow
This topic walks you through a simple example to help you get started with Experiments in
  Cloudera Machine Learning.
Best practice: Itâ€™s useful to display two windows while creating runs for your experiments: one
   window displays the Experiments tab and another displays the MLflow
   Session.

From your Project window, click New Experiment
    and create a new experiment. Keep this window open to return to after you run your new
    session.
From your Project window, click New
    Session.
Create a new session using ML Runtimes. Experiment runs cannot be created from sessions using
    Legacy Engine.
In your Session window, import MLflow by running the following code:
     import mlflow The ML Flow client library is installed by default, but you must
    import it for each session.
Start a run and then specify the MLflow parameters, metrics, models and artifacts to be
    logged. You can enter the code in the command prompt or create a project. See CML
     Experiment Tracking through MLflow API for a list of functions you can use. For
      example: mlflow.set_experiment(<experiment_name>)
mlflow.start_run()
mlflow.log_param("input", 5)
mlflow.log_metric("score", 100)
with open("data/features.txt", 'w') as f:
    f.write(features)
# Writes all files in "data" to root artifact_uri/states
mlflow.log_artifacts("data", artifact_path="states")
## Artifacts are stored in project directory under
/home/cdsw/.experiments/<experiment_id>/<run_id>/artifacts
mlflow.end_run()<



For information on using editors, see Using Editors for ML Runtimes.

     ors.html

Continue creating runs and tracking parameters, metrics, models, and artifacts as
    needed.
To view your run information, display the Experiments window and
    select your experiment name. CML displays the Runs table. 


Click the Refresh button on the Experiments
    window to display recently created runs
You can customize the Run table by clicking
     Columns, and selecting the columns you want to display.
