Accessing data with Spark
When you are using CDW, you can use JDBC connections.
JDBC is useful in the following cases: 

Use JDBC connections when you have fine-grained access.
If the scale of data sent over the wire is on the order of tens of thousands of rows of
       data.

Add the Python code as described below, in the Session where you want
   to utilize the data, and update the code with the data location information.
Permissions
In addition, check with the Administrator that you have the correct permissions to access the
    data lake. You will need a role that has read access only. For more information, see
     Accessing a Data Lake from CML.

Set up a JDBC Connection
When using a JDBC connection, you read through a virtual warehouse that has Hive or Impala
    installed. You need to obtain the JDBC connection string, and paste it into the script in your
    session.

In CDW, go to the Hive database containing your data.
From the kebab menu, click Copy JDBC URL.
Paste it into the script in your session.
You also have to enter your user name and password in the script. You should set up
     environmental variables to store these values, instead of hardcoding them in the script.
