  with both legacy engines and runtime sessions.
The following commands enable a CML session to connect to Ozone using the ofs
   protocol.

Put the input file into Ozone:
    hdfs dfs -put data/jedi_wisdom.txt ofs://omservice1/s3v/hivetest/spark
List the files in Ozone:
    hdfs dfs -ls ofs://omservice1/s3v/hivetest/
Download file from ozone to local:
    hdfs dfs -copyToLocal ofs://omservice1/s3v/hivetest/spark data/jedi_wisdom.txt
