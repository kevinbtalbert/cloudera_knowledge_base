Upload and work with local files
This topic includes code samples that demonstrate how to access
    local data for CML workloads.
If you want to work with existing
        data files (.csv, .txt, etc.) from your computer, you can upload these files directly to
        your project in the CML workspace. Go to the project's Overview page.
        Under the Files section, click Upload and select the relevant
        data files to be uploaded. These files will be uploaded to an NFS share available to each
          project.noteStoring large data files in your Project folder is
          highly discouraged. You can store your data files in the Data Lake. The following sections use the
            tips.csv dataset to demonstrate how to work with
        local data stored in your project. Before you run these examples, create a folder called
          data in your project and upload the dataset file to it.Python

import pandas as pd

tips = pd.read_csv('data/tips.csv')
  
tips \
  .query('sex == "Female"') \
  .groupby('day') \
  .agg({'tip' : 'mean'}) \
  .rename(columns={'tip': 'avg_tip_dinner'}) \
  .sort_values('avg_tip_dinner', ascending=False)

R

library(readr)
library(dplyr)

# load data from .csv file in project
tips <- read_csv("data/tips.csv")

# query using dplyr
tips %>%
  filter(sex == "Female") %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_tip = mean(tip, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_tip))
