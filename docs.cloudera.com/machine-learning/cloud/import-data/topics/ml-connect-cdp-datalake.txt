Connect to CDP Data Lake
CML has secure access to the data stored in the CDP Data Lake.
The Data Connection Snippet feature now suggests using the cml.data
   library to connect to the CDP Data Lake - these code snippets pop up as suggestions for every new
   session in a project. For more information, see Data Exploration and
   Visualization.
However, if you would still like to use raw code to connect, follow the instructions in the sections below.

As a CML          Admin, follow this procedure to set up the necessary permissions.Example: Connect a Spark session to the Data LakeAfter the Admin sets up the correct permissions, you can access the Data Lake from         your project, as this example shows.Use Direct Reader Mode with PySparkYou can use the Direct Reader Mode when your data has table-level access control, and does not have row-level security          or column level masking (fine grained access.)Use Direct Reader Mode with SparklyRCreate an Iceberg data connectionCML supports data connections to Iceberg data lakes.Accessing Data from HDFSThere are many ways to access HDFS data from R, Python, and Scala       libraries. The following code samples assume that appropriate permissions have been set up in IDBroker or Ranger/Raz.       The samples below demonstrate how to count the       number of occurrences of each word in a simple text file in HDFS.
