Connect to a CDP Data Hub cluster
The Data Connection Snippet feature helps simplify the user experience by abstracting
        the complexity of creating and configuring a data connection.
You can set up a Data Hub Impala or Hive connection by following the documentation: Set
                up a data connection to CDP Data Hub.
However, if you would still like to use raw Python code to connect, follow this Python example:
from impala.dbapi import connect
                
#Example connection string:
# jdbc:hive2://my-test-master0.eng-ml-i.svbr-nqvp.int.cldr.work/;ssl=true;transportMode=http;httpPath=my-test/cdp-proxy-api/hive

USERNAME=os.getenv(HADOOP_USER_NAME)
PASSWORD=os.getenv(WORKLOAD_PASSWORD)

conn = connect(
    host = "my-test-master0.eng-ml-i.svbr-nqvp.int.cldr.work",
    port = 443,
    auth_mechanism = "LDAP",
    use_ssl = True,
    use_http_transport = True,
    http_path = "my-test/cdp-proxy-api/hive",
    user = USERNAME,
    password = PASSWORD)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("<<INSERT SQL QUERY HERE>>")

for row in cursor:
    print(row)
cursor.close()
conn.close()
