Data connection management
There are a few things to keep in mind about data connections.


Manage data connections in a workspace At the workspace level, you can check the data
      connections that are available in a workspace. In Project Settings > Data Connections, check
      that your desired data source is present. You can also set the availability for any discovered
      connections, if necessary.

Manage data connections in a project All the data connections that were available in the
            workspace when the project was created will be automatically created in the project as
            well. The available connections can then further be marked as unavailable if so desired.
            You can update any changes to the connections that were made at the workspace level by
            clicking Sync with Workspace. Any changes made here only apply to
            your project.
Data connection availability Keep in mind these two scenarios for setting data connection
      availability. 
If a workspace data connection is marked Unavailable, and you then
        create a project, the data connection will not appear in the project. If the connection is
        then changed to Available, and then the Sync with
         Workspace button is clicked, the connection will appear in the project.
If a workspace data connection is marked Available, and you then
        create a project, the connection shows up. If the workspace data connection is then toggled
        to Unavailable, and you click Sync with
         Workspace in the project, the data connection will remain available in the
        project.
