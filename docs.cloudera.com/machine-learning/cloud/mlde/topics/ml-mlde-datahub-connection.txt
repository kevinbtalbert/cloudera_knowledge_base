Set up a data connection to CDP DataHub
You can set up a data connection to the DataHub cluster. You can set up a connection
        using the New Connection dialog, or by using raw code inside your
        project. Both approaches are shown below.

Log into the console web UI.

Depending on which connection you want to use, click on either
                        Connect to Hive or Connect to
                        Impala tile.

Ensure your Data Hub cluster name is correct in the popup.

Copy the JDBC URL string.

Now click on the Build a Data Science Project tile to
                    log into the the ML workspace.

In Site Administration > Data Connections, select New Connection.

Return to the Machine Learning service. In Site Administration > Data Connections, select New Connection.

Enter the connection name. You cannot have duplicate names for data connections
                    within a workspace or within a given project.

Select the connection type:

Hive Virtual Warehouse
Impala Virtual Warehouse


Paste the JDBC URL for the data connection.

(Optional) Enter the Virtual Warehouse Name. This is the
                    name of the warehouse in Cloudera Data Warehouse.






The data connection is available to users by default. To change availability, click
            the Available switch. This switch determines if the data
            connection is displayed in Projects created within the workspace.


Set up a DataHub data connection using raw code
It is recommended to use the New Connection dialog to
            create a new data connection. If needed, you can also set up a data connection in your
            project code by using and adapting the following code snippet.
from impala.dbapi import connect
                
#Example connection string:
# jdbc:hive2://my-test-master0.eng-ml-i.svbr-nqvp.int.cldr.work/;ssl=true;transportMode=http;httpPath=my-test/cdp-proxy-api/hive

conn = connect(
    host = "my-test-master0.eng-ml-i.svbr-nqvp.int.cldr.work",
    port = 443,
    auth_mechanism = "LDAP",
    use_ssl = True,
    use_http_transport = True,
    http_path = "my-test/cdp-proxy-api/hive",
    user = "csso_me",
    password = "Test@123")
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("select * from 3yearpop")

for row in cursor:
    print(row)
cursor.close()
conn.close()
