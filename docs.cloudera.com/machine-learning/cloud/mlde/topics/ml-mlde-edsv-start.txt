Starting Data Discovery and Visualization
You can start the Exploratory Data Science and Visualization application within Cloudera
  Machine Learning (CML).

Create or open a project.
In the project, click Data in the left navigation pane.
If the application was previously started, it appears in the UI.
If not, click Launch Data Application to start the application. It
     takes a few minutes to start the first time.




When the application starts, you can see four tabs at the top of the UI. From here, you can
   follow the steps in Get Started, or try some of the following tasks.
