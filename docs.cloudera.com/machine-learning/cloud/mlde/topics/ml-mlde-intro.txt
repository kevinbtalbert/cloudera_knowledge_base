Exploratory Data Science and Visualization
Exploratory Data Science and Visualization makes it simple for data scientists to get
  started on a data science project.
When you start a data science project, you are presented with a blank notebook, and no
   indication of what data sources are available on the CDP platform, or how to access them. The
   Exploratory Data Science and Visualization feature automatically discovers the data sources
   available to you, from within the standard CML user interface.
The Exploration Data Science and Visualization experience enables all features for Exploratory
   Data Analysis. From the Data tab you can:
Connect to data sources that are available in your project 
Explore the data with SQL to understand its basic shape and characteristics 
Create named datasets that you can reference later 
Quickly create visualizations of the data to understand its properties 
Create dashboards that you can share with your team 


For more information on what you can do in the Data tab, see the documentation for
    Cloudera Data Visualization.
