Managing default and backup data connections
As a data scientist, you may want to set default and backup data connections (virtual
        warehouses). This makes it easy to manage the case where the default data source (virtual
        warehouse or data lake) becomes unavailable, for example.

You need Admin privileges to perform this task. Here, the data connection names of
                default and backup are used as examples.


In Site Administration > Data connections, click Edit to change the name of the
                    default data connection to default.

Change another connection to backup.

In Project Settings, click Sync with
                        Workspace to update the names of the data connections. If two
                    different data connections have the same name, an error occurs during
                    synchronization.

If the default data connection becomes unavailable, the Workspace Administrator
                    can go to the Data Connections tab, and rename the
                    connections.
For example, after changing default to
                        unavailable, change backup to
                        default. Projects that use library code for their
                    connection to the default data connection will continue
                    to operate, because it is now using the new default connection. Note: you need
                    to click Sync with Workspace at the project level to get
                    the updated connections.
