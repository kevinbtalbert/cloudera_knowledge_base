Set up a Hive or Impala data connection manually
Data connections to Hive or Impala virtual warehouses within the same environment as
        the CML workspace are automatically discovered and configured. You can also set up a data
        connection manually, which works across CDP environments. Follow this procedure to set up a
        Hive or Impala data connection.

Log into the CDP web interface and navigate to the Data
                        Warehouse service.

In the Data Warehouse service, select Virtual
                        Warehouses in the left navigation panel.

Select the options menu for the warehouse you want to access, and select
                        Copy JDBC URL.






Return to the Machine Learning service. In Site Administration > Data Connections, select New Connection.

Enter the connection name. You cannot have duplicate names for data connections
                    within a workspace or within a given project.

Select the connection type:

Hive Virtual Warehouse
Impala Virtual Warehouse


Paste the JDBC URL for the data connection.

(Optional) Enter the Virtual Warehouse Name. This is the
                    name of the warehouse in Cloudera Data Warehouse.






The data connection is available to users by default. To change availability, click
            the Available switch. This switch determines if the data
            connection is displayed in Projects created within the workspace.
