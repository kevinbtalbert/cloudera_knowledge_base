Troubleshooting: Empty data page
You launch the application and see the spinner, but then the empty data page
  returns.
On the applications tab, click Data Discovery and Visualization application, and check the
   logs. Check if another user stopped or restarted the application.
On the applications tab, click on Settings > Resource Profile, and check if the available
   resources are sufficient. You can increase the resources if necessary, then restart the
   application.
