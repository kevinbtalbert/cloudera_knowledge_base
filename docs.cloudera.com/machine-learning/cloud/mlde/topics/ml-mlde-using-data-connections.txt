Setting the workload password
Set the workload password to connect your code to the data.
You need to set an environmental variable for the password (WORKLOAD_PASSWORD). This
   environmental variable is needed to access a Hive or Impala warehouse. The password you set in
   Machine Learning must match the password you set in Management Console. For more information on
   setting the workload password in Management Console, see Setting the workload
    password. 
To set the password:

In Machine Learning, go to User Settings > Environment.
Under the Reserved Environment Variables set your
    WORKLOAD_PASSWORD.
Click Save.
In Management Console, select your user name in the left navigation
    pane, and select Profile.
Click Set Workload Password.
Enter the same password as in step 2, and click Set Workload
    Password.

noteYou need to restart any sessions or applications that are running in your workspace.
