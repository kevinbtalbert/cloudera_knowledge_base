Using data connection snippets
As a data scientist, you can connect your project to data with a data connection
        snippet.

Select New Project.

Enter the project name.

Start a new session. To use a Spark connection, make sure to select an ML
                    Runtime engine.

In the Connection Code Snippet pane, select the data
                    connection to use.






Select Copy Code.

Paste the snippet into your code.


Edit the username and password, if necessary. (This is not necessary for the
                    Spark Data Lake connection, or if the WORKLOAD_PASSWORD environmental variable
                    is set up for the user.)

Enter the data connection name.

Uncomment and edit the SQL query.

Select Run.

The results of the SQL query display in the command window.
 When you have finished exploring the available data sources, you can select Donâ€™t
            show me this again for this project on the Connection Code
                Snippet pane, and it will no longer display when you start a session in
            the project.
