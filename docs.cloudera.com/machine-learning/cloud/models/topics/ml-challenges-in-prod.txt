Challenges with Machine Learning in production
One of the hardest parts of Machine Learning (ML) is deploying and operating ML models
  in production applications. These challenges fall maily into the following categories: model
  deployment and serving, model monitoring, and model governance.
Challenges with model deployment and servingAfter models are trained and ready to deploy in a production environment, lack of   consistency with model deployment and serving workflows can present challenges in terms of scaling   your model deployments to meet the increasing numbers of ML usecases across your   business.Challenges with model monitoringMachine Learning (ML) models predict the world around them which is constantly changing.   The unique and complex nature of model behavior and model lifecycle present challenges after the   models are deployed.Challenges with model governanceBusinesses implement ML models across their entire organization, spanning a large   spectrum of usecases. When you start deploying more than just a couple models in production, a lot   of complex governance and management challenges arise.
