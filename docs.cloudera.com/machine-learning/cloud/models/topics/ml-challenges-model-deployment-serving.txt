Challenges with model deployment and serving
After models are trained and ready to deploy in a production environment, lack of
  consistency with model deployment and serving workflows can present challenges in terms of scaling
  your model deployments to meet the increasing numbers of ML usecases across your
  business.
Many model serving and deployment workflows have repeatable, boilerplate aspects which you can
   automate using modern DevOps techniques like high frequency deployment and microservices
   architectures. This approach can enable the ML engineers to focus on the model instead of the
   surrounding code and infrastructure.
