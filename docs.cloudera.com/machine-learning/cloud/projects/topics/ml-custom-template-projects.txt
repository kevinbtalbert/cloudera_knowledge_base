Custom Template Projects
Site administrators can add template projects that have been
    customized for their organization's use-cases. These custom project
    templates can be added in the form of a Git repository. 
Required Role: See User Role Authorization.
To add a new template project, go to
            Admin > 
            Settings. Under the Project
          Templates section, provide a template name, the URL to the
        project's Git repository, and click Add. 
The added
         templates will become available in the Template tab on the Create
            Project page. Site administrators can add, edit, or delete custom templates,
         but not the built-in ones. However, individual built-in templates can be disabled using a
         checkbox in the Project Templates table at Admin >  Settings.
