Configure a Local IDE using an SSH Gateway
The specifics for how to configure a local IDE to work with
    Cloudera Machine Learning are dependent on the local IDE you want to use. 
Cloudera Machine Learning relies on the SSH
      functionality of the editors to connect to the SSH endpoint on your local
      machine created with the cdswctl client. Users establish an SSH endpoint on their
      machine with the cdswctl
      client. This endpoint acts as the bridge that connects the editor on your
      machine and the Cloudera Machine Learning deployment. 
The following steps are a high-level description of the steps a user must complete: 

Establish an SSH endpoint with the CML CLI client. See Initialize an SSH Endpoint.
Configure the local IDE to use Cloudera Machine Learning as the
        remote interpreter.
Optionally, sync files with tools (like mutagen, SSHFS, or the
        functionality built into your IDE) from Cloudera Machine Learning
        to your local machine. Ensure that you adhere to IT policies.
Edit the code in the local IDE and run the code interactively on
        Cloudera Machine Learning.
Sync the files you edited locally to Cloudera Machine Learning.
Use the Cloudera Machine Learning web UI to perform actions such
        as deploying a model that uses the code you edited.
