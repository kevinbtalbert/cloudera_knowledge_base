Configure VS Code as a Local IDE

Cloudera Machine Learning supports using
      local IDEs on your machine that allow remote execution and/or file sync over SSH, such as VS
      Code. This topic describes the tasks you need to perform to configure Cloudera Machine Learning to act as a remote SSH interpreter for VS Code.
      Once finished, you can use VS Code to edit and sync the changes to Cloudera Machine Learning. To perform actions such as deploying a model, use
      the Cloudera Machine Learning web UI.Before you begin, ensure that the
        following prerequisites are met:
You have an edition of VS Code that supports SSH.
You have an SSH public/private key pair for your local machine that is compatible with
            VS Code.
You have Contributor permissions for an existing Cloudera Machine Learning project. Alternatively, create a new project
            you have access to.


Download cdswctl and Add an SSH KeyThe first step to configure VS Code as a local IDE is to download       cdswctl and add an SSH key.Initialize an SSH Connection to Cloudera Machine Learning for VS CodeThe following task describes how to establish an SSH endpoint for Cloudera Machine Learning. Creating an SSH endpoint is the first step to     configuring a remote editor for Cloudera Machine Learning.Setting up VS CodeIn VS Code, you can configure an SSH interpreter. Cloudera Machine Learning uses this method to connect to VS Code and act as its     interpreter.
