(Optional) Configure the Sync Between Cloudera Machine Learning and PyCharm
Configuring what files PyCharm ignores can help you adhere to IT policies. 
Before you configure syncing behavior between the remote
      editor and Cloudera Machine Learning, ensure that you understand the policies set forth
      by IT and the Site Administrator. For example, a policy might require that data remains within
      the Cloudera Machine Learning deployment but allow you to download and edit code. 

In your project, go to Settings and search for
            Project Interpreter.
 Depending on your operating system, Settings may be called
            Preferences. 

Search for Deployment.

On the Connection tab, add the following path to the
            Root path field:

/home/cdsw


Optionally, add a Deployment path on the
            Mappings tab if the code for your Cloudera Machine Learning
          project lives in a subdirectory of the root path.

Expand Deployment in the left navigation and go to Options > Upload changed files automatically to the default server and set the behavior to adhere to the policies set forth by IT and the Site
          Administrator.

Cloudera recommends setting the behavior to Automatic upload
            because the data remains on the cluster while your changes get uploaded. 


Sync for the project file(s) to your machine and begin editing.
