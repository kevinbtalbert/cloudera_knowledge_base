(Optional) Using VS Code with Python
You can use VS Code with Python.
To take full advantage of VS Code Python tools, you must
      install the Python extension into the remote ssh session. You must install the extension the
      first time you connect a newly configured remote session. 

Install the Python extension.



With the Extension installed, once you open your first python file, you will be
          prompted to install pylint Linter.


Click Install.
VS Code opens a terminal and runs the code needed to install the linter. It's
          important to note that this is a remote terminal, running on an engine in Cloudera Machine Learning. It's the same as if you launched a terminal
          inside a running workbench.

If you want to run arbitrary Python code inside VS Code, open a Python file, select
          some code, right click, and select Run Selection/Line in Python
            Terminal. 
You can also just hit Shift-Enter in the code editor window. This will open up a new
          terminal if there isnâ€™t one and run the selected code. Since this is a remote session, you
          can run pyspark directly inside VS Code.

For more complex code requirements, you can also use the Python Debugging feature in
          VS Code.
