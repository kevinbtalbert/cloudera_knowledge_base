Upgraded CML deployments keep multiple Hadoop CLI addon versions that administrators can
   configure to maintain compatibility between CML and the Data Lake. 
CML packages the Spark versions that are included in Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE), and makes
   them available as Runtime Addons. In CML, users can select the Spark version they want to use for
   each workload. The compatibility between Spark and the Data Lake is shown in Cloudera Data Engineering
   and Data Lake compatibility.
