Release notes and fixed issues

Base Engine v11 - The default base engine is now version 11. The only change to
    the included libraries is the R interpreter, which is updated to version 3.6.2.
Python 2 checkbox disabled - Python 2 sessions are now disabled by default on
    new clusters, but can be re-enabled by admin users.
Load Balancer Source Ranges - When provisioning a Machine Learning workspace,
    in Advanced Settings, you can enter the CIDR range of IP
    addresses allowed to connect to the workspace. You must include the entire IP pool in the allowlist for
    your VPC to ensure that terminal sessions can connect to the workspace.
Updated Open Workbench button name - When launching a session, the
    Open Workbench button has been renamed to New
     Session.
Login error message - Fixed a bug where users might see the following error
    message upon login to a CML workspace: "Email already associated with an account."
