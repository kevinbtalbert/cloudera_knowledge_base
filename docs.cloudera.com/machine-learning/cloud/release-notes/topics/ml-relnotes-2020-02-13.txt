Release notes and fixed issues


Kerberos Authentication Improvements - Previously, users needed to manually
     authenticate themselves by entering their CDP FreeIPA credentials into their CML
     workspaces (on the Account settings > Hadoop Authentication page). This is no longer required. Users will now automatically
      receive the Kerberos credentials required for any CML workloads such as sessions,
      jobs, models, etc. Existing workspaces can be upgraded to take advantage of this
      improvement. Additionally, the Hadoop Authentication tab
       has been removed from the workspace UI. 
Workspace Monitoring Enabled - When you provision a Machine Learning workspace,
     Monitoring is enabled by default under Advanced Options.
