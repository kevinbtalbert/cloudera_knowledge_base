Release notes and fixed issues

Cloudera Machine Learning on Azure - Cloudera Machine Learning workspaces can
    now be created in environments hosted in Azure. See the documentation for information on
    Azure network planning, limitations, and setup.
Base Engine v11 - This release adds Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC) to the base
    engine (11-cml1.4-hwc-v1). Additionally, the base engine now has the ability to connect
    to DWX. No changes are made to the included library versions.
Navigation improvement - Cloudera Machine Learning users can click the nine-dot
    icon to navigate to the Cloudera Manager console.
Changing user names and addresses - In Cloudera Machine Learning instances
    where user authentication is performed through single sign-on (SSO), users cannot change
    their names and addresses in CML workspaces.
Jupyter enabled by default - Fixed an issue where Jupyter was not enabled by
    default in the default base engine.
