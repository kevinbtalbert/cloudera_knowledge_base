Release notes and fixed issues
New features

CML Test Drive - CML now includes guided interactive modules for setting up
    workspaces, running data science workflows, and getting models to production. These
    workflows are designed with real-world business use case prototypes.
Base Engine v12 - The default base engine is now version 12 (12-cml-2020.06-2).
    Key changes:

Python 3.6.10 (was 3.6.9)
R 3.6.3 (was 3.6.2)
CDPD 7.1.0 parts (Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Avro, Parquet)
Some bundled Python and R data science library upgrades (see Pre-installed
      Packages in Engines).

Bug fixes and improvements:

DSE-10250 - Fixed a bug that could cause an job or experiment to exit with status
      7 if used to run a very short script.
DSE-9872 - Fixed a bug that prevented users from using the `locate` command.
DSE-8601 - The Python launch_workers command now defaults the kernel argument
      match the kernel of the current session (previously it used "python3" in Python 2
      sessions).
Reduced the engine image size by approximately 400 MB




Fixed issues


DSE-11395 - Shared memory size configuration is now applied to sessions, jobs, and
     experiments.
DSE-11433 - Fixed an issue where files opened in the Workbench editor are deselected
     when a new session starts.
DSE-11421 - Fixed an issue where ML workspace provisioning can fail when a GPU
     instance that is not available in the AWS region is selected.
