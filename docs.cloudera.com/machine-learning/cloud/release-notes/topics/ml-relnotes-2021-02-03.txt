New features


Applied ML Prototypes - Applied ML Prototypes (AMPs) are now generally available
     inside the product, which provide end-to-end prototypes to help kickstart real customer
     use cases. AMPs effectively package pre-built models for data scientists to tailor for
     their own needs, as well as enable data scientists to learn how the different parts of CML
     work together.
Kubernetes Support - CML AWS now supports K8s 1.18, keeping up with updated EKS
     support.
NFS version picker - In Provision Workspace, the NFS version field was changed to
     a pick list with the default version set to 3. Make sure that this is the correct version
     to use, otherwise the workspace installation will fail.
