New features


CML Model DNS resolution - For CML on Azure and AWS, DataHub and CDE connectivity
     to CML services such as workspaces and model endpoints is now possible. This is supported
     by enabling internal DNS resolution for CML workspace endpoints and models on private IPs.
     However, any existing workspaces must be upgraded to the current release to obtain this
     functionality.
RAZ integration - CML now integrates with RAZ for S3.
Cdswctl support - ML Runtimes is now supported in
     cdswctl.
External engine repositories - Admins can now add basic Docker credentials for
     external engine repositories.
ML workspace provisioning - In case of validation errors, it is possible to skip
     preflight validation for ML workspace provisioning. See Provisioning ML Workspaces for more information.
Cloud permissions - CML now supports configuring AWS environment cross-account roles
     with fine-grained cloud permissions and policies for provisioning and running workspaces.
     See AWS restricted policies for more information.


Fixed issues


DSE-14481 - CML no longer needs Network Security group ports to be open for EFS
     on AWS (port 2049).
DSE-14685 - Clarified impact of changing Load Balancer Source Range settings on Security Group
     settings. See Provisioning ML Workspaces for details.
