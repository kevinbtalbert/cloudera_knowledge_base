Release notes and fixed issues.
June 24, 2021


Engine Deprecation - Cloudera ML Runtimes are the default and recommended
          solution to run user workloads. New projects will be created with ML Runtimes configured
          by default and we recommend migrating existing projects to use ML Runtimes. Legacy Engines
          are deprecated and will be removed in a future release but workloads running on them
          remain fully supported.
Register customized Runtime - Administrators can register an externally built
          Runtime to provide Data Scientists with a customized environment.
Support user API key rotation - Administrators can rotate keys for all users, or
          users can rotate their own keys, just by clicking on a button.
AMP specification for Runtimes - You can specify which Runtimes to use in
          AMPs.
New base engine released - Engine:14-cml2021.05-1 is now
          available.
Configurable engine image for Jobs - You can specify which engine to use for a
          Job. Jobs use the Project engine by default.
Web session timeouts - Timeout limits for User and Admin User web sessions were
          changed to be a period of inactivity, instead of a set time limit.


Fixed issues


Spark configuration (DSE-16422) - Fixed an issue where user-added Spark
          configurations in the ~/spark-defaults.conf file may not be populated
          to /etc/spark/conf/spark-defaults.conf correctly. 
Hive table (DSE-16108) - Fixed an issue where saving data to a managed Hive table
          using Hive Warehouse Connector via CDSW from CML may fail with a
            StreamCorruptedException.
API keys (DSE-15678) - Fixed an issue where user API keys may be accessible
          through non-private projects.
Web sessions (DSE-11394) - Fixed an issue where user web session may not be
          refreshed even when the user is actively using CML.
