Release notes and fixed issues
New Features / Improvements

Site Administration - The Project Creation Timeout (minutes)
     settings on the Site Administration > Settings page now applies to project creation via both git clone
     and fork. Consider increasing this value in case you need to create a
     large project. If you have tried forking projects before doing this and they get "stuck," the
     only way to delete these projects is to manually navigate to the <user>/<project-name>
     URL, and select Project Settings > Delete.
Load Balancer subnet - Support specifying subnets for the Load Balancer created by
     CML on AWS. The Workspace Provisioning page now has a field for specifying a subnet for the
     Load Balancer. See Provisioning a Workspace for more information.


Fixed Issues

Editor (DSE-11423) - Fixed an issue so that the editor, session, or workbench windows
     resize when the browser window resizes.
