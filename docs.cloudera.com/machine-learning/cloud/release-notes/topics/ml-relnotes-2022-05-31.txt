Release notes and fixed issues for version 2.0.30.
New Features / Improvements

ML Discovery and Exploration, SQL and Visualization (GA) - This feature enables Data
     Scientists to understand their data using a SQL editor and drag-and-drop Visual Dashboards
     within CML. Users can start with their pre-configured Data Connections and create Datasets that
     they can rely on for model development. For more information, see 
     ML Discovery and Exploration.
CML Endpoint Stability - This feature adds the ability for CML admin to define the
     prefix for the URL for the CML Workspace. This enables a new CML Workspace to be created and
     leverage the endpoint of a previously deleted CML Workspace. This ensures that deployed models
     and applications deployed in the new Workspace will have the same endpoint as the same models
     and applications deployed in the old Workspace. For more information, see CML Static Subdomain in  
     Provisioning ML Workspaces.

Add/Delete GPU Nodes - This feature enables MLAdmins to reconfigure CML Workspaces by
     adding or removing GPU Worker groups for existing deployments.
