Release notes and fixed issues for version 2.0.36.
New Features / Improvements

Custom Runtime Addons - This feature enables administrators to mount shared
          dependencies like connection drivers or configuration files to all CML workloads. You can
          start by following the documentation.
Cancellable CML Workspace Backup - Administrators now can cancel in-progress
          backups and resume the CML Workspace.
AWS Support - The AWS Jakarta and Hong Kong regions are now supported.
Kubernetes - EKS 1.23 (AWS) and AKS 1.24 (Azure) are now supported.


Fixed Issues

Applications (DSE-22857) - Fixed an issue where unauthenticated users could
          access the terminal session in a running public application if the application was
          configured to allow anonymous access to the terminal endpoint. Now anonymous access to the
          terminal endpoint is redirected to an authentication page.
Applications (DSE-24105) - Fixed an issue where the Application List page may not
          load correctly when there are a large amount of Applications accessible by the user.
