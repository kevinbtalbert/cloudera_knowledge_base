Release notes and fixed issues for version 2.0.36-H2.
Fixed Issues

Model Registry (DSE-25331) - Fixed an issue where users may see an error message
          x509: Certificate signed by unknown authority on the Model Registry
          page in the CML workspace application. Note that if you are seeing this error, or if you
          create a model registry after you create one or more CML workspaces in an environment, you
          must synchronize the model registry with the workspaces. See the Synchronizing the
            model registry with a workspace section of the Model Registry Tech Preview documentation for more
          details..
