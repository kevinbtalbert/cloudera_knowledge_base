Release notes and fixed issues for version 2.0.40-b157.
Fixed Issues

AWS : Non-Transparent Proxy Support
Fixed issues with supporting non-transparent proxy related to web pod connectivity to
            control plane, image-puller, pod to pod connectivity and api pods missing
            configuration.
Upgrades

Fixed an issue where workspace upgrade fails due to not deleting orphan pods.
Fixed an issue where workspace upgrade fails due to incorrect error handling.

Fixed an issue where the Team Sync tab was disabled. 
Azure
Added a preflight check when creating NTP clusters: Azure does not support NTP.
The NCv2 series is no longer supported due to its upcoming end of support on
              September 6, 2023. See TSB-692 for details. The default GPU for
              creating Azure workspaces will now be the Standard_NC6s_v3. This
              new GPU offers nearly identical configurations to the previous default GPU. If you are
              currently using NCv2 series GPUs, it is recommended to make the necessary adjustments
              before the end of support date.
