AWS IAM restricted roles and policies for compute and CML
AWS IAM write permissions are used by the CML compute infrastructure to create and
  delete roles and instance profiles.
Some customers may not be willing to provide IAM write permissions in the roleâ€™s policy.
   Instead, customers can set up static pre-created roles and instance profiles defined and used by
   the CML compute infrastructure to provision clusters.
note
The compute infrastructure is only able to use the pre-created roles and instance profile if
          the entitlement LIFTIE_USE_PRECREATED_IAM_RESOURCES is set for the tenant
          in use.
The pre-created roles and instance profiles should continue to exist for the lifetime of the
     cluster.

The two main tasks are:

Create roles and an instance profile.
Create restricted IAM policies for use by the compute infrastructure.

After these two tasks are completed, you can create the cross-account credential, if
      needed.
See the following topics for the procedures for creating the roles and policies.

Create IAM roles and instance profile pairThis step describes the roles and instance profiles that you create and attach to EKS   master and worker instances at runtime. This step is needed in customer environments where write   permissions are not provided to CML. The roles created here are used exclusively within the   customer's account.Create role and policy used to deploy CDP environments for CMLThe CML control plane requires a role and policies to create CDP environments. In this   step, you create a common policy for creating environments, as well as a policy that is specific   to CML environments.
