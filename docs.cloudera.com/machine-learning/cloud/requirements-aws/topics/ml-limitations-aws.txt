Limitations on AWS
This section lists some resource limits that CML and AWS impose
      on workloads running in ML workspaces. 


Certificate creation (for TLS) uses LetsEncrypt which is limited to 2000
            certs/week. As such a single tenant in CDP can create a maximum of 2000 ML workspaces
            per week.


CML imposes a limit (50) on the number of pods a user can create at
            any point within a specific workspace. This limit is not
            configurable. 


CML allows you to provision a maximum of 30 compute nodes per ML
            workspace. This does not include any additional infrastructure nodes
            CML might need to provision to run the service. 


Amazon EKS imposes a limit on the number of pods you can run
            simultaneously on a node. This limit varies depending on your
            instance type. For details, see ENI Max Pods.

CML creates one Amazon Elastic File System per workspace. The number of Elastic File
        Systems in a region is limited to 1000 per account. Therefore, the number of CML workspaces
        in a region is limited to 1000 at any given time for a given account.
