Azure Environment Setup for ML Workspaces
After an Azure environment has been created, there are several setup steps to prepare
    the environment for ML Workspaces. These steps are required when using Azure Files NFS or Azure
    NetApp Files, which are the recommended NFS services.
First, ensure that the Azure environment has been created. Instructions to do this can be found here:

Working with Azure environments
Azure subscription requirements

The following steps must be performed by an Azure administrator to prepare the environment
      for use with an ML workspace.

Create subnetsWithin a virtual network, you need to create one or more subnets for workspaces. CML         workspaces cannot share subnets, so if you are planning to create multiple CML workspaces         you will need to create one subnet for each workspace. In addition, if you plan to use Azure         NetApp Files for NFS, one dedicated subnet must be created and delegated to Azure NetApp         Files.Create Azure Files Storage Account and File ShareAzure Files NFS v4.1 is a managed, POSIX compliant NFS service on Azure. The file         share is used to store files for the CML infrastructure and ML workspaces. This is the         recommended NFS service for use with CML.Create Azure NetApp Files Account, Capacity Pool and VolumeAzure NetApp Files is a service on Azure that provides a fully managed, native file         share system that is accesible in the Azure cloud. The following procedure is only required         if you are using Azure NetApp Files, which is not the recommended NFS service. For more         information, see Quickstart: Set up Azure NetApp Files. Other NFS OptionsSet up minimum permissionsThe minimum permissions for Cloudera Machine Learning on Azure govern access control         between the ML workspace, Azure resources, and the Azure storage account.
