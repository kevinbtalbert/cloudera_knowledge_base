Create subnets
Within a virtual network, you need to create one or more subnets for workspaces. CML
        workspaces cannot share subnets, so if you are planning to create multiple CML workspaces
        you will need to create one subnet for each workspace. In addition, if you plan to use Azure
        NetApp Files for NFS, one dedicated subnet must be created and delegated to Azure NetApp
        Files.

 Open the Virtual Network for your environment.

Click the Subnets in the left-hand navigation and then
                        +Subnet.

Enter the name of the subnet, for example ‘Workspace-1’.

Enter the IP address range as a CIDR address. A /25 network should be
                    sufficient.

Create a subnet for each workspace you plan to provision. 

Create a subnet named ‘netapp’. Only one subnet needs to be delegated to
                    'netapp'. The ‘netapp’ subnet is used for Cloudera Machine Learning
                    infrastructure purposes only, and cannot be used for a workspace. Make sure that
                    the CIDR ranges specified do not overlap.
noteThis step is only needed if Azure NetApp Files is used.

In the ‘netapp’ subnet Info page, under
                        Subnet delegation, select
                        Microsoft.Netapp/volumes. 
noteThis step is only needed if Azure NetApp Files is used.

Click Save.

Create a subnet with the CLI
You can use the CLI to create subnets, as shown in this example.

 
az network vnet subnet create \ 
--resource-group my-cdp-resource-group \ 
--vnet-name my-cdp-vnet \ 
--name my-cml-subnet-1 \ 
--address-prefix 10.0.10.0/25 \ 
--service-endpoints Microsoft.Sql 
                
This example creates a subnet for the NetApp Files volume:
noteThis is only required if Azure NetApp Files is used.
 
az network vnet subnet create \ 
--resource-group my-cdp-resource-group \ 
--vnet-name my-cdp-vnet \ 
--name my-anf-subnet \ 
--address-prefix 10.0.10.0/25 \ 
--delegations Microsoft.NetApp/volumes 
                
The --delegations and --service-endpoints flags can also be
                    applied to an existing subnet by using the az network vnet subnet update
                    command.
