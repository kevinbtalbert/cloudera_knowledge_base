Create Azure NetApp Files Account, Capacity Pool and Volume
Azure NetApp Files is a service on Azure that provides a fully managed, native file
        share system that is accesible in the Azure cloud. The following procedure is only required
        if you are using Azure NetApp Files, which is not the recommended NFS service. For more
        information, see Quickstart: Set up Azure NetApp Files. 

In Azure Services, select Azure NetApp
                        Files.

In the New NetApp account, create an account.

Select the existing Resource Group.

In Location, select the region where the CML environment
                    is located.

Provision the service. When deployment is done, click Go to
                        Resource

Under Storage Service → Capacity Pools, click
                        Add pool.

For Capacity, enter 4 TiB.
4 TiB is the minimum size for a capacity pool in Azure NetApp Files. We
                    recommend a Service level of Premium or higher to ensure adequate I/O
                    performance.

Click Create.
In the next steps, create a Volume.

Create a Volume
In the Azure portal, you create an Azure NetApp Files volume to provide a file
            system within the Capacity Pool.

In the NetApp account screen, click Volumes in the
                        menu on the left, the click Add Volume.

For Quota, set a value in GB. You can set an initial
                        value, then increase it to add additional workspaces, without having to
                        resize the pool itself. We recommend an initial volume capacity of at least
                        100GB in order to ensure adequate I/O performance.

Confirm the value in the Delegated Subnet: the only
                        option should be the ‘netapp’ subnet, because that is the one that was
                        delegated to this service. 

On the Protocol tab, choose the protocol version.
                        Version 3 is supported by CML. Ensure that “Root Access” in the “Export
                        policy” section is set to “On”, and “Access” is set to “Read &
                        Write”.

On the Review and Create tab, click
                            Create. The volume is deployed after several
                        minutes.

After the volume is deployed, obtain the Mount
                        path.

Create a Linux VM in the subnet in which the CML workspace will be created,
                        and verify that the NFS volume can be mounted successfully in the VM. This
                        step ensures that there are no connectivity issues between the NFS server
                        and hosts running in the subnet.

Create a sub-directory to be used for the CML workspace project files. For
                        example, if the NFS export path is
                            10.102.47.132:/netapp-vol and is mounted as
                            /mnt/netapp-vol, run sudo mkdir
                            /mnt/netapp-vol/ml-workspace-1; sudo chown 8536:8536
                            /mnt/netapp-vol/ml-workspace-1 to ensure the directory is owned
                        by the cdsw user ID and group ID.

When prompted for the NFS path in the CML control plane, enter the path as
                            10.102.47.132:/netapp-vol/ml-workspace-1.

The Linux VM created above can be deleted if there are no issues with
                        mounting the NFS share.
