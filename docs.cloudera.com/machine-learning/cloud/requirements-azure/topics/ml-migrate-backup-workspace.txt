Backing up workspace
The Azure Back-Up Workspace feature is under entitlement. To enable Back Up Workspace
        for Azure, you must use the entitlement ML_ENABLE_BACKUP_RESTORE. If you have the
        entitlement, the “Backup Catalog” is visible in the UI. Contact your account manager if you
        don’t have the required entitlement.

Azure Back-Up has the following prerequisites: 
You must have an Azure resource group “cml-snapshots-<azure region>”
                        preconfigured. Otherwise, the backup operation will throw preflight
                        validation errors. For example, if your ML workspace is in the ‘westus2’
                        region, the resource group should be named “cml-snapshots-westus2”. 



To create a backup of the Azure workspace, enter the following commands:
$  cdpcp-account-helper % cdp ml backup-workspace --workspace-crn 
                    crn:cdp:ml:us-west-1:9d74eee4-1cad-45d7-b645-7ccf9edbb73d:workspace:8d7ea6ba-718e-45e9-9532-767f8ef0b4a4 
                    --backup-name azure-test-backup --profile dev

Be sure to note the backup CRN that CDPCLI returns:
{
    "backupCrn": "crn:cdp:ml:us-west-1:9d74eee4-1cad-45d7-b645-7ccf9edbb73d:workspace_backup:bfc57661-0eb6-4a59-bcb9-ef793740558a"
}


Wait for the backup to be in a ready state, before proceeding further


Bring up the original number of replicas (for example, 3) in order to make the original workspace functional.
                
kubectl scale deployment/web -n mlx --replicas=3

At this point, you have the corresponding Azure disks and NFS backed up to be restored into a new workspace.
