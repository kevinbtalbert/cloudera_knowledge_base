Set up minimum permissions
The minimum permissions for Cloudera Machine Learning on Azure govern access control
        between the ML workspace, Azure resources, and the Azure storage account. 

To set up the minimum permissions, you first create a custom role that contains those
                permissions, and then assign that role to a credential, called an app registration,
                in your Azure subscription. 


Create the custom role.

The following code example creates a custom role for CML and assigns the
                        minimum permissions needed. The permissions are listed in the
                            actions section, so that CML can access resources and
                        operate correctly. 
You need to substitute the following values: 
[YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID]: Your subscription ID in
                                use.
[YOUR-RESTRICTED-ROLE-NAME]: The custom role name
                                which is assigned to the application.
[YOUR-SINGLE-RESOURCE-GROUP]: The original resource
                                group name.
