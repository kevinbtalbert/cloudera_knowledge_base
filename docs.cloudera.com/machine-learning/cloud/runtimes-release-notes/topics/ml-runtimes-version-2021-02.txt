ML Runtimes Version 2021.02
Major features and updates for ML Runtimes.
Version 2021.02
New features


Nvidia GPU support - Runtimes supporting Nvidia GPUs are available with
          preinstalled CUDA software for both Workbench and JupyterLab editors. (See ML
            Runtimes Nvidia GPU Edition.)
Runtimes supporting R 3.6 and R 4.0 available for Workbench editor
noteUser R libraries are installed in /home/cdsw/.local/lib/R rather
              than /home/cdsw/R, which is where they were installed in engine:13.
              This change was made to support simultaneous use of R 3.6 and R 4.0. Because of this
              change you will need to reinstall user R packages when migrating an existing project
              from engine:13 to MLRuntimes 2021.02, or from R 3.6 to R 4.0Cloudera bug:
                  DSE-3686

Support for JupyterLab runtimes - The JupyterLab runtimes now use JupyterLab 3.0
          (was 2.2) and are considered generally available using Standard Edition ML Runtimes. See
            JupyterLab blog for notes on this upgrade.
Python runtimes include a C++ compiler - Python runtimes now include a C++
          compiler (g++), which enables the installation and use of certain Python libraries such as
          impyla and pystan.Cloudera bug: DSE-14492
Preinstalled Python libraries (See ML Runtimes 2021.02) are now installed
          in /usr/local/lib rather than /var/lib/cdsw, which is
          where they were installed in engine:13 and runtimes 2020.11 (DSE-12177). This means that
          you can upgrade these packages more easily, but there are some packages you should not
          upgrade. (See Upgrading R and Python Packages)
ML runtimes are supported on CDSW (version 1.9.0 or higher). 


Fixed issues


DSE-13743 - Idle JupyterLab sessions are now ended after around 
            IDLE_MAXIMUM_MINUTES. (See ML Runtimes Environment Variables Environment
            Variables).noteThese sessions may run for an additional 5 minutes after
               IDLE_MAXIMUM_MINUTES. (DSE-13743)
DSE-14979 - matplotlib figures restore the styling used in engine:13 (MLRuntimes
          2020.11 used the matplotlib defaults)
DSE-12881 - For Python runtimes, py4j is now installed.
Security fixes, python library version updates
