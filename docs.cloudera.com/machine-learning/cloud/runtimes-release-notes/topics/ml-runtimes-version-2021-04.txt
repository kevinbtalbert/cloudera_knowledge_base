Major features and updates for ML Runtimes.
Version 2021.04
New features


RAPIDS Runtimes - The RAPIDS Edition Runtimes are built on top of community built
          RAPIDS docker images. The RAPIDS suite of software libraries relies on NVIDIA CUDA
          primitives for low-level compute optimization, but exposes that GPU parallelism and
          high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly Python interfaces.


Fixed issues
The following fixed issus relate only to RAPIDS Runtimes.


DSE-13743 - Idle JupyterLab sessions are now ended after around 
            IDLE_MAXIMUM_MINUTES. (See ML Runtimes Environment Variables Environment
            Variables).noteThese sessions may run for an additional 5 minutes after
               IDLE_MAXIMUM_MINUTES. (DSE-13743)

          2020.11 used the matplotlib defaults)
