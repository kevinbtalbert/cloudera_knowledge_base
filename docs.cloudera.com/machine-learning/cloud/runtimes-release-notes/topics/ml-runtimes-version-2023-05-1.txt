ML Runtimes Version 2023.05.1
Major features and updates for ML Runtimes.

This release is available with ML Runtimes version 2023.05.1.
noteNew ML Runtime releases are automatically added
        to the deployment, if internet connection is available.
New features


This release of ML Runtimes includes the following features that improve support for
            Large Language (LLMs) within CML:
Git Large File Storage (LFS) support is now included in all ML Runtimes images.
                Users can now easily download Large Language models via Git. LFS replaces large
                  files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers
                  inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or
                  GitHub Enterprise.
Upgraded CUDA to version 11.8.0 in JupyterLab Python CUDA runtimes. This change
                allows customers to use the latest pytorch version in CML. Affected Python versions
                are 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.
NVIDIA GPU versions of PBJ Runtimes are now available for Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and
                3.10. The base image used for CUDA ML Runtimes are the “devel” series CUDA image
                provided by NVIDIA. This change, for example, enables the usage of the Numba JIT
                compiler. This change also supports the latest version of tensorflow in CML and
                  some other libraries that need to compile GPU code in run-time.
wget is now installed on all ML Runtimes. This enables users another way to
                download large language models in CML in addition to git-lfs.

This release introduces a new Technical Preview Runtime, adding support for Anaconda,
            based on the JupyterLab editor. Conda environments can be created, modified, and
            activated from the Terminal without any limitations. For more information, see Using Conda Runtimes.
New Python 3.10 Runtimes are available.
Added the following extensions to our JupyterLab Runtimes (Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10):
            Language Server Protocol (jupyterlab-lsp) and git (jupyterlab-git). Language Server
            Protocol integration provides coding assistance for JupyterLab (code navigation, hover
            suggestions, linters, autocompletion, rename).
Added the git (jupyterlab-git) extension to our JupyterLab Runtimes (Python 3.7).
The Workbench Runtimes is being deprecated in favor of PBJ. As a result, the CUDA
            version for the Workbench Runtimes is not updated for the current release. 
Implya client is now updated to version 0.18.0 which has support for authentication
            via JWT token.


Version 2023.05.1
Fixed Issues

DSE-26724 wget is now installed on all ML Runtimes. This enables users to
          download large language models in CML two ways: via Gi and via wget. 
DSE-25078 The OS package cmake is now installed for all ML
          Runtime images. This change enables users to install packages like
          nloptr.
DSE-23762 Updated installed R package versions to make sparklyr R package usable
          in the same session as it was installed in.
DSE-23751 Upgraded Jupyter to version 3.6.0 in all JupyterLab Runtimes. 
DSE-23613 Upgraded CUDA to version 11.8.0 in JupyterLab Python CUDA runtimes.
          This change was needed to allow customers to use the latest pytorch version in CML.
          Affected Python versions are 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.
DSE-22425 Added OS packages to R Runtimes to support recent versions of the
          "devtools" package.
DSE-20234 Jupyter session-specific data is no longer persisted in the Project
          directory. This prevents errors when starting multiple Jupyter sessions.
