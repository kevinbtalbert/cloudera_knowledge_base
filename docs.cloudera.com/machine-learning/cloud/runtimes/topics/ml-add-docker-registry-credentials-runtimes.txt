Add Docker registry credentials
To enable Cloudera Machine Learning to fetch custom engines from a
  secure repository, as Administrator you need to add Docker registry credentials.
Create a kubectl secret named regcred for your secured
   Docker registry. The following command creates the secret in your Kubernetes cluster:
   kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred 
    --docker-server=<server host> 
    --docker-username=<username> 
    --docker-password=<password> 
    -n <compute namespace eg. mlx>
The next time the engine image is pulled, the new secret will be picked up.
For further information, see Custom certificate authority (CA) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
