Limitations
This topic lists some limitations associated with customized ML Runtime images. 



The contents of certain pre-existing standard directories such as
              /home/cdsw, /tmp, and so on,
            cannot be modified while creating customized non-PBJ ML Runtimes. This means any files saved in
            these directories will not be accessible from sessions that are running on customized ML
            Runtimes.
Workaround: Create a new custom directory in the Dockerfile used to create the
            customized ML Runtime, and save your files to that directory.


For PBJ Runtimes, note the following limitations:

PBJ Runtimes work as models only with R and Python kernels.
