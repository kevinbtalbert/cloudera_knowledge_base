Distribute the Image
This topic explains the different methods that can be used to distribute a custom ML
      Runtime to all the hosts.Once you have built a new custom
            ML Runtime, use one of the following methods to distribute the new image to all your Cloudera Machine Learning hosts:
Push the image to a public registry such as DockerHub

For instructions, refer to the Docker documentation docker push
                        and Push images to Docker Cloud.

Push the image to your company's Docker registry

When using this method, make sure to tag your image with the following
                        schema:
docker tag <image-name> <company-registry>/<user-name>/<image-name>:<tag>
Once the image has been tagged properly, use the following command to push
                        the image:
docker push <company-registry>/<user-name>/<image-name>:<tag>
