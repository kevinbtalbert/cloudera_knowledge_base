This topic addresses customizing a third-party editor to work with ML
                Runtimes.For a third-party editor to work with ML Runtimes, you must provide a starting script. For
                                example:
#! /bin/bash
"$ZEPPELIN_HOME/bin/zeppelin.sh"
For Cloudera Machine Learning to interpret this as an
                                editor startup script, you must create a symlink to the editor
                                        as/usr/local/bin/ml-runtime-editor.
                                This will be created in the Dockerfile of the customized
                                runtime.

noteThird-party editors provide a way to run
                                        arbitrary code that is not distributed by Cloudera. Use
                                        third-party editors at your own risk. You should absolutely
                                        trust the code that you want to run.
