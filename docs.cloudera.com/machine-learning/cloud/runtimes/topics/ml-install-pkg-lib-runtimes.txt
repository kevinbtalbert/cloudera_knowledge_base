Installing Additional ML Runtimes Packages
Cloudera Machine Learning Runtimes are preloaded with a few common packages and
    libraries for Python. However, a key feature of Cloudera Machine Learning is the ability of different projects to install and
    use libraries pinned to specific versions, just as you would on your local computer.
Before downloading or using third-party content, you are
      responsible for reviewing and complying with any applicable license terms and  making sure
      that they are acceptable for your use case.

 Generally, Cloudera recommends you install all required packages
        locally into your project. This will ensure you have the exact versions you want and that
        these libraries will not be upgraded when Cloudera upgrades the ML Runtimes image. You only
        need to install libraries and packages once per project. From then on, they are available to
        any new ML Runtimes you spawn throughout the lifetime of the project. 
You can install additional libraries and packages from the workbench, using either the
        command prompt or the terminal.
        
note
Cloudera Machine Learning does not currently support installation of
          packages that require root access to the hosts. For such use-cases, you will need to
          create a new custom runtime that extends the base image with the required packages. For
          instructions, see Customized Runtimes.



(Python) Install Packages Using Workbench Command Prompt
To install a package from the command prompt:
Navigate to your project's Overview page. Click
              New Session and launch a session.
At the command prompt (see Native Workbench Console and Editor) in the bottom right,
            enter the command to install the package. Some examples using Python have
            been provided. 


Python 3

# Installing from console using ! shell operator and pip3:
!pip3 install beautifulsoup4

# Installing from terminal
pip3 install beautifulsoup4


(Python Only) Using a Requirements File
For a Python project, you can specify a list of the packages you want in a
          requirements.txt file that lives in your project. The packages can be
        installed all at once using pip/pip3. 


Create a new file called requirements.txt file within your
            project:beautifulsoup4==4.6.0
seaborn==0.7.1

To install the packages in a Python 3 ML Runtimes, run the following command in the
            workbench command prompt.
            !pip3 install -r requirements.txt
