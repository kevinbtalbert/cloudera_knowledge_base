Metadata for Custom ML Runtimes
This topic addresses the metadata for custom Runtimes.

All new custom Runtimes must override the Edition metadata of existing
                                Runtimes. The rest of the metadata can be overriden to communicate
                                the expectations for the consumers of the image. Both the Docker
                                label and the environment variable match in a custom Runtime image.
                                In order to add or register a custom Runtime to a deployment, the
                                user facing metadata combination should be unique in that
                                deployment. For example, of the following, Editor, Edition, Kernel,
                                Version, and Maintenance Version, at least the later should be
                                incremented for adding a next iteration of the same image.
See the following reference table for more details on ML Runtime
                                metadata.
