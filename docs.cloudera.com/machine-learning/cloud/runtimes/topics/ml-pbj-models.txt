Example models with PBJ Runtimes
The library cml includes the package, models_v1. This
  package includes the cml_model decorator that can be used to allow a function to
  work as a model in a PBJ Runtime. It can also be used to enable gathering of model
  metrics.
The package has an optional boolean argument, called metrics, that when set to
    True, enables the model_metric decorator functionality from
   the deprecated cdsw lib. The default value of the metrics
   parameter is False. Therefore, this example does not have model metric gathering
   enabled, but the R example does. In both examples the function to be used for the model is called
    predict.
Python example
Example #1
import cml.models_v1 as models
    
@models.cml_model
def predict(args):
    return args["x"]*2
Example #2:
import cml.models_v1 as models
    
@models.cml_model(metrics=True)
def predict(args):
    return args["x"]*2

R example
Almost all of the functionality in the cdsw library for R has also been
    migrated to the cml library and is available automatically for every R Runtime
    workload. It includes a new function wrapper, called cml_model, to be used for
    model entry point functions in PBJ Runtimes. The function to be used for the model in this case
    is called predict.
library(cml)
    
predict <- cml_model(function(args) {
    return(args$x*2)
    })
