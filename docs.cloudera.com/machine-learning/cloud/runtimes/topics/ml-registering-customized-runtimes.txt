Adding New ML Runtimes

Cloudera Machine Learning enables you to add customized ML Runtimes from
      the Runtime Catalog window.

noteYou must have system administrator permission to add a new ML Runtime.


Click Runtime Catalog from the
                  Navigation panel. 

Click the Add Runtime button in the upper right
               corner.

In the Add Runtime window, enter the url of the Runtime
               Docker image you want to upload.
As ML Runtimes are identified based on certain attributes, metadata (such as
               Editor, Kernel, Edition, Version, and Maintenance Version) must be unique to add new
               Customized Runtimes to a deployment. Customized ML Runtimes must have different
               Edition text compared to Cloudera supported versions.

Click Validate.
CML will use the provided URL to fetch the Docker image and validate if it can be
               used as a customized Runtime.
If the Docker image is successfully validated, CML will display the metadata
               information of the image. The new customized Runtime will be visible in the Runtime
               Catalog and accessible over the different workloads.
