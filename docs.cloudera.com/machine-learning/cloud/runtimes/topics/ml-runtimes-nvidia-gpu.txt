ML Runtimes NVIDIA GPU Edition
The NVIDIA GPU Edition Runtimes are built on top of NVIDIA CUDA docker images. CUDA is
      a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing
      on graphical processing units (GPUs). With CUDA, developers can dramatically speed up
      computing applications by harnessing the power of GPUs. 
Cloudera Machine Learning supports GPUs using particular ML Runtime
         Editions. NVIDIA GPUs together with related specialized software can be utilized using the
         NVIDIA GPU Edition.
