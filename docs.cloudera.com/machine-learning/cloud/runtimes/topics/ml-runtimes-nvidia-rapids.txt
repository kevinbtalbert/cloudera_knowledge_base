ML Runtimes NVIDIA RAPIDS Edition
The RAPIDS Edition Runtimes are built on top of community built RAPIDS docker images.
      The RAPIDS suite of software libraries gives you the freedom to execute end-to-end data
      science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. It relies on NVIDIA CUDA primitives for
      low-level compute optimization, but exposes that GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth memory
      speed through user-friendly Python interfaces.

noteRAPIDS require NVIDIA Pascal or better GPUs. You need to use P3 or newer EC2
            instances on AWS to meet this requirement.

Visit rapids.ai for more
         information.

noteRAPIDS on Spark is not support as Spark3 is not supported on
            CDSW.

ML Runtimes RAPIDS edition differs from other Runtime Editions in the following ways:

Python maintenance versions differ from what is being used in the Standard and NVIDIA
            GPU edition runtimes. These Python kernels are coming from the RAPIDS base image.
Pre-installed Python packages and package versions differ from what’s in Standard and
            NVIDIA GPU edition runtimes.

RAPIDS Runtimes are an optional extension of the Cloudera ML Runtime distribution. The
         RAPIDS images are not distributed automatically. Administrators can register them in the
         Runtime Catalog. The following RAPIDS editions are available for the 2021.04 Runtime
         version:

RAPIDS Python environment
The RAPIDS python libraries are distributed and present as a conda environment in the
         docker image. While it’s possible to install additional libraries for your project via
         conda, these packages will be installed to a non-persistent part of the file system and
         won’t persist between sessions and jobs. 
Installing additional libraries via pip is supported and works the same way as in other
         Runtimes.

notethe RAPIDS images have the official Anaconda channels configured for conda, if you
            decide to use conda to install packages, make sure you are familiar with Anaconda’s
            license requirements.
