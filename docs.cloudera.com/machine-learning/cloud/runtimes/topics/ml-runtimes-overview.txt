Managing ML Runtimes
Provides overview, installation, set up, configuration, and customization information
  for Machine Learning Runtimes.
ML Runtimes are responsible for running the code written by users and intermediating access
   to the Data Hub. 
You can think of an ML Runtime as a virtual machine, customized to have all the necessary
   dependencies to access the computing cluster while keeping each projectâ€™s environment entirely
   isolated. To ensure that every ML Runtime has access to the parcels and client configuration
   managed by the Cloudera Manager Agent, a number of folders are mounted from the host into the
   container environment. 
ML Runtimes have been open sourced and are available in the cloudera/ml-runtimes GitHub repository. If you need to understand your Runtime
   environments fully or want to build a new Runtime from scratch,  you can access the Dockerfiles
   that were used to build the ML Runtime container images in this repository.

ML Runtimes versus Legacy EngineWhile Runtimes and the Legacy Engine are both container images that contain the Linux     OS, interpreter(s), and libraries, ML Runtimes keeps the images small and improves performance,     maintenance, and security.Using Runtime CatalogYou can use the Runtime catalog to list all runtimes that are available for your     deployment.Disabling RuntimesA key feature of Cloudera Machine Learning, Runtime       Catalog, is the ability to disable and enable one or more runtimes at once.
