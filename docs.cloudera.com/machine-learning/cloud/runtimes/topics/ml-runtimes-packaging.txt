Pre-Installed Packages in ML Runtimes
Cloudera Machine Learning ships with several base engine images that
    include Python kernels, and frequently used libraries.
noteNew ML Runtime releases are automatically added to the deployment, if
      internet connection is available.
Because the software and versions in these lists
      is installed in the images, you should not upgrade these versions because this will cause
      dependency conflicts. If any software in this list needs to be at a higher version, you should
      use a more recent version of the legacy engine or ML Runtime.
The Workbench Runtimes are being deprecated in favor of the PBJ Runtimes.
