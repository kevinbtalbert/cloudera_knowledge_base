Adding an SSH Key to GitHub
Cloudera Machine Learning creates a public SSH key for each account. You can add this
    SSH public key to your GitHub account if you want to use password-protected GitHub repositories
    to create new projects or collaborate on projects. Sign in to Cloudera Machine Learning.
Go to the upper right drop-down menu and switch context to the account whose key you
          want to add. This could be a individual user account or a team account.

On the left sidebar, click User Settings.

Go to the Outbound SSH tab and copy the User Public
            SSH Key.

Sign in to your GitHub account and add the Cloudera Machine Learning key copied in the
          previous step to your GitHub account. For instructions, refer the GitHub documentation on
            Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account.
