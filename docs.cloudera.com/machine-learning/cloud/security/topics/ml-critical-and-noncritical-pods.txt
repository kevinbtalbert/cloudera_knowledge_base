Critical and Non-critical Pods
The pods running various Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) services and jobs broadly fall
    into critical and non-critical types.
Critical pods are protected from preemption by autoscaling to avoid interrupting important
      services. Most of the pods running in the “infra” autoscaling group are critical. Pods that
      run user sessions, such as engine pods and Spark executor pods, are also considered critical,
      and are marked as not safe to evict. CML system services that are deployed as daemonsets (they
      run on all nodes in the cluster) are deemed important, but not critical. These pods are marked
      as “safe-to-evict” by autoscaling.
