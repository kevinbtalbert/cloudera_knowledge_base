Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Most modern browsers implement the Same-Origin Policy, which restricts how a
        document or a script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource
        from another origin. When the Enable cross-origin resource
          sharing property is enabled on Cloudera Machine Learning,
        web servers will include the Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
          * HTTP header in their HTTP responses. This gives web
        applications on different domains permission to access the Cloudera Machine Learning API through browsers.
This
      property is 
disabled by default
.
If this property is disabled, web applications from different domains
        will not be able to programmatically communicate with the Cloudera Machine Learning API through browsers.
