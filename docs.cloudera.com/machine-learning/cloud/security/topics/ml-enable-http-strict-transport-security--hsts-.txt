Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

noteWithout TLS/SSL enabled, configuring this property will have no effect on your
      browser.
When both
        TLS/SSL and this
      property (Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)) are
      enabled, Cloudera Machine Learning will inform your browser that it should never load the site
      using HTTP. Additionally, all attempts to access Cloudera Machine Learning using HTTP will
      automatically be converted to HTTPS.
This
      property is 
disabled by default
.
If you ever
      need to downgrade to back to HTTP, use the following sequence of steps: First, deactivate this
      checkbox to disable HSTS and restart Cloudera Machine Learning. Then, load the Cloudera
      Machine Learning web application in each browser to clear the respective browser's HSTS
      setting. Finally, disable TLS/SSL across the cluster. Following this sequence should help
      avoid a situation where users get locked out of their accounts due to browser caching.
