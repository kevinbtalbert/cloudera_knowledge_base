Configuring External Authentication with LDAP and SAML

importantCloudera recommends you leverage Single Sign-On for
      users via the CDP Management Console. For instructions on how to configure
      this, see Configuring User Access to CML. If
      you cannot do this, we recommend contacting Cloudera Support before
      attempting to use the LDAP or SAML instructions provided in this section. 
Cloudera Machine Learning supports user authentication against its internal
      local database, and against external services such as Active Directory, OpenLDAP-compatible
      directory services, and SAML 2.0 Identity Providers. By default, Cloudera Machine Learning
      performs user authentication against its internal local database. This topic describes the
      signup process for the first user, how to configure authentication using LDAP, Active
      Directory or SAML 2.0, and an optional workaround that allows site administrators to bypass
      external authentication by logging in using the local database in case of
      misconfiguration.
