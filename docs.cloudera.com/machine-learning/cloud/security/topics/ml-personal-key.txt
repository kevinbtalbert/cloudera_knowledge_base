Personal Key
Cloudera Machine Learning automatically generates an SSH
      key pair for
    your user account. You can rotate the key pair and view your public key on
    your user settings page. It is not possible for anyone to view your private
    key. 
Every console you run has your account's private key loaded into its SSH-agent. Your consoles can use the private
        key to authenticate to external services, such as GitHub. For
        instructions, see #add_key_to_github.
