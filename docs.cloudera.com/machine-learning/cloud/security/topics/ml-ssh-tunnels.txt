Creating an SSH Tunnel
 You can use your SSH key to connect Cloudera Machine Learning
    to an external database or cluster by creating an SSH tunnel.

In some environments, external databases and data
        sources reside behind restrictive firewalls. A common pattern is to
        provide access to these services using a bastion host with only the SSH
        port open. Cloudera Machine Learning provides a convenient way to
        connect to such resources using an SSH tunnel.
If you create an SSH tunnel
        to an external server in one of your projects, then all engines that you
        run in that project are able to connect securely to a port on that
        server by connecting to a local port. The encrypted tunnel is completely
        transparent to the user and code.
Open the Project Settings
        page.Open the Tunnels tab.Click New Tunnel. Enter the server IP Address or DNS hostname.Enter your username on the server.Enter the local port that should be proxied, and
        to which remote port on the server.
On the remote server, configure SSH to
      accept password-less logins using your individual or team SSH key. Often,
      you can do so by appending the SSH key to the file /home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys.
