Installing a non-transparent proxy in a CML environment
If Cloudera Machine Learning is used in an air-gapped environment, a proxy configuration
  is not mandatory. If a non-transparent proxy is used, then certain endpoints must be added to the
  allowed list for the proxy.
If your CDP Private Cloud deployment uses a non-transparent network proxy, configure proxy
   hosts that the workloads can use for connections with CML workspaces. You can configure the proxy
   configuration values from the Management Console.
noteThe settings configured using this procedure reflect in newly provisioned CML workspaces in
   a CDP Private Cloud Experiences deployment using the Experiences Compute Service (ECS). In an
   OpenShift deployment, the default values are used. 

Sign in to the CDP console.
Click Management Console.
On the Management Console home page, select Administration > Networks to view the Networks page.
Configure the following options for the proxy values: 
Field
Description

HTTPS Proxy
The HTTP or HTTPS proxy connection string for use in connections with CML workspaces.
       You must specify this connection string in the form:
        http(s)://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>. noteThe
         <username> and <password> parameters are optional.
        You can specify the connection proxy string without these parameters.

HTTP Proxy
The HTTP or HTTPS proxy connection string for use in connections with CML workspaces.
       You must specify this connection string in the form:
        http(s)://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>. noteThe
         <username> and <password> parameters are optional.
        You can specify the connection proxy string without these parameters.

No Proxy

Comma-separated list of hostnames, IP addresses, or hostnames and IP addresses that should
        not be accessed through the specified HTTPS or HTTP proxy URLs.
In case of ECS deployments, you must include no-proxy URLs for the following:

All the ECS hosts in your deployment 
Any CDP Private Cloud Base cluster that you want to access 
CIDR IP addresses for internal operations in the ECS cluster: 10.42.0.0/16 and
         10.43.0.0/16
