Ports used by Cloudera Machine Learning
Certain ports must be accessible through the firewall for proper operation of Coudera
  Machine Learning.
Firewall restrictions must be disabled across Cloudera Machine Learning and CDP cluster hosts.
   Internally, the Cloudera Machine Learning master and worker hosts require full connectivity with
   no firewalls. Externally, end users connect to Cloudera Machine Learning exclusively through a
   web server running on the master host, and therefore do not need direct access to any other
   internal Cloudera Machine Learning or CDP services.





Communication with the CDP cluster
Cloudera Machine Learning -> CDPAs a gateway service, Cloudera Machine Learning
       must have access to all the ports used by CDP and Cloudera Manager.

Communication with the Web Browser
The Cloudera Machine Learning web application is available at port 80. HTTPS access is
      available over port 443.
