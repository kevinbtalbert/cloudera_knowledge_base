Cloudera Machine Learning Email Notifications
Cloudera Machine Learning allows you to send email notifications
    when you add collaborators to a project, share a project with a colleague,
    and for job status updates (email recipients are configured per-job). This
    topic shows you how to specify email address for such outbound
    communications.
Note that email notifications are not currently enabled by default.
      Emails are not sent when you create a new project. Email preferences
      cannot currently be configured at an individual user level.
Option 1: If your existing corporate SMTP server is accessible
      from the VPC where your ML workspace is running, you can continue to use
      that server. Go to the
          Admin > Settings
      tab to specify an email address for outbound invitations and job
      notifications.
Option 2: If your existing SMTP solution cannot be used, consider
      using an email service provided by your cloud provider service. For
      example, Amazon provides Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES).
