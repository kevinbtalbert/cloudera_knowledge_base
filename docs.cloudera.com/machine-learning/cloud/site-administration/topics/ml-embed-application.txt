Embed a CML application in an external website
You can embed a CML application into an I-frame on a web page. You need to specify the
   frame-ancestor attribute, otherwise the browser security policy will prevent the
  application from rendering in the page. 
The frame-ancestor attribute prevents "Clickjacking" attacks by specifying which domains are
   allowed to provide embedded content to your site. To enable a domain to embed a CML application,
   set the environmental variable CDSW_FRAME_ANCESTORS to cointain one or more
   websites as follows:

The name of the embedding website, specified in host-source form.
You can specify multiple websites as a comma-separated list.

You can set the environmental value in Project Settings > Advanced.

For more information on host-source form, see: CSP: frame-ancestors.
