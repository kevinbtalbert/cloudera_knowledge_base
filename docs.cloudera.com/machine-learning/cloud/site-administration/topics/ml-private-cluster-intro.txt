Private cluster support
Each type of network architecture supported by CDP has a unique set of tradeoffs among
  ease of setup, security, workloads (Experiences) supported, and so on.
Private Clusters provide a simple way to create a secure cluster, where the API server and the
   workloads themselves only rely on private IP addresses that are not accessible from the internet.
   Connectivity to the cluster from the CDP control plane is provided by the Cluster Connectivity
   Manager v2 (CCM v2). CCMv2 uses an agent running in the cluster, and an inverting proxy running
   on CDP, which creates a HTTPS tunnel between the workload and the control plane.notePrivate clusters are Generally Available (GA) on AWS, but are in Preview
    on Azure, and require an entitlement. 

Enable a private clusterTo enable a private cluster, select the option when provisioning the         workspace.User Defined Routing (UDR)With the Fully Private Cluster configuration, Azure still creates some public IP resources to         support load balancer egress. If necessary, you can avoid creating public IP addresses in the         CML cluster by using a User Defined Routing (UDR) table. A UDR table can be configured in the         cluster subnet to route packets to a customer-configured firewall, for example to limit internet         access or analyze traffic. For more information on setting up UDR, see the Microsoft articles         Virtual appliance scenario or Virtual network traffic routing.
