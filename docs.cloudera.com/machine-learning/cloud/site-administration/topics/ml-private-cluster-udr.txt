User Defined Routing (UDR)
With the Fully Private Cluster configuration, Azure still creates some public IP resources to
        support load balancer egress. If necessary, you can avoid creating public IP addresses in the
        CML cluster by using a User Defined Routing (UDR) table. A UDR table can be configured in the
        cluster subnet to route packets to a customer-configured firewall, for example to limit internet
        access or analyze traffic. For more information on setting up UDR, see the Microsoft articles
        Virtual appliance scenario or Virtual network traffic routing.

To utilize a UDR and firewall in the Azure CML private cluster, select the following when setting
                up the cluster.


Select a subnet with a default route configuration to forward the traffic to the network
                    appliance or firewall.






Create load balancers with private IP addresses. This is the default choice when creating
                    clusters in CML.






Select Enable User Defined Routing.
