Web session timeouts
You can set web sessions to time out and require the user to log in again. This time
  limit is not based on activity, it is the maximum time allowed for a web session.
You can set timeout limits for Users and Admin Users in Site Administration > Security.

User Web Browser Timeout (minutes) - This timeout sets the default
          maximum length of time that a web browser session can remain inactive. You remain logged
          in if you are actively using the session. If you are not active, then after a 5-minute
          warning, you are automatically logged out. Any changes to the setting take effect for any
          subsequent user logins.
Admin User Web Browser Timeout (minutes) - This timeout sets the
          default maximum length of time that a web browser session for an Admin user can remain
          inactive. You remain logged in if you are actively using the session. If you are not
          active, then after a 5-minute warning, you are automatically logged out. Any changes to
          the setting take effect for any subsequent Admin user logins.
