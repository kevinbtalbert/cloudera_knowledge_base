There are some questions we often hear from customers as they get started on using CML
  in their work. We have listed several below, with links to the specific guidance you need, to give
  you a quick boost.

How do I bring CDP data into CML using data connections?
CML offers a variety of ways to connect to data in a CDP environment, such as connecting to
     Hive, Impala, or Spark data sources, or to a CDP Data Hub. These are detailed in
      Exploratory Data Science and Visualization.


How do I deploy a web-based application with CML?
CML makes it easy to create web-based applications, such as dashboards, to display the
     results of your data science work to business users or other consumers. This is explained in
      Analytical Applications.


How can I monitor a model running in production?
You can easily monitor active models in your workspace. For more information, see
      Monitoring Active Models Across the Workspace.
