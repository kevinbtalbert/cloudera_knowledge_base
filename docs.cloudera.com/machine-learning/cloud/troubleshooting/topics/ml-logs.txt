Logs for ML Workspaces
You can access logs to troubleshoot issues with the CML service and your workloads on
    ML workspaces. 
Access to logs
When you create a CDP environment, you specify an S3 bucket (on AWS) or an Azure Storage
      container (on Azure) in that environment for storing logs. If you have access to the log
      storage, you can use the AWS or Azure console to access certain CML and Spark logs directly.
      You can get the details of the specific bucket or container from the Summary
       page for the environment. 
noteIf you file a support case, Cloudera Support will not automatically have access to these
      logs because they live in your environment.
ML Workspace access to logs
CML workspace users also have access to these logs depending on their authorization level: 

Site AdministratorsSite administrators can download the same logs directly from
          their workspace Site Admin panel (Admin >  Support). For more details, see Downloading Diagnostic Bundles for a Workspace.
Data ScientistsWhile data scientists don't have access to the full set of
          workspace logs, they do have access to engine logs for their own workloads
          (sessions/jobs/experiments). While in an interactive session or on a job/experiment's
          Overview page, click Download Logs at any time to review the full
          set of logs for that workload's engine. In the case of Spark workloads, Spark executor and
          event logs are also downloaded as part of this bundle.
