Instance type preflight check fails
On AWS, in a given region, the corresponding Availability Zones do not always support
  the same instance types. The instance type preflight check will fail if the desired instance type
  is not supported in all AZs in the region.
If the preflight check fails, check all failed AZs for the supported instance types using this
   command:
aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings --location-type availability-zone --filters Name=location,Values=<az> 
   --query "InstanceTypeOfferings[].InstanceType" --region <region>
Remediation:
It is possible, but not guaranteed, that skipping the validation will result in successful
   provisioning of a CML workspace. AWS selects the AZ for creating an instance group based on the
   VPC and Subnet configuration of the customerâ€™s datalake; the user cannot choose the AZ.
Alternatively, select an instance type that is supported by all AZs in the region.
