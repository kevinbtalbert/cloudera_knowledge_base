Downloading Diagnostic Bundles for a Workspace
This topic describes how to download diagnostic bundles for an ML workspace. 

Required Role: MLAdmin
Make sure you are assigned the MLAdmin role in CDP. Only users with the MLAdmin role will
        be logged into ML workspaces with Site Administrator privileges. 


Log in to the CDP web interface.

In ML Workspaces, select a workspace.

Select Site Administration > Support > Generate Log Archive.

Select the time period from the dropdown.

Ensure Include Engines is selected if engine logs are needed (included by
          default). 

Select Send to Cloudera to send the diagnostic logs to Cloudera
          Support.

Select Create to generate the logs.

When Status is Complete, select
            Download to download the diagnostics bundles to your
          machine.

The data in the contained bundles may be incomplete. If it does not contain logs for
      time period you are looking for, there are a number of possible reasons: 
There is a delay between the time the logs are initially generated by a workload and the
          time they are visible in cloud storage. This may be approximately 1 minute due to
          buffering during streaming, but can be significantly longer due to eventual consistency in
          the cloud storage.
Another user or process may have deleted data from your bucket; this is beyond the
          control of Cloudera Machine Learning.
There may be a misconfiguration or an invalid parameter in your request. Retrieving logs
          requires a valid cloud storage location to be configured for logging, as well as
          authentication for Cloudera Machine Learning to be set up properly for it. Requests must
          pertain to a valid engine in a valid project.
