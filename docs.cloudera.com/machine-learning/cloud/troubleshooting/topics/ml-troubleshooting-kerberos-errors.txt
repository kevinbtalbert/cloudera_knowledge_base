Troubleshooting Kerberos Errors
This topic describes some common Kerberos issues and their
    recommended solutions. 
HDFS commands fail with Kerberos errors even though Kerberos
        authentication is successful in the web application
If Kerberos authentication is successful in the web
        application, and the output of klist in the engine reveals a valid-looking TGT, but
        commands such as hdfs dfs -ls
          / still fail with a Kerberos error, it is possible that your
        cluster is missing the Java Cryptography
          Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy File.
        The JCE policy file is required when Red Hat uses AES-256 encryption.
        This library should be installed on each cluster host and will live
        under $JAVA_HOME. For
        more information, see Using AES-256
          Encryption.

Cannot find renewable Kerberos TGT
Cloudera Machine Learning runs its
        own Kerberos TGT renewer which produces non-renewable TGT. However, this
        confuses Hadoop's renewer which looks for renewable TGTs. If the Spark 2
        logging level is set to WARN or lower, you may see exceptions such
        as:16/12/24 16:38:40 WARN security.UserGroupInformation: Exception encountered while running the renewal command. Aborting renew thread. ExitCodeException exitCode=1: kinit: Resource temporarily unavailable while renewing credentials

16/12/24 16:41:23 WARN security.UserGroupInformation: PriviledgedActionException as:user@CLOUDERA.LOCAL (auth:KERBEROS) cause:javax.security.sasl.SaslException: GSS initiate failed [Caused by GSSException: No valid credentials provided (Mechanism level: Failed to find any Kerberos tgt)]

This is not a bug.
        Spark 2 workloads will not be affected by this. Access to Kerberized
        resources should also work as expected.
