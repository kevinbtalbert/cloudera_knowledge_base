Troubleshooting ML Workspaces on Azure
You can collect logs to troubleshoot issues that occur in ML Workspaces with Azure. 
How to access Azure logs
Logs from the AKS control plane can be found in the "Logs" blade of the
          liftie-xxxxxxx resource group (not to be confused with the "Logs" blade
        of the AKS cluster itself or the Log Analytics Workspace in that resource group). The logs
        can be looked up using aÂ query language developed by Microsoft.

Cluster fails to scale down
If a worker node is idle but is not being scaled down, check the cluster autoscaler logs. 
Use this example to look up the logs: AzureDiagnostics | where Category ==
          "cluster-autoscaler" 
The logs list the pods that are scheduled on a given node that are preventing it from being
        scaled down, or other reasons for its scaling decisions. Services running in the kube-system
        namespace (such as tunnelfront, or metrics-server) have been known to delay scale-down when
        scheduled on an otherwise idle node.

Delete ML Workspace fails
If you delete a workspace, and the delete operation fails, you can use Force
          delete to remove the workspace.
In this case, CML attempts to delete associated cloud resources for the workspace including
        metadata files. However, users should check that all such resources have been deleted, and
        delete manually if necessary.
