Creating a Team
Users who work together on more than one project and want to facilitate collaboration
    can create a Team. Teams enable you to efficiently manage the users assigned to projects.

Team projects are owned by the team, rather than an individual user.
        Team administrators can add or remove members at any time, assigning each member different
        permissions.





In Site Administration > Teams, select New Team.

Enter the name of the team.

Select Local or Synced Team.
CDP manages the member data of a Synced Team. The member data of a Local team
        is not managed by CDP.

If Synced Team is selected, choose a group in Select Synced Group.

Enter a Description, if needed.

Add or invite team members. Team members can have one of the following privilege
          levels: 



Viewer - Read-only access to team projects. Cannot create new projects within
              the team but can be added to existing ones.
Operator - Read-only access to team projects. Additionally, Operators can
              start and stop existing jobs in the projects that they have access to. 

Contributor - Write-level access to all team projects to all team projects with
                Team or Public visibility. Can create new projects within the team.
              They can also be added to existing team projects.

Admin - Has complete access to all team projects, can add new team members, and
              modify team account information.



Select Create Team.

Select Sync Teams to update the teams with information in the
          CDP management console.
