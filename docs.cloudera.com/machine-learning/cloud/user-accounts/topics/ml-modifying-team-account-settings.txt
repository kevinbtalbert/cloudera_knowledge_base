          account. Click Settings to open up the Account
          Settings dashboard.Modify any of the following settings:

You can add new team members on this page, and modify
                privilege levels for existing members. 
SSH Keys
The team's public SSH key resides here. Team SSH keys provide
                a useful way to give an entire team access to external resources
                such as databases. For instructions, see SSH Keys. Generally, team SSH
                keys should not be used to authenticate against Git
                repositories. Use your personal key instead.
