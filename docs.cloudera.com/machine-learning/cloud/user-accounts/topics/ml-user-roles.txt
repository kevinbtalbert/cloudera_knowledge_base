User Roles
Users in Cloudera Machine Learning are assigned one or more of the following
  roles.
There are two categories of roles: environment resource roles, which apply to a given CDP
   environment, and workspace resource roles, which apply to a single workspace. To use workspace
   resource roles, you may need to upgrade the workspace or create a new workspace.
If a user has more than one role, then the role with the highest level of permissions takes
   precedence. If a user is a member of a group, it may gain additional roles through that
   membership.
Environment resource roles


MLAdmin: Grants a CDP user the ability to create and delete Cloudera
      Machine Learning workspaces within a given CDP environment. MLAdmins also have Administrator
      level access to all the workspaces provisioned within this environment. They can run
      workloads, monitor, and manage all user activity on these workspaces. They can also add the
      MLUser and MLBusinessUser roles to their assigned environment. This user also needs the
      account-level role of IAMViewer, in order to access the environment
       Manage Access page. To create or delete workspaces, this user also
      needs the EnvironmentAdmin role.
MLUser: Grants a CDP user the ability to view Cloudera Machine
      Learning workspaces provisioned within a given CDP environment. MLUsers will also be able to
      run workloads on all the workspaces provisioned within this environment.
MLBusinessUser: Grants permission to list Cloudera Machine Learning
      workspaces for a given CDP environment. MLBusinessUsers are able to only view applications
      deployed under the projects that they have been added to as a Business User.



Workspace resource roles
Workspace roles are for users who are granted access to just a single workspace.

MLWorkspaceAdmin: Grants permission to manage all machine learning
     workloads and settings inside a specific workspace. To perform resource role assignment, 
     the IAMViewer role is also needed. A user
     with this role can administer the workspace, but is not able to utilize CDP APIs that modify a
     workspace (for example, creating or upgrading workspaces).
MLWorkspaceBusinessUser: Grants permission to view shared machine
     learning applications inside a specific workspace.
MLWorkspaceUser: Grants permission to run machine learning workloads
     inside a specific workspace.


Using the workspace resource roles
A power user or account administrator must assign the first MLWorkspaceAdmin to a workspace.
   Subsequently, if the MLWorkspaceAdmin also has the IAMViewer role, they can assign resource roles 
   to the workspace.
An MLAdmin (an environment resource role) is not automatically able assign workspace resource
    roles on the Manage access page. A role such as MLWorkspaceAdmin is
    needed to do this.
You can check the permissions for a given resource role by clicking the Information icon by
    each resource role shown in User Management, on the
     Resources tab for a user, or in a CDP user profile.

noteAny user that lists users or assigns resource roles also needs the account-level role of
      IAMViewer.
