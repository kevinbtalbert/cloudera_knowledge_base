Restoring to a different environment
A backup can be restored to a different CDP environment, as long as it is within the
  same AWS account and region. Make sure the following requirements are met:

Environment roles must be within the same AWS account and region.
The target environment must have the necessary restore-related permissions, entitlements, and
    trust relationships.
Within the environment where the backup is stored, the user must have the
     ml/listWorkspaceBackups permission.
Within the environment where the workspace will be restored, the user must have the
     ml/createWorkspace permission.
