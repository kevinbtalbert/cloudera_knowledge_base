Removing ML Workspaces
This topic describes how to remove an existing ML workspace and clean up any cloud
    resources associated with the workspace. Currently, only CDP users with both the MLAdmin
    role and the EnvironmentAdmin account role can remove workspaces. 

Log in to the CDP web interface.

Click ML Workspaces.

Click on the Actions icon and select Remove Workspace. 


Remove EFS Storage - This option is enabled by default. If you want to
              retain project files on EFS, disable this property.


Force Delete - This property is not required by default. You should
              first attempt to remove your workspace with this property disabled. 

Enabling this property will delete the workspace
                from CDP but does not guarantee that the underlying cloud resources used by the
                workspace will be cleaned up properly. Go to your cloud service provider account to
                make sure that the cloud resources have been successfully deleted.
When manually cleaning up resources, make sure that the
                following types of shared resources are not deleted:
AWS:

VPCs
Subnets
Storage (S3 buckets and bucket entries)
AWS IAM roles

Microsoft Azure

Virtual networks
Subnets
ADLS storage
Azure resource groups (RGs named <liftie-id> and
                    MC_<liftie-id>_<azure-region>)





Click OK to confirm.

noteOn Azure public cloud, you also need to delete NFS storage after removing the
            workspace, if the NFS service is no longer needed.
