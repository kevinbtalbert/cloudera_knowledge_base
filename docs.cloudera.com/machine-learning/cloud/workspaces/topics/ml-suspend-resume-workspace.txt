Suspend and resume ML workspaces
Cloud consumption costs are a pain point for many public cloud users. The CML Suspend
        feature allows users to scale down the Kubernetes pods running on CML infra and CPU/GPU
        nodes for a given ML workspace. When the resume operation is performed on the suspended
        workspace, the suspended pods scale up. 

A suspended CML workspace has all its autoscaling node groups, except the Platform
                Infra node group, shrunk to zero instances, thereby saving compute instance costs
                for the duration the workspace is suspended. However, Kubernetes pods running on
                Platform Infra nodes continue to run when a workspace is suspended.
When a workspace is suspended, you cannot access the workspace URL, and all
                associated models, applications, sessions, and jobs also become unavailable. The
                suspend operation terminates sessions and jobs, so the suspend should be started
                only after those operations have finished. When the workspace is resumed, models and
                applications automatically resume operation at the same URLs as before. 
noteMake sure that disks are tagged to avoid garbage collection during backup, restore,
                upgrade, or suspend operations on CML workspaces. For more information, see
                Tagging disks to avoid garbage collection.


To suspend a CML workspace, in the Workspaces UI, select Actions > Suspend Workspace for the workspace to suspend. Then click
                        OK to start the suspend process.

To resume a CML workspace, in the Workspaces UI, select Actions > Resume Workspace for the workspace to resume. Then click OK
                    to start the resume process.
