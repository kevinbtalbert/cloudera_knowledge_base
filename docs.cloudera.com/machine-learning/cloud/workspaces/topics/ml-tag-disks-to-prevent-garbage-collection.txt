Tagging disks to avoid garbage collection
During backup, restore, upgrade, or suspend operations on CML workspaces, EBS or Azure
  disks can be left in a temporarily detached or unmanaged state when the associated EKS or AKS
  cluster is still running. If there is a garbage collection script running, and it is not properly
  configured, the disks used by the workspace can be deleted unintentionally. If the disk is not
  backed up, then the data will be lost.
Garbage collection scripts need to check for the following tags and ignore disks that are
   tagged with the corresponding values.
