Configuring User Access to CML
This topic describes how to grant users/groups access to an environment so that they
    can provision and/or list ML workspaces within that environment. The same users will also be
    granted Single Sign-on (SSO) access to the workspaces. In addition, if a user needs to
    provision, upgrade, or delete an ML workspace, they also need the account-level
      EnvironmentAdmin role assigned. For more information, see Understanding account
      roles and resource roles.

noteThis topic applies to public cloud releases.
Required Role: PowerUser
There are two CDP user roles associated with the CML service: MLAdmin and
        MLUser. A CDP PowerUser will need to assign these roles to users who require access
      to the CML service within an environment.
MLAdmin - This role grants a CDP user/group the ability to
            create and delete Cloudera Machine Learning workspaces within a given CDP environment.
            MLAdmins will also have Site Administrator level access to all the workspaces
            provisioned within this environment. That is, they can run workloads, monitor, and
            manage all user activity on these workspaces.
MLUser - This role grants a CDP user/group the ability to list
            Cloudera Machine Learning workspaces provisioned within a given CDP environment. MLUsers
            will also be able to run workloads on all the workspaces provisioned within this
            environment.

For instructions, see Granting CDP Users Access to Cloudera Machine
        Learning Service.
