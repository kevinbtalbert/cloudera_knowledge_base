Granting Remote Access to ML Workspaces
This topic shows you how to allow specific users remote access to the underlying
    cluster that powers an ML workspace. 

noteThis topic applies to AWS public cloud. On Azure public cloud, a user with the
            MLAdmin role can download the kubeconfig file, and this file
          alone grants access to any user who has it.
Required Role: MLAdmin

As part of this process, you will be required to enter the user's
      Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Make sure you have access to this information
      before you begin. Either get the ARN from the user OR look up a user's ARN
      in your AWS account. For the latter, go to your organisation's
          AWS Account > Identity and
          Access Management
        (IAM) > Users and lookup
      the user. The ARN is available on their Summary page. If you are using
        the AWS CLI, you can run the following command to get the
        ARN:aws sts get-caller-identity#Sample output
{
"UserId": "ABCDE12345FGHIJKLMNO6789",
"Account": "888888888888",
"Arn": "arn:aws:iam::888888888888:user/<username>"
}
Log in to the CDP web interface.Click ML Workspaces.Click Actions to expand the dropdown
          menu.Click Manage Remote Access.
Enter the user's ARN, or select the user's name.

Click Grant Access.
To remove access for a user, in the Actions column, click
            Revoke Access next to the user's name.

Click Download Kubeconfig. 

Send the downloaded Kubernetes config file to the user who has been granted access. To
      be able to connect to the EKS cluster, they will need to have
        aws-iam-authenticator installed.
