Securing Applications
You can provide access to Applications via either the CDSW_APP_PORT or the
    CDSW_READONLY_PORT. Any user with read or higher permissions to the project is
    able to access an application served through either port.

Securing project resourcesCML applications are accessible by any user with
            read-only or higher permissions to the project. The creator of the
          application is responsible for managing the level of permissions the application users
          have on the project through the application. CML does not actively prevent you from
          running an application that allows a read-only user (i.e. Viewers) to modify files
          belonging to the project. 
Public ApplicationsBy default, authentication for applications is enforced on
          all ports and users cannot create public applications. If desired, the Admin user can
          allow users to create public applications that can be accessed by unauthenticated users.
          To allow users to create public applications on an ML workspace: 
As an Admin user, turn on the feature flag in Admin > Security by selecting Allow applications to be configured with
                unauthenticated access.
When creating a new application, select Enable Unauthenticated
                Access.
For an existing application, in Settings select
                Enable Unauthenticated Access.
To prevent all users from creating public applications, go to Admin > Security and deselect Allow applications to be configured with
            unauthenticated access. After one minute, all existing public applications
          stop being publicly accessible.
Transparent Authentication
CML can pass user authentication to an Application, if the Application expects an
          authorized request. The REMOTE-USER field is used for this task.
