Using ML Runtimes with cdswctl
If a project is configured to use Runtimes, cdswctl workflows for
    starting sessions or models are slightly different.
Querying the engine typeYou can query whether a project is configured using ML Runtimes or Legacy     Engine.Listing runtimesThe first step to working with projects using runtimes is to query the available     runtimes using the cdswctl runtimes list command. Starting sessions and creating SSH endpointsOnce you choose a runtime, you can start a session using the cdswctl sessions       start command and create SSH endpoints using the cdswctl       ssh-endpoint command. Creating a modelCreating a model in a project that uses runtimes is similar to model creation with an     legacy engine, but you must use a different parameter to specify the runtime ID.
