Command Line Tools in CML
Cloudera Machine Learning ships with the following command
    line tools. The purpose of each tool differs.


CDP CLI for Cloudera Machine Learning - If you prefer to work
          in a terminal window, you can download and configure the CDP client
          that gives you access to the CDP CLI tool. The CDP CLI allows you to
          perform the same actions as can be performed from the management
          console. Use this CLI to create, delete, upgrade, and manage ML
          workspaces on CDP. To view all the available commands,
            run:cdp ml helpTo view help for a
            specific command,
            run:cdp ml <operation> helpIf you
            don't already have the CDP CLI set up, see Installing the CDP
              CLI Client.
cdswctl - Cloudera Machine Learning also ships with a CLI client that you can
          download from the Cloudera Machine Learning web UI. This is also referred to as the
          Model CLI client. The cdswctl client allows you to log in, create an SSH
          endpoint, launch new sessions, automate model deployment, model updates, and so on.
