Azure NetApp Files Management with the CLI
You can manage the NetApp Files setup using the CLI. This can be helpful for automating
  setup and teardown of workspaces as ML project needs change.
Create an Azure NetApp Files account
The following code sample creates an Azure NetApp Files account.
 az netappfiles account create \ --account-name my-anf-account \ --resource-group
    my-cdp-resource-group \ --location westus2 

Create a capacity pool
A capacity pool is a storage container for volumes, which are accessed directly by CML. The
    minimum size for an Azure NetApp Files capacity pool is 4 TiB 
 MINIMUM_POOL_SIZE=4 # 4 TiB is the minimum az netappfiles pool create \
    --account-name my-anf-account \ --pool-name my-anf-pool \ --resource-group my-cdp-resource-group
    \ --service-level Standard \ --location westus2 \ --size ${MINIMUM_POOL_SIZE} 

Create a volume
Create one or more volumes in the capacity pool. The "Usage threshold" is referred to as the
    "quota" in the Azure web portal. It is measured in GiB. The volume must support the NFSv3
    protocol (which is the default).
 az netappfiles volume create \ --account-name my-anf-account \ --pool-name
    my-anf-account \ --volume-name my-anf-volume \ --resource-group my-cdp-resource-group \
    --location westus2 \ --file-path my-anf-volume \ --usage-threshold 1000 \ --vnet my-cdp-vnet \
    --subnet my-anf-subnet \ --service-level Standard 
The mount path for this volume, or a dedicated, empty subdirectory inside that volume, must be
    provided for the "Existing NFS" field when provisioning CML workspaces. It can be found in the
    "Mount Instructions" blade of the volume in the Azure portal.
Since each capacity pool has a large minimum, and each volume requires a dedicated subnet,
    users may wish to have a single volume that is shared between workspaces. This can be managed by
    having a VM that has the Azure volume mounted (instructions for doing this are also in the
    "Mount Instructions" blade of the volume in the Azure portal). This VM can then be used to
    quickly manage directories for individual workspaces on a single, shared volume. For
    instance:

    USER=      # username for accessing management VM
    VM=        # IP address or hostname for accessing management VM
    VOLUME=    # NFS volume name
    WORKSPACE= # CML workspace name (or other unique directory name)
    ssh ${USER}@${VM} "sudo mkdir ${VOLUME}/${WORKSPACE}; sudo chown 8536:8536 ${VOLUME}/${WORKSPACE}"
    # ...
    ssh ${USER}@${VM} "sudo rm -r ${VOLUME}/${WORKSPACE}"
