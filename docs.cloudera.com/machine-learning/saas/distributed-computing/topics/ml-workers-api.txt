Workers API
This section lists the functions available as part of the workers
    API.
Parent topic: Distributed Computing with WorkersLaunch WorkersLaunches worker
      engines into the cluster.

Syntax

launch_workers(n, cpu, memory, nvidia_gpu=0, kernel="python3", script="", code="", env={})

Parameters


n (int) - The number of engines to launch.
cpu (float) - The number of CPU cores to allocate to
                the engine.
memory (float) - The number of gigabytes of memory to
                allocate to the engine.
nvidia_gpu (int, optional) - The number of GPU's to
                allocate to the engine.
kernel (str, optional) - The kernel. Can be "r", "python2", "python3" or
                "scala". This parameter is only available for projects that use legacy engines.
script (str, optional) - The name of a Python source file the worker should
                run as soon as it starts up.
code (str, optional) - Python code the engine should
                run as soon as it starts up. If a script is specified, code
                will be ignored.
env (dict, optional) - Environment variables to set in
                the engine.


Example Usage

Python
import cdsw
workers = cdsw.launch_workers(n=2, cpu=0.2, memory=0.5, code="print('Hello from a CDSW Worker')")
R
library("cdsw") 
workers <- launch.workers(n=2, cpu=0.2, memory=0.5, env="", code="print('Hello from a CML Worker')")
noteThe env parameter has been defined due to a
              bug that appears when parsing the launch.workers
              function. When not defined, the env parameter is
              serialized internally into a format that is incompatible with
              Cloudera Machine Learning. This bug does not affect the
              Python engine.



List WorkersReturns all
      information on all the workers in the cluster.

Syntax

list_workers()



Stop WorkersStops worker
      engines.

Syntax

stop_workers(*worker_id)

Parameter


worker_id (int, optional) - The ID numbers of the
                worker engines that must be stopped. If an ID is not provided,
                all the worker engines on the cluster will be stopped.
