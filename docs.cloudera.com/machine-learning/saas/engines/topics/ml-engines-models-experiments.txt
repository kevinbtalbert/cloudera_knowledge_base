Engines for Experiments and Models

In Cloudera Machine Learning, models, experiments, jobs, and sessions are all created
      and executed within the context of a project. We've described the different ways in which you
      can customize a project's engine environment for sessions and jobs in Environmental
        Variables. However, engines for models and experiments are completely isolated from
      the rest of the project. 
Every time a model or experiment is kicked off, Cloudera Machine Learning creates a new isolated Docker image where the model or
      experiment is executed. This isolation in build and execution makes it
      possible for Cloudera Machine Learning to keep track of input and
      output artifacts for every experiment you run. In case of models,
      versioned builds give you a way to retain build history for models and a
      reliable way to rollback to an older version of a model if needed. 



The following topics describe the engine
      build process that occurs when you kick off a model or experiment. 

Related informationEnvironmental VariablesSnapshot CodeWhen you first launch an experiment or model, Cloudera Machine Learning takes a Git snapshot of the project filesystem at that point in     time. This Git server functions behind the scenes and is completely separate     from any other Git version control system you might be using for the project     as a whole.Build ImageOnce the code snapshot is available, Cloudera Machine Learning     creates a new Docker image with a copy of the snapshot. Run Experiment / Deploy ModelOnce the Docker image has been built and pushed to the internal     registry, the experiment/model can now be executed within this isolated     environment.
