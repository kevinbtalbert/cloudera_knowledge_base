Run Experiment / Deploy Model
Once the Docker image has been built and pushed to the internal
    registry, the experiment/model can now be executed within this isolated
    environment. 
In case of experiments, you can track live progress as the experiment
      executes in the experiment's Session tab. 
Unlike experiments, models do not display live execution progress in a
      console. Behind the scenes, Cloudera Machine Learning will move on to
      deploying the model in a serving environment based on the computing
      resources and replicas you requested. Once deployed you can go to the
      model's Monitoring page to view statistics on the
      number of requests served/dropped and stderr/stdout logs
      for the model replicas.
