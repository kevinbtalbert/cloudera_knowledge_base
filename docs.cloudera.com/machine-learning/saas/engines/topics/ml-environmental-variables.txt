Environmental Variables
This topic explains how environmental variables are propagated
    through an ML workspace. 
Environmental variables help you customize engine environments, both
          globally and for individual projects/jobs. For example, if you need to
          configure a particular timezone for a project or increase the length
          of the session/job timeout windows, you can use environmental
          variables to do so. Environmental variables can also be used to assign
          variable names to secrets, such as passwords or authentication tokens,
          to avoid including these directly in the code. 
For a
         list of the environmental variables you can configure and instructions on how to configure
         them, see Engine Environment Variables.
