This topic describes how to include custom images in the allowlist so that they can be
    used in projects.Including a customized image in
        Cloudera Machine Learning is a two-step process. 
 Include the image in the allowlist for the whole deployment. First, a site
            administrator will need to clear the new image for use on the deployment. 
Log in as a site administrator.
Click Admin > Engines.
Add
                  <company-registry>/<user-name>/<image-name>:<tag>
                to the allowlist of  engine images.



 Include the image in the allowlist for a specific project If you want to start
            using the image in a project, the project administrator will need to set this image as
            the default image for the project. 
Go to the project Settings page. 
Click Engines. 
Select the new customized engine from the drop-down list of available Docker
                images. Sessions and jobs you run in your project will now have access to this
                engine.
