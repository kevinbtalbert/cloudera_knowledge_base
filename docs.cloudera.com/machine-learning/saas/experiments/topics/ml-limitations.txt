Limitations
This topic lists some of the known issues and limitations
    associated with experiments.

Experiments do not store snapshots of project files. You cannot
            automatically restore code that was run as part of an
            experiment.


Experiments will fail if your project filesystem is too large for the Git snapshot
                  process. As a general rule, any project files (code, generated model artifacts,
                  dependencies, etc.) larger than 50 MB must be part of your project's
                     .gitignore file so that they are not included in snapshots for
                  experiment builds. 


Experiments cannot be deleted. As a result, be conscious of how you
            use the track_metrics and
              track_file functions. 
Do not track files larger than 50MB. 
Do not track more than 100 metrics per experiment. Excessive metric calls from
                        an experiment may cause Cloudera Machine Learning to stop responding. 




The Experiments table will allow you to display only three metrics
            at a time. You can select which metrics are displayed from the
              metrics dropdown. If you are tracking a
            large number of metrics (100 or more), you might notice some
            performance lag in the UI.


 Arguments are not supported with Scala experiments. 


The track_metrics and track_file
            functions are not supported with Scala experiments.


The UI does not display a confirmation when you start an experiment
            or any alerts when experiments fail.
