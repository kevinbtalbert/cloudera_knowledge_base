Saving Files
This topic teaches you how to use the track_file
    function to save files associated with experiments.Cloudera Machine Learning allows you to select which
        artifacts you'd like to access and evaluate after an experiment is
        complete. These artifacts could be anything from a text file to an image
        or a model that you have built through the run. The cdsw library includes a
          track_file function that can be used to specify which
        artifacts should be retained after the experiment is complete. 
Python

cdsw.track_file('model.pkl')

R

cdsw::track.file('model.pkl')
Specified artifacts can be accessed from the run's Overview
        page. These files can also be saved to the top-level project filesystem
        and downloaded from there.noteThis function is not supported with Scala experiments.
