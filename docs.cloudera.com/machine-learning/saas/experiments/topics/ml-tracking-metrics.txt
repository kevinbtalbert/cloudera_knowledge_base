Tracking Metrics
This topic teaches you how to use the
      track_metric function to log metrics associated with
    experiments.The cdsw library includes a
          track_metric function that can be used to log up to
        50 metrics associated with a run, thus allowing accuracy and scores to
        be tracked over time. The function accepts input in the form of key value
        pairs.cdsw.track_metric(key, value)

Python
cdsw.track_metric(“R_squared”, 0.79)
R
cdsw::track.metric(“R_squared”, 0.62)
These metrics will be available on the project's Experiments tab
        where you can view, sort, and filter experiments on the values. The
        table on the Experiments page will allow you to
        display only three metrics at a time. You can select which metrics are
        displayed from the metrics dropdown. noteThis function is not supported with Scala experiments.
