Site Admins: Add the Custom CUDA Engine to your Cloudera Machine Learning
            Deployment
After you create a custom CUDA-capable engine image, you must add the new engine to
        Cloudera Machine Learning. 

You must have the Site Administrator role to perform this task. 


Sign in to Cloudera Machine Learning.

Click Admin.

Go to the Engines tab.

Under Engine Images, add the custom CUDA-capable engine
                    image created in the previous step.
This allows project administrators across the deployment to start using this
                    engine in their jobs and sessions.

Site administrators can also set a limit on the maximum number of GPUs that can
                    be allocated per session or job. From the Maximum GPUs per
                        Session/Job dropdown, select the maximum number of GPUs that can
                    be used by an engine.

Click Update.
