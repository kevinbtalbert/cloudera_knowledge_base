Accessing Local Data from Your Computer
This topic includes code samples that demonstrate how to access
    local data for CML workloads.
If you want to perform analytics operations on existing data files
        (.csv, .txt, etc.) from your computer, you can upload these files
        directly to your Cloudera Machine Learning project. Go to the
        project's Overview page. Under the Files section, click Upload
        and select the relevant data files to be uploaded.The following sections use the tips.csv dataset to demonstrate
        how to work with local data stored within your project. Upload this
        dataset to the data folder in your project before you
        run these examples.Pandas (Python)

import pandas as pd

tips = pd.read_csv('data/tips.csv')
  
tips \
  .query('sex == "Female"') \
  .groupby('day') \
  .agg({'tip' : 'mean'}) \
  .rename(columns={'tip': 'avg_tip_dinner'}) \
  .sort_values('avg_tip_dinner', ascending=False)

dplyr (R)

library(readr)
library(dplyr)

# load data from .csv file in project
tips <- read_csv("data/tips.csv")

# query using dplyr
tips %>%
  filter(sex == "Female") %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_tip = mean(tip, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_tip))
