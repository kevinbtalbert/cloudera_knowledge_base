Loading CSV Data into an Impala Table

For this
        demonstration, we will be using the tips.csv dataset. Use the following steps to save
        this file to a project in Cloudera Machine Learning, and then load it into a table in Apache
          Impala.
Create a new Cloudera Machine Learning project.

Create a folder called data and upload tips.csv to this folder. For
            detailed instructions, see Managing Project Files
            .
The next steps require access to services on the CDH cluster. If Kerberos has been
            enabled on the cluster, enter your credentials (username, password/keytab) in Cloudera
            Machine Learning to enable access. 
Navigate back to the project Overview page and click Open
              Workbench.
Launch a new session (Python or R).
Open the Terminal.
Run the following command to create an empty table in Impala called tips. Replace
                  <impala_daemon_hostname> with the hostname for your
                Impala daemon.
                impala-shell -i <impala_daemon_hostname>:21000 -q '
  CREATE TABLE default.tips (
    `total_bill` FLOAT,
    `tip` FLOAT,
    `sex` STRING,
    `smoker` STRING,
    `day` STRING,
    `time` STRING,
    `size` TINYINT)
  ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ","
  LOCATION "hdfs:///user/hive/warehouse/tips/";'

Run the following command to load data from the /data/tips.csv
                file into the Impala table.
                hdfs dfs -put data/tips.csv /user/hive/warehouse/tips/
