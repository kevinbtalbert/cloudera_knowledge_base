Jupyter Magic Commands
Cloudera Machine Learning's Scala and Python kernels are based on
      Jupyter kernels. Jupyter kernels support varying magic commands that
      extend the core language with useful shortcuts. This section details the
      magic commands (magics) supported by Cloudera Machine Learning.
Line magics begin with a single %: for example,
        %timeit. Cell magics begin with a double %%: for
      example, %%bash.
