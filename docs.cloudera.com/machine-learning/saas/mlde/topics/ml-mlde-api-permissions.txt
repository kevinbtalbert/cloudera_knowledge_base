API Permissions For Projects
The tasks available to collaborators depends on their level of access.
A collaborator with read-only access is able to do the following:

List data connections
Get data connection details

noteThe list of data connections is unavailable in the UI to viewer-only users because the
    Setting tab in a project is hidden for viewer collaborators. However,
   they can use curl to submit api requests to list the data connections.
A collaborator with write access can:

Create data connections
Edit data connections
Delete data connections
List data connections
Get data connection details
