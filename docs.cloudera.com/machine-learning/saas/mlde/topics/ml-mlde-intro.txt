Machine Learning Discovery and Exploration
ML Discovery and Exploration makes it simple for data scientists to get started on a
  data science project.
When you start a data science project, you are presented with a blank notebook, and no
   indication of what data sources are available on the CDP platform, or how to access them. The ML
   Discovery and Exploration feature automatically discovers the data sources available to you, from
   within the standard CML user interface.
With ML Discovery and Exploration, you can:
  
Easily discover and connect to data sources (virtual warehouses or data lakes).
Quickly set up an ML project to access a given data source.
Start running SQL queries to explore the data.
