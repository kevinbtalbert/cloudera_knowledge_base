Set up a data connection manually
Data connections are automatically discovered. You can also set up a data connection
        manually, which works across CDP environments. 

Log into the CDP web interface and navigate to the Data
                        Warehouse service.

In the Data Warehouse service, select Virtual
                        Warehouses in the left navigation panel.

Select the options menu for the warehouse you want to access, and select
                        Copy JDBC URL.






In Site Administration > Data Connections, select New Connection.

Enter the connection name. You cannot have duplicate names for data connections
                    within a workspace or within a given project.

Select the connection type:

Hive Virtual Warehouse
Impala Virtual Warehouse


Enter the JDBC URL for the data connection. You can obtain this from the
                    virtual warehouse in Cloudera Data Warehouse.

(Optional) Enter the Virtual Warehouse Name. This is the
                    name of the warehouse in Cloudera Data Warehouse.

The data connection is available to users by default. To change availability, click
            the Available switch.
