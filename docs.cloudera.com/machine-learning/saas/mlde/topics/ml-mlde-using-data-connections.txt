Using data connections in a project
As a data scientist, you can manage the data connections within a project, and connect
  your code to the data.
Ensure your environment is set up as follows:
  
The project must be configured to use ML Runtimes.
To use a Spark data connection,  make sure you have the correct permissions set in the s3 bucket.
Configure the WORKLOAD_PASSWORD environmental variable.

You need to set an environmental variable for the password (WORKLOAD_PASSWORD). This environmental 
   variable is needed to access a Hive or Impala warehouse.
To set the password:

Go to User Settings > Environment.
Under the Reserved Environment Variables set your
    WORKLOAD_PASSWORD.
Click Save.
