Viewing lineage for a model deployment in Atlas
You can view the lineage information for a particular model deployment and trace it
        back to the specific data that was used to train the model through the Atlas' Management
        Console.

Navigate to Data Lake > Atlas from the Management Console.

Search for ml_model_deployment. Click the model deployment of
                    your interest.

Click the Lineage tab to see a visualization of lineage
                    information for the particular model deployment and trace it back to the
                    specific data that was used to train the model.
You can also search for a specific table, click through to its
                        Lineage tab and see if the table has been used in any
                    model deployments.
