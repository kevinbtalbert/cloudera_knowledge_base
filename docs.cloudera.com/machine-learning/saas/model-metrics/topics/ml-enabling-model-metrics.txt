Enabling model metrics
Metrics are used to track the performance of the models. When you enable model
        metrics while creating a workspace, the metrics are stored in a scalable metrics store. You
        can track individual model predictions and analyze metrics using custom code.


Go to Cloudera Machine Learning and click Provision
                        Workspace on the top-right corner.

Enter the workspace name and other details.

Click Advanced Options.

Select Enable Model Metrics. 
If you want to connect to an external (custom) Postgres database, then specify
                    the details in the additional optional arguments that are displayed. If you do
                    not specify these details, a managed Postgres database will be used to store the
                    metrics.
