API Key for Models
You can prevent unauthorized access to your models by specifying an API key in the
  “Authorization” header of your model HTTP request. This topic covers how to create, test, and use
  an API key in Cloudera Machine Learning.
The API key governs the authentication part of the process and the authorization is based on
   what privileges the users already have in terms of the project that they are a part of. For
   example, if a user or application has read-only access to a project, then the authorization is
   based on their current access level to the project, which is “read-only”. If the users have been
   authenticated to a project, then they can make a request to a model with the API key. This is
   different from the previously described Access Key, which is only used to identify which model
   should serve a request.

Enabling authenticationRestricting access using API keys is an optional feature. By default, the “Enable   Authentication” option is turned on. However, it is turned off by default for the existing models   for backward compatibility. You can enable authentication for all your existing   models.Generating an API keyIf you have enabled authentication, then you need an API key to call a model. If you are   not a collaborator on a particular project, then you cannot access the models within that project   using the API key that you generate. You need to be added as a collaborator by the admin or the   owner of the project to use the API key to access a model.Managing API KeysThe admin user can access the list of all the users who are accessing the workspace         and can delete the API keys for a user.Parent topic: Securing Models
