Technical Metrics for Models
You can observe the operation of your models by using charts provided for technical
  metrics. These charts can help you determine if your models are under- or over-resourced, or are
  experiencing some problem.
To check the performance of your model, go to Models, click on the model
   name, and select the Monitoring tab. You can choose to monitor all
   replicas of the model, or choose a specific replica. You can also select the time and date range
   to display. Up to two weeks of data is retained.
This tab displays charts for the following technical metrics:

Requests per Second
Number of Requests
Number of Failed Requests
Model Response Time
All Model Replica CPU Usage
All Model Replica Memory Usage
Model Request & Response Size

All charts share a common time axis (the x axis), so it is easy to correlate cpu and memory
   usage with model response time or the number of failed requests, for example.
