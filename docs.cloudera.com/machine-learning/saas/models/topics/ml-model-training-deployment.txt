Model Training and Deployment Overview
This section provides an overview of model training and deployment
    using Cloudera Machine Learning.
Machine learning is a discipline that uses computer algorithms to extract
      useful knowledge from data. There are many different types of machine
      learning algorithms, and each one works differently. In general however,
      machine learning algorithms begin with an initial hypothetical model,
      determine how well this model fits a set of data, and then work on
      improving the model iteratively. This training process continues until the
      algorithm can find no additional improvements, or until the user stops the
      process.
A typical machine learning project will include the following high-level
      steps that will transform a loose data hypothesis into a model that serves
      predictions.

Explore and experiment with and display findings of
        data
Deploy automated pipelines of analytics workloads
Train and evaluate models
Deploy models as REST APIs to serve predictions

With Cloudera Machine Learning, you can deploy the complete
      lifecycle of a machine learning project from research to deployment.
