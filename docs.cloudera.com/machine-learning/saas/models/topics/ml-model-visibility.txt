Model visibility
A basic requirement for model governance is enabling teams to understand how machine
  learning is being applied in their organizations. This requires a canonical catalog of models in
  use. In the absence of such a catalog, many organizations are unaware of how their models work,
  where they are deployed, what they are being used for, and so on. This leads to repeated work,
  model inconsistencies, recomputing features, and other inefficiencies.
