Train the Model
This topic shows you how to run experiments and develop a model
    using the fit.py file. 
The fit.py script tracks metrics, mean squared error
        (MSE) and R2, to help compare the results of different
        experiments. It also writes the fitted model to a
          model.pkl file.

Navigate to the Iris project's Overview > Experiments page.Click Run Experiment.Fill out the form as follows and click Start
            Run. Make sure you use the Python 3 kernel.The new experiment should now show up on the
            Experiments table. Click on the Run ID to go
          to the experiment's Overview page. The
            Build and Session tabs
          display realtime progress as the experiment builds and executes.Once the experiment has completed successfully, go back to
          its Overview page. The tracked metrics show us
          that our test set had an MSE of ~0.0078 and an R2 of
          ~0.0493. For the purpose of this demo, let's consider this an accurate
          enough model to deploy and use for predictions.Once you have finished training and comparing metrics from
          different experiments, go to the experiment that generated the best
          model. From the experiment's Overview page,
          select the model.pkl file and click Add to
            Project.This saves the model to the
          project filesystem, available on the project's
            Files page. We will now deploy this model as
          a REST API that can serve predictions.
