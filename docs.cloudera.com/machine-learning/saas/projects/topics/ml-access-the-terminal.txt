Access the Terminal
Cloudera Machine Learning provides full terminal access to
    running engines from the web console. This topic show you how to access the
    Terminal from a running Workbench session. You can use the terminal to move files around, run Git
      commands, access the YARN and Hadoop CLIs, or install libraries that
      cannot be installed directly from the engine. To access the Terminal from
      a running session, click Terminal Access above the session log pane. The terminal's default working directory is
          /home/cdsw, which is where all your project files
        are stored. Any modifications you make to this folder will persist
        across runs, while modifications to other folders are discarded. If you are using Kerberos authentication, you can run
          klist to see your Kerberos principal. If you run
          hdfs dfs -ls you will see the files stored in your
        HDFS home directory. Note that the terminal does not
        provide root or sudo access to the container. To install packages that require root access,
        see Customized Engine Images.
