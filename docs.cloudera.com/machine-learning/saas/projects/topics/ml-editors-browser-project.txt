Configure a Browser IDE at the Project Level
The following steps are only required if you want to use an editor that does not come
    preinstalled as part of the default engine image that Cloudera Machine Learning ships
    with.
Before you start, verify that you have installed the IDE of your
      choice to the project. For information about how to install additional packages to a project,
        see Installing Additional Packages.
Perform the following steps to add an editor to a
      project:

Open the Cloudera Machine Learning web UI.

Go to the project you want to configure an editor for.

Go to Settings > Editors and click New Editor.

Complete the fields:


Name: Provide a name for the editor. This is the name that
              appears in the dropdown menu for Editors when you start a new
              session.
Command: Enter the command to start the server for the editor
              on the Cloudera Machine Learning public port specified in the
                CDSW_APP_PORT environment variable (default 8081). For
                example, the following command starts Jupyter Lab on the port specified by the
                  CDSW_APP_PORT environment
              variable:/home/cdsw/.local/bin/jupyter-lab --no-browser --ip=127.0.0.1 --port=${CDSW_APP_PORT} --NotebookApp.token= --NotebookApp.allow_remote_access=True --log-level=ERROR

              This is the same command you used to start the IDE to test it in a session.



Save the changes.
When a user starts a new session, the editor you added is available in the list
          of editors. Browsers must be configured to accept cookies and allow pop-up windows from
          the Cloudera Machine Learning web UI.
