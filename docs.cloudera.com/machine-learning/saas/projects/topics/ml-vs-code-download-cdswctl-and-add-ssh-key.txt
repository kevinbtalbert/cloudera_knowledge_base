Download cdswctl and Add an SSH Key
The first step to configure VS Code as a local IDE is to download
      cdswctl and add an SSH key.

Open the Cloudera Machine Learning web UI and go to Settings > Remote Editing for your user account.

Download cdswctl client for your operating system.

In the terminal, run cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. If you used a different
          filename above when generating the key, use that filename instead. This command prints the
          key as a string.

Copy the key. It should resemble the following: ssh-rsa
            AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQCha2J5mW3i3BgtZ25/FOsxywpLVkx1RgmZunI


In SSH public keys for session access, paste the key.

Cloudera Machine Learning uses the SSH
      public key to authenticate your CLI client session, including the SSH endpoint connection to
      the Cloudera Machine Learning deployment. Any SSH endpoints that are
      running when you add an SSH public key must also be restarted.
