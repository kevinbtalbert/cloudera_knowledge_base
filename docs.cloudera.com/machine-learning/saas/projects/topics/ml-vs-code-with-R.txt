(Optional) Using VS Code with R
You can use VS Code with R.
The R extension provides similar capabilities as Python. This
      means you can edit R files with code completion and execute arbitrary code in the terminal.
      With sparklyr, you can run spark code using R inside VS Code.

Prior to installing the R extension, check where your R binary lives in CDW by running
            which R and then pasting that into the R > Rterm:
            Linux setting in VS Code. 
The R binary is most likely located in /usr/local/bin/R, but its best
          to check.



After you install the R extension, you can use sparklyr to run spark code using R
          inside VS Code.
