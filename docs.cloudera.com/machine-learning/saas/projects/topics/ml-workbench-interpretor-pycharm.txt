Add Cloudera Machine Learning as an Interpreter for PyCharm
In PyCharm, you can configure an SSH interpreter. Cloudera Machine Learning uses
    this method to connect to PyCharm and act as its interpreter. 
Before you begin, ensure that the SSH endpoint for Cloudera
      Machine Learning is running on your local machine. These instructions were written for
      the Professional Edition of PyCharm Version 2019.1 and are meant as a starting point. If
      additional information is required, see the documentation for your version of PyCharm for
      specific instructions.

Open PyCharm.

Create a new project.

Expand Project Interpreter and select Existing
            interpreter.

Click on ... and select SSH
          Interpreter

Select New server configuration and complete the fields:


Host: localhost
Port: 2222
Username: cdsw



Select Key pair and complete the fields using the RSA private
          key that corresponds to the public key you added to the Remote
            Editing tab in the Cloudera Machine Learning web UI..
For macOS users, you must add your RSA private key to your keychain. In a terminal
          window, run the following command:
          ssh-add -K <path to your prviate key>/<private_key>

Complete the wizard. Based on the Python version you want to use, enter one of the
          following parameters: 


/usr/local/bin/python2
/usr/local/bin/python3


You are returned to the New Project window.
            Existing interpreter is selected, and you should see the
          connection to Cloudera Machine Learning in the Interpreter
          field.

In the Remote project location field, specify the following
          directory:

/home/cdsw


Create the project.
