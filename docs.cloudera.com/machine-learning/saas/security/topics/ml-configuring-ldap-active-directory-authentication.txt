Configuring LDAP/Active Directory Authentication
This topic describes how to set up LDAP authentication for a
    workspace. 
importantThis is not the recommended method to set up
      LDAP authentication. Cloudera recommends you use the CDP management
      console to set this up: Configuring User Access to
      CML.
Cloudera Machine Learning supports both search bind and direct
        bind operations to authenticate against an LDAP or Active Directory
        directory service. The search bind authentication mechanism performs an
        ldapsearch against the directory service, and binds using the found
          Distinguished Name (DN) and
        password provided. The direct bind authentication mechanism binds to the
        LDAP server using a username and password provided at login. 
You can configure Cloudera Machine Learning to use external
        authentication methods by clicking the Admin link
        on the left sidebar and selecting the Security
        tab. Select LDAP from the list to start configuring LDAP
        properties.
