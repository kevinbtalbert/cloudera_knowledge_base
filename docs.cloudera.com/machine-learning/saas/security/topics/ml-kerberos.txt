Hadoop Authentication for ML Workspaces


CML does not assume that your Kerberos principal is always the same as your login
        information. Therefore, you will need to make sure CML knows your Kerberos identity when you
        sign in.
This procedure is required if you want to run Spark workloads in an ML
        workspace.


Navigate to your ML workspace.

Go to the top-right dropdown menu, click Account settings > Hadoop Authentication.

To authenticate, either enter your password or click Upload
            Keytab to upload the keytab file directly.

Once successfully authenticated, Cloudera Machine Learning uses
      your stored credentials to ensure you are secure when running workloads.
