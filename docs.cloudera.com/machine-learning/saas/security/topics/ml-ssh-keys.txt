SSH Keys

This topic describes the different types of SSH keys
      used by Cloudera Machine Learning, and how you can use those
      keys to authenticate to an external service such as GitHub.

Personal KeyCloudera Machine Learning automatically generates an SSH       key pair for     your user account. You can rotate the key pair and view your public key on     your user settings page. It is not possible for anyone to view your private     key. Team KeyTeam SSH keys provide a useful way to give an entire team access     to external resources such as databases or GitHub repositories (as described     in the next section). Adding an SSH Key to GitHubAdd your Cloudera Machine Learning SSH public key to your     GitHub account if you want to use GitHub repositories to create new projects     or collaborate on projects. Creating an SSH Tunnel You can use your SSH key to connect Cloudera Machine Learning     to an external database or cluster by creating an SSH tunnel.
