Test LDAP Configuration
Use the Test LDAP Configuration form to test your settings. 
You can test your LDAP/Active Directory configuration by entering
          your username and password in the Test LDAP Configuration
          section. This form simulates the user login process and allows you to
          verify the validity of your LDAP/Active Directory configuration
          without opening a new window. 
Before using this form, make sure you click
            Update to save the LDAP configuration you
          want to test.
