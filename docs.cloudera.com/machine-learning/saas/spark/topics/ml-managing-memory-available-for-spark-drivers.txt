Managing Memory Available for Spark Drivers
By default, the amount of memory allocated to Spark
      driver processes is set to a 0.8 fraction of the total memory allocated for the engine
      container. If you want to allocate more or less memory to the Spark driver
      process, you can override this default by setting the spark.driver.memory property in
        spark-defaults.conf (as
      described above).
