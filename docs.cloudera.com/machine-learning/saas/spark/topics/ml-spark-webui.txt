Spark Web UIs
This topic describes how to access Spark web UIs from the CML UI. 
Spark 2 exposes one web UI for each Spark application driver running in
      Cloudera Machine Learning. The UI will be running within the container, on
      the port specified by the environmental variable
        CDSW_SPARK_PORT. By default,
        CDSW_SPARK_PORT is set to 20049. The web UI will
      exist only as long as a SparkContext is active within a session. The port
      is freed up when the SparkContext is shutdown.
Spark 2 web UIs are available in browsers at:
        https://spark-<$CDSW_ENGINE_ID>.<$CDSW_DOMAIN>.
      To access the UI while you are in an active session, click the grid icon
      in the upper right hand corner of the Cloudera Machine Learning web
      application, and select Spark UI from the dropdown.
      Alternatively, the Spark UI is also available as a tab in the session
      itself. For a job, navigate to the job overview page and click the
        History tab. Click on a job run to open the
      session output for the job.
