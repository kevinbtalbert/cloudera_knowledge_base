Modifying database properties
You can modify external database properties such as hostname,
    port, username, password, and database name using the Cloudera Management
    Console. 
If your cluster was installed using the
      OpenShift Container Platform, you can view, but not modify the database
      properties. If the cluster was installed using the Embedded Container
      Service, you can edit the properties. important
When updating the database password, if the User Management Service
          (UMS) and other CDP Private Cloud Data Services share the same
          database, then you must update the UMS database password first,
          followed by other services that share the database.



Sign in to the CDP console.

Click Management Console.

On the Management Console home page, select Administration > Databases to view the Database administration page.
The Database administration page displays a list of
          databases.

Click  located at the right side of each row, for the database you want to modify.
A dialog box appears where you can modify database properties. For example:


Modify any of the following properties: 

Username
Password
Database Host
Database Port
Database Name

Click the Test Database Connection
          button to verify that CDP can connect to the database. If the test
          fails, re-check your modifications and click Test Database
            Connection again.Click Save and Restart. Optional: 
If you have deployed the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) service in your ECS cluster, you
          must refresh the affected Database Catalogs and Virtual Warehouses from the CDW UI. Go to
          the CDW UI, click  on the Database Catalog or Virtual Warehouse and click
            Refresh.

The database properties are updated.
