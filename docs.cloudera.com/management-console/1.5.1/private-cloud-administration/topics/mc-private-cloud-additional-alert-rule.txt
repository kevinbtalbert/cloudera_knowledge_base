Additional operations on the alert rules
You can perform different operations on the added alert rules from the
            Alerts page.

If you want to edit the details of an alert rule, select Edit Alert
                    Rule from the drop-down menu against that rule entry, and update the
                desired fields. You can access the drop-down menu by clicking the vertical ellipsis
                (three dots) against the particular rule entry on the table. The fields that you
                    can edit vary with the type of the alert rule. For example, you can edit only
                    the Severity, For Clause fields,
                    and select or clear the Enable Alert  checkbox for a
                    built-in alert rule. However, you can edit almost all the available fields for a
                    custom alert rule.
If you want to enable an alert rule or disable an already enabled rule without
                opening the pop-up window, select Enable Alert Rule or
                    Disable Alert Rule from the drop-down menu against that
                rule depending on your requirement. 
If you want to delete a custom alert rule, select Delete Alert
                    Rule from the drop-down menu against that rule.
