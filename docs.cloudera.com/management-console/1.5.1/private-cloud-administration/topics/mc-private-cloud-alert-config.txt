Configuring alerts for CDP Private Cloud
Management Console helps you configure alert receivers and rules to trigger automated
        notifications when specific events occur in your CDP Private Cloud deployment. You can view
        these alert notifications on the Management Console dashboard. Further, you can send the
        notifications to specified endpoints.
Configuring alert receiversYou can configure alert receivers on Management Console to trigger automated         system-specific event notifications through external services such as emails, Slack channel         messages, webhook notifications, PagerDuty messages, or SNMP traps. By configuring an alert         receiver, you specify the details of an external service through which Management Console         forwards the notification to the specified destination.Configuring alert rulesYou can define alert rules for your CDP Private Cloud Data Services deployment based on             PromQL expressions. The alerts are automatically triggered when         specific events occur in your deployment. You can view the triggered alerts on the         Management Console dashboard. Further, any alert receivers that you have already configured         start sending notifications to specified endpoints.Additional operations on the alert rulesYou can perform different operations on the added alert rules from the             Alerts page.
