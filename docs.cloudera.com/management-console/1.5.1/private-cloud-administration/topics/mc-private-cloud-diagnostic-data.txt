Collecting CDP Private Cloud diagnostic data
You can collect and download CDP Private Cloud diagnostic data for different
        components and services from the Administration page of the
        Management Console. In addition, you can specify the type of workloads and the duration for
        which you want to collect the diagnostic data.

On the Management Console home page, select Administration >
                        Diagnostic Data.

Click Collect and Send Diagnostic Data.
A pop-up window opens where you can customize the type of diagnostic data to
                    collect.

Specify the various options on the Collect and Send Diagnostic Data window to
                    gather the diagnostic data based on your requirements.
You can specify the following options for data collection: the time duration,
                    the associated environments and services, and the size of the file to include
                    the diagnostic data. For more information on the diagnostic data options, see
                        Options for generating the CDP Private Cloud diagnostic data.

Click Collect and Send Diagnostic Data in the pop-up
                    window.
Management Console initiates the process of generating the diagnostic data
                    based on the options that you select. After the data is generated, the
                        Last Collected Time field is updated with the
                    collection time. 
If your system is connected to the internet, Management Console collects the
                    diagnostic data and sends it to Cloudera Support.

To manually download the diagnostic data, click the Last Collected
                    link.
The diagnostic data is downloaded in a .zip file. You can
                    send this file to Cloudera support.
