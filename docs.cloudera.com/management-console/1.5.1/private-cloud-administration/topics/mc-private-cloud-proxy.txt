Configuring proxy hosts for CML workspace connections
If your CDP Private Cloud deployment uses network proxy, you can configure proxy
        hosts that the workloads can use for connections with Cloudera Machine Learning (CML)
        workspaces. You can configure the proxy configuration values from the Management
        Console.

The settings that you configure with the help this procedure
        reflect in newly provisioned CML workspaces only in those
          CDP Private Cloud Data Services that are deployed using the Embedded Container Service
        (ECS). In a deployment using an OpenShift cluster, the default values
        are used. 


Sign in to the CDP console.

Click Management Console.

On the Management Console home page, select
                        Administration>Networks to
                    view the Networks page.

Configure the following options for the proxy values:

HTTPS Proxy
The HTTP or HTTPS proxy connection string for use in
                                        connections with CML workspaces. You must specify this
                                        connection string in the form:
                                            https://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>.noteBoth
                                                <username> and
                                                <password> are optional
                                            parameters. You can specify the connection proxy string
                                            without these parameters.


HTTP Proxy
The HTTP or HTTPS proxy connection string for use in
                                        connections with CML workspaces. You must specify the
                                        connection string in the form:
                                            http://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>noteBoth
                                                <username> and
                                                <password> are optional
                                            parameters. You can specify the connection proxy string
                                            without these parameters.


No Proxy
Comma-separated list of hostnames, IP addresses, or
                                        hostnames and IP addresses that should not be accessed
                                        through the specified HTTPS or HTTP proxy URLs.In the case of CDP Private Cloud Data Services
                                            deployments that use ECS, must include URLs for the
                                                following:
All the ECS hosts in your deployment
Any CDP Private Cloud Base cluster that you want
                                                  to access 
CIDR IP addresses for internal operations in the
                                                  ECS cluster: 10.42.0.0/16 and
