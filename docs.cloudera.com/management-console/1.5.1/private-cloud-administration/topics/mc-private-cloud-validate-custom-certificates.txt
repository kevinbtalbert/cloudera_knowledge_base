Updating custom certificates
In a CDP Private Cloud deployment configured with an external
    vault, the CDP Management services such as Custom Ingress and Custom
    Kubernetes API authenticate to the vault with the help of the
    ServiceAccount's JSON Web Token (JWT) attached to the Kubernetes pod on
    which the services are running. The vault service validates the JWTs using
    the Kubernetes TokenReview API, and verifies the existence of the services.
    However,  if the external service dependency being updated uses an entirely
    new CA certificate that CDP Private Cloud Data Services
    is not currently configured to trust, then that CA certificate should be
    updated in CDP Private Cloud Data Services
    first, then the certificate of the service dependency can be
    updated.
You must have updated the certificates for the services by
            using the Miscellaneous certificate type option mentioned in
                Updating TLS certificates.

Enter the following cURL statement to authenticate to the vault.

$ curl \ 
      --header "X-Vault-Token: <VAULT_TOKEN>" \
      --request POST \
      --data @payload.json \ 
      http://<VAULT_URL>/v1/auth/<KUBERNETES_PATH>/config
Here:
<VAULT_TOKEN>: The privileged authorization
                                token with write permissions on the vault.
<KUBERNETES_PATH>: The path on which the
                                Kubernetes login credentials information is mounted on the vault
                                service. You can find this information specified as the value of the
                                    VAULT_AUTH_PATH property in the vault
                                configmap. Ensure that this value follows the following naming
                                convention:
                                    cloudera-<PROJECT_NAME>-<K8s-host> with
                                the dot (.) replaced by an underscore
                                    (_).
<VAULT_URL>: The URL of the vault service.


The payload.json contains the following information:
kubernetes_host: The URL to access the Kubernetes API
                            server from the vault service.
token_reviewer_jwt: The JWT of the Kubernetes service
                            account that the vault service uses to validate authentication requests
                            from the Management Console services. The CDP Private Cloud installer
                            creates a dedicated service named vault-auth for
                            reviewing the requests.
kubernetes_ca_cert: The CA certificate of the
                            Kubernetes API server with newline characters replaced with '\n'.

The following example shows the contents of
                    payload.json:{
  "kubernetes_host": "https://api.examplehost.com:1111",
  "token_reviewer_jwt": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n.......\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
  "kubernetes_ca_cert": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n.......\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
}
