Configuring CLI autocomplete
The CDP CLI includes a command-completion feature that enables you to use the Tab key
    to complete a partially entered command. Because the feature is not automatically installed, you
    must configure it manually. 

Locate the CLI completer.

which cdp_completer


Add the CLI completer folder to your path:


Find the profile script for the shell profile script in your user folder.

~/.bash_profile



Add the following command to your bash_profiler, replacing
                /usr/local/bin/cdp_completer with the actual location discovered in
              the previous sub-step:

complete -C /usr/local/bin/cdp_completer cdp



Reload the profile into the current session to put the changes into effect. Replace
                .bash_profile with the name of the shell script you discovered in
              the first sub-step:

$ source ~/.bash_profile




Enter cdp and press the Tab key to display the available options for
          autocomplete.

noteWhen you partially enter a command, parameter, or option, the command-completion
            feature either automatically completes your command or displays a suggested list of
            commands. To prompt command completion, you must partially enter a command and use the
            Tab key.
