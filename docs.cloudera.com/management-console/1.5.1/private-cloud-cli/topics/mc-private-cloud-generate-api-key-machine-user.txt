Generate an access key for another user or machine user
Only administrator can generate API access keys for other users, including machine
        users.

Sign in to the CDP console as an Administrator.

From the CDP home page, click Management Console.

On the side navigation panel, click User
                    Management.

On the Users tab, click the name of the user or machine
                    user account for which you want to generate an access key.

On the user account page, go to the Access Keys section
                    and click Generate Access Key.

On the Generate Access Key pop-up window, click
                        Generate Access Key.
CDP creates the key and displays the information on the screen.

Copy the access key and private key to a text file and send it to the CDP user
                    who requires it.
The private key is a very long string of characters. Make sure that you copy
                    the full string. You can optionally download the credentials file containing the
                    access key information by clicking Download Credentials
                        File.

noteThe CDP console displays the API access key
                        immediately after you create it. You must copy or download the access key ID
                        and private key information when it is displayed. Do not exit the console
                        without copying the private key. After you exit the console, there is no
                        other way to view or copy the private key.


Click Close to exit the access key window.

Once you have generated the access key, you can configure
            CDP CLI, SDK, or other utilities that require it.
