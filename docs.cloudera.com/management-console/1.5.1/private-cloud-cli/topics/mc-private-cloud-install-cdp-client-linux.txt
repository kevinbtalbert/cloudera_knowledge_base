Install CDP client on Linux
Install CDP client on Linux and verify that the CDP CLI client is working.

To avoid conflicts with older versions of Python or other packages, Cloudera recommends
          that you install the CDP client in a virtual environment. Use the
            virtualenv tool to create a virtual environment and install the
          client.
Use pip to install the client on a virtual environment:

mkdir ~/cdpclienv
virtualenv ~/cdpclienv
source ~/cdpclienv/bin/activate
~/cdpclienv/bin/pip install cdpcli
To upgrade the CDP client to the latest version, run the following command:

~/cdpclienv/bin/pip install --upgrade cdpcliAfter the client installation process is complete, run the following command to confirm that the CDP client is working:

If virtualenv is activated: cdp --version
If virtualenv is not activated: ~/cdpclienv/bin/cdp
                --version
