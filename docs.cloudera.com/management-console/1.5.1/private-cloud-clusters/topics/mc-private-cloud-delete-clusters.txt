Deleting CDP Private Cloud Base clusters
You can delete a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster from the Cluster
            Details page.

importantIf you delete a base cluster added to your CDP Private Cloud Data Services deployment, any data management operations such as replication policy
                schedules configured on the base cluster will be adversely impacted. Therefore, you
                must consider the possible implications before actually deleting the cluster because
                the action is not reversible.


Sign in to the CDP console. 

Click Management Console.

On the Management Console home page, select
                    Clusters.

Search for the cluster whose details you want to delete and select
                        Delete from the drop-down menu for that
                    cluster.
You can access the drop-down menu by clicking the vertical ellipsis (three
                    dots) against the particular cluster entry on the table.

Click Remove to proceed with the deletion. Otherwise,
                    click Cancel.
