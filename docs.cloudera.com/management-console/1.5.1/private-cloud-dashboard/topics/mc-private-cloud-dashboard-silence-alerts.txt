Silencing alerts
Problems that arise can trigger alerts that persist on the Management Console
        dashboard until the cause is resolved (depending on the alert rule configuration). You can
        use alert silencing to avoid repeated alert pings while troubleshooting issues. 
Silencing an alert


On the Management Console dashboard, click Silence
                        for the alert you would like to silence.




On the Silence Alert pop-up, specify an expiration date and enter a reason
                        for silencing the alert, then click Silence.







Unsilencing an alert


On the Management Console dashboard, click Unsilence
                        for the alert you would like to unsilence.




On the Unsilence Alert pop-up, click Unsilence.
