Monitoring Control Plane using Grafana DashboardsYou can access pre-built Grafana dashboards to monitor your environments. Silencing alertsProblems that arise can trigger alerts that persist on the Management Console         dashboard until the cause is resolved (depending on the alert rule configuration). You can         use alert silencing to avoid repeated alert pings while troubleshooting issues.
