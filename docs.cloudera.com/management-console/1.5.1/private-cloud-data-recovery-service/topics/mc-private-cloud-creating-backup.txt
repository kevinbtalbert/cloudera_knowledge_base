Creating backup of Control Plane and restoring it
The Backup and Restore Manager in the CDP Private Cloud Data Services Management
        Console helps you to backup and restore Kubernetes namespaces and resources on Embedded
        Container Service (ECS) and OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). You can also restore and
        delete the backups.

Ensure that the following prerequisites are complete:
You must have the PowerUser role.
For OCP, ensure that a VolumeSnapshotClass is installed with a CSI
                        driver that matches the CSI driver for the storage class used.

tipData recovery service is a microservice in CDP
                Private Cloud Data Services that backs up and restores the Kubernetes namespaces and
                resources of supported services. Backup and Restore Manager leverages the data
                recovery service capabilities to backup and restore namespaces in Management
                Console. Alternatively, you can use the data recovery service CDP CLI options for
                    Control Plane to create, restore, or delete backups. For more information, see
                        CDP CLI drscp.

The following steps show how to create a backup of the
            Kubernetes namespaces and resources in the Control Plane and then restore it.

Go to the CDP Private Cloud Data Services Management Console > Dashboard page.

To create a backup, perform the following steps:

Enter a unique Backup Name and choose the
                                Backup Entity that you want to back up in the
                                Create Backup modal window.


Click Create. 
This initiates the backup event and generates a backupCRN. The
                            backupCRN appears as a CRN on the Backups tab in
                            the Backup and Restore Manager that you can click

                            backup; click Restore on the Backup
                                    [***name of backup***] modal
                            window, and then click OK to acknowledge that you
                            want to restore the backup.



To delete a backup, perform the following steps:


Go to the Backup and Restore Manager > Backups tab.


Click Actions > Delete, and then click OK in the
