Data Recovery Service overview
The Data Recovery Service (DRS) is a microservice in CDP Private Cloud Data Services
    that allows you to back up and restore Kubernetes namespaces and resources on both Embedded
    Container Service (ECS) and OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). You can backup and restore
    namespaces for Control Plane and other supported services. The "Backup and Restore Manager" in
    the CDP Private Cloud Data Services Management Console, and the CDP CLI options for the
    respective services leverage the DRS capabilities to run the backup and restore events (jobs). 
Cloudera recommends that you create a backup of your Kubernetes namespace before a
      maintenance activity, before you upgrade, or in general, as a best practice.

By default, the data recovery service is located in the
          [***CDP_INSTALLATION_NAMESPACE***]-drs
      namespace. For example, if the CDP Private Cloud Data Services installation is located in the
      cdp namespace, the data recovery service namespace is automatically named
      cdp-drs. If you have multiple CDP Private Cloud Data Services installations (as
      in OCP), the data recovery service is named accordingly. 
When you initiate the backup event in the Backup and Restore Manager for Control
      Plane, the data recovery service takes a backup of the following resources and data:
Kubernetes resources associated with the cdp namespace and the embedded vault
          namespaces of the Control Plane in CDP Private Cloud Data Services. The resources include
          deployment-related information, stateful sets, secrets, and configmaps.
Data used by the stateful pods, such as the data in the embedded database and
          Kubernetes persistent volume claim.

Alternatively, you can use the CDP CLI options in CDP CLI drscp to backup and restore Control Plane.
