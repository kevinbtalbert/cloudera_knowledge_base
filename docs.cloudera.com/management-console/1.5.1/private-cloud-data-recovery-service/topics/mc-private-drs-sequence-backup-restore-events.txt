Learn how backup and restore events work in DRS
The "Backup and Restore Manager "in the CDP Private Cloud Data Services Management
        Console and the CDP CLI options use Data Recovery Service (DRS) to backup and restore
        Kubernetes namespaces and resources on Embedded Container Service (ECS) and OpenShift
        Container Platform (OCP) for Control Plane and other supported services. You can take
        multiple backups and restore any backup as necessary.
Backup event
The backup event does not have any downtime impact and you can backup the
                Control Plane while it is running.
When you create a backup, the data recovery service:

initiates the backup event or job for the chosen backup entity. For
                    example, the Control Plane in CDP Private Cloud Data Services,
assigns an ID called backupCrn to the backup event,The backupCRN
                        appears in the CRN column on the Backup and Restore Manager > Backups tab. Click the CRN to view more details
                        about the backup event on the Backup [***name of
                                backup***] modal window.
creates a backup of the persistent volume claim (PVC) snapshots of the
                    Control Plane namespaces and the backup event's PVC.

tipData recovery service is a microservice in CDP
                Private Cloud Data Services that backs up and restores the Kubernetes namespaces and
                resources of supported services. Backup and Restore Manager leverages the data
                recovery service capabilities to backup and restore namespaces in Management
                Console.

Restore event
Best practices:
Do not delete the
                                [***CDP_INSTALLATION_NAMESPACE***]-drs
                        namespace while the restore event is in progress.
If you want to restore a backup from version 1.5.0 to version
                        1.5.1, you must perform the following steps:
Create a backup of alert rules in 1.5.1 using the
                                    kubectl get alertruletemplates -o yaml >
                                        [***alert backup file
                                    name***].yaml command. This is because
                                alert rules are not supported in 1.5.0 and they get deleted when you
                                restore a 1.5.0 backup in version 1.5.1.
Restore the backup from version 1.5.0.
Restore the alert rules backup that you created in Step
                                    1 using the kubectl apply -f
                                        [***alert backup file
                                    name***].yaml command.


When you start the restore event, the data recovery service:

initiates the restore event based on the chosen backup,
assigns an ID called restoreCrn to the restore event,The restoreCRN
                        appears as CRN on the Backup and Restore Manager > Restores tab. Click the CRN to view more details
                        about the restore event.
deletes the existing resources and data,During this stage of the
                        restore event, the ECS restore vault is sealed and the POD is down which
                        might appear as a failure in the control plane environment. After the
                        restore event is complete, the vault and POD are auto-recovered and
                        restored. Depending on the number of resources and data, this step might
                        take a maximum of 10 minutes to complete.
restores the resources and data from the backup. The restore event
                        has a downtime impact because the pods and data are recreated.
