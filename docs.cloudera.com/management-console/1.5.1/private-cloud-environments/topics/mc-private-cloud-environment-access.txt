Accessing a CDP Private Cloud environment
Once an environment exists, you can access it from the Management Console.
From the details available on the Environments
                        page, you can access the Data Lake cluster, the Data Hub clusters running
                        within the environment, and the Summary page listing the
                        information.
To access an existing environment, navigate to
                                                Management Console >
                                                Environments and click on your
                                        environment.
On the environment details page, you can access the shared Data Lake cluster
                services and Cloudera Manager.
