Environments
In CDP, a private cloud environment is a logical entity that represents the association
    of your Private Cloud user account with multiple compute resources using which you can provision
    and manage workloads such as Data Warehouse, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning. You can
    register as many environments as you require.
Registering an environment provides CDP with access to your user account and identifies the
      resources in your user account that CDP services can access or provision. For private cloud
      environments, resources include compute clusters such as Kubernetes as well as Data Lake
      clusters in CDP. Compute workloads are deployed within these environments. 
A workload receives access to a Kubernetes cluster for compute purposes and a Data Lake
      cluster for storage, metadata, and security purposes within the environment in which it is
      deployed. Administrators can define user permissions and set resource quotas in each
      environment.

CDP Private Cloud environment prerequisitesCDP Private Cloud requires that you set up specific account criteria prior to     registering an environment. Registering a CDP Private Cloud environmentAfter you have set up the CDP Private Cloud requirements, you can register the environment.Accessing a CDP Private Cloud environmentOnce an environment exists, you can access it from the Management Console.Managing the compute clusterCompute Cluster provides information about the Kubernetes version, number of nodes in the cluster, and cluster registration time. You can access the RedHat OpenShift dashboard from here. You can download and update the Kubernetes configuration file.Deleting a CDP Private Cloud environmentDeleting an environment also removes all the resources associated with that environment.
