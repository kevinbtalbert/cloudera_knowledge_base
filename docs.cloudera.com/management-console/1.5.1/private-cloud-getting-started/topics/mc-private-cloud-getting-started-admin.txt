Getting started as an admin
As an admin user for CDP Private Cloud Data Services, there are specific tasks that you
    must perform to ensure that authorized users can log in, and work on the Cloudera Data Warehouse
    (CDW), Cloudera Machine Learning (CML), and Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE)
    experiences.

Accessing CDP Private Cloud
Log into the CDP Private Cloud console as the local admin user for setting up the
        users. If LDAP is already configured with the base cluster, then those LDAP users are
        automatically added on logging in to the CDP Private Cloud console the first time.

Setting up an identity provider
In order to add users from your organization to CDP, set up your identity
        provider. For instructions, refer to Configuring identity providers. 

Setting up an environment 
Register an environment for your organization. Environments in CDP Private Cloud
        provide shared data, security, and governance (metadata) for your machine learning and data
        warehouse applications. For instructions on registering, refer to  Environments.

Assigning roles to users and groups
You must assign roles to the users and the user groups to access CDP Private
        Cloud. For instructions, refer to the following:
Assigning account-level roles to users
Assigning account roles to a group


Provisioning compute resources 
After performing these steps, you are set to start provisioning compute resources
        such as Data Warehouses, Machine Learning workspaces, and Data Engineering clusters. For more information, refer to the
        following:
