        control plane and specific environments. Environment health information is provided from
        Machine Learning and Data Warehouse dashboards.
You can use the Monitoring dashboard to view information about components, resource
            usage, and environments and associated alerts. The information available in these
            dashboards is dependent on the configuration of your environments.
