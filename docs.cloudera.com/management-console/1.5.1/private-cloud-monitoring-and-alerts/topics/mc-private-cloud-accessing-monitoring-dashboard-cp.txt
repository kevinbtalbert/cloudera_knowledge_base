Accessing the CDP Private Cloud Control Plane Monitoring Dashboard
The Control Plane Monitoring dashboard provides health information at the control
        plane level, including which pods are currently running, which pods have restarted recently,
        the amount of CPU and memory the pods are consuming, the average load, and so on. The
        information available in the dashboard is dependent on your control plane
        configuration.
