CDP Private Cloud Interfaces
You can access and use CDP cloud services with the web interface.
Web interface 
The CDP web interface provides a web-based, graphical user interface. As an admin user, you
    can use the web interface to register environments, manage users, and provision CDP service
    resources for end users. As an end user, you can use the web console to access CDP service web
    interfaces to perform data engineering or data analytics tasks. 

CDP CLI
If you prefer to work in a terminal window, you can download and configure the CDP client that
    gives you access to the CDP CLI tool. The CDP CLI allows you to perform the same actions as can
    be performed from the Management Console.
