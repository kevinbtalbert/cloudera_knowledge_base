Management Console
The Management Console is a service used by CDP administrators to manage environments,
    users, and services.
The Management Console allows you to:

Enable user access to CDP Private Cloud Data Services, onboard and set up authentication for
        users, and determine access rights for the various users to the available resources.
Register an environment, which represents the association of your user account with
        compute resources using which you can manage and provision workloads such as Data Warehouse,
        Machine Learning, and Data Engineering. When registering the environment, you must specify a
        Data Lake residing on the Private Cloud base cluster to provide security and governance for
        the workloads.
View information about the resources consumed by the workloads for an environment.
Collect diagnostic information from the services for troubleshooting purposes.
