Backup and Restore Manager
You can use the Backup and Restore Manager in the CDP Private Cloud Data Services
          Management Console to back up and restore Kubernetes namespaces and resources for Control
          Plane on Embedded Container Service (ECS) and OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). Backup
          and Restore Manager leverages the Data Recovery Service (DRS) capabilities to backup and
          restore the namespaces and resources.
External metadata databases are no longer supported on OCP
As of CDP Private Cloud Data Services
          1.5.1, external Control Plane metadata databases are no longer supported. New installs
          require the use of an embedded Control Plane database. Upgrades from CDP Private Cloud Data Services 1.4.1 or
          1.5.0 to 1.5.1 are supported, but there is currently no migration path from a previous
          external Control Plane database to the embedded database. Upgrades from 1.4.0 or 1.5.0
          with external Control Plane metadata databases also require additional steps, which are
          described in the CDP Private Cloud Data Services 1.5.1
          upgrade topics.
