Known issues for the CDP Private Cloud Data Services Management Console
This section lists known issues that you might run into while using the CDP Private Cloud Management Console service.
Known Issues in Management Console 1.5.1

External metadata databases are no longer supported on OCP

As of CDP Private Cloud Data Services 1.5.1, external Control Plane metadata databases are no longer supported. New
              installs require the use of an embedded Control Plane database. Upgrades from CDP Private Cloud Data Services 1.4.1
              or 1.5.0 to 1.5.1 are supported, but there is currently no migration path from a
              previous external Control Plane database to the embedded Control Plane database.
              Upgrades from 1.4.0 or 1.5.0 with external Control Plane metadata databases also
              require additional steps, which are described in the CDP Private Cloud Data Services 1.5.1
              upgrade topics.



OPSAPS-67214: Single Node | Restart Stability | Rolling start is failing with "global
            timeout reached: 10m0s, error when evicting pods"

For the ECS service, rolling restart is not applicable to a single node cluster.

Workaround: Instead of a rolling restart, you should stop and start the ECS
              Service. 


CDPVC-1098: How to refresh the YuniKorn configuration

Sometimes it is possible for the scheduler state to go out of sync from the cluster
              state. This may result in pods in Pending and ApplicationRejected states, with pod
              events showing Placement Rule related errors. To recover from this, you may need to
              refresh the YuniKorn configuration.

Workaround: Follow the steps in Refreshing the YuniKorn
            configuration.


OPSAPS-67340: L1 runs failing as service monitor is in bad health state

Service Monitor (SMON) ends up in a bad health state after restarting the Cloudeara
              Manager (CM) server, reporting problems with descriptor and metric schema age, when
              Kerberos and CM SPNEGO authentication are both enabled. 

Workaround: Use the following steps to restart SMON each time a CM server
              restart is required:
Stop SMON
Restart the CM server
Start SMON
If the health status is already bad, a simple restart of SMON is
            sufficient.


DOCS-15855:  Networking API is deprecated after upgrade to CDP Private Cloud Data Services 1.5.1
            (K8s 1.24)

When the control plane is upgraded from 1.4.1 to 1.5.1, the Kubernates version
              changes to 1.24. The Livy pods running in existing Virtual Clusters (VCs) use a
              deprecated networking API for creating ingress for Spark driver pods. Because the old
              networking API is deprecated and does not exist in Kubernates 1.24, any new job run
              will not work for the existing VCs. 



CDPQE-24295: Update docker client on docker.lab.eng.hortonworks machine

When you attempt to execute the Docker command to fetch the Cloudera-provided images
              into your air-gapped environment, you may encounter an issue where Docker pulls an
              incorrect version of the HAProxy image, especially if you are using an outdated Docker
              client. This situation arises due to the Cloudera registry containing images with
              multiple platform versions. Unfortunately, older Docker clients may lack the
              capability to retrieve the appropriate architecture version, such as amd64. 

Workaround: Update the Docker client. It has been demonstrated that Docker
              20.10.5 and later versions have been successful in resolving this problem.


OPSX-4326: OCP upgrade from 1.5.0 to 1.5.1 â€“ Restore is unsuccessful after
            upgrade

After upgrading CDP Private Cloud Data Services on OCP
              from 1.5.0 to 1.5.1, Restore using a 1.5.0 backup could not be performed
              successfully.

Workaround: Make a backup of the OpenShift routes before upgrading to 1.5.1.
              If you need to restore the control plane on a CDP Private Cloud Data Services1.5.1
              OpenShift cluster using a 1.5.0 backup, contact Cloudera Customer Support.


OPSX-4266: ECS upgrade from 1.5.0 to 1.5.1 is failing in Cadence schema update
            job

When upgrading from ECS 1.5.0 to 1.5.1, the CONTROL_PLANE_CANARY fails with the
              following error: 

Firing alerts for Control Plane: Job did not complete in time, Job failed to complete. 

 And the cdp-release-cdp-cadence-schema-update job fails.

Workaround: Use the following steps to manually execute the job: 

Export the job manifest into a file:
kubectl get job cdp-release-cdp-cadence-schema-update -n <cdp> -o yaml > job.yaml

Delete the cdp-release-cdp-cadence-schema-update
                  job:kubectl delete job cdp-release-cdp-cadence-schema-update -n <cdp>
Remove runtime information from the manifest, such
                  as:resourceVersion
uid
selector
  matchLabels
    controller-uid
labels
  controller-uid
status section
Create the job:kubectl apply -f job.yaml

If the job still fails, contact Cloudera Support. 



OPSX-4076:
When you delete an environment after the backup event, the
            restore operation for the backup does not bring up the environment. 
Create the environment manually.




OPSX-4295:
The logs for the backups created in CDP Private Cloud Data
            Services 1.5.0 version do not appear after you upgrade to version 1.5.1.



OPSX-4024: CM truststore import into unified truststore should handle duplicate
            CommonNames

If multiple CA certificates with the exact same value for the Common Name field are
              present in the Cloudera Manager truststore when a Private Cloud Data Services cluster
              is installed, only one of them may be imported into the Data Services truststore. This
              may cause certificate errors if an incorrect/old certificate is imported. 

Workaround: Remove old certificates from the Cloudera Manager truststore,
              and ensure certificates have unique Common Names.


OPSX-2713: PVC ECS Installation: Failed to perform First Run of services

If an issue is encountered during the Install Control Plane step of the Containerized
              Cluster First Run, installation will be re-attempted infinitely rather than the
              command failing. 

Workaround: Because the control plane is installed and uninstalled in a
              continuous cycle, it is often possible to address the cause of the failure while the
              command is still running, at which point the next attempted installation should
              succeed. If this is not successful, abort the First Run command, delete the
              Containerized Cluster, address the cause of the failure, and then retry from the
              beginning of the Add Cluster wizard. Any nodes that are reused must be cleaned before
              re-attempting installation.
OPSX-3666: mlx_crud_app DB connection fails with error "unable to create connection:
            x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs instead"

After upgrade, the mlx-crud-app fails with the error "unable to create connection:
              x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs instead" 

Workaround: If you are upgrading from CDP Private Cloud Data Services 1.4.1
              or 1.5.0 to 1.5.1, and you were previously using an external database, you must
              regenerate the DB certificate with SAN before upgrading to CDP Private Cloud Data
              Services 1.5.1.


OPSAPS-66166:  FreeIPA cmadminrole needs more privileges for PvC+ after upgrade

After upgrade, the Cloudera Manager admin role may be missing the Host Administrators
              privilege in an upgraded cluster. 

Workaround: The cluster administrator should run the following command to
              manually add this privilege to the role.
ipa role-add-privilege <cmadminrole> --privileges="Host Administrators"



COMOPS-2822:  OCP error x509: certificate signed by unknown authority

The error x509: certificate signed by unknown authority usually
              means that the Docker daemon that is used by Kubernetes on the managed cluster does
              not trust the self-signed certificate.

Workaround: Usually the fix is to copy the certificate to the path below on
              all of the worker nodes in the cluster:
/etc/docker/certs.d/<your_registry_host_name>:<your_registry_host_port>/ca.crt



OPSX-4225: Upgrade failed as cadence pods are crashlooping post upgrade 

When doing a fresh install of CDP Private Cloud Data Services 1.5.1,
              external metadata databases are no longer supported. Instead, the CDP Private Cloud Data Services
              installer will create an embedded database pod by default, which runs inside the
              Kubernetes cluster to host the databases required for installation.
If you are upgrading from CDP Private Cloud Data Services 1.4.1
              or 1.5.0 to 1.5.1, and you were previously using an external database, you must run
              the following psql commands to create the required databases. You
              should also ensure that the two new databases are owned by the common database users
              known by the control plane.

CREATE DATABASE db-cadence;
CREATE DATABASE db-cadence-visibility;




OPSAPS-67046: Docker Server role fails to come up and returns a connection error
            during ECS upgrade 

When upgrading from 1.4.1 to 1.5.1, a Docker server role can sometimes fail to come
              up and return the following error:

grpc: addrConn.createTransport failed to connect to {unix:///var/run/docker/containerd/containerd.sock <nil> 0 <nil>}. 
Err :connection error: desc = "transport: error while dialing: dial unix:///var/run/docker/containerd/containerd.sock: timeout". 
Reconnecting... module=grpc 
failed to start containerd: timeout waiting for containerd to start

This error appears in the stderr file of the command, and can be
              caused by a mismatch in the pid of containerd.

Workaround: 
Ensure that the problematic Docker server role has been stopped.
Log in to the failing Docker server host.
Run the following commands:
                cd /var/run/docker/containerd/
rm containerd.pid
Restart the Docker server role.




Longhorn-4212 Somehow the Rebuilding field inside volume.meta is
            set to true causing the volume to get stuck in attaching/detaching loop

This is a condition that can occur in ECS Longhorn storage.


Since the volume has only 1 replica in this case, we can:
1. Scale down the workload. The Longhorn volume will be detached.
2. Wait for the Longhorn volume to be detached.
3. SSH into the node that has the replica.
4. cd into the replica folder (for example,
                /longhorn/replicas/pvc-126d40e2-7bff-4679-a310-e444e84df267-1a5dc941).
5. Change the"Rebuilding" field from true to false
              in the volume.meta file.
6. Scale up the workload to attach the volume.

OPSX-3528: [Pulse] Prometheus config reload fails if
              multiple remote storage configurations exist with the same name
It is possible to create multiple remote storage
              configurations with the same name. However, if such a situation occurs, the metrics
              will not flow to the remote storage as the config reload of the original prometheus
              will fail.
At any point in time, there should never be multiple

INSIGHT-2469: COE Insight from case 922848: Not able to
            connect to bit bucket
After installing CML on an ECS cluster, users were not able to
            connect the internal bitbucket repo. 
Workaround:


In this case the MTU of the ECS virtual network interfaces were larger than that of
              host external interface, which may cause the network requests from ECS containers to
              get truncated. 
The Container Network Interface (CNI) is a framework for dynamically configuring
              networking resources. CNI integrates smoothly with Kubenetes to enable the use of an
              overlay or underlay network to automatically configure the network between pods.
              Cloudera ECS uses Calico as the CNI network provider.
The MTU of the podsâ€™ virtual network interface can be seen by running the
                ifconfig command.
The default MTU of the virtual network interfaces is 1450.
The MTU setting of the virtual interfaces is stored as a configmap in the kube-system
              namespace. To modify the MTU, edit the rke2-canal-config
              configmap.

$ /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl --kubeconfig 
 /etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml --namespace kube-system 
 edit cm rke2-canal-config

Find the veth_mtu parameter in the YAML content. Modify the default
              value of 1450 to the required MTU size. 
Next, restart the rke2-canal pods from the kube-system namespace.
              There will be rke2-canal pods for each ECS node.
After the pods are restarted, all subsequent new pods will use the new MTU setting.
              However, existing pods that are already running will remain on the old MTU setting.
              Restart all of the pods to apply the new MTU setting.


OPSAPS-67046: Docker Server role fails to come up and returns a connection error

A Docker server role can sometimes fail to come up and return the following
              error:

grpc: addrConn.createTransport failed to connect to {unix:///var/run/docker/containerd/containerd.sock <nil> 0 <nil>}. 
Err :connection error: desc = "transport: error while dialing: dial unix:///var/run/docker/containerd/containerd.sock: timeout". 
Reconnecting... module=grpc 
failed to start containerd: timeout waiting for containerd to start

This error appears in the stderr file of the command, and can be
              caused by a mismatch in the pid of containerd.

Workaround: 
Ensure that the problematic Docker server role has been stopped.
Log in to the failing Docker server host.
Run the following commands:

OPSX-1405: Able to create multiple
            CDP PVC Environments with the same name
If two users try to create an environment
            with the same name at the same time, it might result in an unusable
            environment.
Delete the environment and try again
            with only one user trying to create the environment.


OPSX-1412: Creating a new environment
            through the CDP CLI reports intermittently that "Environment name is
            not unique" even though it is unique
When multiple users try to create the same
            environment at the same time or use automation to create an
            environment with retries, create environment may fail on collision
            with a previous request to create an environment.
Delete the existing environment, wait
            5 minutes, and try again.

OPSX-2062: Platform not shown on the
            Compute Cluster UI tab
On CDP Private Console UI in ECS, when
            listing the compute clusters, the Platform field is empty (null)
            instead of displaying RKE as the Platform.
None.


OPSX-2713: ECS Installation: Failed
            to perform First Run of services.
If an issue is encountered during the
            Install Control Plane step of Containerized Cluster First Run,
            installation will be re-attempted infinitely rather than the command
            failing.
Since the control plane is installed
            and uninstalled in a continuous cycle, it is often possible to
            address the cause of the failure while the command is still running,
            at which point the next attempted installation should succeed. If
            this is not successful, abort the First Run command, delete the
            Containerized Cluster, address the cause of the failure, and retry
            from the beginning of the Add Cluster wizard. Any nodes that are
            re-used must be cleaned before re-attempting installation. 


OPSX-735: Kerberos service should
            handle CM downtime
The Cloudera Manager Server in the base
            cluster must be running in order to generate Kerberos principals for
            Private Cloud. If there is downtime, you may observe
            Kerberos-related errors.
Resolve downtime on Cloudera Manager.
            If you encountered Kerberos errors, you can retry the operation
            (such as retrying creation of the Virtual Warehouse).

OPSX-2484: FileAlreadyExistsException
            during timestamp filtering
The timestamp filtering may result in
            FileAlreadyExistsException when there is a file with same name
            already existing in the tmp directory. 



OPSX-2772: For Account Administrator user, update roles
            functionality should be disabled
An Account Administrator user holds the biggest set of
            privileges, and is not allowed to modify via current UI, even user try to modify
            permissions system doesn't support changing for account administrator.



Known Issues for Management Console 1.3.x and lower


Recover fast in case of a Node failures with
            ECS HA
When a node is deleted from cloud or made
            unavailable, it is observed that the it takes more than two minutes
            until the pods were rescheduled on another node.
It takes some time for the nodes to
            recover. Failure detection and pod-transitioning are not
            instantaneous.


Cloudera Manager 7.6.1 is not compatible
            with CDP Private Cloud Data Servicesversion 1.3.4. 
You must use Cloudera Manager version 7.5.5
            with this release. 





CDP Private Cloud Data Services ECS
            Installation: Failed to perform First Run of services.
If an issue is encountered during the
            Install Control Plane step of Containerized Cluster First Run,
            installation will be re-attempted infinitely rather than the command
            failing.
Workaround: Since the control
            plane is installed and uninstalled in a continuous cycle, it is
            often possible to address the cause of the failure while the command
            is still running, at which point the next attempted installation

Environment creation through the CDP CLI
            fails when the base cluster includes Ozone
Problem: Attempt to create an
            environment using the CDP command-line interface fails in a CDP Private Cloud Data Services deployment when the Private Cloud Base cluster is in a degraded
            state and includes Ozone service. 
Workaround: Stopping the Ozone
            service temporarily in the Private Cloud Base cluster during
            environment creation prevents the control plane from using Ozone as
            a logging destination, and avoids this issue.


Filtering the diagnostic data by time range
            might result in a FileAlreadyExistsException
Problem:Filtering the collected
            diagnostic data might result in a FileAlreadyExistsException if the
            /tmp directory already contains a file by that name.
There is currently no workaround for
            this issue.


Full cluster name does not display in the
            Register Environment Wizard

None


Kerberos service does not always handle
            Cloudera Manager downtime
Problem: The Cloudera Manager Server
            in the base cluster must be running to generate Kerberos principals
            for CDP Private Cloud. If there is downtime, you might observe
            Kerberos-related errors.
 Resolve downtime issues on Cloudera
            Manager. If you encounter Kerberos errors, you can retry the
            concerned operation such as creating Virtual Warehouses.


Management Console allows registration of
            two environments of the same name
Problem: If two users attempt to
            register environments of the same name at the same time, this might
            result in an unusable environment.
Delete the environment and ensure that
            only one user attempts to register a new environment.


Not all images are pushed during
            upgrade
A retry of a failed upgrade intermittently
            fails at the Copy Images to Docker Registry step due to images not
            being found locally.
The failed images can be loaded
            manually (with a docker load), and the upgrade resumed. To identify
            which images need to be loaded take a look at the stderr file. The
            downloaded images are present in the Docker Data Directory.


The Environments page on the Management
            Console UI for an environment in a deployment using ECS does not
            display the platform name
Problem: When you view the details of
            an environment using the Management Console UI in a CDP Private Cloud Data Services deployment using ECS, the Platform field
            appears blank. 
Use the relevant CDP CLI command from
            the environments module to view the required
            details.


Updating user roles for the admin user does
            not update privileges 
In the Management Console, changing roles on
            the User Management page does not change
            privileges of the admin user. 
None


Upgrade applies values that cannot be
            patched
If the size of a persistent volume claim in
            a Containerized Cluster is manually modified, subsequent upgrades of
            the cluster will fail.
