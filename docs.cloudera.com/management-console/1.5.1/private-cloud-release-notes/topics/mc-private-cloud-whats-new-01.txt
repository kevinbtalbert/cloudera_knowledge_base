This is the first release of the CDP Private Cloud Management Console
    service.
The Management Console service provides the following capabilities:
Registering environments
In a CDP Private Cloud deployment, an environment represents that the
                        association between a Data Lake and multiple compute resources using which
                        you can provision and manage workloads for services such as Data Warehouse
                        and Machine Learning. You can register as many environments as you
                            require.For more information, see Private Cloud Environments.
Managing users
The CDP Private Cloud Management Console service allows you to perform
                        different type of user management tasks such as creating and onboarding
                        different types of users, configuring identity providers, adding users,
                        assigning roles to users, generating access keys, and removing roles
                        assigned to users.For more information, see Private Cloud User
                            Management.
Accessing resource utilization and health monitoring dashboards
The CDP Private Cloud Management Console service contains dashboards that
                        help you track the consumption of compute resources and monitor health
                        information. The resource utilization dashboard provides an overview of the
                        resources consumed by the CDP workloads while the monitoring dashboards
                        provide health information for both the control plane and specific
                            environments.For more information, see Private Cloud Resource Utilization and  Private Cloud Monitoring and
                                Alerts.
