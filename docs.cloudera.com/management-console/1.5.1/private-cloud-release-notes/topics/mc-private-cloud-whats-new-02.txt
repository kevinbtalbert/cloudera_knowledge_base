Support for Red Hat OpenShift version 4.5
This release of CDP Private Cloud now supports Red Hat OpenShift Container
                        Platform version 4.5.x or later.For more information, see OpenShift Container Platform
                                requirements.
Viewing the Platform Management Dashboard
You can get insights into the resource utilization and health of the CDP
                        Private Cloud Management Console components and the active environments
                        through the new Dashboard page.For more
                            information, see Management Console
                            Dashboard.
Updating TLS certificates
You can now update TLS certificates that the Management Console uses for
                        secure connections with an external database, an external vault, and the
                        Cloudera Manager associated with the CDP Private Cloud base cluster. For
                            more information, see the following:

                                        secure database connection

                                        secure Cloudera Manager connection

Support for OpenLDAP
In addition to authenticating users through Microsoft Active Directory LDAP,
                        you can now use OpenLDAP for authenticating users.For more information,
                            see User Management.
Importing users in bulk
You can now perform a bulk import of users to CDP Private Cloud and assign
                        them rights and roles. This improves the experience from the previous
                        version where each user was required to log in at least once before access
                        rights could be configured. For more information, see Importing or uploading
                            users.
