The 1.3.1 release of the CDP Private Cloud Management Console service provides the
        following new features:

Support for new resource roles
CDP Private Cloud Management Console introduces two new resource roles for
                    managing the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) services: DEAdmin and DEUser. 
The DEAdmin role grants a CDP user/group the permission to create,
                            delete and administer Cloudera Data Engineering services for a given CDP
                            environment. 
The DEUser role grants a CDP user/group the permission to list and use
                            Cloudera Data Engineering services for a given CDP environment. 
For more information, see Understanding roles.
Support for CDP CLI
CDP Private Cloud Data Services enables you to configure the CDP client that gives
                    you access to the CDP CLI tool. The CDP CLI allows you to perform the same
                    actions as can be performed from the Management Console.For more information,
                        see CDP Private Cloud CLI.
Configuring alert rules
CDP Private Cloud Management Console enables you to define alert rules based on
                        PromQL expressions. The alerts are
                    automatically triggered when specific events occur in your CDP Private Cloud Data Services deployment.

For more information, see Configuring alert rules.
