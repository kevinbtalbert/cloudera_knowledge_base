Resource Utilization DashboardCloudera DocsResource Utilization Dashboard
Resource Utilization provides an overview of the resources consumed by the CDP workloads
  for a specific environment. You can get information about all compute clusters used across
  environments and compute resource utilization within these compute clusters. You can view
  information about the number of cores and the memory used by a specific environment. Using this
  data, you can plan your resource allocation for the workloads.
You can select a time range from the available options, between five minutes and 15 days, and
   view resource utilization data of a specific environment. 
noteWhen you select a time range to display that is longer than the available data, this
   message appears below each graph. “Note: Some data for the selected time range is
    missing, which may cause this graph to appear misleading. Select a shorter range.”
