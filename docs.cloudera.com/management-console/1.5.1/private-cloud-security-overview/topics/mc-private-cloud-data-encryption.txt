Handling of sensitive data in CDP 
CDP uses Vault to encrypt sensitive data (such as tokens, passwords, and encryption
    keys).
CDP Private cloud uses the Embedded/External Vault to store user credentials and some critical
      system data pertaining to the Control Plane that includes the machine user password used to
      create the control plane, the contents of the kubeconfig file which provides admin access to
      the Kubernetes Control Plane, and the LDAP credentials configured for the ECS Cluster.
The CDP Private Cloud installer can install Vault, but for OpenShift environments,
      typically this is a pre-existing customer-managed external Vault deployment.
