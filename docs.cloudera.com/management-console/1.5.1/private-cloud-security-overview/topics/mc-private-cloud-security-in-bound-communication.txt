Secure in-bound communication
CDP uses Vault to encrypt sensitive data (such as tokens, passwords, certificates, and
    encryption keys). The CDP Private Cloud installer can install Vault, but typically this is a
    pre-existing customer-managed Vault deployment. 
Data Warehouse communication endpoints
The Data Warehouse service runs on top of a Kubernetes cluster and does not include a
        Cloudera Manager instance.
Primary command and control communication goes to the Kubernetes API server. This endpoint
        is specific to a particular Kubernetes cluster. The Data Warehouse service does not make
        connections to endpoints in the cluster.

Machine Learning communication endpoints
In terms of communication, a Machine Learning Workspace looks very similar to a Data 
       Warehouse workspace in that it is also a Kubernetes cluster, although the contents differ.
Primary command and control communication goes to the Kubernetes API server. This endpoint
        is specific to a particular Kubernetes cluster. The Machine Learning service does not make
        connections to endpoints in the cluster.
