CDP user management
The Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Private Cloud Management Console includes a user
    management system that allows you to integrate your LDAP identity provider and manage user
    access to CDP resources.
When CDP Private Cloud is installed, a CDP account administrator user is created. A
      CDP account administrator has all privileges and can perform any task in CDP. Administrators
      can create other administrators by assigning the EnvironmentAdmin role to users. CDP users
      with the EnvironmentAdmin role can also register environments and create Data Lake
      clusters.
The CDP Private Cloud Management Console also enables account administrators to
      federate access to CDP by configuring an external LDAP identity provider. CDP users can
      include users synched with an external LDAP identity provider, or machine users. Machine users
      can be assigned roles and resource roles, but cannot log in to the web console.
