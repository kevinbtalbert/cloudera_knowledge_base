Assigning a group membership administrator
As a CDP administrator, you can create a CDP group and manage the users, roles, and resources assigned to the group. You can also assign other users and groups the IamGroupAdmin role to allow them to manage the users in the group.

noteThe IamGroupAdmin role grants a user or group the permission to add users to or remove
        users from a group. The role does not grant permission to manage roles and resources for the
        group.

CLI
You can assign the IamGroupAdmin resource role to users and groups to allow them to
            manage the users in a specified group.
You can use the following command to assign the IamGroupAdmin role to a
              user:cdp iam assign-user-resource-role \
--user <value> \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value>
The user parameter requires the CRN of the user to whom you
                want to assign the IamGroupAdmin resource role.
The resource-role-crn parameter requires the CRN of the
                IamGroupAdmin role.
The resource-crn parameter requires the CRN of the group on
                which the user will have administrator permission.

To assign the IamGroupAdmin role to a
              group:cdp iam assign-group-resource-role \
--group-name <value>e \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value> 
The group-name parameter requires the name of the group to
                which you want to assign the  resource role.
The resource-role-crn parameter requires the CRN of the
                IamGroupAdmin role.
The resource-crn parameter requires the CRN of the group on
                which the group specified in the group-name parameter will have
                administrator permission.For example, to assign the IamGroupAdmin to GroupABC so
                  that GroupABC can manage the users in GroupXYZ, run a command similar to the
                  following
                  command:cdp iam assign-group-resource-role \
--group-name groupABC \
--resource-role-crn crn:cdp:iam:us-west-1:cdp:resourceRole:IamGroupAdmin \
--resource-crn crn:cdp:iam:us-west-1:4e9d74e5-1cad-47d8-b645-7ccf9edbb73d:group:GroupXYZ/54218ac1-187b-40f7-aadb-5ghm96c35xy4
To assign the users in a group to be the administrators of their own group, set
                the values of the group-name parameter and the
                  resource-crn parameter to refer to the same group.
