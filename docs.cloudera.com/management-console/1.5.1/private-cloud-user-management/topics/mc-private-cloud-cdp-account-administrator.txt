CDP account administrator
CDP designates a default user account as a CDP account administrator during the initial
  setup.
A CDP account administrator has administrator privileges in CDP. The CDP account administrator
            user account cannot be managed within CDP. The default username and password for CDP
            account administrator is admin/admin. You should consider
            changing the default password for security purposes. You must contact Cloudera support
            to add or remove an account administrator from your CDP account.
As an account administrator, you have all the privileges in CDP and can perform any
   task in CDP. You can set up users and assign roles, services, and environments to users in CDP
   according to the tasks that they need to perform. You can set up another user as a CDP
   administrator by assigning the PowerUser role to the user. However, you cannot set up another
   user as a CDP account administrator.
