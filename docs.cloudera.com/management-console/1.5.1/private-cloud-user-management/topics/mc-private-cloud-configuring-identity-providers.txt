Configuring identity providers
You can onboard users by setting up identity federation with CDP. 
If your organization uses an enterprise Identity Provider (IdP) that is compliant with
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), you can set up identity federation with CDP.

   authentication system in your organization without registering with Cloudera or creating a
   Cloudera account.
