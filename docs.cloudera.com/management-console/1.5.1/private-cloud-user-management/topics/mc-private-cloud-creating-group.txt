Creating a group
You can create CDP groups based on the tasks performed by CDP users in your
    organization.
Before you begin: To create a CDP group and to manage the users, roles, and resources
      in the group, you must have the PowerUser role.
Steps


Management Console UI

Sign in to the CDP console.
From the CDP home page, click Management Console.
In the User Management section of the side navigation panel,
            click Groups.The Groups page displays the list of all CDP
            groups.
Click Create Group.
On the Create Group window, enter the name of the group to create.noteYou must
              consider the following when naming a group:
The group name must be unique and not contain any of the reserved group names.
The group name can be up to 64 characters and can include only alphanumeric
                  characters, hyphens (-), and underscores (_). The first character in the name must
                  be an alphabetic character or underscore.
The group name is not case sensitive. For example, the group name AAa is
                  equivalent to the group name aaa.
Depending on your IdP setup in CDP, you may be able to manipulate the Sync
                    Membership option. To learn more about this option, refer to Synchronizing group membership.

Click Create. CDP creates the group and adds it to the list of
            groups on the particular page.

        group:cdp iam create-group \
