Enabling admin and user access to environmentsCloudera DocsEnabling admin and user access to environments
A user with PowerUser role enables admin and user access to environments in a CDP
    Private Cloud deployment.

A CDP user with PowerUser role creates an environment. 
The PowerUser assigns the EnvironmentAdmin role to the intended user. For
        instructions, refer to Assigning account-level roles to users.
Additional admin resource roles enumerated in Understanding roles should be assigned if
        admin access to specific CDP services is needed. For example, for admin access to the Data
        Warehouse service, assign DWAdmin role. For instructions, refer to Assigning resources to users.
