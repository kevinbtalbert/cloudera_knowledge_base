Onboarding users
To enable users to work on the various CDP components and services, you can onboard them
  by using LDAP.
Configuring identity providersYou can onboard users by setting up identity federation with CDP. Importing or uploading usersYou can bulk import users to CDP Private Cloud and assign them access rights and roles.     Importing users in bulk allows admins to prepare the system for the desired level of access     before users log in to CDP Private Cloud.
