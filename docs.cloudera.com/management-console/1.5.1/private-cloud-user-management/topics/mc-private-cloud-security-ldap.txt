Configuring LDAP authentication for CDP Private Cloud
You can configure LDAP user authentication for CDP Private Cloud from the
            Administration page of the Management Console.
If you intend to use Hue as your SQL
      editor in CDW, you must use LDAP over SSL.

Sign in to the CDP console.

Click Management Console.

On the Management Console home page, select
                        Administration>Authentication.

Configure the following settings for LDAP authentication:



Property
Description
Sample values



LDAP URL
The LDAP server URL. The URL must be prefixed with
                                        ldap:// or ldaps://. The URL can optionally specify a custom
                                        port, for example:
                                        ldaps://ldap_server.example.com:1636.
ldap://<ldap-host>:389 or
                                            ldaps://<ldap-host>:636


CA Certificate for Secure LDAP

The X.509 PEM certificate to be used to access secure
                      LDAP (URLs starting with ldaps://). Ensure that at least
                      one valid certificate is provided. A typical CA
                      certificate is structured as follows:
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE----- 

If you add or update CA certificates
                    and you have deployed the Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW)
                    service in your ECS cluster,  you must refresh the affected
                    Database Catalogs and Virtual Warehouses from the CDW UI. Go
                    to the CDW UI, click  on the more vertical menu on the
                    Database Catalog or Virtual Warehouse and click
                      Refresh.


LDAP Bind DN
The Distinguished Name of the user to bind to LDAP for
                                        user authentication search/bind and group lookup for role
                                        authorization.

Distinguished Name (DN) example:
CN=cdh
                                                admin,OU=svcaccount,DC=example,DC=com
FreeIPA example:
uid=username,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com



LDAP Bind Password
The bind user password.



LDAP User Search Base
The distinguished name indicating the path within the
                                        directory information tree from which to begin user
                                        searches. 

AD example:
cn=users,dc=example,dc=com
LDAP example: 
ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
FreeIPA example:
cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com



LDAP User Search Filter
The search filter to use for finding users. 
AD
                        example:(sAMAccountName={0})LDAP
                      example: (uid={0})Note that
                      a custom attribute can also be used if the directory is
                      configured differently for user names. The
                        {0} expands the currently
                      authenticating user's name entered in the login form for
                      the query.FreeIPA
                      example:(&(uid={0})(objectClass=person))


LDAP Group Search Base
The distinguished name indicating the path within the
                    directory information tree to begin group searches
                    from.

cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com




LDAP Group Search Filter
The search filter to use for finding groups for
                                        authorization of authenticated users for their roles. You
                                        must configure this value such that only the groups
                                        associated with the user logging in are fetched from the
                                            IdP.There are two placeholders that can be used to
                                            match the groups of a user, {0) and {1}. {0} expands
                                            into the user DN and {1} expands into the
                                        username.
For Active Directory and openLDAP compatible directories
                                        this will usually be (member={0}), where
                                            {0} will be replaced by DN string for a
                                        successfully authenticated user through the search/bind
                                        process. This requires configuration of the LDAP Bind User
                                        Distinguished Name field. AD
                                            example:(member={0})
                                            LDAP/FreeIPA
                                            example:(&(member={0})(objectClass=posixgroup)(!(cn=admins)))


Email Mapping Attribute
The LDAP attribute to be used for mapping the email in
                                        Identity Management. If no value is provided,
                                            mail is used as the default email
                                        mapping attribute.Email is a mandatory value in CDP. If
                                            no value is found for the email attribute, a value of
                                                {userame}@cdp.example is assumed
                                            for the user.
