Understanding CDP Private Cloud user accounts
User accounts identify the users who can access services, applications, and
   components in the Cloudera Data Platform.
 Roles assigned to a user account determine the actions
   that the user can perform in CDP.
There are three types of user accounts in CDP Private Cloud:

CDP Account administrator
CDP user
CDP machine user


CDP account administratorCDP designates a default user account as a CDP account administrator during the initial   setup.CDP userTo perform tasks using CDP and its services, you must be a CDP user with the required   roles and resources assigned.CDP machine userA machine user account provides programmatic access to CDP. Create a machine user   account if you have an application that needs to access the CDP services with Management Console   APIs.
