AWS setup for audit archiving
While the auditing system stores generated audit events initially into a cloud provider
  managed database, after a specific amount of time, audit logs are exported to customer-managed
  storage, in their own cloud provider. As a result, you need to set up audit archiving for your
  platform.
Configuring audit event archiving through the UITo configure archiving, you must create an AWS IAM role specifically for audit event     archiving. Then create an audit credential using the cross-account role ARN. Setting up an AWS policy and role to configure archiving using the CLITo configure archiving through the CDP CLI, you must first set up a policy and     cross-account role in AWS IAM and obtain the cross-account role ARN.Creating an AWS credential for audit event archiving using the CLITo configure archiving, you must set up a credential for audit event archiving and then     configure CDP.Setting up audit archiving in AWS using the CLIAfter you set up a credential for audit event archiving, you need to configure CDP.     This process is not necessary if you used the UI to create the audit archiving credential and     configure the data storage location.
