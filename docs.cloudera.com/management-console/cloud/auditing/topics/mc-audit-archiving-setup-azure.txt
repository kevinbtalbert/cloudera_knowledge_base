Azure setup for audit archiving
While the auditing system stores generated audit events initially into a cloud provider
  managed database, after a specific amount of time, audit logs are exported to customer-managed
  storage, in their own cloud provider. As a result, you need to set up audit archiving for your
  platform.

While you can use an existing storage account, Cloudera     recommends that you create a dedicated storage account for audit archiving, especially if you     are archiving any sensitive data.Creating a container in Azure To set up audit archiving, you must designate a container for audit archiving in the     Azure portal. While you can use an existing container, Cloudera recommends that you create a     dedicated container for audit archiving.Configuring audit event archiving through the UITo configure audit event archiving for Azure through the CDP UI, create a new audit     archiving credential and then configure the audit data storage and location.Creating a CDP credential for audit archiving on Azure using the CLIAfter you create (or designate) a storage account and container in Azure, you need to     create a CDP credential for audit archiving on Azure.
