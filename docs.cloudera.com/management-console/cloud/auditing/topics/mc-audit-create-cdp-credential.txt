Creating a CDP credential for audit archiving on Azure using the CLI
After you create (or designate) a storage account and container in Azure, you need to
    create a CDP credential for audit archiving on Azure. 
Before proceeding with this task, open the Azure shell in the
      Azure Portal.Required Role:
PowerUser

Use the provided command in an Azure shell to identify your subscription ID and tenant
          ID:
az account list|jq '.[]|{"name": .name, "subscriptionId": .id, "tenantId": .tenantId, "state": .state}'
Take note of the subscription ID (the subscription used to create the storage account
            that you designated for auditing) and the tenant ID for later use.

Use the provided command in an Azure shell to create a new service principal in
          Azure. Substitute your service principal name (whatever you chose to give it, for example
          the container name), subscription ID, resource group name, storage account name, and
          container name where indicated:
az ad sp create-for-rbac \    --name http://{app-name} \    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \    --scopes /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storage-account-name}/blobServices/default/containers/{container-name}
Save the App ID and password from the command output to use in the credential creation
            command.
In the CDP CLI, use the following command to create the CDP credential:
cdp environments set-azure-audit-credential --profile <profile-name> --subscription-id <subscription-id> --tenant-id <tenant-id> --app-based applicationId=<application-id>,secretKey=<password>
The value of the secretKey parameter is the password returned in
            the output of the previous command that you ran to create the Azure service
            principal.
Running this command creates the CDP credential for audit archiving on
          Azure. Take note of the crn returned in the command output, as you
          will need it to configure archiving in the next task.
After you create the credential for auditing, proceed to the
      next task: Configuring audit archiving for Azure using the CLI.
