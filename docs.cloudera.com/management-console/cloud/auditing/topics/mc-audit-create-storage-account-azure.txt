Creating a storage account in Azure
To set up audit archiving, you must first designate a storage account and container for
    audit archiving in the Azure portal. While you can use an existing storage account, Cloudera
    recommends that you create a dedicated storage account for audit archiving, especially if you
    are archiving any sensitive data.
When creating a new storage account, youâ€™ll need to know the
      following pieces of information for creating a new Service Principal in Azure later on: 
Resource group name
Storage account name
Although it is not required, it can be helpful to create a new resource group when you
      create a new storage account, so that future management becomes easier. You can create a new
      resource group in an Azure shell in the Azure Portal by running the following
      command:az group create --location <location> --name <resource-group-name>

In Azure, create a storage account.
In the Basics page, you should be able to accept the defaults for
          all settings other than the name. You should also be able to accept the defaults on the
            Advanced and Networking pages.



When you reach the Data Protection page, you must disable the
          soft delete options for blobs, containers, and file shares. These options are enabled by
          default, so be sure to uncheck the selection boxes for these options, as shown
          below:


Review your changes in the next screen and verify that the soft delete options are
          disabled. If everything looks correct, click the Create
          button.



Alternatively, you can create a storage account using the Azure shell by running the
          following command:
az storage account create --name <storage-account-name> --kind <kind> --location <location> --resource-group <resource-group-name>
