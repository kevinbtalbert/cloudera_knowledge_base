Auditing Control Plane activity
Auditing is used to collect or log evidence of activity in a system that auditors can
  use to both track and analyze to answer questions such as: Who made a change to the system? When
  did a change happen? What exactly changed? Why was a change authorized? 
Control Plane auditing is based on the concept of an audit event. An audit event is a record of
   an audited action which is typically a change in the system that is important enough to keep a
   record of. However, even some read-only actions are audited, because it might be important to
   know who was able to see information in the system, and not just who could alter it.  
Control Plane auditing is scoped to actions that occur within the CDP Control Plane. Audit
   events are not collected from workload clusters; in fact, many Control Plane audit events are
   collected without the need for any workload clusters to exist. 
The auditing system initially stores generated audit events into a cloud provider managed
   database. After a specific amount of time, audit logs are exported to customer-managed storage,
   in their own cloud provider.
