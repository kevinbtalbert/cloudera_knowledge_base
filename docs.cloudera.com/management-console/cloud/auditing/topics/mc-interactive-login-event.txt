Interactive login event
There are sufficient additional details about Control Plane login events that they merit
  their own category. An interactive login event contains the following additional fields. Here, an
  identity provider is an authentication system outside of the Control Plane that keeps identity
  information about users, such as Okta.



Field name
Description
Example


identity provider CRN
CRN of the identity provider as known by the control plane
crn:altus:iam:us-west-1:altus:samlProvider:cloudera-sso


identity provider session ID
identifier assigned to the login session by the identity provider
TBD


identity provider user ID
identifier of the user as stored in the identity provider
spongebob@cloudera.com (for Cloudera SSO, email is used)


email
email address of the user logging in
spongebob@cloudera.com


first name
first (given) name of the user logging in
Spongebob


last name
last name (family name / surname) of the user logging in
Squarepants


account admin
a Boolean flag indicating if the login is for an administrative user
true


groups
names of groups to which the user belongs in their account
TBD


source IP address
IP address of the user logging in
192.168.0.1


user CRN
CRN of the user logging in
crn:...



The account admin flag is only available if login succeeds. The user CRN is not known until
   login is attempted, and the CRN is not always recorded when login fails (for example, if the
   user's account cannot be determined by the Control Plane). Remaining fields are filled in before
   the user login attempt, and so should be present in every event.
