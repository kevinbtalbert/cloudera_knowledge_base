Creating an AWS credential for audit event archiving using the CLI
To configure archiving, you must set up a credential for audit event archiving and then
    configure CDP.
You must have the cross-account role ARN obtained in the
      previous task to finish setting up an AWS credential for audit event archiving.
Complete this task before you configure audit archiving. The
      audit credential that you create here is not tied to an environment, and exists outside of any
      environment, like the control plane itself. The associated role / permissions require write
      access to the storage location, including the ability to create files and
          folders.Required Role:
PowerUser

Use the following commands to create a new audit credential:

cdp environments set-aws-audit-credential \
    --role-arn arn:aws:...

The role-arn information was provided when you created an IAM role.You can view
            audit credentials with this
            command:cdp environments list-audit-credentials
Make note of the credential name created by the command.
Proceed to Setting up audit archiving in AWS using the
        CLI to complete the audit archiving setup.
