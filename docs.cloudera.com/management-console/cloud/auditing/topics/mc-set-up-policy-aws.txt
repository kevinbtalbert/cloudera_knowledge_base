Setting up an AWS policy and role to configure archiving using the CLI
To configure archiving through the CDP CLI, you must first set up a policy and
    cross-account role in AWS IAM and obtain the cross-account role ARN.
In AWS, create a new S3 bucket or designate an existing bucket.
      Be sure to block all public access. Audit events will be archived under the /cdp/cp folder,
      which will be created automatically by CDP.

From the AWS account hosting the bucket, create an IAM policy that permits read and
          write access to the bucket.
For example, substituting your bucket name where indicated:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "cdpauditb",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name-for-audit-archiving>"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "cdpauditbo",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name-for-audit-archiving>/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeRegions"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}


From the AWS account hosting the bucket, create an IAM role for another AWS account, in
          this case, for the account running the CDP Control Plane.





Include the policy you just created as the only one in the role.For detailed
            instructions on creating an AWS IAM policy and cross-account role, see Create a cross-account IAM role, starting with
            "1. Log into the AWS Management Console." Although the audit event archiving credential
            requires a unique policy and Role ARN, the process is largely the same as creating a
            role-based credential during environment registration.
To finish creating the role you will need the account ID (service manager account
          ID) and external ID. Run the following CDP CLI command:
cdp environments get-audit-credential-prerequisites \
  --cloud-platform AWS
noteThe control plane uses a different external ID for each account or tenant. So, be
            sure to look up the account ID and external ID using a user in the account which is
            being configured.
When you finish the role creation process, copy the Role ARN from the role
            Summary page in the AWS Management Console. You will need it to
          create the audit event archiving credential in the next task.
Follow the process in the next topic, Creating an AWS
        credential for audit event archiving using the CLI, to create the audit archive
      credential.
