Adding classic clusters with CCMv1
If your CDP tenant still uses CCMv1, refer to the following documentation for
  instructions on how to register your existing on-prem cluster in CDP Public Cloud.

warningCCMv1 has been replaced with CCMv2. If you started registering your
    on-premise cluster with CCMv1, we recommend that you delete it and start a new registration
    process with CCMv2, as described in Delete an unregistered classic cluster and Adding classic clusters with CCMv2.


Adding an HDP cluster (CCMv1)You must register clusters with CDP before you can use those clusters with CDP services     and components. To ensure optimum security, clusters within the customer environment are not     accessible for communication. They have private IP addresses and cannot be accessed outside the     firewall. However, to add your cluster to the CDP, a communication line needs to be established. Adding a CDH cluster (CCMv1)You must register clusters with CDP before you can use those clusters with CDP services     and components. You can register CDH clusters that can be reached only through private IP     address using a reverseSSH tunnel. Adding a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster (CCMv1)You must add a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster with CDP to register it before you can         use those clusters with CDP services and components. You can register CDP Private Cloud Base         clusters that can be reached only through a private IP address using a reverseSSH         tunnel.Using classic clusters with a non-transparent proxy (CCMv1)If your organization has a non-transparent proxy on the CM node, the following steps   must be performed prior to classic cluster registration. Troubleshooting classic cluster registration errors (CCMv1)While trying to resume the registration process, you can identify the problem behind the error and fix it.
