Adding an HDP cluster (CCMv1)
You must register clusters with CDP before you can use those clusters with CDP services
    and components. To ensure optimum security, clusters within the customer environment are not
    accessible for communication. They have private IP addresses and cannot be accessed outside the
    firewall. However, to add your cluster to the CDP, a communication line needs to be established. 
warningCCMv1 has been replaced with CCMv2. If you started registering your
      on-premise cluster with CCMv1, we recommend that you delete it and start a new registration
      process with CCMv2, as described in Delete an unregistered classic cluster and Adding classic clusters with CCMv2.
A reverseSSH tunnel solves the problem by establishing a tunnel from the cluster to CDP. You
      must download and install AutoSSH and the connectivity install scripts to establish a secure
      two-way communication channel. The AutoSSH ensures that the connectivity is stable. The
      connectivity scripts and their installation ensure safe connectivity and communication. 
Before you begin
caution After you register an HDP cluster in CDP, do not change the cluster name
      in Ambari. A cluster name change in Ambari does not currently propagate to CDP, which can
      result in issues when using clusters with CDP clusters and components. 

HDP clusters must be managed by Ambari. Clusters that are not managed by Ambari cannot be
        registered to CDP. 
HDP clusters must include Knox.
HDP clusters must include Ranger policy settings
LDAP/AD must be set up and synced in AmbariLDAP settings are automatically detected
          from the default topology setup in Knox. If the default topology does not have the LDAP
          setup, you will be asked to provide another topology name where you have configured the
          LDAP. If that topology has LDAP the setup continues. If the LDAP is not configured, you
          will receive an error message.
Kerberos must be enabled on the HDP cluster and the LDAP/AD must be set up in the Kerberos
        authentication so that the same set of LDAP/AD credentials can be used to access Ambari APIs
        as well as Beacon APIs
All clusters must meet the requirements identified in Prerequisites for adding classic clusters.

Steps
The process to register an HDP cluster using a reverseSSH tunnel is as follows:

 Log in to CDP and navigate to the Management Console. 
 Click Classic Clusters in the left navigation panel. 
 Click Add Cluster. Classic Cluster displays the Cluster
            Details dialog box.
If you are a first time user, under Step 1 in the Register Classic
        Cluster wizard, click GET STARTED. Classic Cluster then displays the
          Cluster Details dialog box.If you are not a first time user,
          click the ADD CLUSTER button on the right side of the listing
          page.
 Click HDP. 
 Provide the following connectivity information for your new cluster, then click
          CONNECT:
IP Address
Port
Data center

note Establishing connection might take more than twenty minutes if you are adding the
            cluster for the first time. 
After Classic Cluster establishes connection, it will highlight Step
            2 in the Register Classic Cluster wizard.
 Start the download and installation process for the SSH connectivity files by clicking
        the Files button in Step 2 of the wizard.
Follow the instructions in the Setup Connectivity Client dialog
        box: Download and install the ccm-autosssh-client, and the
          ssh_tunnel_setup_files or
          cluster_connectivity_setup_files onto your new cluster. If the
          installation of CCM autossh-client rpm fails with “No package autossh available”, refer to
            Troubleshooting: Install autossh package.
Copy the files to your Knox node or the Knox proxy host in the cluster.
Run the install.sh script../install.sh
Enter the following information as the install script prompts for it:
Enter Ambari URL (http(s)://host:[port]):
Enter Ambari Username:
Enter Ambari Password:

If Knox is not installed on a proxy server, proceed to Step 13.Classic Cluster
          sets up the topology for the Knox server and establishes the reverseSSH tunnel.
If Knox is installed on a proxy server, Classic Cluster displays the following
            message:We discovered that your Knox is installed in HA mode. Please confirm
            if this node is your proxy node (yes/no):Enter
          yes.Classic Cluster generates XML content that you will need to
          add to your Knox hosts. Classic Cluster also displays three steps you must perform on
            all of your Knox hosts:
Copy the generated XML to
              /usr/hdp/current/knox-server/conf/topologies/cdp_default.xml.For
              example:
<?xml version ='1.0' encoding='utf8'?>
<topology> 
  <gateway>       
    <provider>  
      <role>authentication</role>     
      <name>ShiroProvider</name>   
      <enabled>true</enabled>   
      <param>   
        <name>sessionTimeout</name>  
        <value>30</value>
        .
        .
        .
</topology>>
              

Run chown knox:knox cdp_default.xml.
Check the Knox logs/deployment directory to verify that the
              cdp_default topology is deployed.
After you have completed Steps a through c on all of your Knox hosts, press
              Enter to continue.This sets up the topology for the Knox
              server or Knox proxy host and establishes the reverseSSH tunnel.

Classic Cluster starts checking the connectivity with the cluster. When the connectivity
        is successful, proceed to Step 3 in the wizard.If the connection
          attempts fail or if there is an error in the connectivity, Classic Cluster displays
          troubleshooting information in Step 2 of the Registration wizard.
          Follow the troubleshooting information to fix the connectivity error, then click
            Test connection.
noteAfter you download the files, the ssh files download is disabled. At this point, you
            can regenerate the ssh files using the regenerate files option. This option comes in
            handy if you lose the files previously downloaded before you can set the cluster
            connectivity in the cluster. 

Click Register in Step 3 of the Registration
        wizard.
In the Cluster Details dialog box, provide the username and
        password to access the cluster, then click CONNECT.The user should
          have Admin access to the customer cluster services.
Finish registering the cluster by providing the following information.
Cluster Location
Data Center
Tags (optional)
Description (optional)
If LDAP is not set up on the default topology, the system will ask for the following
          additional information:Enter knox topology name that contains LDAP
            setup:
 Click ADD.
