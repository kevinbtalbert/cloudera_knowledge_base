Adding CDP Private Cloud Base cluster for use in Replication Manager and Data Catalog
        (CCMv1)
After you register the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster as a classic cluster using
        Cloudera Manager and Knox endpoints, you can use the classic cluster in Replication Manager
        and Data Catalog.

warningCCMv1 has been replaced with CCMv2. If you started registering your
                on-premise cluster with CCMv1, we recommend that you delete it and start a new
                registration process with CCMv2, as described in Delete an unregistered classic cluster and
                    Adding classic clusters with CCMv2.
Ensure that the following components and role are available:

The CDP Private Cloud Base cluster has an active Knox service.
A proxy to Cloudera Manager through Knox for communication purposes.
                    For more information, see Proxy Cloudera Manager through Apache
                        Knox.

LDAP is configured in the Cloudera Manager of CDP Private Cloud
                        Base cluster. For more information, see Configure authentication using an
                            LDAP-compliant identity service.

A minimum of one LDAP user with the Full
                        Administrator role.
An LDAP-based topology with CM-API, CM-UI, ATLAS, ATLAS-API, RANGERUI,
                    and RANGER services. The topology name is used during the classic cluster
                    registration process. 

noteIf there are policies that restrict access through Knox,
                then add the topology name to the cdp_default Ranger policy
                so that the Ranger policies can communicate through Knox.

The Management Console acquires the configuration details from Cluster
                        Connectivity Manager (CCM) service.


On the Classic Clusters page, click
                        Files in the Step 2 pane. 

In the Setup Connectivity Client dialog box, click
                        ccm-autossh-client,
                        ssh_tunnel_setup_files or
                        cluster_connectivity_setup_files, and
                        ssh_tunnel_setup_files_knox or
                        cluster_connectivity_setup_files_knox links to download the
                    RPM for AutoSSH from the specified location and the connectivity-installation
                    scripts from CDP and Knox to your machine.

In the Setup Connectivity Client dialog box, click
                        Close.

When the Cloudera Manager and Knox service are on the same host, perform the
                    following steps to create two reverseSSH tunnels to the Cloudera Manager and
                    Knox service:


In the command line interface, copy the RPM and ZIP files to the
                            Cloudera Manager host.


To establish the first SSH tunnel between the Cloudera Manager and
                            Management Console, SSH to the Cloudera Manager host.


Run the following command to install AutoSSH RPM using the
                                ccm-autossh-client rpm file:

yum --nogpgcheck localinstall [***downloaded ccm_autossh-client-rpm***]


If the installation of CCM autossh-client rpm fails with “No package
                                autossh available”, refer to Troubleshooting: Install autossh
                                    package.



Extract the ssh_tunnel_setup_files.zip or
                                cluster_connectivity_setup_files.zip file to a
                            temporary directory.


Run the install script in the directory using the
                                ./install.sh command.


Optionally, you can check the Cluster Connectivity Manager (CCM)
                            service status using the systemctl status
                                ccm-tunnel@CM.service command to verify whether the SSH
                            tunnel is established.


To establish the second SSH tunnel between the Knox service and
                            Management Console, extract the
                                ssh_tunnel_setup_files_knox.zip or
                                cluster_connectivity_setup_files_knox.zip file to a
                            temporary directory.


Run the install script in the temporary directory using the
                                ./install.sh command.


Enter the Knox topology details that you created earlier when the
                                Enter knox topology name that contains LDAP
                                setup: prompt appears.


Optionally, you can check the Cluster Connectivity Manager (CCM)
                            service status using the systemctl status
                                ccm-tunnel@KNOX.service command to verify whether the SSH
                            tunnel is established.



noteIf you regenerate the script files, you cannot use
                        the previously downloaded ssh_tunnel_setup_files.zip or
                            cluster_connectivity_setup_files.zip file because the
                        file is no longer valid.


When the Cloudera Manager and Knox service are on the different hosts, perform
                    the following steps to create a SSH tunnel to Cloudera Manager and another SSH
                    tunnel to the Knox service:


In the command line interface, copy the
                                ccm-autossh-client, and
                                ssh_tunnel_setup_files or
                                cluster_connectivity_setup_files to the Cloudera
                            Manager host.


To establish the first SSH tunnel between the Cloudera Manager host and
                            and Management Console, SSH to the Cloudera Manager host.


Run the following command to install AutoSSH RPM using the
                                ccm-autossh-client rpm file:
yum --nogpgcheck localinstall [***downloaded
                                ccm_autossh-client-rpm***]


Extract the ssh_tunnel_setup_files.zip or
                                cluster_connectivity_setup_files.zip file to a
                            temporary directory.


Run the install script in the directory using the
                                ./install.sh command.

                            tunnel is established.


To establish the second SSH tunnel between the Knox service and
                            Management Console, copy the ccm-autossh-client 
                            and ssh_tunnel_setup_files_knox or
                                cluster_connectivity_setup_files_knox files
                            to the Knox host.


SSH to the Knox host.


Run the following command to install AutoSSH RPM using the
                                ccm-autossh-client rpm file:
