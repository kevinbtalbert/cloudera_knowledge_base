Troubleshooting classic cluster registration errors (CCMv1)
While trying to resume the registration process, you can identify the problem behind the error and fix it.
Issues during registration in CDP


Error or issue details
Resolution



Alert: Registration is pending for a cluster with the same details.
A cluster with the same IP Address and Datacenter cannot registered again. Check if
         you have registered this cluster already. To check this, navigate to the Classic Clusters
         page and search for your cluster in the list.Check if the IP address is
         correct.Provide a different DataCenter name.



Cluster side issues


Error or issue details
Resolution



When installing the AutoSSH rpm on a cluster node, fetching the
         ccm-autossh-client rpm package failed. Multiple mirrors were tried but a
        lot of them resulted in 404/ timed out errors.
Install autossh independently and then try installing the script.
        
       


Connection refused even though the systemctl status ccm-tunnel@CM.service shows that the autossh client is running.
        
       
Make sure you copied the right ssh setup files for the cluster or check if the port
        number CCM_TUNNEL_SERVICE_PORT in cm_reverse_tunnel.conf or
         cluster_connectivity.conf is your Cloudera Manager's port number. 


When running install script on cluster node, the ssh tunnel could not be established (as indicated in the logs generated using journalctl -xe).
       
Check if outbound connection to CDP or HDP control plane (host/port =
        CCM_HOST/CCM_SSH_PORT) is allowed. Make sure to check the firewall rules. 


Test connection failure

Try the following:

Check if the reverse SSH tunnel is running on the Knox
          node:systemctl status ccm-tunnel@KNOX.service
If the tunnel is not running, start the tunnel by running the install script.
If the tunnel is active, check if there are any Ranger policies set up to deny access
          to the cluster. If such policies exist on the cluster, modify or set up policies to allow
          access to the cluster cdp_default topology
If the tunnel is active, check if the port number entered during registration is
          correct.
If the port number is incorrect, delete the registration attempt from the UI, remove
          all the setup-related file from the cluster node and re-register the cluster with the
          correct information.
If the port number is correct, check if outbound connection to CDP control plane
           (host/port = CCM_HOST/CCM_SSH_PORT) is allowed on the directory which
          has the ssh setup files.
cat reverse_tunnel.conf or cat
             cluster_connectivity.conf and collect the following properties -
             CCM_HOST, CCM_SSH_PORT, CCM_TUNNEL_INITIATOR_ID
Check if the NLB is reachable from the node:
On the node, execute the command nslookup <CCM_HOST> to check
              if the NLB is reachable from the node.
If this fails, then the traffic to the cloudera network is blocked on the
              customerâ€™s VPC. 
The customer should check the outbound rules on their VPC to make sure that the
              traffic to the cloudera network is allowed. 







CCM issues
Classic Clusters registration uses CCM, enabled by the installation of the CCM client and
    secrets on the CM node. 



Error or issue details
Resolution



Unable to get endpoint from CCM for key <key>
The Network Load Balancers (NLBs) might be unreachable. 
To verify, find the autossh process on the FreeIPA master host by issuing the
            ps aux | grep autossh command. 
Modify the command by adding the process
           name:ssh -o ConnectTimeout=30 -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/etc/ccm/ccm.pub ... -vvv
Outgoing traffic should be allowed in the port range 6000-6049 on the legacy CDH/HDP
           cluster. 
If there is a proxy in the network it is also worth checking the ssh proxy
           configurations under:

/root/.ssh/config
/root/.ssh/proxy_auth

If Cluster name and Display name are different, few details are missing
         from the cluster detail page. 
Cluster name and Display name must be the same. 





Troubleshooting: Install autossh packageDuring step 2 of the classic cluster registration process, you install an rpm to   establish connectivity between the cluster and CDP Control Plane. If the installation fails, you   can install the autossh using the following steps.Parent topic: Adding classic clusters with CCMv1
