Using classic clusters with a non-transparent proxy (CCMv2)
If your organization has a non-transparent proxy on the CM/Knox node, the following
    steps must be performed prior to classic cluster registration.
noteThese steps only apply if you have a non-transparent proxy. You do not need to perform
      them if you have a transparent proxy.
noteAn https proxy is supported only if the certificate is added to the system trust
      store.
When you register a cluster in CDP as a classic cluster, CDP installs CCM on the CM/Knox node
      of CDH and HDP clusters to establish connection between the on-premise cluster and CDP,
      allowing communication with the CDP Control Plane to kick off replication jobs on schedule. To
      do this, CCM must be able to connect to the outside of the Data Center.
Steps
Create the following file on the Cloudera Manager node (in case of a CDH or CDP Private Cloud
      Base cluster) or on the Knox node (in case of an HDP cluster):

/etc/cdp/proxy.env

The file should include a proxy link. The format of the file should
      be:https_proxy=http://<username>:<password>@<proxy.com>


The <username> and <password> should be replaced with an actual username
          that allows access to the proxy.


The <proxy.com> should be replaced with the URL of the proxy server.


Once youâ€™ve performed these steps, you can proceed to registering your cluster in
      CDP.
