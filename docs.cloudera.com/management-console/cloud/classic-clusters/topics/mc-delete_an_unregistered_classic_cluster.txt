Delete an unregistered classic cluster
If you started registering an on-prem cluster in CDP PC using CCMv1 and have not yet
  completed it, we recommend that you delete the unregistered cluster and re-register it using
  CCMv2.
Classic clusters that are already registered with CCMv1 continue to use CCMv1, but new cluster
   registrations should be using CCMv2. If you started registering an on-prem cluster in CDP PC
   using CCMv1 and have not yet completed it, we recommend that you delete the unregistered cluster
   and re-register it using CCMv2. We suggest this as it will save the future efforts required to
   upgrade from CCMv1 to CCMv2. 
Steps


If you reached step 2 or 3 in classic cluster registration, you should first stop the CCM
     tunnel and then clean up the setup files that you must have downloaded for CCM v1. Run the
     following commands on the Cloudera Manager host (CDH or CDP PvC Base cluster) or on the KNOX
     host (HDP cluster).
Check the tunnel status:
       systemctl status ccm-tunnel@CM.service
Use below commands to stop tunnel and cleanup CCMv1 resources:

CentOS7/RHEL7:CDH or CDP PvC Base
           clustersystemctl stop ccm-tunnel@CM.service
yum remove autosshHDP
           clustersystemctl stop ccm-tunnel@KNOX.service
yum remove autossh
CentOS6/RHEL6:CDH or CDP PvC Base
           clusterservice reverse-tunnel stop 'CM'
yum remove autosshHDP
           clusterservice reverse-tunnel stop 'KNOX'
yum remove autossh



Delete the cluster from the classic cluster UI by clicking on the  context menu next to the cluster
     name and selecting Remove.
Enter the cluster name and click Remove.
