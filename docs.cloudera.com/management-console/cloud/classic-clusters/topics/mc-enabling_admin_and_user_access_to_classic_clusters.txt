Enabling admin and user access to classic clusters
In order to grant admin and user access to a classic cluster, you should assign the
  required roles. 


Consider the following when granting access to admins and users of your classic
     clusters:

You need to be a ClassicClustersCreator in order to register
      classic clusters.
The user who registers a classic cluster gets the Owner role for
      that classic cluster.
Once a classic cluster is registered, the following roles can be assigned to a
      user or a group on that cluster:
Owner - Grants all permissions on the classic cluster in CDP
      including the ability to delete them. It does not grant any cluster-level access (such as
      Cloudera Manager access).
ClassicClusterAdmin - Grants permission to perform any operation on
      the cluster, except deleting it. Grants permission to assign access to the cluster to other
      users.
ClassicClusterUser - Grants permission to access details of the
      classic cluster. 



The roles are described in detail in Resource roles. The steps for assigning the roles
   are described in Assigning resource roles to users and Assigning resource roles to
    groups.
