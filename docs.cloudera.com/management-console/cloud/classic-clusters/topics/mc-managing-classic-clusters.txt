Managing classic clusters
You can register CDH, HDP, or CDP Private Cloud Base clusters to CDP and later
    replicate data and workloads from these clusters to the clusters in your CDP environments. These
    clusters are called Classic Clusters in CDP.
To add or register CDH, HDP, or CDP Private Cloud Base clusters to CDP:

Make sure all the prerequisites are met before adding the classic cluster.
Configure the classic cluster to establish connectivity to CDP.
On the CDP Management Console, add the classic cluster.
