Resume the cluster registration
If the cluster registration does not succeed due to some factors, you can resume the registration, identify and fix any issues, and complete the registration process.

Go to the Classic Clusters page. 

From the list of unregistered clusters that appears, select your cluster and
                    start the process from the point you left off.
