Troubleshooting: Install autossh package
During step 2 of the classic cluster registration process, you install an rpm to
  establish connectivity between the cluster and CDP Control Plane. If the installation fails, you
  can install the autossh using the following steps.
During step 2 of the classic cluster registration process, you install an rpm to
   establish connectivity between the cluster and CDP Control Plane. The CCMv1 autossh client rpm
   has dependency on the autossh package which is used for creating the reverse SSH tunnel from the
   cluster node (Knox/CM) to CDP Control Plane. The instructions on the screen instruct you to run
   the following command:

sudo yum --nogpgcheck localinstall ccm-autossh-client-0.2-20201211113132gita7b10d3.x86_64.rpm

If the installation of CCM autossh-client rpm fails with “No package autossh
   available”, you must download and install the autossh package on the node where you are setting
   up connectivity.
