Configuring a VPC with private IPs in GCP 
Prior to registering your GCP environment in CDP, you should set up a VPC network with
    private IPs, and create firewall rules.
You need the following:


At least one subnet for hosts that will use CCM.


Outbound traffic via the HTTP connection initiated by CCM should be allowed to
          the Cloudera hosted Network Load Balancers (NLBs) on workload nodes.


In the Google Cloud console, configure the following:


Create a VPC with custom (preferred) subnet configuration in the desired GCP
          region.


Create a GCP cloud router in the desired region.


Create a GCP NAT gateway specifying the previously created GCP cloud
          router.


You must configure outbound traffic for CDP resources.


The workload clusters containing CCM (Knox, master, or CM for Classic Clusters)
          must be able to reach the Network Load Balancers (NLBs).


You can use port 443 to connect to the NLBs. 


Create your firewall rules as described in Firewall rules.
