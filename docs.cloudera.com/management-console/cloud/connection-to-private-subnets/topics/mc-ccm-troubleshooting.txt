Troubleshooting CCMv1
You can troubleshoot cluster connection issues that might occur when you use CCMv1 by
    referring to the syslog on your Cloudera Manager node for classic clusters and your gateway and
    Knox nodes for data lake and data hub clusters. 
Search for auto-ssh messages to diagnose any connection problems.
For example, CDP can communicate with clusters that are on private subnets with only private
      IPs without any additional network configuration or setup. However, CDP requires that these
      clusters have outbound connections to AWS NLBs hosted in the Cloudera's AWS account.
Common cases when connection via CCMv1 fails
The following list includes the most common cases when connection via CCM fails
        and steps for how to fix the problems.
In all the cases listed below, it is essential to check if the CCM domain name
        “.ccm.cdp.cloudera.com” has been whitelisted and the port range 6000-6049 has been
        whitelisted for SSL connections. This is because by default SSL connections are allowed only
        on the port 443 but connections to the Control Plane via CCM go through the ports in the
        range 6000-6049.



Reason for connection failure
How to fix the problem



You have not whitelisted the NLB domains or the port range 6000-6049 on your
                  VPC. 
Both the incoming and the outgoing traffic must be allowed from CCM NLB and
                  port ranges.


You are using a transparent proxy and you did not explicitly whitelist NLB
                  domains and the ports on the transparent proxies.
If you are using a transparent proxy, you need to explicitly whitelist the
                  NLB domains and the ports on the transparent proxies.


You are using a non-transparent proxy but you did not register it in CDP. 
If you are using a non-transparent proxy, you need to perform the steps in
                    Setting up a non-transparent proxy in CDP
                  documentation.


Your firewall doesn’t allow traffic to/from NLBs. 
The firewall configured on your VPC should allow the traffic to/from the NLBs
                  and the port range 6000-6049.


The IPs of the NLB do not fall under the elastic IP CIDR block assigned to
                  CCM NLBs.
CCM NLBs have IPs assigned to them which are taken from the CIDR block
                  44.234.52.96/27. If the NLB assigned to the environment/cluster
                    returns IPs that do not fall under this CIDR block when an nslookup call is
                    made, then the IPs returned need to be explicitly whitelisted so that the
                    traffic from these IPs is allowed in your VPCs.



If you are still unable to determine the root cause and fix the issue, you may consider
        collecting more information.

Collecting information from the cluster where connection fails 
Obtaining relevant information such as the NLB domain name, tunnel type (for
        example, CM), autossh client logs, and the syslogs from a cluster helps narrow down the root
        cause. 
The following steps explain how to obtain this information.



Check if the autossh process is running on the cluster:
SSH into the node on which the issue is being seen. Execute ps -aux |
                    grep autossh to see if the autossh client responsible for creating the
                  tunnel from the node to CDP is running.
If the process is running, it would show the command similar
                  to:autossh -M 0 -o ServerAliveInterval 30 -o ServerAliveCountMax 3 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/etc/ccm/ccm.pub -N -T -R 0.0.0.0:0:localhost:<LOCAL_PORT> -i /tmp/pk.key -p <NLB_PORT> <INITIATOR_ID>@<NLB_HOST_NAME> -vvv
Collect the values of NLB_HOST_NAME, NLB_PORT,
                    INITIATOR_ID from the above step. 
Share the collected information with Cloudera support.



Check if the NLB is reachable from the node: 
On the node, execute the command nslookup <NLB_HOST_NAME> to
                  check if the NLB is reachable from the node. 
Use tools such as telnet or netcat to check if it is possible to
                  reach the NLB on the specific NLB_PORT. For example:
                  telnet <NLB_HOST_NAME> <NLB_PORT>
If telnet is not installed on the node, you can use curl telnet as an
                  alternative. For
                  example:curl -vv telnet://<NLB_HOST_NAME>:<NLB_PORT>
If this fails, then the traffic to the Cloudera network is blocked on your VPC.
                  This means that you should check the outbound rules on their VPC to make sure that
                  the traffic to the cloudera network is allowed. 



Collect the following logs and share them with Cloudera support:
The dump of /var/log/messages (which stores the global system messages)
                  is necessary to debug the issue with the SSH tunnel setup by CCM.
The dump of the output of the tcpdump command on the problematic node captures
                  the network messages with the description of contents of packets between the node
                  and the CDP control plane. Cloudera support may ask for this if needed or when the
                  already collected information is not sufficient to debug the issue.
The dump of /var/log/socket_wait_cleanup.log (which stores the logs
                  related to the restarts of autossh process) Note that this log file is only
                  present in environments created after December 12, 2020.



Collect the firewall logs and share them with Cloudera support:
It is useful for Cloudera support to see the logs from your firewall to see if
                  the firewall is closing the connection to the CDP Control Plane.



Collect and share the environment/cluster and CCM related information:
To look up the logs, Cloudera support needs the account id of the customer,
                  environment CRN, and the time period to scan the logs for the issue. 





FreeIPA sync issues 



Error or issue details
Resolution



502 or "Bad Gateway" error such as: 
"Bad Gateway, cause=com.cloudera.cdp.cm.ApiException: Bad Gateway"
Unexpected response from FreeIPA; details: code: 502
Status: 502 Bad Gateway Response

A new parameter defining connection timeout was added to the autossh script
                  placed on images used to provision clusters. Without it, there is no timeout for
                  CCM connections and CCM related services won't restart automatically. If you
                  provisioned Freeipa or Data Lake prior to the implementation of this parameter,you
                  need to update the script by using the following steps:1. Modify autossh
                    command on FreeIPA, Data Lake and Data Hub nodes in this
                    script:/cdp/bin/reverse-tunnel.shAdd new parameter to the
                    command: -o "ConnectTimeout 30"Original command:
                    exec autossh -M 0 -o "ServerAliveInterval 30" -o "ServerAliveCountMax 3" -o UserKnownHostsFile=${CCM_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE} -N -T -R ${LOCAL_IP}:0:localhost:${CCM_TUNNEL_SERVICE_PORT} -i ${PRIVATE_KEY} -p ${CCM_SSH_PORT} ${USER}@${CCM_HOST} -vvvNew

                    Restart ccm-tunnel@KNOX service on Data Lake and Data Hub nodes and
                    ccm-tunnel@GATEWAY on FreeIPA, Data Lake and Data Hub nodes:
                    systemctl restart ccm-tunnel@KNOXsystemctl restart ccm-tunnel@GATEWAY3.
                    Check if modification of the command was
                  successful:ps aux | grep autossh
