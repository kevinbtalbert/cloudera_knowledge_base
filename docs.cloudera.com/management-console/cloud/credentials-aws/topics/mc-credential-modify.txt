Modify a credentialCloudera Docs
Modify a credential 
You can modify an existing credential if needed. You can modify all parameters except
  the credential name. This shows you how to modify a credential from the CDP web interface. There
  is currently no way to modify a credential from CDP CLI.
The modify credential option is meant for cases such as updating your access and
    secret key on AWS in case it expired or changed. 
If the credential that you are trying to modify is already attached to an environment, ensure
    that the modification that you are making still allows access to the resources, such as the data
    lake, running within that environment. 
noteIf you are trying to update the IAM policy used for the credential, do not follow these
     instructions. Instead, edit the policy via the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI as described
     in Editing IAM Policies in AWS docs.
