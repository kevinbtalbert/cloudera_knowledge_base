Introduction to the provisioning credential for Google Cloud
The provisioning credential for Google Cloud relies on a service account that can be
  assumed by CDP.
The following flow describes how the Google Cloud provisioning credential works:


Your GCP account administrator creates a service account and assigns the minimum permissions
     allowing CDP to create and manage resources in your Google Cloud account. Next, the
     administrator generates a service account access key pair for the service account. The minimum
     permissions are described in Service account for the CDP provisioning
     credential.
The service account is registered as a credential in CDP and its access key is uploaded to
     CDP.
The credential is then used for registering your Google Cloud environment in CDP.
Once this is done, CDP uses the credential for provisioning environment-related resources,
     workload clusters, and resources for other CDP services that you run in CDP.
