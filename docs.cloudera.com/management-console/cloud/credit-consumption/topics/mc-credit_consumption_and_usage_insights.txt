Credit consumption and usage insights
CDP includes a user interface that allows you to monitor your credit consumption and
  download your consumption records.
CDP displays consumption data in terms of credits. A credit is a unit of consumption
   in CDP corresponding 1 to 1 to local currency with which it was purchased. For example, if you
   pay $1000, you receive 1000 credits. DIscounts do not affect the number of credits purchased. If
   the full price for 1000 credits is $1000 but you receive a discount and only pay $900, you still
   receive 1000 credits. 
Required roles: BillingAdmin
