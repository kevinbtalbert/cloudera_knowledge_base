Switching image catalogs
You can switch the image catalog of an already existing Data Hub, Data Lake, or FreeIPA
    cluster. You may want to switch the image catalog for a cluster in order to restrict which
    Runtime version can be upgraded to, or in order to move to custom images for an existing
    cluster.
Use the following CDP CLI commands to switch the image catalog for an existing cluster:

FreeIPA:cdp environments set-catalog --environment $ENVIRONMENT_NAME --catalog $CATALOG
Parameter
Description

--environment
Name or CRN of the environment that holds the FreeIPA installation.

--catalog
URL of the FreeIPA catalog to be used.

Data
          Hub:cdp datahub set-catalog --cluster $DATAHUB_NAME --catalog-name $CATALOG
Parameter
Description

--cluster
Name or CRN of the Data Hub for which you want to use the new image
              catalog.

--catalog-name

              catalog, and switching is only possible from catalogs that are JSON based.

Data
          Lake:cdp datalake set-catalog --datalake $DATALAKE_NAME --catalog-name $CATALOG

              catalog.
