Accessing Data Lake services
You can access your Data Lake security and governance services such as Atlas and Ranger
  from the Gateway tab from Data Lake details in the Management Console.
Required role:
EnvironmentAdmin, Data Steward, or Owner of the environment 
To access data lake UIs and endpoints navigate to the Management Console > Data Lakes
   and click on the tile representing your Data Lake. This brings you to the Data Lake cluster
   details page: 
The URLs to data lake service UIs are listed directly on this page, in the Services
     section. Click on the URL for the service that you would like to access and you will be logged
     in automatically with your CDP credentials. All the UIs are accessible via the Knox gateway:
     The URLs listed connect you to a chosen service via Knox and Knox securely passes your CDP
     credentials.
To access API endpoints, navigate to the Gateway tab. If you need to access the
     endpoints, refer to Accessing Non-SSO Interfaces Using IPA Credentials.


Security exception

      The first time you access the UIs, your browser will attempt to confirm that the SSL
        Certificate is valid. Since CDP automatically generates a certificate with self-signed CA,
        your browser will warn you about an untrusted connection and ask you to confirm a security
        exception. Depending on your browser, perform the steps below to proceed:
