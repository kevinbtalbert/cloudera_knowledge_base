Checking the status of a Data Lake backup
After configuring and running a backup of your Data Lake, you can check the status of
        the backup operation.
Checking backup status
Use the following command to see the status of a Data Lake
        backup:$ cdp datalake backup-datalake-status 
      --datalake-name <name> 
     [--backup-id <generated-ID>]
     [--backup-name <name>]
     [--cli-input-json <string>]
     [--generate-cli-skeleton]where
        the options are the following:

Option
Example
Description



--datalake-name
finance-dl
This is the name of the Data Lake as configured in the CDP
                  environment. 


[--backup-id]
415927d9-9f7d-4d42-8000-71630e5938ca
The system-generated ID for the backup. If you don't know the ID or name for
                  the backup, run the list-datalake-backups command to see the
                  available backups.If neither an ID or a name is provided, the command shows the
                    status of the most recent backup operation.


[--backup-name]
pre-upgrade0420
The user-provided name for the backup. If you don't know the name or ID for
                  the backup, run the list-datalake-backups command to see the
                  available backups.If neither an ID or a name is provided, the command shows the
                    status of the most recent backup operation.


--cli-input-json <string> 

Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string
                  follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other
                  arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the
                  JSON-provided values.


--generate-cli-skeleton

Prints a sample JSON configuration file to standard output. If this
                  argument is specified, only the template is produced: the list-backup command does
                  not run.


For example:
        $ cdp datalake backup-datalake-status
      --datalake-name finance-dl --backup-id
      415927d9-9f7d-4d42-8000-71630e5938caThe
        output of the command shows the current status of the backup operation. Note the internal
        state shows the status of each separate backup operation. If any of the individual backups
        fail, the overall status is failed and the backup cannot be
        restored.{

    "failureReason": ""
}

Listing metadata for all backups
Use the following command to show all Data Lake backups in a given storage
        location:$ cdp datalake list-datalake-backups 
      --datalake-name <name>
     [--cli-input-json <string>]
     [--generate-cli-skeleton]where
        the options are the following:

Option
Example
Description



--datalake-name <name>
finance-dl
This is the name of the Data Lake as configured in the CDP
                  environment. 


--cli-input-json <string> 

Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string
                  follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values
                    will override the JSON-provided values.

        example:$ cdp datalake list-datalake-backups
          --datalake-name finance-dlThe
        output of the command shows the metadata for all backups stored for this Data Lake. Note
        that if a backup is listed with status failed, it cannot be
        restored.{
