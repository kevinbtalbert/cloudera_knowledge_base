How to check the status of a Data Lake restore operation.
Check status of Data Lake restore
Use the following command to see the status of a Data Lake
        restore:$ cdp datalake restore-datalake-status 
      --datalake-name <name> 
     [--cli-input-json <string>] 
     [--generate-cli-skeleton]where
        the options are the following:

Description


--datalake-name
finance-dl
This is the name of the Data Lake as configured in the CDP
                  environment. 


[--restore-id]
f0da74a9-3b22-477a-b07c-cb69b211b81c
ID for a specific restore, as reported in the output of the
                  original restore command. If a restore ID is not specified, the command returns
                  the status of the most recent restore operation.


--cli-input-json <string> 

Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string
                  follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values
                    will override the JSON-provided values.


--generate-cli-skeleton

Prints a sample JSON configuration file to standard output. If this
                  argument is specified, only the template is produced: the list-backup command does
                  not run.


For
        example:$ cdp datalake restore-datalake-status
          --datalake-name finance-dl The
        output of the command shows the current status of the restore operation. Note the internal
        state shows the status of each separate backup operation. If any of the individual restore
        operations fail, the overall status is failed and the restoration is aborted. Note that the
        internal restore status lists operations for deleting the existing Solr collections in
        addition to the operations to restore the backed up
        collections.{
