Recovering after a failed scaling operation
Recover from a failed scaling operation using the recovery command in the CDP
    CLI.
You can recover from a failed scaling operation by returning a Data Lake to its
      original state before the resize operation was started. Be sure that this is what you want to
      do before proceeding.
Data Lake recovery simply reattaches and starts the original light duty Data Lake
      in the environment. All of the instances, disks, and databases are unchanged from their
      original state.
If recovery cannot be started, or fails for any reason, reach out to the Cloudera
      support team, who can manually recover your Data Lake. 
Trigger the recovery command through the CDP
      CLI:cdp datalake recover-datalake --datalake-name <mydatalake>
