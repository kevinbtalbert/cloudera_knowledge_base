Renewing private/host certificates on Data Lake and Data Hub clusters
Private (host) certificates have a default expiration date of one year; to keep the
    Data Lake and Data Hub clusters running, you must renew the host certificates before they
    expire. 
Required role (Data Lakes):
EnvironmentAdmin or Owner of the environmentRequired role (Data
          Hub):
DatahubAdmin, Owner of the Data Hub, EnvironmentAdmin, or Owner

        of the environmentDuring cluster provisioning, Cloudera Manager creates an intermediate
      certificate (CMCA) signed by FreeIPA CA. The CMCA is used to create certificates for every
      host with Auto-TLS. There are two ways to renew a private/host certificate. To renew the
        private/host certificates at any time, use the following CLI commands:Data Lake
          certificate
          renewal:cdp datalake rotate-private-certificates --datalake <Data Lake name or CRN>Data
          Hub certificate renewal:cdp datahub rotate-private-certificates --datahub <Data Hub name or CRN>Alternatively, you can wait until the host certificate is close to
        expiration. During periodic cluster state synchronization, CDP uses the Cloudera Manager API
        to check that the HOST_AGENT_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRY apiHealthCheck alert is in a GOOD state. If
        the apiHealthCheck is not in a GOOD state, CDP displays a warning in the UI.These UI
        warnings will display on the associated Environments, Data Lakes, or Data Hubs list and
        details pages. For example:To renew the
        host certificate once you receive an expiration warning, follow the steps below.
noteRenewing host certificates causes some downtime because all services are restarted.
          The Cloudera Manager UI will be inaccessible for some time because the Cloudera Manager
          server is also restarted.

On the Environments, Data Lakes, or Data Hubs list pages, click the three vertical
          dots next to the expiration message.Click Renew Host Certificates or Renew Data Lake
            Host Certificates.

Click Yes when you are asked if you want to renew the
          certificates.
