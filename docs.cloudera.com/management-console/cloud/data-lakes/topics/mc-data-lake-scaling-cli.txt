Scaling the Data Lake through the CDP CLI
You can scale a Data Lake from light to medium duty through the CDP CLI.

Required role:
EnvironmentAdmin or Owner of the environment


Stop all of the attached Data Hub clusters that can be stopped, to make sure that there
          are no changes to HMS metadata during the scaling operation. For any cluster that cannot
          be stopped, stop all of the services on the Data Hub through the Cloudera Manager
          UI.Verify that the DATALAKE_ADMIN_ROLE, RANGER_AUDIT_ROLE, and LOG_ROLE have
          read/write permissions to the backup location. See the Data Lake backup and restore documentation
          for more information on these permissions. LOG_ROLE is specific to Data Lake restore.To trigger scaling from the CDP CLI, run the cdp datalake
            resize-datalake command. For example:
cdp datalake resize-datalake --datalake-name <mydatalake> --target-size MEDIUM_DUTY_HA


Option
Description



â€“datalake-name
Name or CRN of the Data Lake that you want to upscale.


--target-size
Currently only MEDIUM_DUTY_HA is supported.


Monitor the Event History. The scaling operation is finished when the Data Hub
          clusters have been automatically refreshed, which happens after the original light duty
          Data Lake has been deleted. Check the Event History to verify that the Data Hubs have been
          refreshed.When the scaling operation is finished, if you are upscaling a RAZ-enabled Data
          Lake, manually restore the Data Lake from the
          backup taken by the scaling process. To restore, you will need to add the restore_to_raz
          policy in Ranger and then run the cdp datalake restore-datalake command
          in the CDP CLI.
