Scaling post-requisites
Complete the following tasks after you scale a Data Lake.

If RAZ is not being used, resync the IDBroker mappings to the Data Lake.Start the Data Catalogs and Virtual Warehouses. For each virtual warehouse,
          Cloudera recommends that you start, stop, and start again. This will completely refresh
          the Data Lake details for the virtual warehouse.Start the Data Hub cluster services if you stopped them before the scaling
          operation. Data Hubs that were stopped before the scaling operation should continue to
          work when the scaling completes, by communicating with the new Data Lake automatically
          when they are re-started.Scale up the FreeIPA cluster. See Resize FreeIPA.With CDF 2.1 or higher, the steps below are sufficient. For older CDF versions, you
          must re-create the impacted flows.
An alert suggesting restart of the flow is triggered in the Data Flow
              service.
Restart the Flows.
After restart, the flows should start working with the resized Data Lake.
              Not all CDP Flows will be impacted by a resized Data Lake. Only those Flows that have
              a dependency on the Data Lake will be alerted.

Resume the CML workspaces.
