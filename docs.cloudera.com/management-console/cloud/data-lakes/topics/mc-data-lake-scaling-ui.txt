Scaling the Data Lake through the CDP UICloudera Docs
Scaling the Data Lake through the CDP UI
You can scale a Data Lake from light to medium duty through the CDP UI.

Required role: EnvironmentAdmin or Owner of the environment


Stop all of the attached Data Hub clusters that can be stopped, to make sure that there
          are no changes to HMS metadata during the scaling operation. For any cluster that cannot
          be stopped, stop all of the services on the Data Hub through the Cloudera Manager
          UI.Verify that the DATALAKE_ADMIN_ROLE, RANGER_AUDIT_ROLE, and LOG_ROLE have
          read/write permissions to the backup location. See the Data Lake backup and restore documentation
          for more information on these permissions. LOG_ROLE is specific to Data Lake restore.In the CDP UI, click Data Lakes and select the Data Lake
          that you want to scale.Click Resize.

You will be asked to confirm that you want to resize the Data Lake, after which the
            scaling process will begin. The scaling operation is finished when the Data Hub clusters
            have been automatically refreshed, which happens after the original light duty Data Lake
            has been deleted. Check the Event History to verify that the Data Hubs have been
            refreshed.
When the scaling operation is finished, if you are upscaling a RAZ-enabled Data
          Lake, manually restore the Data Lake from the
          backup taken by the scaling process. To restore, you will need to add the restore_to_raz
          policy in Ranger and then run the cdp datalake restore-datalake command
          in the CDP CLI.
