Accessing a Data Lake cluster via SSH
If you plan to access a Data Lake (for example for troubleshooting purposes) via a
  command line client, SSH into the master node.
SSH to a Data Lake node as cloudbreak user
Required role: No CDP role is required
CDP administrators can access Data Lake cluster nodes as cloudbreak user
        with the SSH key provided during cluster creation.
On Mac OS, you can use the following syntax to SSH to the
        VM::
ssh -i "privatekey.pem" cloudbreak@publicIP
For example:
ssh -i "testkey-kp.pem" cloudbreak@90.101.0.132
On Windows, you can access your cluster via SSH by using an SSH client such as
        PuTTY. For more information, refer to How to use PuTTY on Windows.

SSH to a Data Lake node as your own CDP user
Required role:
EnvironmentUser, Data Steward, or EnvironmentAdmin
A user who have the required CDP role assigned to them can SSH to Data Lake cluster nodes
        as themselves.
On Mac OS, you can use the following syntax to SSH to the
        VM::
ssh -i "privatekey.pem" cdpusername@publicIP
For example:
ssh -i "testkey-kp.pem" jsmith@90.101.0.132
On Windows, you can access your cluster via SSH by using an SSH client such as
        PuTTY. For more information, refer to How to use PuTTY on Windows.
