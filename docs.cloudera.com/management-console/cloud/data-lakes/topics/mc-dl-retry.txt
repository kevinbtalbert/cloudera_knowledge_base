Retry a Data Lake
When stack provisioning or cluster creation fails, use the Retry
    option to resume the process from the last failed step.

Required role:
EnvironmentAdmin or the Owner of the environment
Only failed stack or Data Lake creation can be resolved using a retry
        operation. You can potentially run a retry operation any number of times
        on a failed creation process, where each time it runs it resumes the
        creation process after the last successful step.
In some cases the cause of a failed stack provisioning or Data Lake
        creation may be eliminated by simply rerunning the process. For example,
        in case of a temporary network outage, a retry operation may be
        successful. In other cases, a manual modification is required before a
        retry operation can succeed. For example, if you are using a custom
        image but some configuration is missing causing the creation process to
        fail, you must log in to the provisioned node and fix the issue; after
        that you can run the retry operation to resume the Data Lake creation
        process.

note
Only failed stack or Data Lake creation are affected by a retry
              operation, so the option is only available in these cases.



Click Yes to confirm. The operation continues from the last failed step.
