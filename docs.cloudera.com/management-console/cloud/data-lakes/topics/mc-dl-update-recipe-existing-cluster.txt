Update a recipe
You can attach or detach recipes to/from existing Data Lake clusters in an available
    state. Using this capability, you can update a recipe by removing it from the cluster, replacing
    the old recipe with a modified recipe of the same type, and attaching the new modified recipe to
    the cluster. 
Attaching or detaching a recipe will not execute the recipe.
      The next execution of the recipe will take place based on the type of the recipe. After an
      upscale, a newly attached recipe runs only on the new hosts.Required role (one of the
          following):
PowerUser on CDP tenant
Owner of the environment
EnvironmentAdmin


Create a new recipe (with updated/modified content) of the same type as the old recipe
          that you want to replace.Click Data Lakes > <Data Lake
              Name> and scroll to the Data Lake details pane at the bottom
          of the page. Click the Recipes tab and find the recipe that you
          want to remove in the list of recipes for the Data Lake.Click Remove Recipe next to the name of the recipe that you
          want to remove, then click Yes in the confirmation
        window.Once you have removed the old recipe, click on the Add
            Recipe button for the Data Lake and select the same host group that you
          previously used for the old recipe. Then select the name of the new recipe that contains
          the modified content and click Add.

Alternatively, you can use the CDP CLI to attach or detach recipes from a host
          group:cdp datalake replace-recipes --datalake <CRN or name> --instance-group-recipes instanceGroupName=<instance group name>,recipeNames=<recipe names>Note
          that the same command is used to both detach and attach a recipe. When you attach a
          recipe, use the recipeNames parameter to specify the recipe or recipes that you want to
          attach; when you detach a recipe, give the instanceGroupName but do not provide a
          recipeName. For example:To detach all recipes from an instance
            group:cdp datalake replace-recipes --datalake myDL --instance-group-recipes
            instanceGroupName=worker,recipeNames=To
            attach a new
            recipe:cdp datalake replace-recipes --datalake myDL --instance-group-recipes
            instanceGroupName=worker,recipeNames=myrecipeFor
            instance groups with multiple recipes, give the recipeNames that you would like to keep.
            Any recipes not specified will be detached.
You should see the new recipe appear for the same host group.
      After this change, the next recipe execution will execute the new script.
