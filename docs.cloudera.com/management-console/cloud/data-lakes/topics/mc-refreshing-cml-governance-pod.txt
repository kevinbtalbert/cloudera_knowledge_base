Refreshing CML governance pods

    pods after scaling a Data Lake.

Configure CML kubeconfig to access the workspace (see Kubernetes documentation).Run the following commands to restart goverance pods in CML:
kubectl scale deployments governance --replicas 0 -n mlx
#wait for 30 sec
kubectl scale deployments governance --replicas 1 -n mlx
