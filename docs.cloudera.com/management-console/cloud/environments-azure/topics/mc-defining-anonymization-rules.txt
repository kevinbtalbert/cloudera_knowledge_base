Defining anonymization rules for CDP logs
CDP includes a set of default anonymization rules and allows you to define custom
        anonymization rules in order to remove sensitive information from CDP logs. 


Use PCRE convention for writing custom anonymization rule patterns. 
Anonymization rules are applied to the following logs:

Cluster logs collected during deployments and automatically sent
                        to Cloudera. See Enabling environment telemetry. 
Diagnostics logs that can be collected for troubleshooting and
                        sent to Cloudera Support. See Generating a VM-based diagnostic
                            bundle. 




noteAnonymization rules are only applied to environments created after the rules were
                added in CDP. 

Default anonymization rules
CDP includes a set of default anonymization rules that anonymize the
                following:

Creating anonymization rule patterns 
Use PCRE convention for writing anonymization rule patterns. For each pattern, come
                up with a replacement string.

Define custom anonymization rules
You can define custom anonymization rules in CDP. The anonymization rules
                are only applied to environments created after the rules were added in CDP.
Required role: PowerUser
Steps
CDP UICDP CLI


Once you have created the rules, navigate to CDP web interface >
                        Management Console > Global Settings > Telemetry > Anonymization
                            rules.


Default rules are pre-populated.


Click on New rule and add a pattern and replacement string
                        for your rule. Repeat for multiple rules.


Test the rules from the same page on the UI under Test
                            rules:
Under Input text paste an example text with sensitive content
                                that should get anonymized by the rules that you added.
Click Test all rules.
The sensitive content should be removed nad replaced in the output
                                printed in the Anonymized result text box. 


Click Save Changes.

note
You can use the Set defaults button if you would like to revert to the
                    default rules.



If you would like to add new rules, you should first prepare the patterns
                        and replacement strings, and then test them with the following
                        command:cdp environments test-account-telemetry-rules --cli-input-json {
    "testInput": "Email: myemail@cloudera.com",
    "rules": [
        {
            "value": "\\b([A-Za-z0-9]|[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9\\-\\._]*[A-Za-z0-9])@(([A-Za-z0-9]|[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9\\-]*[A-Za-z0-9])\\.)+([A-Za-z0-9]|[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9\\-]*[A-Za-z0-9])\\b",
            "replacement": "email@redacted.host"
        }
    ]
}

Run the following command to get your current telemetry
                            settings in JSON
                            format:cdp environments get-account-telemetry


Copy the JSON file that you obtained in the output of this
                            command and paste it into a text editor.


Update the JSON file, updating the settings or adding new rules.note
Make sure to preserve all the existing rules, or else they will
                                    be deleted. Also, make sure to pass the
                                        workloadAnalytics and
                                        cloudStorageLogging parameters. If you
                                    donâ€™t pass all of the parameters, the parameters that are not
                                    passed will get reset to their default values. 



Once you have the JSON file updated, run the cdp
                                environments set-account-telemetry command. For
                            example:cdp environments set-account-telemetry --cli-input-json {
    "workloadAnalytics": true,
    "cloudStorageLogging": true,
    "rules": [
        {
            "value": "\\b([A-Za-z0-9]|[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9\\-\\._]*[A-Za-z0-9])@(([A-Za-z0-9]|[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9\\-]*[A-Za-z0-9])\\.)+([A-Za-z0-9]|[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9\\-]*[A-Za-z0-9])\\b",
            "replacement": "email@redacted.host"
        }
    ]
}
