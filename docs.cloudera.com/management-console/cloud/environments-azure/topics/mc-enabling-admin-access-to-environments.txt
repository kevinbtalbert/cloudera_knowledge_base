Enabling admin and user access to environmentsCloudera DocsEnabling admin and user access to environments
In order to grant admin and user access to an environment that you registered in CDP,
    you should assign the required roles.
You need to be an EnvironmentCreator in order to register an environment. Once an
      environment is running, the following roles can be assigned:

EnvironmentAdmin - Grants all rights to the environment and Data
        Hub clusters running in it, except the ability to delete the environment. The user who
        registers the environment automatically becomes its EnvironmentAdmin. 
EnvironmentUser - Grants permission to view Data Hub clusters and
        set the workload password for the environment. This role should be used in conjunction with
        service-specific roles such as DataHubAdmin, DWAdmin, DWUser,
          MLAdmin, MLUser, and so on. When assigning one of these service-specific
        roles to users, make sure to also assign the EnvironmentUser role. 
DataSteward - Grants permission to perform user/group management
        functions in Ranger and Atlas Admin, manage ID Broker mappings, and start user sync for the
        environment.
Owner - Grants the ability to mange the environment in CDP, including
        deleting the environment. The user who registers the environment automatically becomes its
          Owner. The Owner role does not grant access the environment's clusters (Data
        Lakes, Data Hubs). 

The roles are described in detail in Resource roles. The steps for assigning the roles
      are described in Assigning resource roles to users and Assigning resource roles to
        groups.
