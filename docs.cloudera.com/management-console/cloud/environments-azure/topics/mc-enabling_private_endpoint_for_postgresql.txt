Enabling a private endpoint for Azure PostgresCloudera Docs
Enabling a private endpoint for Azure Postgres
By default CDP uses service endpoints, but you can select to use
    private endpoints instead. During environment registration you can optionally select the “Create
    Private Endpoint” option to use private endpoints instead of using a service endpoint.
    Currently, only one service or private endpoint is used, for Azure Postgres. 
The endpoint type - either service or private endpoints - and whether to use your own private
      DNS zones or have CDP create them are decided at environment creation. All services capable of
      that endpoint type will use the selected endpoint type - this currently means only the
      Postgres server.
note
The endpoint type cannot be changed after the environment was created.

By default service endpoints are used, and in order to use private endpoints the
      user has to explicitly enable the “Create Private Endpoints“ option from either the CDP UI or
      CDP CLI. There is no option to not use either. Once you have turned on private endpoints then
      you can specify your own private DNS zone if you wish.
Prerequisites
You should also decide if you would like to use your own Azure private DNS zone or have CDP
        create an Azure private DNS zone for you, and meet the related prerequisites. Review the
        requirements described in Private endpoint for Azure Postgres.

Enabling private endpoints
You can enable private endpoints and select to use a CDP-managed Azure private DNS zone or
        your own Azure private DNS zone during Azure environment registration in the Management
        Console. 
Required role: EnvironmentCreator
Steps
CDP UICDP CLI
When registering an environment specify the following:


In the Resource group section, select to use your pre-created
                resource group.


In the Network section of the register environment wizard, enable the
                "Create Private Endpoints" option. 


A new drop down option appears. You have two options:


Select an existing private DNS zone. 


If you would like CDP to create the private DNS zone, select “Create
                    new private DNS zone”.






Provide other Azure environment parameters as usual and complete environment
              registration. 


The parameter createPrivateEndpoints defines that Azure
            Postgres will be configured with a Private Endpoint and a Private DNS Zone. When this
            option is disabled, Azure Service Endpoints are created. This option is disabled by
            default, so Azure Service Endpoints are used by default.
This is how to specify this via CDP CLI when running the cdp environments
              create-azure-environment
            command:--create-private-endpoints
--no-create-private-endpoints
If you would like to specify your own Azure private DNS zone, you should additionally
            include the databasePrivateDnsZoneId as part of
              existing-network-params:
            --existing-network-params networkId=<NETWORK_ID>,resourceGroupName=<NETWORK_RG_NAME>,subnetIds=<SUBNET_1>,<SUBNET_2>,databasePrivateDnsZoneId=<PRIVATE_DNS_ZONE_RESOURCE_ID>
The <PRIVATE_DNS_ZONE_RESOURCE_ID> that you need to provide should look
        similar
        to:/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com
For example: 

/subscriptions/a9a10f9c-5323-4fd2-8s14-747b2d68784c/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/contoso.com
