Cleaning up a failed Azure environment
When environment creation fails, you should delete the environment. If environment
  termination fails, you should clean up any resources that might have already been created on your
  AWS account. 
When environment creation fails, you should delete the environment by using the steps described
   in Delete an Environment. 
If environment termination fails, you should clean up any resources that might have already
   been created on your Azure account. To do this, log in to your Azure Portal and do one of the
    following:
If CDP created all resource groups for your CDP resources, find it and delete these resource
     groups. The names of these resource groups will include the name of the environment.
If you used your own existing resource group, navigate to it and delete all the resources
     that were created by CDP. The names of these resources will include the name of the
     environment.
