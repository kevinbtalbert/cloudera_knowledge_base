Stop and restart an environment
You can stop an environment if you need to suspend but not terminate the resources
    within the environment. When you stop an environment, all of the resources within the
    environment are also stopped, including Data Lakes and Data Hubs. You can also restart the
    environment.
warning
The Machine Learning service does not support environment stop and restart. This means that
        if ML workspaces are running or expected to be provisioned within an environment, then the
        environment should not be stopped. If done, this will disrupt running CML workspaces and
        prevent successful provisioning of ML workspaces in the environment.
