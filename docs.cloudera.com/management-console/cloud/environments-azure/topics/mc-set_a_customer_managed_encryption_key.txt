Adding a customer managed encryption key to a CDP environment running on AzureCloudera Docs
Adding a customer managed encryption key to a CDP environment running on Azure
By default, local Data Lake, FreeIPA, and Data Hub disks attached to Azure VMs and the
  PostgreSQL server instance used by the Data Lake and Data Hubs are encrypted with server-side
  encryption (SSE) using Platform Managed Keys (PMK), but you can optionally configure SSE with
  Customer Managed Keys (CMK). 
The CMK can be specified during environment registration and, if present, is used for
   encrypting Data Lake, FreeIPA, and Data Hub disks and PostgreSQL server instances. Alternatively,
   it is possible to specify it once the environment is running, in which case the CMK will only be
   used for Data Hubs created after the CMK was added.
The disks that are attached to the VMs of the Data Lake, FreeIPA, and Data Hub
   clusters will be associated with a Disk Encryption Set (DES) that is created with the key URL as
   the underlying encryption key version. The DES dedicated to the CDP environment will be created
   in the resource group of the environment before the FreeIPA launch at the beginning of the
   environment creation process. 
This documentation covers the following topics:
Azure prerequisites for using a CMK
Registering a new Azure environment and specifying a CMK
Creating a Data Hub with the same CMK
Checking whether a CMK exists for an Azure environment
Adding a CMK to an existing Azure environment


Parent topic: Managing an environment
Azure prerequisites for using a CMK
You can use your existing Azure vault and vault key or create a new Azure vault and
  vault key.
For detailed requirements, refer to Azure Prerequisites: Customer managed encryption keys.


Register an Azure environment with a CMK
You can specify an existing customer managed key (CMK) during Azure environment
  registration and the encryption key will be used to encrypt the VMs and databases running in the
  environment.
Steps
CDP UICDP CLI
You can register your environment as described in Register an Azure environment from CDP UI, just
     make sure that on the Region, Networking and Security page you enable
     the following:
Under Customer-Managed Keys, click Enable Customer-Managed Keys.
In the same section, under Select Resource group select the resource group where
       the CMK is located.
Provide the URL of the key value where the CMK resides. This is the same as the key
       identifier that you can copy directly from Azure Portal


Use the following CDP CLI command to create an environment with the encryption key
     created earlier. Replace the placeholders with actual values. For example
      <ENVIRONMENT-NAME> should be replaced with an actual name. The parameters important for this feature are
     highlighted:cdp environments create-azure-environment \
--environment-name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> \
--credential-name <CREDENTIAL_NAME> \
--region <REGION> \
--security-access cidr=<YOUR-ORGANIZATION’S_CIDR> \
--public-key '<SSH_PUBLIC_KEY>' \
--log-storage <STORAGE_LOCATION> \
--description '<DESCRIPTION>' \
--resource-group-name <ENV_RESOUCE_GROUP_NAME> \
--encryption-key-resouce-group-name <CMK_RESOUCE_GROUP_NAME> \
--encryption-key-url <KEY_RESOUCE_ID>

cdp environments set-id-broker-mappings \
--environment-name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> \
--data-access-role <DATA_ACCESS_IDENTITY>\
--ranger-audit-role <RANGER_AUDIT_IDENTITY> \
--set-empty-mappings 

cdp datalake create-azure-datalake \
--datalake-name <DATALAKE_NAME> \
--environment-name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> \
--cloud-provider-configuration <STORAGE_LOCATION_BASE_CONFIGURATION>
The encryption key can be present in a separate resource group than in which the
     environment is being created. The resource group in which encryption key is present can be
     provided using --encryption-key-resouce-group-name. Either
      --encryption-key-resouce-group-name or --resource-group-name
     must be present. Depending on the resource group where you environment and encryption key
     reside, there are three possible use cases:

If your encryption key is in the same resource group as you wish to create the
       environment in, you can provide a common resource group with
        --resource-group-name parameter. In this case, you do not need to provide
       the --encryption-key-resouce-group-name parameter.


If your encryption key is in a different resource group than you wish to create
       the environment in and you wish to use some other existing resource group for the
       environment, you can provide encryption key’s resource group with
        --encryption-key-resouce-group-name and the environment’s resource group
       with --resource-group-name. 

If you don’t want to specify an existing resource group for the environment, you just need
    to provide the encryption key’s resource group using
     --encryption-key-resouce-group-name and the environment’s resource groups will
    be created by CDP. You can obtain more complete commands using the instructions in Obtain CLI commands for registering an
      environment. 



Create a Data Hub on Azure with a CMK
Use CDP web interface or CDP CLI to create a Data Hub cluster. Note that this doesn’t
  require any extra steps, so you can refer to the Data
    Hub documentation. 
The disks that are attached to the VMs of the Data Hub cluster will be associated with a Disk
   Encryption Set (DES) that is created with the key URL as the underlying encryption key version.
   The DES dedicated to the CDP environment will be created in the resource group of the environment
   at the beginning of the environment creation process (before the FreeIPA launch, specifically). 


Check Azure environment’s CMK
You can check in an Azure environment’s summary whether a CMK is used to encrypt a given
  environment. 
Steps
CDP UICDP CLI


In the Management Console, navigate to Environments and click on the environment
       for which you would like to set a CMK.
Click on the Summary tab.
Scroll down to the Customer Managed Encryption Key section. If a CMK exists, the entry will look similar to: 


You can also find the CMK information by clicking on the Data Lake tab and then
       navigating to the Hardware tab.
Click on >> on the right side of the screen next to any of the nodes to expand the
       node related information.
Under Storage Details, the following information is included about the CMK:
Whether the node has been encrypted with a CMK
CMK encryption key URL
Disk Encryption Set ID 
For example: 




You can use the cdp environments
      update-azure-encryption-resources command to check environment’s CMK encryption
     status. If encryption key is set, the cdp environments
     update-azure-encryption-resources command will return the disk encryption set,
    encryption key, and encryption key's resource group details.


Check Data Hub's CMK
You can check in a Data Hub’s hardware tab whether a CMK is used to encrypt
  it.

noteA Data Hub’s CMK is the same as the one used for the environment in which the Data Hub is
    running, so you can also find this information in the environment’s details. 

Steps



Navigate to the Data Hub details > Hardware tab. 


Click on >> on the right side of the screen next to any of the nodes to
        expand the node related information.


Under Storage Details, Under Storage Details, the following
        information is included about the CMK:
Whether the node has been encrypted with a CMK
CMK encryption key URL
Disk Encryption Set ID 






Set a CMK for an existing Azure environment 
You can set a CMK for an existing environment. The CMK will be only used for encrypting
  disks of Data Hubs created after the CMK was added. 
note
The CMK added to an existing environment will only be used for encrypting disks of Data Hubs
   created after the CMK was added. Data Lake and FreeIPA disks and databases are not encrypted with
   the CMK.  
Steps
CDP UICDP CLI
You can update the encryption key for an existing environment that does not have an
     encryption key set by navigating to the Summary page of the environment.

In the Management Console, navigate to Environments and click on the
        environment for which you would like to set a CMK.


Click on the Summary tab.


Scroll down to the Customer Managed Encryption Key section. 


If no CMK has been set, you will see a message stating that there is no
        customer-managed key enabled.


Click on the edit button in the top right corner of the tab. 


Click on the toggle button next to Enable Customer-Managed Keys to enable
        adding a CMK.



Provide the following:

Provide the encryption key URL. This is the same as the key identifier that
          you can copy directly from Azure Portal. 


If your encryption key resource group is different from the environment’s
          resource group, provide the name of the resource group.


Click Save.




You can add an encryption key for an existing environment that does not yet have
     encryption enabled.
If your encryption key resource group is same as environment resource group,
     use:cdp environments update-azure-encryption-resources \
  --environment-name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> \
  --encryption-key-url <CMK_URL> \
If your encryption key resource group is different from environment resource group,
     use:cdp environments update-azure-encryption-resources \
  --environment-name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> \
  --encryption-key-url <CMK_URL> \
  --encryption-key-resource-group-name <CMK_RESOURCE_GROUP>
