Adding a customer managed encryption key for GCP
By default, a Google-managed encryption key is used to encrypt disks and Cloud SQL
  instances in Data Lake, FreeIPA, and Data Hub clusters, but you can optionally configure CDP to
  use a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) instead. 
To set up a CMEK, you should:


Meet the CMEK prerequisites.
Register a GCP environment in CDP via CDP web UI or CLI. During environment registration,
     specify the encryption key that you would like to use.


CMEK prerequisites
Refer to  GCP Prerequisites: Customer managed encryption keys.

Create a CDP environment with a CMEK
You can pass the CMEK during GCP environment registration in CDP via CDP web interface or CDP
    CLI.
Steps
CDP UICDP CLI
You can register your environment as described in Register a GCP environment from CDP UI, just make
    sure that on the Data Access and Audit page you enable the following:

Under Customer-Managed Encryprion Keys, click Enable Customer-Managed
        Keys.


In the same section, select the CMEK:


The following screenshot shows the UI options:




The steps below can only be performed via CDP CLI. Create an environment passing the
       --encryption-key parameter as shows in this example:
      cdp environments create-gcp-environment \
  --no-use-public-ip \
  --environment-name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> \
  --credential-name <EXISTING_CREDENTIAL-NAME>\
  --region <REGION>\
  --security-access securityGroupIdForKnox=<SG_NAME1>,defaultSecurityGroupId=<SG_NAME2> \
  --public-key <PUBLIC_SSH_KEY>\
  --log-storage storageLocationBase=<LOGS_STORAGE_LOCATION> \
  --existing-network-params networkName=<NETWORK>,subnetNames=<SUBNET>,sharedProjectId=<PROJECT_ID>\
  --workload-analytics \
  --encryption-key <PATH_TO_THE_ENCRYPTION_KEY>

noteIf the --encryption-key parameter is not provided the GCP resources are
     not encrypted using CMEK, falling back to the default behavior of Google managed
     encryption.

Next, create a Data Lake and IDBroker mappings using the usual commands. Once the
    environment is running, Data Hubs can be created using the usual steps.
