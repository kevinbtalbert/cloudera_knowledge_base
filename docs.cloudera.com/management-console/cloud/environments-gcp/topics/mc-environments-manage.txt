Managing an environment
The following management options are available for an existing environment:


Stop and restart an environmentYou can stop an environment if you need to suspend but not terminate the resources     within the environment. When you stop an environment, all of the resources within the     environment are also stopped, including Data Lakes and Data Hubs. You can also restart the     environment.Delete an environmentDeleting an environment terminates all resources within the environment including the     Data Lake.Change environment's credentialYou can change the credential attached to an environment as long as the new credential   provides the required level of access to the same GCP account as the old credential. Defining custom tagsIn the Management Console user interface, you can define tenant-level or         environment-level custom tags across all instances and resources provisioned in your         organizationâ€™s cloud provider account. Adding a customer managed encryption key for GCPBy default, a Google-managed encryption key is used to encrypt disks and Cloud SQL   instances in Data Lake, FreeIPA, and Data Hub clusters, but you can optionally configure CDP to   use a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) instead.
