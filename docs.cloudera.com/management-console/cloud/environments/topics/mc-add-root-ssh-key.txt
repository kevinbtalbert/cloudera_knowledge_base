    environment you want to modify.
Click the Summary tab.
Scroll down to the Advanced section.
Click the (edit)
    button, then under Root SSH select New SSH public key and paste the SSH public key that
    you want to add to the Environment. If your environment is on AWS, you can also select
     Existing SSH public key and then select the SSH public key as long as you have

The newly added SSH key will only be used for root access to the Data Hub clusters created
      within the environment after the new SSH key pair was added. All the existing environment
      resources such as the Data Lake, FreeIPA, and any existing Data Hub clusters will remain
      accessible via the SSH key pair originally defined during environment creation.
