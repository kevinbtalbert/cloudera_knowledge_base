Managing an environment
The following management options are available for an existing environment:


Stop and restart an environmentYou can stop an environment if you need to suspend but not terminate the resources     within the environment. When you stop an environment, all of the resources within the     environment are also stopped, including Data Lakes and Data Hubs. You can also restart the     environment.Delete an environmentDeleting an environment terminates all resources within the environment including the     Data Lake.Cleaning up a failed environmentWhen environment creation fails, you should delete the environment. If environment   termination fails, you should clean up any resources that might have already been created on your   AWS account. Add subnets to an environmentYou can add additional subnets to an existing environment. These subnets will only be     used for all Data Hub clusters created within the environment in the future.Add security groups to an environmentYou can add additional security groups to an existing environment. These security groups   will be used for all Data Hub clusters created within the environment in the future.Add root SSH key to an environmentYou can add an additional SSH public key to an existing environment. This SSH public key   will be used for root access to all Data Hub clusters created within the environment in the   future.Change environment's credentialYou can change the credential attached to an environment as long as the new credential   provides the required level of access to the same AWS account as the old credential. Enabling environment telemetryYou can optionally enable workload analytics so that diagnostic information about job                 and query execution is sent to Cloudera Observability for Data Hub clusters.                 Similarly, you can optionally enable logs collection so that logs generated during                 deployments will be automatically sent to Cloudera. Adding a customer managed encryption key to a CDP environment running on AWSBy default, Data Lake and FreeIPA's Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes and   Relational Database Service (RDS) are encrypted using a default key from Amazon’s KMS, but you can   optionally configure encryption using Customer Managed Keys (CMK). Data Hubs inherit environment's   encryption key by default but you have an option to specify a different CMK during Data Hub   creation.Deploying CDP in multiple AWS availability zonesBy default,   CDP provisions Data Lake, FreeIPA and Data Hubs in a single AWS availability zone (AZ), but you   can optionally choose to deploy them across multiple availability zones (multi-AZ). It is possible   to enable it either for all or some of these components.Defining custom tagsIn the Management Console user interface, you can define tenant-level or         environment-level custom tags across all instances and resources provisioned in your         organization’s cloud provider account. Restricting access for CDP services that create their own security groups on AWSThe security groups that you select to use during environment registration are only used     for the Data Lake, FreeIPA, Data Hubs, and Operational Databases running in that environment.     The Kubernetes-based CDP services (Data Engineering, Data Flow, Data Warehouse, and Machine     Learning) create their own security groups with rules that should be restricted separately. Configure lifecycle management for logs on AWSTo avoid unnecessary costs related to Amazon S3 cloud storage, you should create   lifecycle management rules for your cloud storage bucket used by CDP for storing logs so that   these logs get deleted once they are no longer useful.
