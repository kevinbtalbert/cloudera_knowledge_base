Add subnets to an environment
You can add additional subnets to an existing environment. These subnets will only be
    used for all Data Hub clusters created within the environment in the future.
Before you begin
These steps assume that you have already created the subnets that you want to add to the
      environment.
Required role: EnvironmentAdmin or Owner
Steps

Navigate to Management Console > Environments and select the
        environment you want to modify:
Click the Summary tab.
Scroll down to the Network section.
Click the (edit) button, then click the Select Subnets pull down menu and
        select the subnet you want to add to the Environment.
Click the (save) button.You should see the new subnet listed in the Network section.note
The newly added subnets will not be used for any CDP services other than Data Hub.
              The newly added subnets will only be used for the Data Hub clusters created within the
              environment after the new subnets were added. All the existing environment resources
              such as the Data Lake, FreeIPA, and any existing Data Hub clusters will remain within
              the subnets originally defined during environment creation.
