Provisioning CML workspace for RAZ-enabled AWS environment
If you require Cloudera Machine Learning (CML), you must provision a CML workspace. A
        CML workspace enables teams of data scientists to develop, test, train, and ultimately
        deploy machine learning models for building predictive applications all on the data under
        management within the enterprise data cloud. 
For information about provisioning a CML workspace, see Provisioning ML Workspaces.
