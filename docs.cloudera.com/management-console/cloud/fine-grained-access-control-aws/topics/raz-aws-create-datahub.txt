Cluster templates available in RAZ-enabled AWS environment
After you register your RAZ-enabled AWS environment, you can create a Data Hub
        cluster for the environment. 
The following cluster templates have been tested and can be used with RAZ:
Data Engineering
Data Engineering HA
Data Engineering Spark3
Data Mart
Operational Database with SQL

You can create custom variants of these templates in a RAZ-enabled AWS environment.
warningIf you create a Data Hub with custom paths for a
            RAZ-enabled AWS environment, your cluster might fail with an
                AccessDeniedException exception on the custom Zeppelin path.
            To fix the problem, you must use the workaround mentioned in Creating a Data Hub cluster with custom path

Creating a Data Hub cluster with custom pathWhen you create a Data Hub cluster with custom paths for Data Hub clusters, your         cluster might fail with an access exception. To resolve this issue, you must add the policy         path to the default Zeppelin notebooks policy using Ranger.
