Ranger policy options  for RAZ-enabled AWS environment
After you register the RAZ-enabled AWS environment, you can log in to Ranger to
        create the policies for granular access to the environment’s cloud storage location. 
Ranger includes a set of preloaded resource-based services and
            policies. You need the following additional policies  for granular access to the
            environment’s cloud storage location: 
Policies for Spark
                        jobs
Policies for Hive external
                        tables and Spark jobs
Policies for Hive managed
                        tables and Spark jobs



Policies for Spark jobs
A Spark job on an S3 path requires an S3 policy for the end user on the specific
                    path. For information to create the policies, see Creating Ranger policy to use in RAZ-enabled AWS environment.
For example, a Spark job on
                        s3a://bucket/data/logs/tabledata requires an S3 policy
                    in cm_s3 repo on
                        s3a://bucket/data/logs/tabledata for end user.The following sample image shows the S3 policy created in the
                            cm_s3 repo for the user
                            csso_abc to read and write data in
                            s3a://abc-eu-central/abc/test.csv:




Policies for Hive external tables and Spark jobs

Running the create external table [***table
                                definition***] location
                            ‘s3a://bucket/data/logs/tabledata’ command in Hive requires the
                        following Ranger policies:

An S3 policy in the cm_s3 repo on
                                s3a://bucket/data/logs/tabledata for
                                hive user to perform recursive read/write.
An S3 policy in the cm_s3 repo on
                                s3a://bucket/data/logs/tabledata for the end
                            user.
A Hive URL authorization policy in the Hadoop SQL repo on
                                s3a://bucket/data/logs/tabledata for the end
                            user.

Access to the same external table location using Spark shell requires an S3
                        policy (Ranger policy) in the cm_s3 repo on
                            s3a://bucket/data/logs/tabledata for the end
                        user.

For information to create the policies, see Creating Ranger policy to use in RAZ-enabled AWS environment.


Policies for Hive managed tables and Spark jobs 
Operations such as create, insert, delete, select, and so on, on a Hive managed
                    table do not require any custom Ranger policies. 
For information to create the policies, see Creating Ranger policy to use in RAZ-enabled AWS environment.


Creating Ranger policy to use in RAZ-enabled AWS environmentAfter you register the RAZ-enabled AWS environment, you can log in to Ranger to         create the policies for granular access to the environment’s cloud storage location. To         create the Ranger policy, you must first create the required S3 policy and then a Hive URL         authorization policy, on an S3 path for the end user.
