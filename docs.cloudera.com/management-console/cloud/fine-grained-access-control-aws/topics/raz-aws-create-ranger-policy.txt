Creating Ranger policy to use in RAZ-enabled AWS environment
After you register the RAZ-enabled AWS environment, you can log in to Ranger to
        create the policies for granular access to the environmentâ€™s cloud storage location. To
        create the Ranger policy, you must first create the required S3 policy and then a Hive URL
        authorization policy, on an S3 path for the end user.

To create the required S3 policy on an S3 path for end user, perform the
                    following steps:


Navigate to the Ranger UI.


On the S3 tab, click
                                cm_s3.


Click Add New Policy in the top right
                            corner.


Provide the following policy details:


Enter Policy Name.
Enter an S3 Bucket name.
Provide a Path within the S3
                                    bucket.
Select users and permissions to assign to the end
                                    user. Only Read and
                                            Write permissions can be assigned
                                        to the end user. 

The following sample image shows the Create

                                    bucket.
Select users and permissions to assign to the end
                                    user. noteOnly

                                        to the end user.
