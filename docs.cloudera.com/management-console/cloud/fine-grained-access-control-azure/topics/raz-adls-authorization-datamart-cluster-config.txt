Configuring Data Mart for RAZ-enabled Azure environment
The Data Mart template provides a ready to use, fully capable, standalone deployment
      of Impala. To use a Data Mart cluster in a RAZ-enabled Azure environment, you need to
      configure additional Data Mart configuration steps in the Data Mart for Azure cluster
      definition.

Log in to the Cloudera Manager for the Data Mart.

Select Impala > Configuration, and then set the value of the Impala Daemon Data Cache Per
                  Directory Capacity property to 10 GB. 

This property must be set to avoid the following Impala Daemon start failure: 

F0615 07:11:40.206655 62270 impalad-main.cc:73] Insufficient space for /hadoopfs/fs1/impala/datacache. 
Required 130.00 GB. Only 29.53 GB is available
. Impalad exiting.



Create a Ranger ALDS policy in the cm_adls service with the
               following properties: 
Note that the following property values are sample values. You can enter the
               values as required for your environment.

Storage Account *= mpdsasv2san


Storage Account Container * = data


Relative Path * = /


Recursive = ON


User = impala


Permissions = read, add, create, write, delete, list, move,
                           superuser

This policy must be created to avoid the following failure: 
E0615 07:58:02.019865 71092 impala-server.cc:383] Could not read the root directory at abfs://data@mpdsasv2san.dfs.core.windows.net/mp-dsasv2-dm. Error was:
Failed to acquire a SAS token for list on / due to org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: org.apache.ranger.raz.intg.RangerRazException: request failed: status=403


Restart the Impala service in Cloudera Manager, then verify that the Ranger Azure
               authorization is working as expected.
