  using a RAZ-enabled Azure environment and the steps to resolve the issues.

How do I view logs and RAZ configuration in a RAZ-enabled Azure environment?


You can use the following methods to view logs and RAZ configuration in a RAZ-enabled
                Azure environment:




To view RAZ server logs, perform the following steps:
Identify the host on which the RAZ service is installed in
                                    Cloudera Manager.
SSH to log into the RAZ server.
Locate the
                                            ranger-raz-[***host-name***]-*-rangerraz.log
                                    file in the /var/log/ranger/raz/
                                    directory.

To view the RAZ client logs, go to the respective component logs.RAZ
                                authorization is triggered when a CDP Public Cloud service accesses
                                the ADLS storage through the HDFS client layer. The logs related to
                                these calls are stored by the respective service or component
                                logs.The following table lists some services and
                                the RAZ client log location:

                                                  tools.


To view RAZ server configuration, perform the following steps:
Identify the host on which the RAZ service is installed in
                                    Cloudera Manager.
SSH to log into the RAZ server.
Run the ps -ef | grep rangerraz | awk '{split($0,
                                        array,"classpath"); print array[2]}' | cut -d: -f1
                                    command to identify the RAZ_CONF_DIR
                                    directory.
Run the cat
                                        [***RAZ_CONF_DIR***]/ranger-raz-site.xml
                                    command to view the RAZ server configuration details.





How do I enable the debug level for RAZ server and RAZ client?



When you enable the DEBUG level for RAZ server and RAZ client, a detailed
                        verbose log is generated. Alternatively, you can only enable debug on a
                        package level, so that only the package logs show detailed verbose logs.

To configure debug for RAZ server at package level, perform the
                            following steps:
Go to the Cloudera Manager > Ranger RAZ service > Configuration tab.
Search for the Ranger Raz Server Logging Advanced
                                        Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) property
                                    property, and enter the following information:
log4j.logger.org.apache.ranger.raz.[***package name***]=DEBUG
log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.security=DEBUG
log4j.appender.RFA.layout.ConversionPattern=[%p] %d{dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss,SSS} [THREAD ID=%t] [CLASS=(%C{1}:%L)] %m%n

Click Save Changes.
Restart the Ranger RAZ service.

You can configure the DEBUG level for RAZ clients. For example, to
                                view the HDFS log in DEBUG level, run the
                                    HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER=DEBUG,console hdfs
                                        [***options***]
[***arguments***] command.




Is there a checklist to refer while troubleshooting RAZ-enabled Azure
        environments?

                                            HTTP Status 401 – Unauthorized appear in
                                        RAZ client logs.
These error messages appear when the RAZ server denies
                                        the authorization request because no or incomplete
                                        authentication details are available. To
                                            resolve this issue, you must ensure that the Ranger RAZ
                                            server has Kerberos or RAZ-DT & JWT authentication.
                                            You must have a valid TGT when the RAZ server supports
                                            Kerberos authentication.


Failed to get DSAS token from Raz,
                                            HttpStatus: 403, Failed to acquire
                                            a SAS token … : Permission denied messages
                                        appear in RAZ client logs.
These errors might appear because of various reasons, the
                                        following are a few possible causes and solutions:
The required Ranger policies are not set.
                                                To verify, the administrator must check the Ranger
                                                Admin Access Audits and if required, assign the
                                                required policies.
The RAZ server might not be able to fetch
                                                the User Delegation key from IDBroker. To verify,
                                                check the Ranger RAZ server logs. To resolve this
                                                  issue, generate the User Delegation Key manually.
                                                  If you cannot generate DSAS manually, this
                                                  indicates that a network connectivity issue
                                                  exists. To proceed, you must resolve the
                                                  connectivity issues.
RAZ server cannot fetch the latest Ranger
                                                admin policies/users. To verify, download the RAZ
                                                policies manually. If you cannot
                                                  download RAZ policies manually, this indicates a
                                                  network connectivity issue. To proceed, resolve
                                                  the connectivity issues.







How do I generate a UserDelegationKey manually?


Perform the following steps to generate a UserDelegationKey manually:




Identify the host on which the RAZ service is installed in Cloudera
                            Manager.

SSH to log into the RAZ server.

Run following commands to get the required parameters:


ps -ef | grep rangerraz | awk '{split($0,
                                        array,"classpath"); print array[2]}' | cut -d: -f1
                                    to identify the RAZ_CONF_DIR directory.
klist -kt
                                            [***RAZ_CONF_DIR***]/../ranger_raz.keytab
                                    to identify the RAZ_PRINCIPLE parameter. The RAZ_PRINCIPLE
                                    parameter starts with rangerraz.
cat
                                        /etc/alternatives/hadoop-conf/core-site.xml | grep -a1
                                        'fs.azure.ext.cab.address' | grep 'value' to
                                    identify the complete ID_BROKER_URL.



Update the expiry date in the sasPost.xml file to
                            another valid date.

Run following commands:


kinit -kt
                                            [***RAZ_CONF_DIR***]/../ranger_raz.keytab
                                            [***RAZ_PRINCIPLE***]

DT=$(curl --negotiate -u :
                                                "[***ID_BROKER_URL***]/dt/knoxtoken/api/v1/token"
                                            | jq -r '.access_token')

AT=$(curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $DT"
                                            '[***ID_BROKER_URL***]/azure-cab/cab/api/v1/credentials'
                                        | jq -r '.access_token')
curl -v -i -X POST -d @sasPost.xml -H
                                        "x-ms-version: 2018-11-09" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AT"
                                            "https://[***ACCOUNT***].blob.core.windows.net/?restype=service&comp=userdelegationkey"


The UserDelegationKey is generated.

In case, the UserDelegationKey is not generated as expected, run the
                            following commands to verify whether the identity mappings are
                            available:


SSH to the IDBroker host.
Go to the cd
                                        /var/log/knox/idbroker/ IDBroker logs
                                    directory.
Run the grep -rl “addIdentitiesToVM”
                                        * command to view the list of identities. Note that
                                    the output must not be empty.
Run the grep . -rnwe
                                        ‘addIdentitiesToVM’ command to view the
                                    assumerIdentity, adminIdentity, and rangerraz identities. 







How do I download RAZ policies manually?


You can perform the following steps to download the RAZ policies manually:




Identify the host on which the RAZ service is installed in Cloudera
                            Manager.

SSH to log into the RAZ server.

Run following commands to identify the required parameters:


ps -ef | grep rangerraz | awk '{split($0,
                                        array,"classpath"); print array[2]}' | cut -d: -f1
                                    to identify the RAZ_CONF_DIR directory. 
klist -kt
                                            [***RAZ_CONF_DIR**]/../ranger_raz.keytab
                                    to identify the RAZ_PRINCIPLE. The RAZ_PRINCIPLE starts with
                                    rangerraz.
cat
                                        /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/1546336485-ranger_raz-RANGER_RAZ_SERVER/ranger-raz-conf/ranger-raz-site.xml
                                        | grep -a1 'ranger.raz.policy.rest.url' | grep
                                        'value' to identify the ADMIN_URL. Use the
                                    ADMIN_URL after you remove any trailing slash.



Run following commands to download the RAZ policies:


kinit -kt
                                        [***RAZ_CONF_DIR***]/../ranger_raz.keytab
                                            [***RAZ_PRINCIPLE***]
curl -ikv --negotiate -u : -X GET -H
                                        "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
                                            "[***ADMIN_URL***]/service/plugins/secure/policies/download/cm_adls



The RAZ policies for the ADLS service are downloaded to the
                                current directory of the logged in host or server.
