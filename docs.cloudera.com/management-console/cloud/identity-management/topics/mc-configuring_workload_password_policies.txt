Configuring workload password policies
In order to bring your workload password complexity requirements in line with company
  policy, you can set your FreeIPA password policies via CDP web interface and CDP CLI. Password
  policies can be configured for length, complexity, expiration, and scope. 


noteConfiguring password policies takes effect in all environments within a tenant, but
     applies to newly set passwords only. As such, admins should advise users to reset their
     passwords to achieve compliance with their new password policy. 
notePrior to introducing this feature, CDP web UI had stricter password complexity
     requirements than the CLI. With the release of the password policy feature, both the UI and CLI
     enforce the same stronger password policy by default.
warningThere is currently no stable notification system in place that would inform
     users that their password expired. When users SSH to a node and their password has expired,
     they may be prompted to reset their password in the SSH session. As resetting the password in
     the SSH session may only work for a short period, the users should instead set a new workload
     password using the Management Console in CDP. For instructions, see Setting the workload password. 


Workload password policy types
There are two types of password policies:


Global policies - Apply to all users including machine users 


Machine user policies - Apply to machine users only 


You can set either or both policies. By default, global policies are applied to all
    users, including machine users. An optional override for configuring a different policy for
    machine users is available. For example, setting strict password expiration policies for machine
    users may not be desired, as password expiration in those accounts may cause upstream failures
    in the applications that use them. 

Default workload password policy
If a password policy has not been set, the following default password policy is
    used:


A minimum password length of 8 characters


Must include at least 1 upper case character, lowercase character, number and
      special character. Supported special characters are: "#", "&", "*", "$", "%", "@", "^",
      ".", "_", and "!".


All previous passwords can be reused


The password can be changed at any time 


The password never expires


For detailed information on how to manage workload password policies, refer to the following
    documentation:



Check the current workload password policy
You can check your current password policy from the Workload Password Policies page or
  using the cdp iam get-account CLI command.
Required role: PowerUser
Steps
CDP UICDP CLI
You can check the current password policy from the Workload Password
      Policies page. To access this page:


Log in to the CDP web interface.


Navigate to the Management Console > User Management > Workload Password
        Policies:






Use the cdp iam get-account to obtain your current password policy. 



Set a password policy
You can set password policies from the Workload Password Policies page or using the
  via CDP CLI using the cdp iam set-workload-password-policy command.

     requirements than the CLI. With the release of the password policy feature, both the UI and CLI
     enforce the same stronger password policy by default.


Required role: PowerUser
Steps
CDP UICDP CLI


Log in to the CDP web interface.


Navigate to the Management Console > User Management > Workload Password
        Policies:





In the Global tab, specify a policy that applies to all CDP users and
       machine users. The following options are available:

UI option
Description 


Minimum lifetime of password (in days)
Once set, the password must remain the same for this period of time. Note: If a user forgets their password, they will be unable to reset it until
             the minimum period has passed or until the PowerUser unsets the minimum lifetime of the
             password for them. 


Maximum lifetime of password (in days)
Allows you to specify password expiration period in days.


Minimum password length
Allows you to specify minimum password length, must be between 6 and 256
            characters.


Number of previous passwords that can’t be reused
If set to 0, all previous passwords can be reused. Any number larger than 0
            indicates the number of most recent passwords that can't be reused. The maximum allowed
            value for this parameter is 20, so you can prevent users from reusing up to 20 recent
             passwords.Note: Password history information is only recorded when
             password history size is set to a value other than zero. This means that when the
             password history size is initially set from zero to non-zero, the previous passwords
             that were set (while the password history size was as at 0) are not considered when the
             password history check is done.


Must include uppercase characters
When checked, at least one uppercase character is required


Must include lowercase characters
When checked, at least one lowercase character is required


Must include numbers
When checked, at least one number is required


Must include symbols
When checked, at least one special character is required. Supported
            special characters are: "#", "&", "*", "$", "%", "@", "^", ".", "_", and "!".
           




Click Update.


By default, global policies are applied to machine users. If you would like to
       set a different policy for machine users:


Navigate to the Machine User tab.


Uncheck Inherit from global policy.



Set a desired policy (the available options are the same as for global
         policy).


Click Update.





The following example creates a global policy: 
cdp iam set-workload-password-policy --global-password-policy minPasswordLength=8,mustIncludeUpperCaseCharacters=true,mustIncludeLowerCaseCharacters=true,mustIncludeNumbers=true,mustIncludeSymbols=false
The following example creates a machine user policy. This overrides the global
     policy for machine users: 
cdp iam set-workload-password-policy --machine-users-password-policy minPasswordLength=8,mustIncludeUpperCaseCharacters=true,mustIncludeLowerCaseCharacters=true,mustIncludeNumbers=true,mustIncludeSymbols=true
The following password complexity requirements can be set as part of your
     policy:


CLI option
Type
Description
Default value


minPasswordLifetimeDays
integer
Minimum period in days during which password cannot be changed once it is set Note: If a user forgets their password, they will be unable to reset it
          until the minimum period has passed or until the PowerUser unsets the minimum lifetime of
          the password for them. 
0


maxPasswordLifetimeDays
integer
Expiration period in days
0


minPasswordLength
integer
Minimum password length; must be between 6 and 256 characters.
8


passwordHistorySize 
integer
Number of previous passwords that can't be reused. 0 indicates that all previous
         passwords can be reused. Any number above 0 indicates the number of most recent passwords
         that can’t be reused. The maximum allowed value for this parameter is 20, so you can
         prevent users from reusing up to 20 recent passwords.Note: Password
          history information is only recorded when password history size is set to a value other
          than zero. This means that when the password history size is initially set from zero to
          non-zero, the previous passwords that were set (while the password history size was as at
          0) are not considered when the password history check is done.
0


mustIncludeUpperCaseCharacters
true|false
At least one uppercase character is required
true


mustIncludeLowerCaseCharacters
true|false
At least one lowercase character is required
true


mustIncludeNumbers
true|false
At least one number is required
true


mustIncludeSymbols
true|false
At least one special character is required. Supported special characters
         are: "#", "&", "*", "$", "%", "@", "^", ".", "_", and "!".

Reset a password policy
You can reset password policies via CDP CLI using the cdp iam
  unset-workload-password-policy command. As a result, default password policies will be
  reinstated.
A global password policy is always present for an account. When the global password policy is
   unset, the policy will revert to the documented defaults. A machine user password policy may or
   may not be present in the account. When the machine user policy is not set for the account, the
   global password policy will be enforced for machine users.
Required role: PowerUser
Steps
CDP UICDP CLI


Log in to the CDP web interface.


Navigate to the Management Console > User Management > Workload Password
        Policies:





Navigate to the Machine User tab and make sure that Inherit from global
        policy is checked.noteIf this option remains unchecked, machine user policies will not
        be reset. 


Click on Reset to default values. 


Click OK to confirm.



Use the following commands to reset password policies:
cdp iam unset-workload-password-policy --unset-global-password-policy

cdp iam unset-workload-password-policy --unset-machine-users-password-policy




Unset user’s minimum password lifetime
With the minimum workload password lifetime enabled, it may happen in very rare cases
  that a user becomes locked out of their account and their minimum password lifetime needs to be
  temporarily unset. 
If your organization’s workload password policy has the minimum password lifetime
   enabled, a user is unable to set a new workload password until the minimum password lifetime
   duration has passed. Consequently, a user who forgets their password will be unable to set a new
   password until the minimum password lifetime duration has passed. In such a case, a PowerUser can
   unset the minimum lifetime date for the user who has been locked out of their account. This is a
   one-time override that will allow the user to set a new workload password.
Required role: PowerUser 
Steps

Use the following command to unset the minimum password lifetime for a specific
   user:cdp iam unset-workload-password-min-lifetime --user <USER-CRN-OR-ID>
This is a one-time override. Once the user sets their password, the minimum password lifetime
   will be reset to the original value that you set for your organization.
