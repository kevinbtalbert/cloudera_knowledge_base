Repair FreeIPA
When running in high-availability mode, the identity management
    system runs multiple instances of FreeIPA on separate hosts. In case of
    failure, you can repair failed hosts using the CDP command-line within one
    week of a node failing.
The repair process for FreeIPA hosts performs the following steps,
        stopping when a healthy status returns:
Start any FreeIPA hosts that are stopped.
Reboot FreeIPA hosts. (same physical host, same public DNS name, private IP address,
            and associated storage).
Restore identity management data from backup. 
Stop and restart FreeIPA hosts (rebuild using new hardware).

This procedure uses the CDP command-line interface. If you haven't already installed
        the CLI, see Installing CDP client for instructions. 
Steps
Run the FreeIPA repair command. Run this command from a computer that has
  network access to the FreeIPA hosts.
cdp environments repair-freeipa --environment-name <value>
                  [--force | --no-force]
                  [--instances <value>]
                  [--cli-input-json <value>]
                  [--generate-cli-skeleton]
                  [--repair-type <string>]
where the options are the following:

Option
Description



--environment-name
                    <value>
Specifies the FreeIPA's environment name or CRN. The environment CRN is
                    listed in Environment > Summary > General.


--force | --no-force
Choose to force the repair even if the status if the FreeIPA nodes are
                    good. If not specified, defaults to no-force.


--instances <value>
Specifies the instance IDs to repair. Use a space to separate multiple
                    instance IDs. If no IDs are provided then all instances are considered for
                    repair. The FreeIPA instance IDs are listed in Environment > Summary > FreeIPA. You can get the IDs from the output of the cdp
                        environments get-freeipa-status command.


--cli-input-json <value>
Performs the operations indicated in the command provided in JSON format.
                    Call generate-cli-skeleton to see a template of the required
                    JSON content. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the command
                    line values override the JSON-provided values. 


--generated-cli-skeleton
Displays an example of the format of the input JSON. The repair command
                    does not run.


--repair-type <string>
The type of FreeIPA repair to perform. 
AUTO - Currently, this is the same as reboot but this may change in the
                        future. 
REBOOT - Repair the failed instances by rebooting them.
REBUILD - Repair the failed instances by deleting them and creating new
                        instances, then replicate data from an existing instance to the new
                        instances.
Possible values: AUTO REBOOT REBUILD


For example, the following command repairs two instances without forcing the repair:
            $ cdp environment repair-freeipa --environment-name crn:cdp:environments:us-west-1:12a0079b-1591-dd33-b721-a446bda74e67:environment:36853fcc-2fef-4094-834c-557b4aea34ee --instances i-078ba50f9feb6638f i-09e8b54a343b33d2 
cdp environments repair-freeipa --environment-name john-doe-env2-25793 --instances i-0288d991ed998ec03 --force
{
    "operationId": "edda2c68-5a29-4f60-a150-aca963b36ead",
    "status": "RUNNING",
    "successfulOperationDetails": [],
    "failureOperationDetails": [],
    "startDate": "2020-10-01T19:48:36.009000+00:00"
}
If you see the following error, consider rerunning the repair command with the
              --force option:

An error occurred: {"message":"No unhealthy instances to reboot. Maybe use the force option."} (Status Code: 404; Error Code: NOT_FOUND; Service: environments; Operation: repairFreeipa; Request ID: eca3a7fb-aa6b-48f7-ae29-b881161869e5;)

Check FreeIPA repair status
 You can check the status of an in-progress repair operation with
      get-repair-freeipa-status. 
This procedure uses the CDP command-line interface. If you haven't already installed the
        CLI, see Installing CDP client for instructions. 
Steps
Run the FreeIPA status command. Run this command from a computer that has network access
      to the FreeIPA hosts.
      cdp environments get-repair-freeipa-status --operation-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton]where
      the options are the following: 

Option
Description



--operation-id <value>
Operation-id for the previously requested repair operation.


--cli-input-json <value>
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string
                follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other
                arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the
                JSON-provided values. 


--generate-cli-skeleton
Prints a sample input JSON to standard output. Note the specified operation is
                not run if this argument is specified. The sample input can be used as an argument
                for --cli-input-json. 


This command can take 15 to 45 seconds to run as it gathers
      information in real-time. The output of the status command provides the status for the repair
      operation (in JSON format).
