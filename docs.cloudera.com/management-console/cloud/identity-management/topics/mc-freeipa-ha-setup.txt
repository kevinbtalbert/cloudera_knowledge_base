Creating an environment configured with FreeIPA
High-availability FreeIPA is automatically enabled when you register an environment via
    CDP web UI or CLI. The CDP CLI provides environment creation commands that include an option for
    setting multiple FreeIPA instances, which triggers the system to set up the identity management
    cluster.
FreeIPA HA cannot be added to an existing environment, only configured during environment
      creation.
Configuring FreeIPA node count via UI
When registering a CDP environment via web UI, you cannot select FreeIPA node count, but
        CDP adjusts FreeIPA based on the Data Lake scale that you select:
For an Enterprise Data Lake, a FreeIPA cluster with 3 nodes (HA) is provisioned
For a Medium Duty Data Lake, a FreeIPA cluster with 3 nodes (HA) is provisioned
For a Light Duty Data Lake, a  FreeIPA cluster with 2 nodes is provisioned


Configuring FreeIPA node count via CLI
When registering an environment using CDP CLI, CDP configures FreeIPA with 1 node by
        default. For production, you should change this setting to 3 nodes. To create an environment
        with selected FreeIPA node count via CLI:


Run the CDP CLI command to create an environment and include an additional parameter
            in the JSON-formatted command input:
            "freeIpa":{"instanceCountByGroup":<SPECIFY-NODE-COUNT>}Or pass
            the following
              parameter:--free-ipa instanceCountByGroup=<SPECIFY-NODE-COUNT>replacing
                <SPECIFY-NODE-COUNT> with the number of instances of FreeIPA
              you want. The maximum number of instances is 3. Choose 2 or 3 based on the level of
              redundancy you want. The recommended setting is 3 nodes.
After successfully registering the environment, continue to create the Data Lake as
            described in the cloud-provider specific instructions.
