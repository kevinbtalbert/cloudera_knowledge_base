Vertically scale FreeIPA instances
If necessary, you can select a larger or smaller instance type for FreeIPA after the
    environment has been created.
Selecting a larger instance type adds more vCPU and/or RAM to
      your instances. Instances can be scaled both up and down, but scaling down to a smaller size
      requires 4 CPU and a minimum of 4 GB memory.If you are using an instance without ephemeral
        disks, you can scale up or down to a new instance with ephemeral disks; however, the reverse
        is not supported. You cannot start with an instance with ephemeral disks and move to an
        instance without ephemeral disks.Vertical scaling is supported on AWS only.
        EBS-backed instances must be stopped before scaling. See Change the instance type in AWS documentation for
        more information.

In the CDP main navigation menu, click Environments  and select
          the environment that requires a larger FreeIPA instance type.Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the FreeIPA
          tab.Click Vertical Scaling.

From the drop-down menu of available instance types, select the instance that you
          want to scale to.

Click Scale. You can monitor the action from the
            Event History tab.Alternatively, you can use the CDP
          CLI to select a new instance for
