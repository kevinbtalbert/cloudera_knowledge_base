Resize FreeIPA
After resizing your Data Lake from Light Duty to Medium Duty you should also resize your
  FreeIPA cluster. You can do this via CDP CLI.
When you register a CDP environment, the FreeIPA node count (also known as
   “availability type”) depends on the Data Lake cluster shape:


When an environment with a Medium Duty Data Lake is provisioned, an HA FreeIPA
     cluster consisting of three instances is created along with it.


When an environment with a Light Duty Data Lake is provisioned, a two-node FreeIPA
     cluster is created along with it. 


When you resize (or “migrate”) your Data Lake from Light Duty to Medium Duty, you
   should resize your FreeIPA cluster accordingly from two to three nodes so that a Medium Duty Data
   Lake can be backed by a FreeIPA server that offers higher availability.
In general, FreeIPA resizing scenarios are supported:


Upscaling from one to three nodes


Upscaling from two to three nodes 


Downscaling from three to two nodes


The following validations are performed before the scaling operation:


Scale is possible given the current node count.


The instances are not deleted and all the instances are available.


FreeIPA stack is available.


The scaling path is supported by Cloudera Management Console


Scale up FreeIPA


To upscale your FreeIPA cluster, use the following
      command:cdp environments upscale-freeipa \
  --environment-name <ENVIRONENT-NAME> \
  --target-availability-type HA
For
      example:cdp environments upscale-freeipa \
  --environment-name my-env \
  --target-availability-type HA
This operation requires the --target-availability-type parameter, with the
      following possible values:

HA - 3 node HA cluster
TWO_NODE_BASED - 2 node cluster
NON_HA - 1 node-cluster




Scale down FreeIPA


To downscale your FreeIPA cluster, use the following
      command:cdp environments downscale-freeipa \
  --environment-name <ENVIRONENT-NAME> \
  --target-availability-type <AVAILABILITY-TYPE>
For
      example:cdp environments downscale-freeipa \
  --environment-name my-env \
  --target-availability-type HA
This operation requires the --target-availability-type parameter, with the
      following possible values:

HA - 3 node HA cluster
TWO_NODE_BASED - 2 node cluster
NON_HA - 1 node-cluster
