Outbound internet access and proxy
This section provides information on the outbound network destinations for CDP, and
  instructions on how to configure CDP to use a proxy for outbound access.
Depending on your enterprise requirements, you may have limited or restricted outbound network
   access and/or require the use of an internet proxy. Registering a cloud provider environment in
   CDP, as well as creating clusters within an environment requires outbound network access to
   certain destinations, and in some cases must go through a proxy.
