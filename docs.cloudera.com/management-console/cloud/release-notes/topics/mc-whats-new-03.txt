This release of the Management Console service introduces the following new
  features:
Wire encryption
CDP now offers TLS encryption across all endpoints for both data and control traffic,
        providing an internal Certificate Authority (CA) with commonly trusted certificates and
        automatic certificate expiry warnings. Adding new cluster hosts or services to a cluster
        with auto-TLS enabled automatically (which is CDP's default setting) creates and deploys the
        required certificates. CDP supports TLS 1.2.

Existing DynamoDB table
When configuring S3Guard as part of environment creation, you can now specify an existing
    DynamoDB table. Note that:
The table must be in the same region as the environment 
One table can be used with one environment only
CDP will not delete this table when deleting the environment 


Removal of environment groups
There is no longer need to create the cdp_$env group for each newly created environment
    and assign it to the environment.

Consistent FreeIPA password across all environments
There is no longer need to reset the FreeIPA password after creating a new environment. The
    password is automatically propagated to each newly created environment. You can still manage
    your FreeIPA password from the User Management page and reset it if needed. 

Knox uses port 443 instead of 8443
Knox gateway now uses port 443. If you select for CDP to create security groups
        automatically, this port is automatically open to your organization's CIDR as needed. If you
        are creating your environment's security groups manually, you should open port 443 instead
        of 8443 to your organization's CIDR.
