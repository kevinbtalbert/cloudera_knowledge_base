This release of the Management Console service introduces the following new
  features:
Specifying multiple CIDRs on security groups
CDP supports specifying multiple comma-separated CIDRs during environment registration under
     Security Access Settings > Access CIDR. 

Enabling workload analytics for Data Hub clusters
For each environment, you can manually enable and disable workload analytics so that
    diagnostic information about job and query execution is sent to Workload Manager for Data Hub
    clusters created within this environment. The option is available during environment creation
    under Logs Storage and Audits > Enable Workload Analytics. You can also update it once
    the environment is running by navigating to environment details > Actions > Enable/Disable
     Workload Analytics:

IAM role selection
When providing IAM instance profiles or IAM roles required for environment's Logs Storage
     and Audits and Data Access configuration, you can now select from available instance
    profiles and roles instead of manually providing IAM role ARNs.
