This release of the Management Console service introduces the following new
    features:
Tagging CDP resources
When you create an environment or other resources shared across your cloud provider
        account, CDP automatically adds default tags to the Cloudera-created resources in your cloud
        provider account. You can also define additional custom tags at either the environment level
        or tenant level.
