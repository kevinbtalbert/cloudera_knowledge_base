This release of the Management Console service introduces the following new
  features:
Support for connecting to private subnets
CDP supports communicating with Data Lake and Data Hub workload clusters that are on private
    subnets.  environments in Azure.
You can use Cluster Connectivity Manager (CCM) to  communicate with Data Lake and Data Hub
    workload clusters that are on private subnets. Communication takes place over private IPs
    without any inbound network access rules required. CDP requires that these clusters have
    outbound connections to AWS NLBs hosted in Cloudera's AWS account. Workload clusters initiate an
    SSH tunnel to the CDP control plane, which is then used for all communication thereafter.

Proxy server (technical preview)
Proxy server works with DataLake and Datahub in both transparent and non-transparent mode. The
    proxy server works with Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) and Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) in
    transparent mode only. Proxy server does not currently work with CML and CDW in non-transparent
    proxy mode.
You can use a proxy server to control the connections that are allowed from your VPC or VNet
    and prevent unattended connections initiated from your environment.
