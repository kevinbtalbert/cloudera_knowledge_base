This release of the Management Console service introduces the following new
  features:
Edit subnets
You can now add new subnets to the configuration of a running environment. This might be
    useful when you add a new service such as Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) and Clouder Data
    Warehouse (CDW) which require their own subnet.

Improvements in Data Hub cluster scaling
A number of significant improvements were made to properly clean up cloud resources for
    scaling up and down Data Hub clusters. This will reduce cloud costs that would have been
    incurred by any orphaned instances.
