This release of the Management Console service introduces the following new
  features:
Groups sync disabled by default
When you create a Group in CDP, the Sync Membership flag is now off by default. This will
    eliminate the situation when users would be removed from a CDP group if they werenâ€™t part of the
    same group in the ID Provider.

Support for HDP 2.6.x Classic Clusters using CCM
Support for registering Classic clusters using the reverse SSH mechanism is extended to legacy
    HDP 2.6.x clusters. This will be behind the CLASSIC_CLUSTERS entitlement.

Auditing Control Plane activity
Auditing is used to collect or log evidence of activity in a system that auditors can use to
    both track and analyze to answer questions such as: Who made a change to the system? When did a
    change happen? What exactly changed? Why was a change authorized?
