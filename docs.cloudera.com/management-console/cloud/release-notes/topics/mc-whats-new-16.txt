This release of the Management Console service introduces the following new features and
  behavioral changes:
Python 3.6 is required for CDP CLI
Starting in January 2021, the CDP CLI requires Python 3.6 for execution. Python 2 reached end of life on January 1, 2020 and is no longer
        receiving updates. While your existing CDP CLI installation running on Python 2 will keep
        working, new features and bug fixes are available only for CDP CLI installations running on
        Python 3.6. To check your Python version, use: 
python -V
If you need to install Python 3, you can: 
Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/
Use a package manager for your OS
Use a Python management tool 

Once you have Python 3, install CDP client by following the usual CDP client installation instructions.
