This release of the Management Console service introduces the following new features and
  behavioral changes:
Control Plane audit archiving
You can configure Control Plane audit archiving from CDP web interface. Previously, this
    feature was only available via CDP CLI. For updated documentation, refer to AWS setup for audit archiving and Azure setup for audit archiving.

New documentation for pre-creating ADLS Gen2 account for storing OS images
CDP uses an ADLS Gen2 storage account for storing images used for VMs. By default, CDP creates
    this account during environment registration, but you can optionally pre-create it. If needed,
    you can also copy the VHD files and create image resources manually. For instructions on how to
    do this, refer to ADLS Gen2 account for storing images.
