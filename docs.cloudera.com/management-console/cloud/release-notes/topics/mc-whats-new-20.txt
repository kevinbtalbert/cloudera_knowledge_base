This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Cloudera Runtime 7.2.8
Cloudera Runtime 7.2.8 is now available and can be used for registering an environment with a
    7.2.8 Data Lake and creating Data Hub clusters. See Cloudera Runtime. For all supported CDP Public Cloud Runtime versions, see Supported Cloudera Runtime and Cloudera Manager
    versions.

Medium duty Data Lake for AWS
The medium duty Data Lake configuration is now available for AWS. Light duty is still used by
    default, but you can change this when registering an environment from CDP user interface or when
    creating a Data Lake from CDP CLI using the --scale MEDIUM_DUTY_HA option. For
    information about available configurations, see Data Lake scale. 

New supported AWS regions
The eu-south-1 (Europe - Milan) and af-south-1 (Africa - Cape Town) regions are now available
    as technical preview for creating Data Hub clusters. See updated Supported AWS regions.

Cluster definitions location
Cluster definitions that can be used with a given environment are now listed in the details of
    that environment. To view them navigate your environment and access the Cluster
     Definitions tab.
