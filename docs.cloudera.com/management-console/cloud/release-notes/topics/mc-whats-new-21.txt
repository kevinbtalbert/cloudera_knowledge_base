Medium duty Data Lakes on Microsoft Azure
The medium duty Data Lake configuration is now available for Microsoft Azure. Light duty is
                still used by default, but you can change this when registering an environment from
                CDP user interface or when creating a Data Lake from CDP CLI using the
                    --scale MEDIUM_DUTY_HA option. For information about available
                configurations, see Data Lake scale.
