This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Cluster Definitions page was moved to environment details 
The Cluster Definitions page that used to be available in the Shared Resources section
    was removed. Instead, you can access all cluster definitions related to a specific environment
    from the Cluster Definitions tab available in the environment's details. You can save new
    cluster definitions using the Save As New Definition option available from the Create
    Data Hub wizard or from CDP CLI using the cdp datahub create-cluster-definition
    command.  

Ranger Audit environment parameter was moved to Data Access section
The option to specify the Ranger Audit role (AWS) managed identity (Azure) or service
    account (GCP) during environment registration was moved from the Logs - Storage and Audit
    section to the Data Access section. Consequently, these sections were renamed to
     Logs and Data Access and Audit. 

You can select specific nodes to repair within a Data Lake host group
From the Hardware tab of the Data Lake details, you can click the
          Repair icon to select specific nodes within a host group to
        repair.

The IAM policy for the provisioning credential has been updated to include new permissions
        related to load balancers. The following permissions are now
        required:cloudformation:UpdateStack

If you are using a restricted IAM policy for your provisioning credential, you must add
        these additional permissions.
