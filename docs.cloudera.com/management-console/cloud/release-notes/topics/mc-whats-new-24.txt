The following updates were made:
CDP Public Cloud onboarding documentation was moved
The following publications were moved to the CDP
     Public Cloud library:
Getting Started in CDP Public Cloud
AWS/Azure/GCP Requirements 
AWS/Azure/GCP Quick Starts
CDP Public Cloud Security Overview

This CDP Public Cloud library is accessible via the Get Started link on the https://docs.cloudera.com homepage or via the https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-public-cloud/cloud/index.html
    link:



The documentation that was moved is available from the following links:
https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/getting-started/index.html



https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/aws-quickstart/index.html
https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/azure-quickstart/index.html
https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/gcp-quickstart/index.html




https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/requirements-aws/index.html

https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/requirements-azure/index.html

https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/requirements-gcp/index.html


https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/security-overview/index.html

URL redirects were added temporarily; They will eventually be removed, so make sure to update
    your bookmarks. 
This change was made in effort to make CDP Public Cloud onboarding documentation easier to
    find. The previous location of this content (in the Management Console library) was unintuitive
    to many users. 

AWS/Azure/GCP planning documentation was consolidated
The AWS/Azure/GCP requirements content was consolidated in one place in the CDP
          Public Cloud library mentioned above. 
If the content that you have bookmarked throws a 404 error, it is most likely in one of the
    following publications: 
https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/requirements-aws/index.html

https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/requirements-azure/index.html

https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/requirements-gcp/index.html

To fix the error, you have three options:
Update the URL by replacing
              /management-console/cloud/environments-<cloud-provider>/ with
              /cdp-public-cloud/cloud/requirements-<cloud-provider>/, replacing
              <cloud-provider> with "aws", "azure", or "gcp". This works for the
            content that was moved, but not for topics that were consolidated into other
            documentation and removed.
On the https://docs.cloudera.com homepage,
      search the website for the content that moved. Search results will direct you to the correct
      location.
Navigate to one of the libraries linked above and find the content that you are looking
      for.

This change was made in effort to consolidate all documentation related to cloud provider
    requirements in one place. Previously, the documentation was scattered and users had to click on
    many links in order to find content.
