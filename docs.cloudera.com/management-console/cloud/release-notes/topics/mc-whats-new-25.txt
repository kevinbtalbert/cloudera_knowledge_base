This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Cloudera Runtime 7.2.9
Cloudera Runtime 7.2.9 is now available and can be used for registering an environment with
        a 7.2.9 Data Lake and creating Data Hub clusters. See Cloudera Runtime. For all supported CDP Public Cloud Runtime versions, see Supported Cloudera Runtime and Cloudera Manager
          versions.

Registering CDP Private Cloud Base clusters in CDP Public Cloud


You can now register CDP Private Cloud Base clusters as classic clusters in
       CDP:
The CDP Private Cloud Base clusters can be registered via Cloudera Manager for use in
        Replication Manager. 
Additionally, you can register CDP Private Cloud Base clusters via Cloudera Manager and
        Knox for use in Data Catalog and Replication Manager. This is a technical preview feature
        that should not be used in a production environment. 



For documentation, see Adding a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster.
