This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
    changes:
Cloudera Runtime 7.2.10
Cloudera Runtime 7.2.10 is now available and can be used for registering an environment
        with a 7.2.10 Data Lake and creating Data Hub clusters. See Cloudera Runtime. For all supported CDP Public Cloud Runtime versions, see Supported Cloudera Runtime and Cloudera Manager
          versions.

S3Guard removal 
S3Guard is no longer used with newly registered AWS environments using Runtime version
        7.2.2 or newer. Consequently, the ''Enable S3Guard" environment registration option has been
        removed and there is no need to create a DynamoDB table for your environment when planing to
        use Runtime version 7.2.2 or newer. Environments created prior to this change continue to
        use S3Guard.
