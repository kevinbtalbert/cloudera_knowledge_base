This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
FreeIPA HA repair
FreeIPA HA repair is now available for all newly created AWS and Azure environments in CDP.
    When running in high-availability mode, the identity management system runs multiple instances
    of FreeIPA on separate hosts. In case of failure, you can now repair failed hosts using the CDP
    command-line within one week of a node failing. For more information, see Repair a FreeIPA instance.

"Don't create public IPs" option was renamed
The Don't create public IPs option available during Azure and GCP environment
    registration was renamed to Create public IPs  and is enabled by default.
