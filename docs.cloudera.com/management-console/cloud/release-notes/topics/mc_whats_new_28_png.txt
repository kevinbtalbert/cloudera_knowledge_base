This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
FreeIPA backup location 
During AWS, Azure, or GCP environment registration via CDP web interface or CDP CLI, you can
    optionally specify a separate cloud storage location (FreeIPA "Backup Location Base") for
    FreeIPA backups. If no separate location is specified, FreeIPA backups are stored in Logs
    Location Base. For more information, see:
Minimal AWS setup for cloud storage
Minimal Azure setup for cloud storage
Minimal GCP setup for cloud storage


FreeIPA HA enabled by default for new AWS and Azure environments
FreeIPA HA is now enabled for all newly created AWS and Azure environments in CDP. The number
    of nodes used for the FreeIPA server depends on the Data Lake scale selected: light duty uses 2
    nodes and medium duty uses 3. The FreeIPA HA toggle button has been removed from the environment
    registration UI, but, if needed, it is possible to customize FreeIPA node count when registering
    an AWS or Azure environment via CDP CLI. For more information, see  Managing FreeIPA.
