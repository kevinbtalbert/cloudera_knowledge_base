This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
New permission for GCP Logger service account
In addition to the previously documented permissions, if you would like to use a bucket path
     (gs://<bucket>/<path>) instead of a bucket
     (gs://<bucket>) for the Logs or Backups bucket, you should
    assign the storage.objects.list permission to the custom role. See Minimum setup for cloud storage.

"Create public IPs" is disabled with CCM
The Create public IPs option available on the UI during Azure and GCP environment
    registration is now disabled by default when CCM is enabled.
