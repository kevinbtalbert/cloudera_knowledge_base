This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Cloudera Runtime 7.2.11
Cloudera Runtime 7.2.11 is now available and can be used for registering an environment with a
        7.2.11 Data Lake and creating Data Hub clusters. See Cloudera Runtime. For all supported CDP Public Cloud Runtime versions, see Supported Cloudera Runtime and Cloudera Manager
          versions.

Specifying multiple existing AWS security groups
When using your existing security groups for registering an AWS environment in CDP via CDP
    CLI, you can provide a comma-separated list of multiple security groups for both Knox
    (securityGroupIdForKnox) and Default (defaultSecurityGroupId). This is a CLI-only
    feature.

Specifying multiple GCP shared subnets
When using an existing shared VPC for registering a GCP environment in CDP via CDP web
    interface or CLI, you can specify multiple shared subnets.

Support for Bahrain (me-south-1) AWS region 
Registering an environment and provisioning Data Hubs is now supported in the Bahrain
    (me-south-1) AWS region. See Supported AWS regions.

Updated outbound network access destinations
If you are using Machine Learning, Data Engineering, or DataFlow data services and have
        restricted egress access, starting on September 7, 2021, you need to add the following new
        endpoints to your egress rules: 

*.s3.{eu-west-1, us-west-2, ap-southeast-1}.amazonaws.com

s3-r-w.{eu-west-1, us-west-2, ap-southeast-1}.amazonaws.com
*.execute-api.{eu-west-1, us-west-2, ap-southeast-1}.amazonaws.com

The region selected should be the region that is geographically closest to where the
    environment is deployed. 
Customers operating in outbound restricted networks will be unable to download docker images,
        which will impact creating new clusters. Existing environments deployed in outbound
        restricted networks may experience operational issues, including limited ability to start,
        scale and repair the data service clusters.
