This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Updated Azure provisioning credential's permissions
The following new Azure permissions are required for the CDP provisioning
    credential:"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/backendAddressPools/join/action",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/delete",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/read",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/write",
If you have created a custom role for the CDP provisioning credential, you should update your
    application registration on Azure, assigning these additional permissions. If you have assigned
    the built-in Contributor role instead of granular permissions, you do not need to take any
    action.
Documentation has been updated. See Prerequisites for the provisioning credential.

FreeIPA HA for GCP environments 
FreeIPA HA is now supported and used by default for all newly created GCP
     environments.
