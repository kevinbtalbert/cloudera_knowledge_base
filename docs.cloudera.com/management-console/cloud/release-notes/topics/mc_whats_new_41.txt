This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
    changes:
Fine-grained Access Control for ADLS Gen2 and S3
The fine-grained access control for ADLS Gen2 and S3 cloud storage via the Ranger
        Authorization Service (RAZ) enables Amazon S3 and ADLS Gen2 users to control access per user and
        per directory in cloud storage. By specifying Apache Ranger policies for cloud storage, admins
        can provide home directories and audit capabilities similar to those used with HDFS files in an
        on-premises or IaaS deployment. 
For more information and setup steps refer to:
