This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Workload password policies
In order to bring your workload password complexity requirements in line with company
        policy, you can set your FreeIPA password policies via CDP web interface and CDP CLI.
        Password policies can be configured for length, complexity, expiration, and scope. For more
        information, refer to Configuring workload password policies.

Pull-based audit archiving
Pull-based audit archiving allows you to pull audit events for archiving purposes without
        any extra configuration beyond Control Plane API usage. For more information refer to Pull-based audit archiving.

Custom images and catalogs
If necessary, you can use a custom Runtime or FreeIPA image for compliance or security
        reasons. You can then use the CDP CLI to register a custom image catalog and set the custom
        image within the custom image catalog. For more information refer to Custom images and catalogs.

Support for CDW in eu-1 regional Control Plane
Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) is now supported in the eu-1 (Germany) regional Control
        Plane. To use CDW in one this Control Plane, your CDP administrator must create a new
        environment.
