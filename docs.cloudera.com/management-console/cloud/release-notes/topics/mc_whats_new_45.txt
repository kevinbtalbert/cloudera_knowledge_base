This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Customer managed encryption keys on Azure
By default, local Data Lake, FreeIPA, and Data Hub disks attached to Azure VMs and the
    PostgreSQL server instance used by the Data Lake and Data Hubs are encrypted with server-side
    encryption (SSE) using Platform Managed Keys (PMK), but you can optionally configure SSE with
    Customer Managed Keys (CMK). For more information, refer to Adding a customer managed encryption key for Azure.
