This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Cloudera Runtime 7.2.14
Cloudera Runtime 7.2.14 is now available and can be used for registering an environment with a
    7.2.14 Data Lake and creating Data Hub clusters. See Cloudera Runtime. For all supported CDP Public Cloud Runtime versions, see Supported Cloudera Runtime and Cloudera Manager
    versions.

Resource list filtering
CDP users other than PowerUsers and CDP administrators can only list the resources that they
    are authorized to access. Prior to this change, all CDP users were able to list all resources,
    but if they tried to access a resource that they were not authorized to access, CDP would return
    an error.
