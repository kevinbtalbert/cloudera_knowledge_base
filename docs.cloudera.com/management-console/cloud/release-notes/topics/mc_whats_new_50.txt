This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Changed FreeIPA Azure VM type
The Azure VM type used for the FreeIPA server was changed from Standard_D3_v2 to
    Standard_DS3_v2 so that FreeIPA nodes can be encrypted at host. Standard_D3_v2 doesn't support
    encryption at host while Standard_DS3_v2 does. See updated Overview of Azure resources used by CDP.

Setting IDBroker mappings in a RAZ environment is disabled 
If a CDP environment has RAZ enabled, setting IDBroker mappings is disabled during environment
    creation and when the environment is already running. If your environment has RAZ enabled, you
    should be using Ranger for authorizing user and group access to the S3 or ADLS Gen 2 cloud
    storage used by the Data Lake. 

Azure Load Balancer 
The Standard SKU Azure Load Balancer is used in multiple places in CDP Data Lakes and Data
    Hubs. It is used as a frontend for Knox in both Data Lakes and Data Hubs, and for Oozie HA in HA
    Data Hubs. See Azure Load Balancers in Data Lakes and Data Hubs.

Upgrading classic clusters from CCMv1 to CCMv2
You can now upgrade your CDH, HDP, or CDP Private Cloud Base clusters that were previously
    registered in CDP from CCMv1 to CCMv2. See  Upgrading a classic cluster from CCMv1 to CCMv2.
