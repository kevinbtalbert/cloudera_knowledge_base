This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Bring your own Azure private DNS zone

CDP supports using a private endpoint for Azure Postgres with an existing
            Azure private DNS zone. The private DNS zone can now be pre-created and provided by you,
            or created by CDP. Previously, CDP always created the private DNS zone when a private
            endpoint was created. See updated Azure requirements for using a private endpoint for
              Azure Postgres and Enabling a private endpoint for Azure Postgres in
              CDP. 


Extended upgrade version support for RAZ-enabled environments
Data Lake major/minor version upgrades for RAZ-enabled environments are now available for
        Runtime versions 7.2.10-7.2.12 to 7.2.14+.
