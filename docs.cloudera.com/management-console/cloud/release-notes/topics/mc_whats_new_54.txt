This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
New permissions were added to the default cross-account AWS policy
The cross-account access IAM role that is used for
    the CDP credential has been changed to include a set of new permissions required for Cloudera
    Data Engineering (CDE), Cloudera DataFlow (CDF), and Cloudera Machine Learning (CML). The new
    AWS permissions are required to simplify the creation of the Kubernetes cluster on AWS. As a
    result of this change, all customers using or planning to use CDE, CDF, or CML in CDP Public
    Cloud on AWS must update their existing cross-account permissions to ensure that these three
    data services can be created, enabled, or updated.
If you are using or planning to use CDE, CDF, or CML, add the following permissions to the
    cross-account
    role:{ 
"Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": [
 "ssm:DescribeParameters",
 "ssm:GetParameter",
 "ssm:GetParameters",
 "ssm:GetParameterHistory",
 "ssm:GetParametersByPath"
 ],
 "Resource": [
 "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:parameter/aws/service/eks/optimized-ami/*"
 ]
}
