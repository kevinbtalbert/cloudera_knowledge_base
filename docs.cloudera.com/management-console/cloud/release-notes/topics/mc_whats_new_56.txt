This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Customer managed encryption keys on AWS
By default, Data Lake and FreeIPA's Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes and Relational
    Database Service (RDS) are encrypted using a default key from Amazonâ€™s KMS, but you can
    optionally configure encryption using Customer Managed Keys (CMK). Data Hubs inherit
    environment's encryption key by default but you have an option to specify a different CMK during
    Data Hub creation. For more information, refer to Adding a customer managed encryption key to a CDP environment
     running on AWS.

Deploying CDP in multiple AWS availability zones


By default, CDP provisions Data Lake, FreeIPA, and Data Hubs in a single AWS availability zone
    (AZ), but you can optionally choose to deploy them across multiple availability zones
    (multi-AZ). It is possible to enable it either for all or some of these components. For more
    information, refer to Deploying CDP in multiple AWS availability zones.
