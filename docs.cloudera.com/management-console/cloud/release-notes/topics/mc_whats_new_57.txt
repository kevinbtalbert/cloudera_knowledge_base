This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Customer managed encryption keys on GCP


By default, a Google-managed encryption key is used to encrypt disks and Cloud SQL instances
      in Data Lake, FreeIPA, and Data Hub clusters, but you can optionally configure CDP to use a
      customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) instead. This can only be configured using CDP CLI.
      There is no UI option available for specifying a GCP CMEK in CDP. For more information, refer
      to Adding a customer managed encryption key for GCP.
