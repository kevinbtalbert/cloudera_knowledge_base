This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Public Endpoint Access Gateway for Azure


During Azure environment registration, you can optionally enable Public Endpoint Access
      Gateway, which provides secure connectivity to UIs and APIs in Data Lake and Data Hub clusters
      deployed using private networking, allowing users to access these resources without complex
      changes to their networking or creating direct connections to cloud provider networks. With
      this release, Public Endpoint Access Gateway is general availability for AWS and Azure, and it
      remains preview for GCP. See Public Endpoint Access Gateway.



Generate workload username based on email
By default, workload usernames are generated using the identity provider user ID.
    Alternatively, you can now generate workload usernames based on users' email addresses. This is
    useful in cases when the identity provider user ID is an opaque ID, like a uuid or employee ID,
    which gives equally opaque workload usernames. For more information, see Generating workload usernames based on email.

AWS Jakarta region
You can now register a CDP environment and create Data Hubs in the AWS Jakarta Region
    (ap-southeast-3). See updated Supported AWS regions.

Support for Operational Database in ap-1 and eu-1 regional Control Planes


Cloudera Operational Database is now supported in the ap-1 (Australia) and eu-1 (Germany)
      regional Control Planes. 



Restricting all Cloudera SSO access
For added security, you can now restrict all Cloudera SSO access (including account
    administrator access) by contacting Cloudera Support and they can disable or enable the
    "Cloudera SSO All Login Enabled" setting for the account. Previously, account administrator
    access could not be restricted. For more information, see Disabling the Cloudera SSO login.
