This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
  changes:
Changed permissions for managing proxies in CDP
You no longer need to be a PowerUser to register and manage a proxy in CDP. The new
    minimal roles are as follows:
EnvironmentCreator can register a proxy in CDP. 
Owner or SharedResourceUser can view details of a proxy.
Owner can delete a proxy registration from CDP.

This change has been introduced for new proxy registrations only; That is, proxies registered
    prior to this change continue to be managed by a PowerUser. 
See updated Setting up a non-transparent proxy in CDP.
