This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
    changes:
Validate and prepare for upgrade
Before you perform a Data Hub upgrade, you can run the new Validate and Prepare
        option to check for any configuration issues and begin the Cloudera Runtime parcel download
        and distribution. Using the validate and prepare option does not require downtime and makes
        the maintenance window for an upgrade shorter. For more information see Preparing for an upgrade.

AWS Hong Kong region
You can now register a CDP environment and create Data Hubs in the AWS Hong Kong Region
        (ap-east-1). See updated Supported AWS regions.
