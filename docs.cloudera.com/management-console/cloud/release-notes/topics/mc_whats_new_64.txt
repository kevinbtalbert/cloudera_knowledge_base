This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
    changes:
Database Upgrade and default major version change
Newly deployed Data Lake and Data Hub clusters with Cloudera Runtime 7.2.7 or above are now
        configured to use a PostgreSQL version 11 database by default.
A new  Database Upgrade capability is now available for existing Data Lake and
        Data Hub clusters. If you are running clusters on Cloudera Runtime version 7.2.6 or below,
        upgrade to a more recent version before performing the database upgrade.
The major version of the database used by Data Lake or Data Hub clusters is now
        also displayed on the Database page of the respective service.
Cloudera strongly recommends that the Database Upgrade is performed on all
          clusters running PostgreSQL version 10 before November 10, 2022.
For more information, see  Upgrading database to Postgres 11

FreeIPA recipes and recipe type changes
You can register and attach recipes to run on a specific FreeIPA host group. For more
        information, see Recipes.
The following recipe types have been renamed for Data Hub, Data Lake, and FreeIPA recipes:
pre-service-deployment (formerly pre-cluster-manager-start)
post-service-deployment (formerly post-cluster-install)

These changes will not affect existing recipe automation.
