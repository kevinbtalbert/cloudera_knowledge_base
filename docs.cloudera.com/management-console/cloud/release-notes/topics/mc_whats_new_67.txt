This release of the Management Console service introduces the following
    changes:
Data Lake scaling
You can now scale up a light duty Data Lake to the medium duty form factor, which has
        greater resiliency than light duty and can service a larger number of clients. You can
        trigger the scale-up in the CDP UI or through the CDP CLI. For more information, see Data Lake scaling.
