Cross-account access IAM role
To allow CDP to create resources in your AWS account, you create a cross-account access
  IAM role in your AWS account and grant CDP access to the role as a trusted principal by specifying
  a specific AWS account and an external ID. 
The policy for the cross-account access IAM role must have the permissions enumerated in the
      documentation linked below. In addition, the IAM role must reference the specific AWS account
      ID and external ID provided in the Management Console.
