Register a GCP environment from CDP CLICloudera Docs
Register a GCP environment from CDP CLI 
Once you’ve met the Google Cloud cloud provider requirements, register your GCP
  environment.
Before you begin
This assumes that you have already fulfilled the environment prerequisites described in GCP requirements.
Required role:
EnvironmentCreator
Steps
Unlike in the CDP web interface, in CDP CLI environment creation is a two-step process with
     environment creation and data lake creation being two separate steps. The following commands
     can be used to create an environment in CDP.

Once you’ve met the prerequisites, register your GCP environment in CDP using the cdp
      environments create-gcp-environment command and providing the CLI input parameters. For
       example:cdp environments create-gcp-environment --cli-input-json '{
    "environmentName": "test-env",
    "description": "Test GCP environment",
    "credentialName": "test-gcp-crd",
    "region": "us-west2",
    "publicKey": "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaZ1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDwCI/wmQzbNn9YcA8vdU+Ot41IIUWJfOfiDrUuNcULOQL6ke5qcEKuboXzbLxV0YmQcPFvswbM5S4FlHjy2VrJ5spyGhQajFEm9+PgrsybgzHkkssziX0zRq7U4BVD68kSn6CuAHj9L4wx8WBwefMzkw7uO1CkfifIp8UE6ZcKKKwe2fLR6ErDaN9jQxIWhTPEiFjIhItPHrnOcfGKY/p6OlpDDUOuMRiFZh7qMzfgvWI+UdN/qjnTlc/M53JftK6GJqK6osN+j7fCwKEnPwWC/gmy8El7ZMHlIENxDut6X0qj9Okc/JMmG0ebkSZAEbhgNOBNLZYdP0oeQGCXjqdv",
    "enableTunnel": true,
    "usePublicIp": true,
    "existingNetworkParams": {
        "networkName": "eng-private",
        "subnetNames": [
            "private-us-west2"
        ],
        "sharedProjectId": "dev-project"
    },
    "logStorage": {
        "storageLocationBase": "gs://logs",
        "serviceAccountEmail": "logger@dev-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    }
}'

Parameter
Description



environmentName
Provide a name for your environment.


credentialName
Provide the name of the credential created earlier.


region
Specify the region where your existing VPC network is located. For
           example ”us-west2” is a valid region. 


publicKey
Paste your SSH public key.


existingNetworkParams
Provide a JSON specifying the
            following:{
 "networkName": "string",
 "subnetNames": ["string", ...],
 "sharedProjectId": "string"
 }Replace the values with the actual VPC network name, one or more subnet names
            and shared project ID. The sharedProjectId value needs to be set
            in the following way:
For a shared VPC, set it to the GCP host project ID
For a non-shared VPC, set it to the GCP project ID of the project where CDP is
              being deployed.



enableTunnel 
By default CCM is enabled (set to “true”). If you would like to disable it, set it
           to “false”. If you disable it, then you must also add the following to your JSON
           definition to specify two security groups as
           follows:"securityAccess":
 {
   "securityGroupIdForKnox": "string",
   "defaultSecurityGroupId": "string"
 }


usePublicIp
Set this to “true” or “false”, depending on whether or not you want to
           create public IPs.


logStorage
Provide a JSON specifying your configuration for cluster and audit logs:
 {
 "storageLocationBase": "string",
 "serviceAccountEmail": "string"
 }
The storageLocationBase should be in the following format:
            gs://my-bucket-name.

noteCDP CLI includes the cdp environments create-gcp-environment
       --generate-cli-skeleton command option, which allows you to generate a CLI JSON template. You
       can also use CLI help to get some information about specific CLI command options.
      
To verify that your environment is running,
      use:cdp environments list-environmentsYou can also log in to the CDP
      web interface to check the deployment status.
Once your environment and Data Lake are running, you should set IDBroker Mappings. To
      create the mappings, run the cdp environments set-id-broker-mappings command. For
       example:cdp environments set-id-broker-mappings \
 --environment-name test-env \
 --data-access-role dl-admin@dev-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
 --ranger-audit-role ranger-audit@dev-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
 --mappings '[{"accessorCrn": "crn:altus:iam:us-west-1:45ca3068-42a6-4227-8394-13a4493e2ac0:user:430c534d-8a19-4d9e-963d-8af377d16963", "role": "data-science@dev-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"},{"accessorCrn":"crn:altus:iam:us-west-1:45ca3068-42a6-4227-8394-13a4493e2ac0:machineUser:mfox-gcp-idbmms-test-mu/2cbca867-647b-44b9-8e41-47a01dea6c19","role":"data-eng@dev-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}]'

Parameter
Description



environment-name
Specify a name of the environment created earlier.


data-access-role
Specify an email address of the Data Lake admin service account created
           earlier. 


ranger-audit-role
Specify an email address of the Ranger audit service account created
           earlier. 


mappings
Map CDP users or groups to GCP service accounts created earlier. Use the following
            syntax:[
{
"accessorCrn": "string", 
"role": "string"
} 
... 
]You can obtain user or group CRN from the Management Console > User
             Management by navigating to details of a specific user or group. The role should be specified as service account email. 


Next, sync IDBroker
      mappings:cdp environments sync-id-broker-mappings --environment-name demo3
Finally, check the sync
      status:cdp environments get-id-broker-mappings-sync-status --environment-name demo3
One your environment is running, you can create a Data Lake using the cdp datalake
       create-gcp-datalake command and providing the CLI input
       parameters:cdp datalake create-gcp-datalake --cli-input-json '{
    "datalakeName": "my-dl",
    "environmentName": "test-env",
    "scale": "LIGHT_DUTY",
    "cloudProviderConfiguration": {
        "serviceAccountEmail": "idbroker@dev-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
        "storageLocation": "gs://data-storage"
    }
}' 

Parameter
Description



datalakeName
Provide a name for your Data Lake.


environmentName
Provide a name of the environment created earlier.


scale
Provide Data Lake scale. It must be one of: 
LIGHT_DUTY or 
MEDIUM_DUTY_HA.



cloudProviderConfiguration
Provide the name of the data storage bucket and the email of the IDBroker
           service account. 

noteCDP CLI includes the cdp datalake create-gcp-datalake --generate-cli-skeleton
       command option, which allows you to generate a CLI JSON template. You can also use CLI help
       to get some information about specific CLI command options. 
To verify that your Data lake is running,
       use:cdp datalake list-datalakesYou can also log in to the
       CDP web interface to check the deployment status.

After you finish

After your environment is running, perform the following steps:
You must assign roles to specific users and groups for the environment so that selected
     users or user groups can access the environment. Next, you need to perform user sync. For
     steps, refer to Enabling admin and user access to environments.
You must onboard your users and/or groups for cloud storage. For steps, refer to Onboarding CDP users and groups for cloud storage.
You must create Ranger policies for your users. For instructions on how to access your Data
     Lake, refer to Accessing Data Lake services. Once you've accessed
     Ranger, create Ranger policies to determine which users have
     access to which databases and tables.
