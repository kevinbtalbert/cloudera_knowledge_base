Register an AWS environment from CDP CLICloudera Docs
Register an AWS environment from CDP CLI
Once youâ€™ve met the AWS cloud provider requirements, register your AWS
  environment.
Before you begin
This assumes that you have already fulfilled the environment prerequisites described in AWS requirements.
Required role:
EnvironmentCreator
Steps
Unlike in the CDP web interface, in CDP CLI environment creation is a three-step process with
     environment creation, setting IDBroker mappings and Data Lake creation being three separate
     steps. The easiest way to obtain the correct commands is to provide all parameters in CDP web
     interface and then generate the CDP CLI commands on the last page of the wizard. For detailed
     steps, refer to Obtain CLI commands for registering an environment.
After you finish
After your environment is running, perform the following steps:
You must assign roles to specific users and groups for the environment so that selected
     users or user groups can access the environment. Next, you need to perform user sync. For
     steps, refer to Enabling admin and user access to environments.
You must onboard your users and/or groups for cloud storage. For steps, refer to Onboarding CDP users and groups for cloud storage.
You must create Ranger policies for your users. For instructions on how to access your Data
     Lake, refer to Accessing Data Lake services. Once you've accessed
     Ranger, create Ranger policies to determine which users have
     access to which databases and tables.
