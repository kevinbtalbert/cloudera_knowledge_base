Problem deleting resources when using AWS Firewall Manager
If you have AWS Firewall Manager enabled, ensure that your AWS Firewall Manager policies
  or rules don't affect any AWS resources created by CDP. If they do, you may experience problems
  deleting these resources due to dependency violation. 
For more information, refer to Security group policies > Avoid conflicts if you also
    use outside sources to manage security groups in AWS documentation.
