General networking and authentication errors
Are you finding that your CDP interactions are hitting errors when
    they shouldn't? Check to see if your identity management system is working.
    FreeIPA errors can be hidden as failures from Knox, Kerberos, or other
    systems that act as clients to FreeIPA.
You can eliminate FreeIPA issues by checking the following status:
Management Console: Select the Environment > Summary > FreeIPA status.



Cloud provider instance status: Follow the link for one of the
          FreeIPA hosts in the status to open the cloud provider's status page
          for that host. If one of the FreeIPA hosts is stopped, restart it. It
          is possible to still see a "Running" status for FreeIPA even if one of
          the hosts is stopped.
