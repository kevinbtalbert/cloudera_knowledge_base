Accessing non-SSO interfaces using workload user and password
You can access all SSO-based interfaces that can be accessed using the browser with your
    CDP credentials, but you cannot access SSH-based or other non-SSO connections with these
    credentials. Instead, you must use your workload user and set the workload password to access
    such interfaces.
You must import and trust the IPA's root certificate as the IPA CA will be a self-signed
      CA.

note
If you would like to access cluster nodes, you have two options: you can use your
          workload password or an SSH key. The advantage of the workload password is that it allows
          a user to interface with Kerberos. Therefore, if you would like to interface with
          Kerberos, use your workload password to SSH to cluster nodes.
