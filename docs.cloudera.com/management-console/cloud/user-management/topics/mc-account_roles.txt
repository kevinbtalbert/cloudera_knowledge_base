Account roles
A CDP role grants permissions to perform tasks in CDP that are not associated with a
  specific resource. You explicitly assign a role to a user, machine user, or a group.
When assigning roles to users and groups, consider the following:

Only PowerUser can assign account roles.
A user needs the following two types of roles in order to assign access to
    resources to other users:
One of the roles that allow role assignment: EnvironmentCreator,
       EnvironmentAdmin, DataSteward, DatahubAdmin or another admin role for a
      CDP service. 
One of the roles that allow listing users within the organization: IamUser
      or IamViewer.

All users who need to access CDP CLI need the IamUser role.

Each role is identified by a CRN, which uses the following
   format:crn:altus:iam:<CONTROL_PLANE_REGION>:altus:role:<ROLE_NAME>
For example, the following is the IamViewer role
   CRN:crn:altus:iam:us-west-1:altus:role:IamViewer
You can view all available roles and their CRNs by using the cdp iam
     list-roles command. 
Account roles can be assigned from the Management Console > User Management >
    Roles tab or from CDP CLI by using the cdp iam assign-user-role or
    cdp iam assign-group-role commands.
The predefined account roles available in CDP are as follows:

Description
Important considerations



PowerUser
Grants permission to perform all tasks on all resources. 

Unlike other users (who only see the resources that they are authorized to list), Power
        Users can list all resources. By default, Power Users don’t not have full access to all
        resources but can assign themselves a resource role that grants them access to these
        resources.



EnvironmentCreator
Grants permission to create environments and shared resources (cluster templates,
              recipes, image catalogs, credentials, proxies), and sync users.
Since shared resources are managed separately from environments, in order for a user
       with the EnvironmentCreator role to be able to use a provisioning credential for
       creating an environment, that user needs to be Owner or SharedResourceUser for
       that credential.EnvironmentCreator is the only role that allows you to manage
        access to proxies that have been registered in CDP.


IamUser
 Grants permission to create access keys and upload SSH keys for the user (but not for
       other users).Moreover, this role includes all permissions of the
         IamViewer role. It grants permission to view all users in the account and their
        assigned roles and access keys. 
Either the IamUser or IamViewer role is required to list other
       users, therefore any user who needs to assign roles, such as EnvironmentCreator,
        EnvironmentAdmin, DataHubAdmin, and so on, should be assigned either
        IamUser or IamViewer.


IamViewer
Grants permission to view all users in the account and their assigned roles
        and access keys.
Either the IamUser or IamViewer role is required to list other
       users, therefore any user who needs to assign roles, such as EnvironmentCreator,
        EnvironmentAdmin, DataHubAdmin, and so on, should be assigned either
        IamUser or IamViewer.

ClassicClustersCreatorThis role is required to register a new cluster. If this role is not present then the “Add Cluster” button is not visible to the user.

DataCatalogCspRuleManager
Grants permission to perform all tasks on CSP rules in Data Catalog.



DataCatalogCspRuleViewer
Grants permission to list and view CSP rules in Data Catalog.



DFCatalogAdmin

        Catalog. This includes importing and deleting flow definitions, as well as uploading new
        versions of existing flow definitions.



DFCatalogViewer
Grants permission to browse the DataFlow Catalog and view flow
        definitions.
