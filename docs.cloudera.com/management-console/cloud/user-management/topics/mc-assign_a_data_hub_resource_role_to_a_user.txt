Assign a Data Hub resource role to a user
You can assign a Data Hub resource role to a user or a machine user to allow them to
  manage a specific Data Hub.

noteWhile full access to manage a Data Hub via the Management Console can be granted via
    assigning the Owner role on the scope of the Data Hub, access to the underlying cluster
    can only be granted by assigning the EnvironmentUser role on the scope of the environment
    where the Data Hub is running. 

Required roles: 
Owner or a role that allows administering the environment AND 
One of the following: IamViewer or IamUser (required for listing
     users).
In order to assign a role, a user must have all rights from the role that they are planning
   to assign to another user; That is, a user can only assign a role higher than his own.



CDP UICDP CLI


Sign in to the CDP console.
Navigate to the details page of your Data Hub cluster. This can be done in a few
     ways. For example:
From the CDP home page, click Data Hub Clusters and then click on the
       specific cluster.
From the CDP home page, click on Management Console, navigate to the
        Data Hub Clusters page, and then click on the specific cluster. 

From the Actions menu select Manage Access.
Enter the name of the user in the text box.
In the Update Resource Roles window, select the required resource role.
Click Update Roles.



Use the following commands to assign a resource to a user or a machine user:
cdp iam assign-user-resource-role \
--user-name <value> \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value> 
cdp iam assign-machine-user-resource-role \
--machine-user-name <value> \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value>
To remove a resource role from a user or a machine user:
cdp iam unassign-user-resource-role \
--user-name <value> \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value>
cdp iam unassign-machine-user-resource-role \
--machine-user-name <value> \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value>

The resource-role-crn parameter requires the CRN of the resource role
    you want to assign to the user. You can use the cdp iam list-resource-roles
    command to list resource roles with role CRNs.
The resource-crn parameter requires the CRN of the resource on which you
    want to grant the resource role permissions. You can obtain it from the details of the
    resource.

To get a list of the resource roles assigned to a user or a machine user:
cdp iam list-user-assigned-resource-role \
--user-name <value>
cdp iam list-machine-user-assigned-resource-role \
--machine-user-name <value>
