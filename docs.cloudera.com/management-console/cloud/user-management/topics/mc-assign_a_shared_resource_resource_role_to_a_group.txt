Assign a shared resource resource role to a group
You can assign shared resources such as credentials, clusters templates, recipes, image
    catalogs, or proxies to groups. To assign a shared resource to a group, assign a specific
    resource role on the scope of the specific shared resource.
Required roles: 
Owner or a role that allows administering the environment AND 
One of the following: IamViewer or IamUser (required for listing
     users).
In order to assign a role, a user must have all rights from the role that they are planning
   to assign to another user; That is, a user can only assign a role higher than his own.



CDP UICDP CLI


Sign in to the CDP console.
From the CDP home page, click Management Console.
From the left pane, select Shared Resources, and then select a resource
     type (for example Cluster Templates) to view a summary of all resources of that type.
Find the specific resource (for example a specific cluster template) and click on
     it to navigate to its details page.
Click on Manage Access.
Enter the name of the group in the text box.
In the Update Resource Roles window, select the required resource role.
Click Update Roles.



To assign a resource role to a group:
cdp iam assign-group-resource-role \
--group-name <value> \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value> 
To remove a resource role from a group:
cdp iam unassign-group-resource-role \
--group-name <value> \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value>

The resource-role-crn parameter requires the CRN of the resource role
    you want to assign to the group.
The resource-crn parameter requires the CRN of the resource on which you
    want to grant the resource role permissions.

To get a list of the resource roles assigned to a group:
cdp iam list-group-assigned-resource-role \
--group-name <value>
