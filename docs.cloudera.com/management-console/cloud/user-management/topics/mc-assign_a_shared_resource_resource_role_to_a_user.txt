Assign a shared resource resource role to a user
You can assign shared resources such as credentials, clusters templates, recipes, image
  catalogs, or proxies to users and machine users. To assign a shared resource to a user or a
  machine user, assign a specific resource role on the scope of the specific shared
  resource.
Required roles: 
Owner or a role that allows administering the environment AND 
One of the following: IamViewer or IamUser (required for listing
     users).
In order to assign a role, a user must have all rights from the role that they are planning
   to assign to another user; That is, a user can only assign a role higher than his own.



CDP UICDP CLI


Sign in to the CDP console.
From the CDP home page, click Management Console.
From the left pane, select Shared Resources, and then select a resource
     type (for example Cluster Templates) to view a summary of all resources of that type.
Find the specific resource (for example a specific cluster template) and click on
     it to navigate to its details page.
Click on Manage Access.
Enter the name of the user in the text box.
In the Update Resource Roles window, select the required resource role.
Click Update Roles.



Use the following commands to assign a resource to a user or a machine user:
cdp iam assign-user-resource-role \
--user-name <value> \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value> 
cdp iam assign-machine-user-resource-role \
--machine-user-name <value> \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value>
To remove a resource role from a user or a machine user:
cdp iam unassign-user-resource-role \
--user-name <value> \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value>
cdp iam unassign-machine-user-resource-role \
--machine-user-name <value> \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value>

The resource-role-crn parameter requires the CRN of the resource role
     you want to assign to the user. You can use the cdp iam list-resource-roles
     command to list resource roles with role CRNs.
The resource-crn parameter requires the CRN of the resource on which
     you want to grant the resource role permissions. You can obtain it from the details of the
     resource.

To get a list of the resource roles assigned to a user or a machine user:
cdp iam list-user-assigned-resource-role \
--user-name <value>
cdp iam list-machine-user-assigned-resource-role \
--machine-user-name <value>
