Assign an environment resource role to a group
To assign an environment to a group, assign a specific resource role on the scope of the
  specific environment.
Required roles: 
Owner or a role that allows administering the environment AND 
One of the following: IamViewer or IamUser (required for listing
     users).
In order to assign a role, a user must have all rights from the role that they are planning
   to assign to another user; That is, a user can only assign a role higher than his own.

Sign in to the CDP console.
From the CDP home page, click Management Console.

     it.
From the Actions menu select Manage Access.
In the Access tab, enter the name of the group in the text box.

To assign a resource role to a group:
cdp iam assign-group-resource-role \
--group-name <value> \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value> 
To remove a resource role from a group:
cdp iam unassign-group-resource-role \
--group-name <value> \
--resource-role-crn <value> \
--resource-crn <value>

The resource-role-crn parameter requires the CRN of the resource role
    you want to assign to the group.
The resource-crn parameter requires the CRN of the resource on which you
    want to grant the resource role permissions.

To get a list of the resource roles assigned to a group:
cdp iam list-group-assigned-resource-role \
--group-name <value>
