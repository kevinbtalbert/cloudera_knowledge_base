Assigning resource roles to groups
When you assign a resource role to a group, the resource role is also assigned to all user and machine user accounts in the group.

To grant a group access to a resource (such as an environment, a shared
          resource, or a Data Hub cluster), assign a resource role to the group on the scope of the
          resource and the resource role is also assigned to all user and machine user accounts in
          the group.In general, resource roles can be assigned from CDP web interface using the
          Manage Access option available from the resource details page, or from CDP CLI
        using the cdp iam assign-group-resource-role command. Next, you need to
        perform user sync. For detailed instructions, see the following sections:
