Assigning resource roles to users
To grant a user or a machine user access to a resource (such as an environment, a
    shared resource, or a Data Hub cluster), assign a resource role to the user on the scope of that
    resource or, in some cases (Data Hub clusters), on the scope of the parent resource. 
In general, resource roles can be assigned from CDP user interface using the Manage
        Access option available from the resource details page or from CDP CLI using the
        cdp iam assign-user-resource-role or cdp iam
          assign-machine-user-resource-role commands. For detailed instructions,
      see the following sections:
