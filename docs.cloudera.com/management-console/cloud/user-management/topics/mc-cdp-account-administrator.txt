CDP account administrator
During the initial setup of the CDP subscription for a customer, Cloudera designates
   a user account as a CDP account administrator.
 A CDP account administrator has administrator
   privileges in CDP. The CDP account administrator user account cannot be managed within CDP. You
   must contact Cloudera support to add or remove an account administrator from your CDP
   account.
As an account administrator, you have all the privileges in CDP and can perform any
   task in CDP. You can set up users and assign roles, services, and environments to users in CDP
   according to the tasks that they need to perform. You can set up another user as a CDP
   administrator by assigning the PowerUser role to the user. However, you cannot set up another
   user as a CDP account administrator.
A CDP account administrator requires a Cloudera user account. To be designated as a
   CDP account administrator, you must register for a Cloudera user account. To register for a
   Cloudera user account, go to the Cloudera Account Registration page and create an account.
