CDP user
To perform tasks using CDP and its services, you must be a CDP user and roles and resources need to be assigned to this user.
CDP allows users within your organization to log in to CDP through the authentication
   system in your organization without registering with Cloudera or creating a Cloudera account.
   During the initial process of configuring the environment, the account administrator must set up
   identity federation and thus automatically add users.
When a CDP user who is not an account administrator logs in to CDP for the first time, the user
   has limited privileges. A CDP administrator must assign the appropriate roles to the user after
   the initial user login.
The CDP account administrator can delete the user accounts. Deleting a user removes all access
   keys and SSH keys associated with the user, and unassigns all roles and resource roles assigned
   to the user. The user is also removed from all groups that they belong to. 
A user who has a valid account in CDP but is not assigned any role can perform a
   limited number of tasks. A user who logs in to the CDP console without an assigned role or
   environment can perform only the following tasks:
