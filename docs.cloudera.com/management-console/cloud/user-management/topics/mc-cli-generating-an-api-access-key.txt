Generating an API access keyCloudera Docs
Generating an API access key
A CDP user account (a user or a machine user) must have API access credentials to
    access CDP services through the CDP CLI or API.
Required roles: Users who have the IAMUser role can generate an API access key
      from their own account page. As a CDP administrator or PowerUser, you can generate an
      API access key for all user accounts.
Generate your own access key
Steps


Sign in to the CDP console.

Click on your user name in the bottom left corner and then select Profile. 
On the user profile page that appears, click Generate Access Key. 

          From the CDP home page, click Management
            Console.
        

          On the side navigation panel, click Users.
        

          On the Users page, click the name of the user or machine
            user account for which you want to generate an access key.
        

          On the user account page, go to the Access Keys section
            and click Generate Access Key.
        

CDP creates the key and displays the information on the screen. 
          Copy the access key and private key to a text file and send it to the CDP user
            who requires it. The private key is a very long string of characters. Make sure that you
            copy the full string. You can optionally download the credentials file containing the
            access key information.
        

Click OK to exit the access key window.
note
The CDP console displays the API access key immediately after you create it. You
                must copy or download the access key ID and private key information when it is
                displayed. Do not exit the console without copying the private key. After you exit
                the console, there is no other way to view or copy the private key.



Once you've generated the access key, you can configure CDP CLI, SDK, or other utilities
        that require it.
