Configuring your enterprise IdP to work with CDP as a service provider
CDP provides a service provider SAML metadata file that describes the information that CDP requires to enable users to log in to CDP through your enterprise IdP.
You can get the CDP SAML metadata XML from the Identity Providers page in CDP web
      interface by navigating to the details of your identity provider configuration. 
The CDP SAML metadata file includes the following information:



              Information
            

              Attribute
            

              Description
            


Name ID formats that CDP supports 
NameIDFormat 
The metadata includes multiple name ID formats. Use one of the formats in the
              list for the user ID.CDP supports any type of name ID format other than transient.
                Cloudera requires that you use name ID formats that are globally unique within your
                identity provider. The name ID format should also be stable over time. Cloudera does
                not recommend using email addresses because, although they can be unique, they are
                typically not stable over time.If your NameID is an opaque ID (such as a
                UUID), you can Generate workload usernames based on
                email.The value of NameID is case-sensitive.


CDP SSO URL 
Location 
It should be the same as the "Location" value of the
              "<AssertionConsumerService>" in the CDP SAML Service Provider metadata. It has a
              fixed format.For CDP Control Plane region
