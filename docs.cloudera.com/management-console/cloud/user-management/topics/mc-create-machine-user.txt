Creating a machine user in CDP
You can create a machine user for programmatic access to CDP
Before you begin
Machine user names cannot start with a double underscore ("__").
Required role: PowerUser
Steps
CDP UICDP CLI

Navigate to the Management Console > User Management > Users.
From the Actions menu, select Create Machine User. 
Provide a name and click on Create. 


Use the following command:

cdp iam create-machine-user  \
--machine-user-name MACHINE_USER_NAME 

Next, generate an API access key for your machine user by using the following command:
cdp iam create-machine-user-access-key \
    --machine-user-name MACHINE_USER_NAME

What to do next
You need to perform user sync for the change to take effect. See Performing user sync. 
To generate an API access key for your machine user, see Generating an API access key.
You should grant the newly created machine user access to resources. To do this, follow
          the steps for Assigning resources to users. noteWhen searching
            for the machine user in the "Select group or user" text box, make sure to enter machine
            user name, not workload user name.
