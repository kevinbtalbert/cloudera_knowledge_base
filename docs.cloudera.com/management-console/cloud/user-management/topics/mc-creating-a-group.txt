Creating a group
Create CDP groups based on the tasks performed by CDP users in your organization.
Before you begin
Consider the following when selecting a name for your group:

The group name must be unique. Note that there are certain group names that are
                reserved and therefore cannot be used in CDP. See Reserved group names.
The group name can be up to 64 characters and can include only alphanumeric
                characters, dots (.), hyphens (-), and underscores (_). The first character in the
                name must be an alphabetic character or underscore.
The group name is not case sensitive. For example, the group name AAa is
                equivalent to the group name aaa.
Depending on your IdP setup in CDP, you may be able to manipulate the Sync
                  Membership option. To learn more about this option, refer to Synchronizing group membership.
