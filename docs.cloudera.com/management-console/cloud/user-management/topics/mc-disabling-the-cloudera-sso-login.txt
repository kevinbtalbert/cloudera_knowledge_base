Disabling the Cloudera SSO login
After you complete the identity federation setup between Cloudera and your enterprise IdP, you can disable the Cloudera SSO login option if you do not want to allow users in your organization to log in to CDP through the Cloudera registration and login page.
When you disable Cloudera SSO login for non-administrator users, CDP users must log in to
      CDP through the identity management system in your organization. Only the designated account
      administrator for your CDP subscription can log in to CDP through the Cloudera registration
      and login page. 
Even after you disable the Cloudera SSO login, the designated account administrator can log
      in to CDP using their Cloudera SSO credentials. For added security, you can restrict all
      Cloudera SSO access (including the designated account administrator's access) by contacting
      Cloudera Support and they can disable or enable the "Cloudera SSO All Login Enabled" setting
      for your account. You can see "Cloudera SSO All Login Enabled" setting on the UI. When all
      Cloudera SSO logins are restricted, you will see this on the UI:



Required role: Account administrator or
PowerUser
