Group membership administration roles
The IamGroupAdmin role can be assigned to a user or a group on the scope of a
  group to allow them to manage membership of that group.
Note that:

The IamGroupAdmin role grants a user or a group the permission to add users
    to or remove users from a group. The role does not grant permission to manage roles and
    resources for the group.
In order for a user with the IamGroupAdmin to add or remove users from a
    group, the user must also have the IamUser or IamViewer role that allows listing
    IAM users and groups within the organization.
