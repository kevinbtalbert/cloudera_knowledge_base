Importing or uploading users
You can bulk import users so as to assign policies to users and groups without requiring the users to log in at least once. 
Before you begin

Make sure the identity provider user ID matches with the NameId attribute value that is
        passed for the user in the SAML response using the associated SAML provider.
Cloudera
        has default limits in place with regard to how many users, machine users, and groups can be
        added per account. Review User and group limits and make sure that you do not
        exceed these limits.
