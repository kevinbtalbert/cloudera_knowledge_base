CDP machine user
A machine user account provides programmatic access to CDP. Create a machine user
   account if you have an application that needs to access the CDP services with the CLI or the CDP
   SDK for Java.
You can define the machine user account in your application to create and manage clusters and
   run jobs in CDP using the CLI or API commands.
You can create and manage a machine user account within CDP. You must assign an API access key
   to a machine user account to enable it to access the CDP service with the CDP CLI or CDP SDK. You
   must assign roles to a machine user account to authorize it to perform tasks in CDP. 
A machine user account does not have an associated Cloudera user account. You cannot
   use a machine user to log in to the CDP console.
Use the following guidelines when you manage user accounts in CDP:

When you create a machine user account, you assign roles and environments to the
    machine user account in the same way that you assign roles and environments to other user
    accounts. 
You can revoke permissions for a CDP machine user account by removing the machine
    user from groups or unassigning account level or resource roles. 
Deleting a machine user removes all access keys and SSH keys associated with the
    machine user, and unassigns all roles and resource roles assigned to the machine user. The
    machine user is also removed from all groups that they belong to.
