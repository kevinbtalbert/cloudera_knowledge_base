Reserved group names
There are certain group names that are reserved and therefore cannot be used in CDP.
  This applies to groups synchronized from your identity provider as well as groups created directly
  from CDP. 
If you attempt to synchronize or register a group with a reserved name, you will get an error
   including the following
   message:Invalid group name 
Name cannot be a reserved group name
To avoid problems, review the following list and avoid synchronising or creating groups with
   the following names.
