Resource roles
A role that is associated with a specific resource is called a resource role. This type
  of role gives permission to perform tasks on a specific resource, such as a specific CDP
  environment, shared resource, or Data Hub cluster.

When you assign a resource role, you must specify the resource on which to grant the
        resource role permissions. For example, you can assign a user a resource role that grants
        permission on an environment. The user assigned the resource role can list, access, and
        perform tasks only on that environment, but not on other environments.A
          resource role determines a specific set of tasks that the user can perform on the
          resources. For example, the EnvironmentUser resource role assigned to a user allows
          the user the rights contained in the resource role only on that particular
          environment.The predefined resource roles available in CDP that you can
          assign to CDP users, machine users, and groups are as follows:
Environment resource roles
Shared resource resource roles
Data Hub resource roles
Classic cluster resource roles
The Owner resource role (available on all resources)
Each role is identified by a CRN, which uses the following format:
crn:altus:iam:<CONTROL_PLANE_REGION>:altus:resourceRole:<RESOURCE_ROLE_NAME>
For example, the following is the DataHubAdmin role CRN:
crn:altus:iam:us-west-1:altus:resourceRole:DataHubAdmin
You can view all available roles and their CRNs by using the cdp iam
     list-resource-roles command.

Environment resource roles

Environment resource roles can be assigned on the scope of a specific
      environment.These resource roles can be assigned from the Management Console >
      Environments > navigate to a specific environment > Actions > Manage Access >
      Access or from CDP CLI using the cdp iam assign-user-resource-role
     command.

EnvironmentAdmin
Grants all rights to the environment and Data Hub clusters running in it, except the
                ability to delete the environment. 
The user who created the environment automatically gets the EnvironmentAdmin
                role on the scope of that environment.The EnvironmentAdmin resource role
                  is assigned the Limited Cluster Administrator role in Cloudera Manager. Users with
                  this role can manage the cluster lifecycle, change configurations, and manage
                  parcels. For more information on CM roles, see the topic Default User Roles.The Cloudera Manager Limited Cluster Administrator role is assigned to the
                    EnvironmentAdmin because the CDP Control Plane is responsible for certain
                  tasks historically done in Cloudera Manager, for example: adding or removing hosts
                  as part of up/down-scaling and repair operations, executing upgrades of clusters
                  in coordination with upgrading the OS images used by clusters, and creating new
                  clusters based on templates preconfigured to work in a CDP environment. In
                  addition, only selected services and workload types are currently supported in
                  Data Hub, represented by the built-in cluster definitions. Finally, certain CDP
                  services like encryption-at-rest infrastructure are explicitly not designed for
                  use in the public cloud, where the cloud provider's object store encryption
                  capabilities should be used. Because of this, Data Hub is prescriptive in its
                  choice of workload types and the CDP Control Plane is best suited to manage most
                  cluster life cycle operations. Doing so directly in Cloudera Manager could lead to
                  unexpected operational issues. Data Hub does, however, support fully customizable
                  cluster templates.EnvironmentAdmin can manage access to the
                environment by assigning a user EnvironmentAdmin, DataSteward,
                or EnvironmentUser role. 


EnvironmentUser
Grants permission to view Data Hub clusters and set the workload password for the
        environment. The EnvironmentUser resource role is assigned the Read-Only
         role in Cloudera Manager. For more information on CM roles, see the topic Default User Roles. 
This role should be used in conjunction with service-specific roles such as
                  DataHubAdmin, DWAdmin, DWUser, MLAdmin, MLUser,
                and so on. When assigning one of these service-specific roles to users, make sure to
                also assign the EnvironmentUser role. 


DataSteward
Grants permission to perform user/group management functions in Ranger and Atlas
                Admin, manage ID Broker mappings, and start user sync for the environment.
DataSteward can manage access to the environment by assigning a user
                  DataSteward or EnvironmentUser role. 


DataHubCreator
Grants permission to create Data Hub clusters in the environment.



DEAdmin
Grants permission to create, delete and administer Data Engineering services
        for the environment.
When assigning this role, you should also assign the EnvironmentUser
        role.


DEUser
Grants permission to list and use Data Engineering services for the
        environment.
When assigning this role, you should also assign the EnvironmentUser
        role.


DFAdmin
Grants permission to enable, disable and administer the CDP environment for
        DataFlow. This includes granting and revoking the ability to access the DataFlow Kubernetes
        API server.
When assigning this role, you should also assign the EnvironmentUser
        role.


DFFlowAdmin
Grants permission to create, terminate, administer and monitor running
        deployments for the environment.
When assigning this role, you should also assign the EnvironmentUser
        role.


DFFlowUser
Grants permission to view and monitor deployments for the
        environment.
When assigning this role, you should also assign the EnvironmentUser
        role.


DWAdmin
Grants permission to activate/terminate or launch/stop/update services in
        Database Catalogs and Virtual Warehouses.
When assigning this role, you should also assign the EnvironmentUser
        role.


DWUser
Grants permission to view and use Cloudera Data Warehouse clusters within
        the environment.
When assigning this role, you should also assign the EnvironmentUser
        role.


MLAdmin
Grants permission to create and delete Cloudera Machine Learning workspaces
        within the environment. MLAdmins will also have Site Administrator access to all the
        workspaces provisioned within this environment. They can run workloads, monitor, and manage
        all user activity on these workspaces.
When assigning this role, you should also assign the EnvironmentUser
        role.



MLBusinessUser

Grants permission to view Cloudera Machine Learning workspaces for the
        environment. MLBusinessUsers are granted view-only access to applications that have
        been shared with them through projects inside a workspace.
When assigning this role, you should also assign the EnvironmentUser
        role.


MLUser
Grants permission to view Cloudera Machine Learning workspaces provisioned
        within the environment. MLUsers are also able to run workloads on all the workspaces
        provisioned within this environment.
When assigning this role, you should also assign the EnvironmentUser role.MLUsers currently require the SharedResourceUser role on the cloud
         credential used for the environment.


ODAdmin
Grants permission to create, drop and administer the Cloudera Operational
        Databases for the environment.
When assigning this role, also assign the DataSteward or
         EnvironmentAdmin role.


ODUser
Grants permission to list and use Cloudera Operational Databases for the
        environment.



Owner
Grants all permissions required to manage the environment in CDP including the ability
                to delete it. 
The user who created the environment automatically gets the Owner role on the
                scope of that environment.The Owner role on the scope of an environment
                  allows you to delete that environment, but to access the environment's clusters
                  (Data Lakes, Data Hubs), you need EnvironmentAdmin or
                    EnvironmentUser. 



Shared resource resource roles
Shared resources resource roles can be assigned on the scope of a specific shared resource
        such as a credential, cluster template, image catalog, proxy, or recipe. This does not
        include default shared resources (such as default cluster templates), which can be seen by
        everyone who is able to access the account.

These resource roles can be assigned from the Management Console > Environments
      > Shared Resources > select a shared resource > navigate to a specific shared resource
      > Manage Access, or from CDP CLI using the cdp iam
      assign-user-resource-role command. 
You can view all available resource roles and their CRNs by using the cdp iam
      list-resource-roles command.

SharedResourceUser
This role enables shared resource sharing with other users. It grants
                  permission to access and use the specific shared resource such as a specific
                  cluster template, credential, image catalog, proxy, or recipe.

In order for a user to be able to use a provisioning credential for creating
          an environment, that user needs to be Owner or SharedResourceUser for that
          credential.



Owner
Grants all permissions required to manage the shared resource in CDP including the
                ability to delete it. 
The user who created the shared resource automatically gets the
                  Owner role on the scope of that shared resource.In order for a user to
                  be able to use a provisioning credential for creating an environment, that user
                  needs to be Owner or SharedResourceUser for that
                credential.



Data Hub resource roles

Data Hub resource roles can be assigned on the scope of a specific Data hub
            cluster.noteWhile full access to manage a Data Hub via the Management Console can
            be granted via assigning the Owner role on the scope of the Data Hub, access to
            the underlying cluster can only be granted by assigning the EnvironmentAdmin or
              EnvironmentUser role on the scope of the environment where the Data Hub is
            running. These resource roles can be assigned from the Management
              Console > Data Hub clusters > click on a cluster > Actions > Manage Access,
            or from CDP CLI using the cdp iam assign-user-resource-role
            command. You can view all available roles and their CRNs by using the cdp
            iam list-resource-roles command.

Important considerations



DataHubAdmin (Technical Preview)
Grants administrative rights over the Data Hub cluster, such as start,
         stop, scale, repair and grant or revoke access. 
When assigning this role, you should also assign the EnvironmentUser role.Granting DataHubAdmin role does not grant Cloudera Manager admin rights
          or Runtime service admin rights (for example NiFi Registry Admin).


Owner
Grants all permissions required to manage the Data Hub in CDP including the ability
                to delete it. 
The user who created the Data Hub automatically gets the Owner role
                on the scope of that Data Hub.The Owner role does not grant any
                  cluster-level permissions such as the ability to access or manage a cluster via
                  Cloudera Manager. In order to access Data Hubs running within an environment, you
                  need EnvironmentAdmin or EnvironmentUser on the scope of that
                  environment. 



Classic cluster resource rolesClassic cluster resource roles can be assigned on the scope of a specific classic cluster.These resource roles can be assigned from the Management Console > Classic clusters > context menu > Manage Access, or from CDP CLI using the cdp iam assign-user-resource-role command. You can view all available roles and their CRNs by using the cdp iam list-resource-roles command. Table 4. Classic cluster resource rolesResource roleDescriptionImportant considerationsClassicClusterAdminGrants permission to perform any operation on the cluster, except deleting it. Grants permission to assign access to the cluster to other users. ClassicClusterUserGrants permission to access details of the cluster.OwnerGrants all permissions required to manage the classic cluster in CDP including the ability to delete it. The user who created the classic cluster automatically gets the Owner role on the scope of that classic cluster.The Owner role does not grant any cluster-level permissions such as the ability to access or manage a cluster via Cloudera Manager.
The Owner resource role
In addition to the aforementioned resource roles, CDP includes the Owner
    resource role.
The Owner role:

Grants full permissions on a specific resource in the Management Console,
          including the ability to delete the resource. It does not grant any cluster-level
          permissions such as the ability to access or manage a cluster via Cloudera Manager.
Is assigned automatically on a resource to the user who created the resource. For
     example, if a user creates an environment called “test”, the user is assigned the Owner role
     for that environment. 
Allows a user to grant a set of rights (including the Owner role) on the
     resource to other users and groups. This is possible only if the user also has the
      IamUser or IamViewer role allowing to list users within the organization. 
Can be assigned at the scope of the following resources: an environment, Data
          Lake, shared resource (cluster template, recipe, image catalog, credential, proxy), Data
          Hub cluster, or classic cluster 
Can be assigned using the same steps as other resource roles.
