Understanding CDP user accounts
User accounts identify the users who can access services, applications, and
   components in the Cloudera Data Platform.
 Roles assigned to a user account determine the actions
   that the user can perform in CDP.
There are four types of user accounts in CDP:

CDP account administrator 
CDP user 
CDP workload user
CDP machine user 


CDP account administratorDuring the initial setup of the CDP subscription for a customer, Cloudera designates    a user account as a CDP account administrator.CDP userTo perform tasks using CDP and its services, you must be a CDP user and roles and resources need to be assigned to this user.CDP workload userYou need the workload username to access Data Hub clusters and non-SSO interfaces, and   to SSH to clusters. CDP machine userA machine user account provides programmatic access to CDP. Create a machine user    account if you have an application that needs to access the CDP services with the CLI or the CDP    SDK for Java.
