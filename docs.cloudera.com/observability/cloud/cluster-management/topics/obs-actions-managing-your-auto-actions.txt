Managing your auto actions
Describes how to update, delete, duplicate, and disable an auto action
    event.
The following Auto Actions management tasks are performed in the
        Management page, which is accessed by selecting the Auto
        Actions tab in the
        Cluster Summary page and then selecting the
        Management
      tab.
Updating your auto action
In the Management page, click the action’s
        vertical
        ellipsis, as shown in the following image, and select
          Edit. Make your changes and then click
          Update. 



Deleting an auto action 
In the Management page, click the action's vertical ellipsis, and
        select Delete. In the confirmation message, click
          OK to confirm. The action is permanently removed. noteUnless the action is no longer required, Cloudera
          recommends disabling the action, as you may require the action at another time.
        

Duplicating an auto action 
In the Management page, click the action's vertical ellipsis, and
        select Clone. Replace the existing name with a new unique name for
        the cloned auto action, make any other changes, and then click
        Create. A new auto action is created and is displayed on the
          Management page.
noteYou must change the name of the cloned auto action before a new
        one can be created. 

Disabling an auto action 
In the Management page, click the action's vertical ellipsis, and
        select Disable. In the confirmation message, click
          OK to confirm. The action is no longer active and the
          Disabled state is displayed in the action’s
          Status column on the Management page.
