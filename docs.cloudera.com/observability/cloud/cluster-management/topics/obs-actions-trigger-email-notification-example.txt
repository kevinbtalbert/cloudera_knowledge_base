Auto action email notification examples
Examples of a Cloudera Observability Auto Actions alert notification email.
The following sample email notifications are sent when the
      listed application meets the action's criteria and the trigger conditions, which are also
      included in the email notification. The sample email notifications are split into three sections:

In the Application Details section, the Application ID contains
            a link to the workload application, job, or query.
In the Auto Action Definition section, the Trigger and the
              Criteria definition display both the value and file size type
            that you defined and in brackets the Actual value, in megabytes,  captured by the
            engine. 
In the Auto Action Results section, the results of the invoked auto action is
            displayed.
