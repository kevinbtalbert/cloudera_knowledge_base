Events and management details of auto actions
Describes the fields in the Auto Actions Events and Management pages of Cloudera Observability.
The Events and Management pages help you monitor, manage, and troubleshoot your Auto
   Actions.
Events
The Events page displays information about your auto action audit
          events:


It contains the following audit entry fields:
Status, which displays the results of the auto action event as an
      icon. Where, green indicates that the action was successful (SUCCEEDED). All the other icons
      indicate that the action was unsuccessful (FAILED). 
Type, which displays the auto action's audit event category type,
      such as Create or Update. 
Details, which displays the type of action. When clicked the auto
      actionâ€™s Event Details audit log opens, as shown in the following
       Invoke and Update event type example images:

Auto Action Name, which displays the unique name you entered for the
      auto action. 
Scope, which displays the workload component service that is
      monitored by the action. 
Time, which displays the time stamp of when the auto action's audit
      event occurred.
importantBy default, the Cloudera Observability UI
     limits the number of displayed audit events to 500 and sorts them in ascending order (newest
     time stamp first). To display older audit events, from the time-range list on the Auto Actions
     Events page, change the date range duration and/or the time range duration.
