Working with alerts, costs, and reports
Certain Cloudera Observability features enable you to define cost centers for planning,
  budgeting, and justifying resources, create alert actions that monitor your workloads and trigger
  a corrective action when applicable, and enable reports that send you daily statistics about your
  environment.
Analyzing your environment costs with Cloudera ObservabilityThe Cloudera Observability Financial Governance Chargeback feature collects CPU,     memory, and resource usage data from your environment, allocates those charges to your custom     cost centers, and visually displays the results. It provides an in-depth visibility into the     workload resource costs of your environmentâ€™s infrastructure that can be used for planning,     budgeting, and     forecasting.Triggering action alerts across jobs and queriesYou can trigger action alerts, that are defined by you, across your workload     applications, jobs, and queries whilst they are running with the Cloudera Observability Auto     Actions feature. When a workload application, job, or query matches the action's defined     threshold value, the auto action event is triggered. For example, you may have a scenario where     too much memory is being allocated to specific jobs and you would like to take an action before     a problem occurs, such as avoiding memory exhaustion. In this case, you can create an auto     action that triggers a notification alert when a job is identified as having an over-allocation     of memory. You can then either manually take steps to alleviate the problem or include the       Kill action option that stops the job in question. Working with cluster reportsWhen enabled, Cloudera Observability mails you daily statistics about your cluster, such     as your cluster's performance.
