Working with cluster reports
When enabled, Cloudera Observability mails you daily statistics about your cluster, such
    as your cluster's performance.
You can use this information to keep track of the number of queries and jobs that are running
      on your cluster, identify users that are running large numbers of queries, and be alerted to
      spikes in the number of failed jobs or queries. This saves you from logging in to your cluster
      and analyzing these numbers yourself. 
Cloudera Observability sends the Cluster Report daily at 1:00 AM PDT with the previous day's
      statistics. It is split into a Data Warehouse section and a Data Engineering section, where: 

The Data Warehouse section shows the total number of queries and the number of failed
        queries for the day, as well as how those statistics compare to the same day of the previous
        week. It also lists the users that ran the most queries and the number of queries they ran
        in the 24 hour period.
The Data Engineering section shows the total number of jobs, the number of failed jobs,
        and how those numbers compare to the same day of the previous week.

noteCluster reports are available for Classic Cluster, Private Cloud
      Base, Data Hub, Virtual Warehouse, and Virtual Cluster Cloudera Observability environments
      only and cannot be managed for other users.

Enabling and disabling cluster reportsThe steps that enable you to receive daily reports that help you track and identify         changes that could be or become potential problems with your jobs and queries. When enabled         reports that compare your jobs and queries with historical data collected from the previous         week are sent to the email address that you use to log into Cloudera Observability.
