Managing user access to workloads
Describes how to create and manage Cloudera Observability resource access
  roles.
You can assign user roles in Cloudera Observability that restrict access to your workload
   clusters, jobs, and queries. These roles provide varying levels of access that prevent users from
   accessing information that they do not explicitly require.
When a user is assigned to a cluster with one of the Cloudera Observability access roles, the
   cluster will appear on the Environment navigation page. All other workload clusters are not
   visible to the user.
noteOnly Account administrator users can assign Cloudera Observability
   resource access roles.
