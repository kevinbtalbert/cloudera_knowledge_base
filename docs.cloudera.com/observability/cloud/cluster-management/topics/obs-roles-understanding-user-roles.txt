    create cost centers, view, edit, and create auto actions, and view, edit, and create workloads
    in all the Workload clusters. These users have the least restrictive access
    permissions.

Cluster 
DisabledFor a Workload user to be able to view the cluster that contains their
         assigned workloads they must also be assigned the Limited Environment access type. Cloudera
         recommends assigning the Limited Environment access type to Workload Users because this
         enables the user to access and view the environment that contains their
        workloads.

    Workload users.
