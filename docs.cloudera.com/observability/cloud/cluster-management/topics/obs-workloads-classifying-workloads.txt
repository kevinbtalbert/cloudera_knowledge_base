Classifying workloads for analysis with Workload Views
The Workload View feature enables you to analyze workloads with much finer
        granularity. For example, you can analyze how queries that access a particular database or
        that use a specific resource pool are performing against your SLAs. Or you can examine how
        all the queries that are sent by a specific user are performing on your cluster.

noteWorkload Views are available for Classic Cluster, Private
                Cloud Base, Data Hub, Virtual Cluster, and Virtual Warehouse Cloudera Observability
                environments only.
