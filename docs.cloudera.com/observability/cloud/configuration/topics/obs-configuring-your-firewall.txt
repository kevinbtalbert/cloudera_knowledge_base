Firewall configuration for Cloudera Observability
Connecting Telemetry Publisher to Cloudera Observability through endpoint services
    creates a secure connection between your CDP Data Hub cluster and the Cloudera Observability
    cloud service. 
The Cloudera Telemetry Publisher service collects metrics from various components in a CDP
      Data Hub cluster and securely sends these metrics by way of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
      Secure (HTTPS) protocol and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption over the internet to
        Cloudera Observability. 
Enabling secure communication from a CDP Data Hub cluster to the Cloudera Observability
      service that runs on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, requires that Telemetry
      Publisher connects to Cloudera Observability through the following endpoint services: 
Depending on your cloud region, pair an Endpoint #1 (EC2 service) with an Endpoint #2 (S3
      service) as follows: 
For a Us-west-2 cloud region, pair Endpoint #1 (EC2 service):
          https://dbusapi.us-west-1.sigma.altus.cloudera.com with
          Endpoint #2 (S3
          service):https://cloudera-dbus-prod.s3.amazonaws.com
For a EU-central-1 cloud region, pair Endpoint #1 (EC2 service):
          https://dbusapi.eu-1.cdp.cloudera.com with Endpoint #2 (S3
          service):https://mow-prod-eu-central-1-sigmadbus-dbus.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
For a AP-southeast-2 cloud region pair Endpoint #1 (EC2 service):
          https://dbusapi.ap-1.cdp.cloudera.comwith Endpoint #2 (S3
          service):https://mow-prod-ap-southeast-2-sigmadbus-dbus.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com

Where, these endpoints map to a dynamic IP address in AWS. For more information on the IP
      address ranges, see the Amazon documentation. 
You can also configure a HTTP proxy between Telemetry Publisher and Cloudera Observability.
      In this configuration, the proxy acts as a HTTP tunnel for the encrypted TLS communication
      between Telemetry Publisher and Cloudera Observability.
