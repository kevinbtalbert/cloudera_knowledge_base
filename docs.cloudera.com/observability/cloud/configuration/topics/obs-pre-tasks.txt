Describes how to generate Telemetry
      Publisher access credentials, how to enable endpoint services between Telemetry Publisher and
        Cloudera Observability, and how to enable or disable data redaction, which provide secure
      data transfers and conceal your sensitive data. For added security, optional configuration
      steps are also included for enabling an intermediary gateway using a proxy server.

Before configuring Telemetry Publisher and enabling
      its service on your cluster you must complete the Telemetry Publisher pre-requisite tasks.

Firewall configuration for Cloudera ObservabilityConnecting Telemetry Publisher to Cloudera Observability through endpoint services     creates a secure connection between your CDP Data Hub cluster and the Cloudera Observability     cloud service. Redacting dataTelemetry Publisher collects diagnostic data from logs, job configurations, and SQL   queries, and then sends this data to Cloudera Observability. As this diagnostic information may   contain sensitive information it is important to mask this data before Telemetry Publisher sends   it to Cloudera Observability.Adding a proxy serverSteps for configuring a proxy server, which adds extra security by enabling an         intermediary gateway for sending your workload data to Cloudera Observability. Generating Telemetry Publisher access credentialsSteps for generating access credentials that enable communication between your         Workload clusters and Cloudera Observability.Parent topic: Configuration tasks for CDP Private Cloud
