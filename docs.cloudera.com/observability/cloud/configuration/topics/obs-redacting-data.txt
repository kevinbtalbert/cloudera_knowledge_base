Redacting data
Telemetry Publisher collects diagnostic data from logs, job configurations, and SQL
  queries, and then sends this data to Cloudera Observability. As this diagnostic information may
  contain sensitive information it is important to mask this data before Telemetry Publisher sends
  it to Cloudera Observability.
Data redaction works separately from Cloudera data encryption techniques. Data encryption alone
   does not preclude administrators with full access to the cluster from viewing sensitive user
   data. Redaction ensures that cluster administrators, data analysts, and others cannot see
   personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data that is not within their job
   domain. At the same time, it does not prevent users with appropriate permissions from accessing
   data to which they have privileges.
In the event that redaction was disabled, such as during testing, Cloudera recommends that
   before you configure Telemetry Publisher you verify that redaction has not been disabled.

Redacting log and query dataBy default, redaction for log and SQL query data is enabled for Telemetry Publisher. Redacting Spark dataBy default, redaction is enabled in the YARN service for Spark SQL data.Redacting MapReduce dataTelemetry Publisher reads the job configuration file from HDFS. You can enable data         redaction for your MapReduce jobs pulled from HDFS by Telemetry Publisher by adding your         MapReduce job configuration properties in the Cloudera Manager YARN configuration         settings.Disabling redaction for testingSteps for disabling the Log and Query redaction property in Telemetry Publisher for         testing tasks.Parent topic: Pre-tasks
