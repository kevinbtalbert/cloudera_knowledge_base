Redacting Spark data
By default, redaction is enabled in the YARN service for Spark SQL data.
The YARN service redacts Apache Spark SQL sensitive data from event and executor logs. importantTo ensure that Telemetry Publisher only sends
        redacted data to Cloudera Observability do not change the
          spark.redaction.regex
        configuration
        property.
