Configuring Telemetry Publisher
Tasks for enabling Cloudera Telemetry Publisher, which collects and sends diagnostic
  information about job and query processes to Cloudera Observability.
Cloudera Telemetry Publisher is a role in the Cloudera Manager Management Service that collects
   and sends your workload information to Cloudera Observability. For example, when new clusters are
   added with Cloudera Manager, Telemetry Publisher automatically sends the new cluster information
   to Cloudera Observability. noteCloudera recommends that you assign a
    dedicated disk for the Telemetry Publisher Service role on your Workload cluster. This prevents
    any issues when sending data to Cloudera Observability from affecting operations other than
    those performed by Telemetry Publisher.Depending on the number and size of the jobs run on
     the cluster, the minimum supported disk drive size is 500GB. This size includes enough disk
     space for Telemetry Publisher to store data locally when it is unable to send data to Cloudera Observability due to connectivity or other issues.
