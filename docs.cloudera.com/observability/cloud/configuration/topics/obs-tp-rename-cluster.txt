Renaming the Workload cluster
Describes how to rename the Workload cluster with a human-readable name in Cloudera
        Manager.

Cloudera Observability identifies the cluster from a random string of 32 characters,
                such as 44a6e75e-8630-4773-9ea9-6272478e84c2, which is difficult to
                identify and manage. Cloudera recommends completing the following task to rename
                your Workload cluster before you add and start the Telemetry Publisher role
                instance.


In a supported web browser on a Workload cluster, log in to Cloudera
                    Manager.

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters, and then select
                    the Workload cluster that requires a human-readable name.

From the Actions menu, select Rename
                        Cluster.

In the Name field of the Rename
                        Cluster dialog box, enter a new name that is easily identifiable
                    by you. 

Click Rename Cluster.

Add and start a role instance of the Telemetry Publisher
            service on the Cloudera Manager Server node.
