Release Notes





Cloudera Observability is an observability tool that continuously discovers and
collects performance telemetry across applications and infrastructure
components running in CDP environments. It creates a granular single
source of truth for collecting and maintaining metrics, logs,
dependencies, and traces.
Cloudera Observability performs real-time correlations that indicate existing and
potential problems and includes prescriptive guidance and
recommendations to address them.
Cloudera Observability has three key focus areas:


Observability -
The single source of truth for all information regarding services and
microservices running on the CDP platform


Monitoring -
Alerts and notifications for monitoring specific services and
microservices (user enabled)


Insights & Recommendations -
Contextual analysis, Health checks, and prescriptive recommendations for
issue remediation
