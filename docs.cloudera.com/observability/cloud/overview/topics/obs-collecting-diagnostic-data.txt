Collecting Cloudera Observability diagnostic metrics for Private Cloud
When you enable the Telemetry Publisher service for Cloudera Observability, the Cloudera
  Management Service starts the Telemetry Publisher role. Cloudera Telemetry Publisher collects and
  transmits metrics, as well as configuration and log files, from Impala, Oozie, Hive, YARN, and
  Spark services for jobs running on your clusters to Cloudera Observability. Telemetry Publisher
  collects metrics for all the clusters that use Cloudera Observability-enabled environments. 
Understanding the sources of information sent to Cloudera Observability and how that data is
   redacted is described in the following topics.
