Collecting Cloudera Observability diagnostic metrics for Public Cloud
When you enable Workload Analytics for Cloudera Observability,
  the Cloudera Management Service starts the Telemetry Publisher and the Databus WXM Client role.
  Telemetry Publisher and Databus WXM Client collect and transmit metrics, as well as configuration
  and log files, to Cloudera Observability from Impala, Oozie, Hive, YARN, and Spark services for
  jobs running on your clusters. Telemetry Publisher and Databus WXM Client collect metrics for all
  the clusters that use Cloudera Observability-enabled environments.
