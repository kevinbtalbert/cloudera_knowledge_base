Cloudera Observability Hive cluster metrics
Lists the Hive cluster health check tests that are performed by Cloudera Observability
    at the end of a Hive job. The list includes the severity conditions and thresholds, and what
    actions you should consider to resolve the problem.

Hive on Tez JVM Pause Rate Analyzer

This health test checks the time taken to free up memory by the Java garbage
                collector.
Where, a high value for the JVM pause rate indicates that the Java garbage
                collection took longer than the threshold to complete its work. 
It uses the hive_on_tez_jvm_pause_time_rate metric to check the
                Hive on Tez JVM pause rate.



A Good result implies that there were no pauses greater
                  than 300ms and no occurrences of more than five pauses between 100ms and
                  300ms.
A Concerning result implies that there were occurrences
                  of more than five pauses between 100ms and 300ms.
A Bad result implies that there was at least one pause
                  that was greater than 300ms.



To address this condition, consider increasing the allocated heap size for the
                HiveServer2 instance. 



Hive Metastore JVM Pause Rate Analyzer

This health test checks the time taken to free up memory by the Java garbage
                collector. 
Where, a high value for the JVM pause rate indicates that the Java garbage
                collection took longer than the threshold to complete its work. 
It uses the hive_jvm_pause_time_rate metric to check the Hive
                Metastore JVM pause rate.



A Good result implies that there were no pauses greater
                  than 300ms and no occurrences of more than five pauses between 100ms and
                  300ms.
A Concerning result implies that there were occurrences
                  of more than five pauses between 100ms and 300ms.
A Bad result implies that there was at least one pause
                  that was greater than 300ms.


To address this condition consider increasing the allocated heap size for the
              Hive Metastore.


Hive on Tez Waiting Compile Ops Analyzer

This health test counts the number of Hive On Tez operations waiting to compile. 
Where, if the number of operations waiting to compile is greater than 0, then the
                HiveServer2 instance is likely overloaded.
It uses the hive_on_tez_waiting_compile_ops metric to count the
                number of Hive On Tez operations waiting to compile.



A Good result implies that there were zero operations
                  waiting to compile.
A Bad result implies that the number of operations
                  waiting to compile is consistently greater than zero.



If the number of operations waiting to compile is consistently greater than zero,
                then to address this condition, consider restarting the HiveServer2 instance.



HiveServer2 Memory Usage Analyzer

This health test calculates the percentage of Hive On Tez heap memory utilization
                for the input period.
Where, if the percentage of heap memory utilization is above the threshold, there
                is a possibility of running out of heap space.
It uses the hive_on_tez_memory_heap_used  and the 
                  hive_on_tez_memory_heap_max metrics to calculate the percentage of  heap
                memory utilization for the input period.



A Good result implies that the maximum heap utilization
                  is less than 80% of the available heap.
A Concerning result implies that the maximum heap
                  utilization is between 80% and 95% of the available heap.
A Bad result implies that the maximum heap utilization
                  exceeded 95% of the available heap.



To address this condition, consider increasing the allocated heap size for the
                HiveServer2 instance.



Hive Metastore Memory Usage Analyzer

This health test calculates the percentage of Hive Metastore heap memory
                utilization for the input period.
Where, if the percentage of heap memory utilization is above the threshold, there
                is a possibility of running out of heap space.
It uses the hive_memory_heap_used and the
                  hive_memory_heap_max metrics to calculate the percentage of heap
                memory utilization for the input period.



A Good result implies that the maximum heap utilization
                  is less than 80% of the available heap.
A Concerning result implies that the maximum heap
                  utilization is between 80% and 95% of the available heap.
A Bad result implies that the maximum heap utilization
                  exceeded 95% of the available heap.



To address this condition, consider increasing the allocated heap size for the Hive
                Metastore.
