Cloudera Operational Database REST API access
You can use the Apache HBase REST server to interact with Cloudera Operational Database
        (COD). Interactions happen using URLs and the REST API. REST uses HTTP to perform various
        actions, and this makes it easy to interface with COD using a wide range of programming
        languages. 

Click Databases, and then select a database from the
                    list.

Click Connect > HBase REST.

From the HBase REST Server URL field, copy the URL to the HBase REST Server to
                    connect to the selected database.







Use the HBase REST API to interact with the HBase services, tables, and regions using
                HTTP endpoints. You can create tables, delete tables, and perform other operations
                that have the REST endpoints. For more information, see Using the HBase REST
                    API using the link in the related information section.
