Cloudera Operational Database .Net interface support
You can use the C# client library to develop applications that can access data stored
        in the Cloudera Operational Database (COD).
Microsoft .Net Framework is supported through multiple interfaces including
            ODBC, Thrift Server, and the Phoenix Query Server.
You can use the Apache Phoenix ODBC driver to connect your .Net applications to Apache
            Phoenix. The .Net applications that you develop interface with the Phoenix Query Server
            using the Avatica API and Google Protocol Buffers serialization format.
