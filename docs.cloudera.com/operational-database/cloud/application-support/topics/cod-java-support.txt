Java 2 platform and Enterprise Edition support
You can use the Apache HBase Java API for applications to communicate with Apache
        HBase. Cloudera Operational Database (COD) supports the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) along
        with the plugins for Eclipse.
You can perform operations on Apache HBase tables by using the Java client API. You can
            develop Java applications that can be used to create tables and insert data. The native
            Java client API offers programmatic access. For more information, see Use the Java
                API using the link in the related information section.
