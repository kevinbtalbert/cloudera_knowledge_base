Cloudera Operational Database JDBC support
You can use the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) interface to access the operational
        database. Apache Phoenix in Cloudera Operational Database (COD) provides a JDBC SQL endpoint to
        interact with data stored in COD.
You can create and interact with Apache HBase tables using  DDL/DML statements
            through its standard JDBC API. Apache Phoenix JDBC driver can be easily embedded in any
            application that supports JDBC. The JDBC interface is provided in COD.
For more information about using the JDBC driver URL syntax and usage, see the
                Client connectivity information for compiling your application for COD
            and Using JDBC API with Apache Phoenix using the links provided in the
            related information section.
