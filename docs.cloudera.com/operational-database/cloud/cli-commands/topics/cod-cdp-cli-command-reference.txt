                use the same entry points and will therefore conflict. Either use a separate virtual
                environment or uninstall the cdpcli first before installing cdpcli-beta. 
Install Python if needed, as described in CDP CLI documentation for your
                            platform.noteDo not install CDP CLI. Instead, proceed to step 2.

                        Beta:pip3 install cdpcli-beta
