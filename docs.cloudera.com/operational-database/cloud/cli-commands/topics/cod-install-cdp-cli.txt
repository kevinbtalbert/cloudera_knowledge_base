Install CDP CLI beta
If you would like to apply custom user tags on Operational Database through CDP CLI,
        you need to download and install  CDP CLI beta version 0.9.40.
Do not install both the regular and beta CLIs in the same
            Python environment, as they use the same entry points and will therefore conflict.
            Either use a separate virtual environment or uninstall the cdpcli first before
            installing cdpcli-beta. 

Install Python if needed, as described in CDP CLI documentation for your
                    platform. 
Do not install CDP CLI. Instead, proceed to step 2. 

Run the following to install CDP CLI beta:

pip3 install cdpcli-beta
