Azure account requirements for COD deployment
When Cloudera Operational Database (COD) is deployed, it uses resources from your
        Microsoft Azure subscription that are registered for an environment in the CDP Management
        Console. 
You must first read the CDP Management Console documentation to understand the basic
            Azure requirements before you can deploy a COD.
If you are using the HBase Java API and Phoenix Thick JDBC driver, you must configure an
            edge node to access data in your operational database instance. This configuration step
            is necessary to ensure that you can query data that is stored in your COD. See the
            related information section for more information.
