CDP environments
In CDP, an environment is a logical subset of your virtual private network, which is
        hosted on a public cloud provider. You can register as many environments as you
        require.

Registering an environment with Management Console provides the CDP
                    platform with access to your public cloud account. When you register an
                    environment, resources are identified in your public cloud account that CDP
                    services can access or provision.If you are a CDP
                    administrator, you must learn about how to set up your environment. For more
                    information, see Getting started as an
