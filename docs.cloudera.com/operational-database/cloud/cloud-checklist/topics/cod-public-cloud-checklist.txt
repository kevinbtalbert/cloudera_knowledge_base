Public cloud environment checklist for COD
You must plan your cloud account requirements and resources before you create a
        Cloudera Operational Database (COD). COD is deployed on the public cloud, and you must
        understand the public cloud account requirements before you deploy your COD
        instance.


Currently, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft
                    Azure are the supported public cloud environments. Before registering your AWS,
                    Azure, or GCP environment in CDP, you must verify that your account has all the
                    resources required by CDP.
You must register your AWS, Azure, or GCP environment in CDP before you create a
                    COD. You must also ensure that you read and understand the AWS or Azure account
                    requirements so that your public cloud account has all the resources required by
                    CDP and that your CDP administrator has adequate permissions to configure the
                    resources and services in AWS, Azure, or GCP.note

You must enable an appropriate entitlement to use COD on GCP.
For AWS environments, Cloudera recommends you to use the EBS volumes
                                as gp2 for better performance.


You must also configure your public cloud environment to ensure that you have
                    assigned the correct policies and roles. See the related information for AWS,
                    Azure, and GCP quickstarts that will help you set up your public cloud
                    environment for use with COD.
