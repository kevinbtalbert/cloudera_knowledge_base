Client connectivity information for compiling your application for CODCloudera Docs
Client connectivity information for compiling your application for COD
When compiling your application for your Cloudera Operational Database (COD) you need
    information about the connectivity options that helps your applications interact with COD. You
    can get that information either using the CLI or the COD user interface.
The following is a graphical representation of the necessary steps to compile an application
      against COD.



From the Connect tab in the Databases user
      interface, you can get information about the available client connectivity configuration
      options in COD:
HBase: Apache HBase Maven URL, Apache HBase client version, and
          the Apache HBase client configuration URL used to download a file containing the Apache
          HBase client configuration
HBase REST: Apache HBase REST Server version and Apache HBase
          REST Server URL
HBase Client Tarball: Apache HBase version, download URL of the
          client tarball, and the Apache HBase client configuration URL used to download a file
          containing the Apache HBase client configuration
Phoenix (Thick): Phoenix thick JDBC driver URL and version number
          of the client artifacts
Phoenix (Thin): Phoenix thin JDBC driver URL and version number
          of the client artifacts
Phoenix (ODBC): Phoenix ODBC driver URL. You  need to
          authenticate again to access this driver

You can also download the YARN and Kerberos configuration from these tabs where
      applicable.
Maven repository containing the HBase client artifacts
Maven repository containing HBase client artifacts is provided in the
          HBase tab. You can get the following information from this tab:

HBase Maven URL: Use this URL to access the Maven repository
          containing HBase client artifacts
HBase Client Version: You can view the version of HBase client
          artifacts in the Maven repository
HBase Client Configuration URL: You can get the endpoint which
          provides a ZIP file with HBase client configuration files

You cannot download the tarball using a web browser, you must instead use a tool like
          curl in the CLI to download the tarball. For example,
        curl -O -u <username> "<download url>.tar.gz



Kerberos configuration information is provided in the HBase tab.
        Only authenticated clients can access a database in COD. You need the following Kerberos
        information that you can use to connect your application to COD:
Kerberos Realm: You need the Kerberos realm information for
            connecting your clients requiring Kerberos authentication
KDC Host: You need the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
            hostname for your clients requiring Kerberos authentication
Krb5.conf: You can download a sample krb5.conf file for your
            clients requiring Kerberos authentication

The /etc/krb5.conf file is the configuration a client uses to access a
        realm through its configured KDC. The krb5.conf maps the realm to the available servers
        supporting those realms. It also defines the host-specific configuration rules for how
        tickets are requested and granted. The krb5.conf file is used to determine the default
        Kerberos realm and KDC. Add the contents into the /etc/krb5.conf file on your edge node. For
        more infromation,  see Configure Kerberos.




HBase REST
You can use the Apache HBase REST server to interact with Cloudera Operational Database
        (COD). You can get the following information from this tab:
HBase REST Server Version: You can see the version of HBase
            REST server
HBase REST Server URL: You can get the URL to the HBase REST
            Server to connect to your COD





HBase Client Tarball
You can download the HBase client tarball that contains the JAR files used to connect to
        your database. The HBase client tarball contains the necessary scripts and JAR files that
        you need to connect your database when using interactive tools such as HBase Shell or
        SQLLine.
Click Connect > HBase Client Tarball tab, and then use the Download URL to download the
        tarball.
You cannot download the tarball using a web browser, you must instead use a tool like
          curl in the CLI to download the tarball. For example,
          curl -O -u <username> "<download url>.tar.gz"


Kerberos configuration information is provided in the HBase Client Tarball
         tab. Only authenticated clients can access a database in COD. You need the
        following Kerberos information that you can use to connect your application to COD:
Kerberos Realm: You need the Kerberos realm information for
            connecting your clients requiring Kerberos authentication
KDC Host: You need the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
            hostname for your clients requiring Kerberos authentication
Krb5.conf: You can download a sample krb5.conf file for your
            clients requiring Kerberos authentication

YARN configuration information is provided in the HBase Client
          Tarball tab. You need this additional configuration information to submit YARN
        applications that access data stored in COD.
You must create the ssl-client.xml  in the downloaded and unzipped YARN
        Archive if it is not present in the archive folder. You need this file to run YARN workloads
        against COD. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>ssl.client.truststore.type</name>
    <value>jks</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>ssl.client.truststore.location</name>
    <value>[[/path/to/truststore.jks]]</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>ssl.client.truststore.password</name>
    <value>[[password]]</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>ssl.client.truststore.reload.interval</name>
    <value>10000</value>
  </property>
</configuration> 

YARN Archive: You can use this URL to download a ZIP archive that
          contains the necessary YARN client configuration files
TLS Truststore: You can use this command to download a Java
          KeyStore file that contains the certificate authority necessary to submit YARN jobs
TLS Truststore Password: You can use this command to download the
          password for the TLS truststore





Phoenix JDBC thick and thin drivers
Apache Phoenix has two kinds of JDBC drivers, thick and thin. The thick driver communicates
        directly with Apache ZooKeeper and Apache HBase, and the thin driver does this through the
        Phoenix Query Server. You can connect your application to the COD instance using the
        provided connection and configuration URLs.
You can get the URL for the thick and thin JDBC driver using:
CDP command-line interface: Use the cdp opdb
              describe-client-connectivity --database-name [***YOUR DATABASE***]
              --environment-name [***YOUR ENVIRONMENT***] command
COD web user interface: Click Databases > your database > Connect tab, and then select the Phoenix (Thick) or
              Phoenix (Thin) client









Phoenix ODBC driver 
ODBC is one of the most established and widely supported API for connecting to and working
        with databases. Use the Database Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) interface to access the
        operational database. The ODBC driver is provided by Cloudera as an additional download, but
        you can also use ODBC drivers from third-party providers. You can download the ODBC driver
        for your operating system using the links in the Phoenix (ODBC)
        tab.
You can get the following information:
Phoenix ODBC driver download URL: A URL where Phoenix ODBC
            driver is available. You may need to authenticate again to access this driver
Phoenix ODBC URL: The basis of a ODBC URL for the Phoenix thin
            driver to connect to this database
