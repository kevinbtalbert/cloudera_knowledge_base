Ephemeral Storage on Azure and AWS
COD now supports 1.6 TB NVMe (Non-volatile Memory Express) based cache that
  significantly improves the performance when you deploy COD with object storage.
Storage on S3 or ABFS can be slow, causing HBase to be slow as well. Large blockcache can solve
   this by keeping your most frequently accessed data on the fast local NVMe disks. Once the
   entitlement is enabled for your tenant, the newly created COD cluster will be automatically
   configured for this feature. It also enables the auto-scale functionality based on the available
   cache space. For more information, see Auto-scaling in public cloud environments. No
   additional configuration is needed. 
 NVMe-based cache is now enabled on Azure too. It uses a high performance AMD instance type
   with a 2 TB NVMe disk for the worker nodes.
