COD integration with RAZ
CDP Public Cloud defaults to using cloud storage, which introduces new challenges around
  managing data access across teams and individual users. The Ranger Authorization Service (RAZ)
  addresses these challenges, enabling users to have the equivalent fine-grained and audit
  capabilities in Apache Ranger they used with HDFS files in an on-prem or IaaS
  deployment.
The Ranger Authorization Service (RAZ) is a fine grained authorization service for cloud
   storage. As a regular individual user or as an HBase user, you can limit the authorization levels
   in the cloud storage to a directory level. COD supports RAZ integration from the Runtime version
   7.2.11.0. You can grant fine-grained access to directories. COD integration with RAZ is supported
   for AWS and Azure. noteCOD integration with RAZ is not supported for GCP.
