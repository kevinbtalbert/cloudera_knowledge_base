Advantages of Multi-AZ deployments
Understand the single and multiple AWS availability zones that Cloudera Operational Database
  (COD) supports along with the advantages of deploying Multi-AZ.
COD in a single AWS availability zone
Without multiple availability zone based deployments, CDP Control Plane deploys COD and Data
    Hubs into a single subnet, meaning that each of them has VMs spread across a single availability
    zone (as on AWS every subnet is related to a single availability zone).

COD in a multiple AWS availability zone
If you choose to deploy your COD Environment and Data Hubs across multiple subnets and
    availability zones (multi-AZ), each of these components could be spread across two or more
    availability zones, providing high availability, resilience, and fault tolerance.

Descriptions



High availability
Supports high availability for your application with automatic database failover. It
         ensures that you do not lose any data and zero manual intervention.


Resilience
Ensures that the data on your standby database instance is up-to-date with the
         primary.


Fault tolerance
Enhances availability by deploying a standby instance in a second AZ, and achieve
         fault tolerance in the event of an AZ or database instance failure.
