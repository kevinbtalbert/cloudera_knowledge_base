Restrictions in Multi-AZ deployment on COD
Know the restrictions while deploying multiple availability zones on your CDP
  Operational Database (COD) environment.
The following are the current restrictions:


Cloudera Manager currently does not support High Availability, therefore if the AZ
     containing the gateway node is down, the Cloudera Manager services are unavailable.
COD auto-scaling does not work during an AZ outage. When an AZ outage occurs, the Data Hub
     identifies that multiple nodes are down and goes into an unhealthy state. COD cannot initiate
     auto-scaling during an unhealthy state.
If the node containing the YARN Resource Manager (RM) is down during an AZ outage, the
     MapReduce jobs related to the YARN services might be impacted, because the RM is not
     distributed.
While performing Multi-AZ failover testing, you might encounter longer failover times
     because of the Ranger RAZ services, which applies authorization logic in front of cloud storage
     systems. When this failover does not happen promptly, HBase is unable to perform any operations
     that require communication with the cloud storage system. Cloudera continues to evaluate this
     issue in later releases.
