How to enable Multi-AZ deployment on COD
The entitlements that you need to access the Multi-AZ on COD and also how you can
    disable Multi-AZ on your COD environment.
To use this feature, you must first contact Cloudera Support or your Cloudera account team to
   enable the CDP_CB_AWS_NATIVE entitlement in CDP Public Cloud.
Once the entitlement is enabled, COD supports multiple availability while creating databases,
   by default.
To disable multiple availability on COD, you can provide the
        --disable-multi-az option while creating a new COD database using
      cdpcli-beta.
For example, cdp opdb create-database --environment
    myEnvironment
--database
myDatabase
--disable-multi-az
If you provide this option for a CDP environment on Azure or GCP, the call fails because this
      feature is only applicable to AWS.
