Restrictions in Store File Tracking
Know the current restrictions and caveats while using the Store File
   Tracking feature.
The following are the current restrictions and caveats.

There is no automated opt-in to this feature for already existing databases. Deploy a new
    database using the above directions.
Previously existing COD databases which are upgraded to Cloudera Runtime 7.2.14 does not use
    the Store File Tracking feature. These databases continue to use HBOSS to safely
    interact with S3.
Restoring HBase snapshots (clone_snapshot and
     restore_snapshot) are observed as unstable at the 1TB scale. You can contact
    Cloudera for assistance on this topic.
