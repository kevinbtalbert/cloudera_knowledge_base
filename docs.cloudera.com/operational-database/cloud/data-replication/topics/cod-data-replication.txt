Cloudera Operational Database data replication 
Cloudera Operational Database (COD) enables you to replicate your data by making a copy of
        the data stored in your COD instance and store them in other locations to help you in
        disaster recovery scenarios. 
Cloudera provides a replication plugin that allows you to securely enable data
            replication for Apache HBase data in Data Hub and Cloudera Operational Database (COD)
            experience. The replication plugin simplifies SSL authenticated data replication between
            Apache HBase clusters in the cloud.
COD supports the following data replication scenarios:

CDH or HDP to COD using the replication plugin
CDP Private Cloud Base to COD using Replication Manager 
COD to COD using Replication Manager
External services like EMR that has Apache HBase using the replication plugin

These         clusters can be Data Hub clusters or Cloudera Operational Database (COD) experience         clusters. Configuring replication with Apache HBase in EMRYou can configure your Cloudera Operational Database (COD) experience for data         replication with an Amazon EMR cluster with Apache HBase. Using the CldrCopyTable utility to copy dataYou can use the CldrCopyTable utility to copy data from one Cloudera Operational         Database (COD) cluster to another. You can use it to bring data in sync for         replication.Using HashTable and SyncTable tools to copy data between COD clustersYou can use the HashTable and SyncTable tools to copy data from one CDP Operational         Database (COD) cluster to another. You can use these tools to synchronize data prior to         replication.
