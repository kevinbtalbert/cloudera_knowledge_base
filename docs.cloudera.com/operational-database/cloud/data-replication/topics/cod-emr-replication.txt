Configuring replication with Apache HBase in EMR
You can configure your Cloudera Operational Database (COD) experience for data
        replication with an Amazon EMR cluster with Apache HBase. 



Ensure that you have the replication plugin. Contact your Cloudera account
                        team to get the replication plugin.
Ensure that all the EC2 instances in the EMR cluster can communicate with
                        COD. For example, you can configure this by placing the EMR cluster on the
                        same VPC netwoek and subnets used by the COD instance. 
Ensure that your COD cluster security group allows inbound TCP connections
                        to ports 16020, 16010, and 2181 from all the EC2 instances in the EMR
                        cluster. You can configure this using the AWS management console. The port
                        configuration is automatically done if the EMR EC2 instances are configured
                        with the same worker, leader, and controller (also known as master) security
                        groups from COD.




Copy the replication plugin to /usr/lib/hbase/lib/ on all
                    EMR cluster RegionServer. (requires root access);

importantThis step requires you to have root access to the EMR
                        cluster.


Add the keystore generated on the destination COD cluster to HDFS using the
                    following command:

hdfs dfs -mkdir /hbase-replication

hdfs dfs -put /[***PATH***]/[***credentials.jceks***] /hbase-replication

hdfs dfs -chown -R hbase:hbase /hbase-replication


Edit the EMR /etc/hbase/conf.dist/hbase-site.xml file on
                    each RegionServer host to add the following values:

<property>
	  <name>[***hbase.security.replication.credential.provider.path***]</name>
	  <value>cdprepjceks://hdfs@[***NAMENODE_HOST***]:[***NAMENODE_PORT***]/hbase-replication/credentials.jceks</value>
	</property>
	<property>
	  <name>[***hbase.security.replication.user.name***]</name>
	  <value>srv_[***WORKLOAD USER NAME***]</value>
	</property>


Restart the EMR RegionServer by stopping the running processes. RegionServers
                    autostarts and now uses the additional JAR files in the classpath.

Use _ReplicationSetupTool_ to add the peer.
                        _ReplicationSetupTool_ is a command line tool that enables
                    you to create the replication peer and make necessary configuration to be peer
                    specific.


sudo -u hbase hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.replication.ReplicationSetupTool 
-clusterKey "zk-host-1,zk-host-2,zk-host-3:2181:/hbase" 
-endpointImpl "org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.regionserver.CldrHBaseInterClusterReplicationEndpoint" -peerId 1
