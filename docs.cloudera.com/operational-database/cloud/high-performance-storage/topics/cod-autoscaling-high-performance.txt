Auto-scaling
COD with cloud storage type uses high performance storage to store Write-Ahead Log
        (WALs), however COD with high performance storage type uses both WALs and HFiles. 
COD provides autoscaling for both the storage types. Your database automatically
            autoscales whenever the high performance storage reaches 60% of its buffer capacity to
            accommodate the growth in the data.
