Overview
Cloudera Operational Database (COD) supports both high performance storage and Amazon
        S3 or Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage through the abfs connector as a storage layer. While the
        default option is cloud storage, COD also provides you an option to choose high performance
        storage. 
You can use high performance storage either in an on-premises or a cloud environment to
            maintain low-latency and high-throughput for your application. If your applications are
            latency sensitive, Cloudera recommends that you use high performance storage for your
            COD databases. The average read and write latency for COD on a high performance storage
            is 500% better than the COD that uses S3 storage for all the workloads. noteCOD on GCP environment supports only high performance storage.
