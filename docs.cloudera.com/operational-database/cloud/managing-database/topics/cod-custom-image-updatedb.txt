Upgrading a database using a custom image
You can upgrade an existing database using a custom image. The database inherits the
        packages and software libraries of the custom image, and is upgraded to the provided
        database image.



You must download and install the latest CDP CLI beta version.
You must have a working CDP environment.
You must ensure that the custom image resides in your CDP environment.

                    image.
