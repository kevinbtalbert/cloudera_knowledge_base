Managing custom images in COD
You can customize a default image for compliance or security reasons. You can then use
  the CDP CLI to register a custom image catalog and set the custom image within the custom image
  catalog. Later, you can use this custom image to create an operational database.
To know more about the custom images, see Custom images and image catalogs.
