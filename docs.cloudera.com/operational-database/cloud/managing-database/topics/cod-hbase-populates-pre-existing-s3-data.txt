Ensure HBase populates pre-existing object storage data
Cloudera Operational Database (COD) databases store data in cloud storage. The location of
        the data is stored in cloud storage is defined by the data access cloud storage location in
        the CDP environment and the COD database name . 
When a COD database is dropped, any data stored in the cloud storage is not dropped. You
            must delete the data separately if you no longer need it. If a COD database is created
            against a cloud storage location which already contains COD data from a previous
            instance of COD, COD will automatically re-create the tables with the corresponding data
            in the new COD instance. Multiple COD databases must not refer to the same cloud storage
            location as this will cause data loss and data corruption.
 If a COD database is created using the same name against a cloud data access storage
            location, which already contains COD data from a previous instance of COD, COD will
            automatically re-create the tables with the corresponding data in the new COD instance.
