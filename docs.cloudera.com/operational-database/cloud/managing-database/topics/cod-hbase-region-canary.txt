Enabling HBase region canary
You can enable the HBase canary, which is an optional service, to monitor the health
        of the HBase RegionServer.

COD provides the CLI option --enable-region-canary to add the HBase
                canaries to monitor the RegionServer health. You can use this option while creating
                an operational database using COD CLI.
The HBase canaries are added under the HBase service in the Cloudera Manager. You can
                view them under Cloudera Manager >  HBase Service >  Configuration tab.

Ensure that you have created a CDP environment and is ready
            to use it.

Log in to the terminal that has the CDP CLI client installed.

Use the following command to enable the HBase region canaries.
cdp opdb create-database --environment-name
ENVIRONMENT_NAME
--database-name
DATABASE_NAME
--enable-region-canaryFor
                    example,cdp opdb create-database --environment-name cdp_7215 --database-name cod_1 --enable-region-canary
