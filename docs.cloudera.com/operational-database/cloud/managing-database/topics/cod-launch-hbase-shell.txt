Launching hbase shell
To launch the hbase shell and use it with Cloudera Operational Database
        (COD), you have to create an edge node with a configured HBase client tarball.

Configure an edge node. For more information, see COD edge node
                overview.


In your COD web interface navigate to Connect >  HBase Client Tarball.

Add your Hbase Client Tarball and HBase Client Configuration.







Download hbase-client-tarball.tar.gz and extract it to
                            a location on the edge node. This is your
                                    "HBASE_HOME".


Download the client configuration using the curl
                            command.


Extract the client configuration zip file, and move the contained
                                hbase-conf directory to
                                "HBASE_HOME" with the name conf
                            (instead of hbase-conf).



Launch the hbase shell.

$ kinit [***cdp_workload_user***]
Password: ********
$ export HBASE_HOME=hbase-2â€¦
$ cd $HBASE_HOME
$ ./bin/hbase shell



Validate you can connect through hbase shell.
Use the list command in hbase shell to list all
                    tables.

Add yarn configuration to hbase configuration.







Navigate to Connect >  HBase Client Tarball and expand the YARN Configuration section..


Download the yarn-config.zip file.


Add the files from yarn-conf to
                                    "HBASE_HOME"/conf.


Download the TLS truststore and remember where you
                            place it.


Update the ssl-client.xml file with the TLS TRuststore
                            details.


Ensure that in the ssl-client.xml file the
                                ssl.client.trustore.location points to the
                                cod-truststore.jks you have downloaded in step d.
                        


Ensure that the ssl.client.truststore.password matches
                            the TLS Truststore Password.



noteIf you plan to use the hbck2 command on COD client
                        side, set the HBASE_CLASSPATH environment variable pointing
                        to the HBase client tarball lib directory as follows:
                        export HBASE_CLASSPATH=/<HBase_client_tarball_location>/hbase-client-tarball/lib/:


You have an edge node with configured HBase client tarball and you can launch the
            hbase shell.
