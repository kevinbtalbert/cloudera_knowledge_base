Changing database status using COD
After you create an operational database, you can start, stop, or drop the database
        using the Cloudera Operational Database (COD) user interface.

Required role: You must be logged into the COD as an ODAdmin


In the COD web interface, select the Databases
                    tab.

Find the database you want to manage.

In the row of the selected database, click Actions and
                    select one of the following actions:


Start Database - Starting the database. When you create a new
                            database, it is initially started by default.
Stop Database - Stopping the database and the underlying
                            instances.
Drop Database - Dropping the database and deleting all the data
                            that is stored in that database. However, your SDX Data Lake continues
                            to exist and you can create another database using the same Data
                            Lake.
