Scaling COD instances vertically 
You can scale up a COD cluster vertically, which means upgrading a COD cluster from a
        LIGHT duty to a HEAVY duty instance type. You can only upgrade COD clusters belonging to the
        Gateway and Master nodes.

Selecting a larger instance type adds more vCPU and/or RAM to your instances. You can
                scale up instances from LIGHT to HEAVY using the CDP CLI command tool.




You must stop the COD cluster before you vertically scale any of the
                        instances.
You must grant CDP_CB_AWS_VERTICAL_SCALE entitlement for
                        the specific tenant.
You must stop EBS-backed instances before scaling. Vertical scaling is
                        supported on AWS only. See Change the instance type in AWS
                        documentation for more information.
You must ensure that the COD clusters belong only to Gateway nodes or Master
                        nodes.
You must download and install the latest CDP CLI beta version.




Log in to the CDP CLI command tool.

Run the following command.
cdp opdb update-database --environment
<environment_name>
--database
<database_name>
-â€“vertical-scale
<Group_type_for_the_database_nodes>The following are
                        the possible values for the group type for the database nodes:
GATEWAY: Value of the group variable as
                                    GATEWAY.
MASTER: Value of the group variable as
                                    MASTER.
For
                        example,cdp opdb update-database --environment-name cod-7216-micro10 --database-name odx2408 --vertical-scale MASTER


Start the cluster after you have vertically scaled it. You can also configure the
                services on the cluster to use the additional or reduced resources/memory.
