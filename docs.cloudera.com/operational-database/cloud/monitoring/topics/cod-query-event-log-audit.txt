Query COD event log and audit events
Cloudera Operational Database (COD) logs and audits important events such as the COD CRUD
  operations and database access. You can query these audit events for a specific time
  interval.
Audit events give you an understanding of the COD operations during your specified time
   interval.
To view the event logs for a specific time interval, run the following command in the CDP
   CLI:$ clients/cdpcli/cdp.sh audit list-events --from-timestamp yyyy-mm-ddT00:00:00Z --to-timestamp yyyy-mm-ddT00:00:00Z --event-source opdb

Note that you have to use the ISO-8601 standard timestamps format.
To view the command information and on-screen help, run the following command in the CDP
   CLI:$ clients/cdpcli/cdp.sh audit list-events
The audit query result displays event details such as event name, time stamp, accountID,
   requestID, and result code. Some events do not display a success or failure result codes; these
   are simple events that indicate that an action succeeded.
