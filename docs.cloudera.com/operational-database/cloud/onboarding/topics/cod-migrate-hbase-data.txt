Migrating HBase data to COD
If you have an existing HBase application running on a CDH or HDP environment, you
        can migrate your data to a COD CDP Public Cloud environment. You can launch a database with
        the durable and consistent storage technology you may already be familiar with while using
        CDH or HDP, but with none of the legacy complexity.

To migrate your HBase data into a COD CDP Public Cloud environment, see HBase
                    Migration through Replication Manager.
