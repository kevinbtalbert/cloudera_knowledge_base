Migrating Phoenix data to COD
Cloudera Operational Database Replication plugin enables HBase replication from a
        number of products which also include Phoenix to COD, such as CDH 5, CDH 6, HDP 2.6, and HDP
        3.1. You can replicate Phoenix tables to COD using the Replication plugin.

Currently, COD includes Apache Phoenix 5.1.1 while other products include a range of
                versions of Phoenix from 4.7.0 to 5.0.0.
