Onboarding COD users
To enable users to work on Cloudera Operational Database (COD) and various CDP
        components, like HBase and Phoenix, you can onboard them to COD.



You have created a CDP environment. See CDP environments.
You have a prior knowledge of HBase and Phoenix.




Set up a workload password in CDP to compile any application against COD. See
                        Setting the workload password.

Create an Operational Database on your CDP environment. See Creating a
                        database using COD.

Assign the appropriate roles to the COD users. See User management in
                        COD.

Configure and deploy an edge node to work with HBase and Phoenix thick clients.
                    See Configuring edge nodes.
