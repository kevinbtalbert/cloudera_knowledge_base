Cloudera Operational Database (COD) 1.15 version provides a new option for the
        upgrade-database command and supports DataHub/OpDB deployment across multiple availability
        zones.
The upgrade-database command supports a new option to upgrade only the operating
                system
COD provides a new option --os-upgrade-only for the
                    upgrade-database command, which you can use to upgrade only
                the operating system to the latest supported version addressing any CVEs that were
                patched in the operating system. Running the upgrade-database
                command with this option does not have an effect on the CDP runtime version running
                on the given cluster.

COD supports DataHub/OpDB deployment across multiple availability zones
                (Multi-AZ) to ensure high availability


COD introduces a technical preview version of Multi-AZ deployment capability
                        and is available by special request through your account team.
When you enable COD, by default it deploys all the databases across three
                        availability zones identified in the SDX by the provided network subnets.
                        COD CLI beta provides a new --disable-multi-az to limit
                        deployments to a single availability zone.



COD can disable ephemeral storage in CLI
COD provides the ability to disable the ephemeral storage using a new command
                    --disable-ephemeral-storage.

COD provides the ability to list all the HBase snapshots using different
                filters
COD supports listing all the HBase snapshots created within a database of an
                environment using these filters, time range, snapshot name, and command ID. For
                example, you can use the time range filter to obtain the snapshots created within a
                particular time, the command ID filter to know the status of a snapshot
                operation.
