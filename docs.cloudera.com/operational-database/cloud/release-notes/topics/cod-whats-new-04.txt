Cloudera Operational Database (COD) 1.14 version offers multiple new features that includes
    disengaging autoadmin database function, runtime upgrade, copy tables between COD environments
    and many more.
Disengage autoadmin database function
COD can disable the autonomous database functions thereby stops managing a database. When
        COD disables the autonomous functions, the database cannot leverage it; however the
        functions are available and accessible as a datahub cluster. Once you disable the autonomous
        database functions, it is irreversible. For more information, see
          disengage-auto-admin.

Cloudera Runtime upgrade with downtime
You can upgrade the Cloudera Runtime installed on the cluster running COD to an advanced
        one with downtime.

Copy tables between two COD environments
COD provides a CopyTable utility to copy tables from one COD cluster to another.

COD supports ephemeral storage on AWS
COD now supports ephemeral storage on AWS for HBase buckets.

COD provides HDFS as a storage option
COD now provides HDFS as a storage option for COD deployment instead of cloud storage.

COD uses instance storage for HBase bucket cache
COD now deploys clusters with large block cache on ephemeral storage thereby enhancing the
        performance of the clusters. This is available only for AWS-based clusters with S3 blob
        storage.
