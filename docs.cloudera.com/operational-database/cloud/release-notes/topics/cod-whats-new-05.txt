Cloudera Operational Database (COD) 1.16 version supports modified auto-scaling criteria and
    a built-in coprocessor AggregateImplementation.
COD supports modified auto-scaling criteria
COD now supports an improved auto-scaling algorithm that considers the latency of the user
        operations. COD now prioritises user operations over system operations that results in a
        reduced cost of infrastructure with a minor increase in replication.

COD supports a built-in coprocessor AggregateImplementation
COD now supports a built-in coprocessor called AggregateImplementation
        that facilitates aggregation function computations (min, max, sum,avg, median, std) at the
        region level. This yields better performance because you need not get all the data to
        perform these calculations. COD enables AggregateImplementation by
        default, and you can use the AggregationClient service in HBase to
        perform RegionServer side aggregation. For example, row count.
