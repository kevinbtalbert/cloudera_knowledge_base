Cloudera Operational Database (COD) 1.17 version is now available as a technical preview on
    GCP (Google Cloud Platform) and with various performance improvements.
COD is available as a Technical Preview feature on GCP
You can now deploy COD on GCP easily similar to what is available for Amazon Web Services
        (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

COD automatically improves the performance by 80% when you use AWS S3
COD now delivers a better performance in S3 because the data loading behaviour from S3 into
        cache is tuned. This improvement minimizes the cost associated with the S3â€™s high latency to
        read data.

COD improvises scalability when using block storage on AWS
COD now uses larger EBS volumes for the underlying master nodes to provide better
        scalability.
