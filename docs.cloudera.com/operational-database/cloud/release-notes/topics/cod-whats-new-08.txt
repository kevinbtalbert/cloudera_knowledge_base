    UI.
Cloudera supports Phoenix when using Hue web UI
Cloudera now supports Phoenix access through the Apache Hue SQL assistant. You can now access
        Phoenix and query the data from the Hue web UI out of the box and leverage Hueâ€™s rich SQL
        support (for example, type ahead) to query Phoenix for operational insights or developer
        testing of SQL statements.
