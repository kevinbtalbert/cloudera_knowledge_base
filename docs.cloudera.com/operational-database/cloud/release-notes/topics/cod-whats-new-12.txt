Cloudera Operational Database (COD) 1.21 version supports enabling the replications for META
  regions, by default.
COD now supports replications for META regions enabled by default
COD now supports replication for the META regions, which means clients can read the META
    replicas first before connecting to the primary region server. This reduces the load on the META
    table because the read META load is distributed across multiple replicas. 
COD supports configuring three META replicas which can be deployed in different RegionServers.
    Client needs to use the COD provided configuration to get the META calls that are distributed
    across these replicas. This is useful when an application has multiple clients accessing spark,
    yarn, or phoenix-spark.
