Cloudera Operational Database (COD) 1.23 version supports custom EBS volumes for HDFS
  clusters while creating a database and displays UI notifications on the COD UI.
COD supports custom EBS volumes for HDFS clusters
COD allows you to customize the attached storage worker node for an HDFS cluster using the
     --attached-storage-for-workers option while creating a database. You can
    define the EBS volumes for HDFS clusters.
You can also view the customized attached storage worker nodes using the
     describe-database and list-database commands. For more
    information, see create-database.

COD displays notifications on the COD UI for all the major events
COD now displays notifications about all the major events on the COD UI. For example,
    auto-scaling events, auto-healing events, and alerting notifications.
The UI notifications is a major step in providing enough information on COD UI so that you do
    not need to navigate to multiple internal systems used by COD to get the required information as
    well as be aware of the events happening in the system on an immediate basis.
