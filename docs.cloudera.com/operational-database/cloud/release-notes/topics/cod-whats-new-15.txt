Cloudera Operational Database (COD) 1.24 version supports fast SSD volume types, deploys
  strong meta servers for multiple regions, and provides two new CDL CLI commands.
COD supports fast SSD based volume types for gateway nodes of HEAVY types
Cloudera Manager and monitoring systems require more resources than a regular deployment for
    big clusters with a large number of nodes. To support this, now COD supports a fast gp2 storage
    when you choose a gateway node of HEAVY type.

COD deploys strong meta servers for multiple regions for Multi-AZ
For Multi-AZ deployments, COD assigns the nodes to multiple regions when multiple strong meta
    servers exist in the deployment.

COD provides CDP CLI commands to set the HBase configuration values
COD now supports the CDP CLI commands update-hbase-configuration and
     describe-hbase-configuration to update and retrieve the HBase configuration
    values. For more information, see describe-hbase-configuration and
     update-hbase-configuration.
