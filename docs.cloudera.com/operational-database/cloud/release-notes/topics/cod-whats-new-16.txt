Cloudera Operational Database (COD) 1.25 version supports creating and updating an
  operational database using a custom image.
COD supports custom images for deploying COD clusters
COD now allows you to create or update a database using a custom image. Custom images can be
    used for various purposes, such as compliance or security requirements. An image catalog is used
    to hold one or more custom images. You can inherit pre-installed packages or software from the
    custom image while creating or updating an operational database.
You can also switch an image catalog of an existing operational database. For more
    information, see Managing custom images in COD.
