Cloudera Operational Database (COD) 1.27 version supports JWT authentication, provides
  Data Lake templates while creating a database, and a CLI option to enable HBase region
  canaries.
COD supports configuring JWT authentication for your HBase clients
COD now allows you to configure JWT (JSON Web Token)-based authentication for your HBase
    clients, which uses an unique identifier and is a standard way of securely transmitting signed
    information between two parties. To know more about the JWT authentication, see
     Configuring JWT authentication for HBase client.

COD supports creating an operational database using a predefined Data Lake
    template
When you create an operational database, you can now define the structure of your database
    based on a predefined Data Lake template. The template defines the number of gateway, master,
    and worker nodes to be added while creating a database.
You can select a template and accordingly the nodes are added into the COD cluster after the
    database is successfully created.
To know more about this, see Creating a database using COD.

COD provides a CLI option to enable HBase region canaries
COD now provides a CLI option, --enable-region-canary to enable the HBase
    region canaries while creating an operational database.
Use the following command to enable the HBase region
     canaries.cdp opdb create-database --environment-name ENVIRONMENT_NAME --database-name DATABASE_NAME --enable-region-canary
hbase_region_health_canary_enabled
hbase_region_health_canary_slow_run_alert_enabled
hbase_canary_alert_unhealthy_region_percent_threshold
For more information, see Enabling HBase region canary.
