Cloudera Operational Database (COD) 1.28 version provides UI enhancements that include
  storage type selection when you create a database and JWT configurations to connect to your HBase
  client.
COD UI allows storage type selection when creating an operational database
COD UI now allows you to select the storage type when creating an operational database. You
    can either select Cloud Storage or HDFS.
Earlier if you had to use the HDFS as the storage type, you were required to use the
     --use-hdfs option on COD CLI while creating the operational database. Now COD
    UI is enhanced to let you select the storage type when you create an operational database.
For more information, see Creating a database using COD.

COD UI provides the JWT configuration details to connect to your HBase client
Now you can find the JWT configuration details On the COD UI. Click on a database and go to Connect >  HBase Client Tarball >  JWT Configuration. You can refer to these configurations to set up a connection to HBase with a JWT
    token and build your own truststore JKS file.
For more information, see Configuring JWT authentication for HBase client.
