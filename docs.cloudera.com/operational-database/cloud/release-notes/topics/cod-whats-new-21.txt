Cloudera Operational Database (COD) 1.31 version provides enhancements to the CDP CLI
  options.
COD provides enhancements to the --scale-type CDP CLI option
In CDP CLI, the --scale-type option now supports all the three options
     --scale-type (string) <MICRO, LIGHT, HEAVY>. COD has added the support for
    additional parameters, LIGHT and HEAVY.

--scale-type LIGHT (master-node-type LITE)
--scale-type HEAVY (master-node-type HEAVY)

Additionally, COD has removed the --master-node-type (string) <LITE,HEAVY>
    CDP CLI option because this option is not needed anymore. For more information, see CDP
     CLI Beta.
