Cloudera Operational Database (COD) 1.32 version provides enhancements to the CDP CLI as
  well as on COD UI.
COD provides UI enhancements to the Scale option on the database
    creation page
On the COD UI, when you create an operational database the Medium Duty
    is renamed to Heavy Duty under Create Database >  Scale. This ensures that the options on COD UI and CDP CLI Beta are symmetrical.
For more information, see Creating a database using COD.

COD provides enhancements to the CDP CLI option --scale-type <HEAVY>

In CDP CLI, when you select the --scale-type option as
    HEAVY, COD allocates larger SSD storage (for example, gp2 on AWS,
    StandardSSD_LRS on Azure, or pd-ssd on GCP) for both master and leader node types. This ensures
    the higher loads on Zookeeper and provides a better performance for COD.
For more information, see CDP CLI Beta.

COD supports enabling custom recipes using CDP CLI Beta
You can now define custom recipes while creating an operational database using the
     --recipes option in CDP CLI Beta. You can register pre-created recipes during
    database creation based on the instance groups in your database. The recipes are executed
    automatically for the specified nodes based on the recipesâ€™ type.
Use the following example command to define custom recipes for your operational database.
cdp opdb create-database --environment-name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> --database-name <DATABASE_NAME> --recipe names=<rec1,rec2>,instanceGroup=<MASTER> names=<rec2>,instanceGroup=WORKER names=<rec3,rec4>,instanceGroup=<GATEWAY>
To know more about the recipes, see Recipes.
To know more about the --recipes option, see CDP CLI
     Beta.
