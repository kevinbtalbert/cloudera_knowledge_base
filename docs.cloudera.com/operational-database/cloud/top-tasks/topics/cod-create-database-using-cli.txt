Creating a database using CDP CLI
You can create an operational database in your registered environment using Cloudera Operational Database (COD) CLI Beta.


You must download and install the latest CDP CLI beta version.
Understand CDP environment and user management. For more information, see
                        User Management and CDP Environments topics.
Set up an environment that gives you credential and cloud storage.
Ensure you are authorized to create a database.



Required role: You must be logged into the COD as an
                            ODAdmin.
You can create a COD database in an AWS, GCP, or Azure environment.


Log in to the CDP CLI beta tool.
 Enter the following command: 
cdp opdb create-database --environment-name cod7215 --database-name
                            test123
Pass the --use-hdfs flag to create a database for COD using
                        HDFS storage.
If you pass --no-use-hdfs flag or do not pass any flag, the
                        database for COD is created using cloud storage. For example, Amazon S3,
                        GCS, or ABFS.

Your new database is ready for use.
