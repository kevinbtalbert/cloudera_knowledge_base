Example: run an application for the Apache Phoenix thick client
Checking the example of how to run a maven application for the Phoenix thick client
        gives you better understanding about how to run your own application for the Phoenix thick
        client.

The requiredKerberos option is set to true for the
                Phoenix thick client. This means that the application must be run for this client
                from a computer which:
Has internal network access to the public cloud in which the database is
                        deployed
Can resolve the internal hostnames of the database
Can obtain a Kerberos ticket from the database's Kerberos Key Distribution
                        Center (KDC)

One way to run an Apache Phoenix thick client application is to launch an edge node
                in your cloud provider which meets the above requirements.


Use the JDBC URL from the describe-client-connectivity command
                    to run the example.

One method is to build on your local machine and copy the JAR files to the
                        remote
                        node:$ scp -r target ec2-user@my-ec2-bastion-host.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:
$ scp clientConfig.zip ec2-user@my-ec2-bastion-host.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:
$ ssh ec2-user@my-ec2-bastion-host.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com "sudo yum install -y java-1.8.0-openjdk"


Ensure that you have a Kerberos ticket and run your application for the Phoenix
                    thick client

 kinit username
$ java -cp target/sql-libs/*:target/sql-exemplar-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:hbase-conf com.cloudera.odx.sql.Client "[***PHOENIX THICK JDBC URL***]"



Run your application.
