Example: run an application using the Phoenix thin client
Checking the example of how to run a maven application for the Phoenix thin client
        gives you better understanding about how to run your own application for the Phoenix thin
        client.
The requiredKerberos options set to false for the
            Phoenix thin client which means that it can be used from virtually any node. In this
            example, the client runs from the local machine.
For the Apache Phoenix thin client the describe-client-connectivity call
            returns a base JDBC URL . You must append the following attributes to the URL which are
            specific to your identity:
avatica_user: your CDP username (required)
avatica_password: your CDP worload password (required)
truststore: a truststore for your CDP Knox gateway
                    (optional)
truststore_password: the password for the truststore file
                    (optional)

You can use Maven to ease launching this application, but a standalone Java program is
            similarly launched:
$ mvn exec:exec -Dexec.executable=java -Dexec.args='-cp target/sql-libs/*:target/sql-exemplar-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar com.cloudera.odx.sql.ThinClient "jdbc:phoenix:thin:url=[***PHOENIX THIN JDBC URL;serialization=PROTOBUF;authentication=BASIC;avatica_user=[***USERNAME***];avatica_password=[***PASSWORD***];truststore=[***CDP-TRUSTSTORE.JKS***];truststore_password=[***TRUSTSTORE PASSWORD***]"'
Or, you can launch the application without the help of
            Maven:$ java -cp target/sql-libs/*:target/sql-exemplar-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar com.cloudera.odx.sql.ThinClient "jdbc:ph
