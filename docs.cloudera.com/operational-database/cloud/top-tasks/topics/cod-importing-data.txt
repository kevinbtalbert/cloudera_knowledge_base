Importing and restoring data into COD database
You can import your data into your Cloudera Operational Database (COD) database by
        restoring your HBase table into COD.


Have a location in cloud storage (for example, S3 or ABFS) with an exported
                    snapshot in it, and have the name of the snapshot.If you do not already have
                        an exported HBase snapshot, you can export your data to cloud storage using
                        the following
                        command:hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.snapshot.ExportSnapshot -snapshot [***SNAPSHOT NAME***] -copy-to [***CLOUD STORAGE LOCATION***] -mappers 10
For
                        example, the data-from-onprem snapshot can be exported into
                            s3a://cod-external-bucket/hbase:hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.snapshot.ExportSnapshot -snapshot data-from-onprem -copy-to s3a://cod-external-bucket/hbase -mappers 10

Have and edge node with a configured HBase client tarball and know how to launch
                    the hbase shell from it. For more information, see Launching HBase
                        shell.



Get your CLOUD STORAGE LOCATION for your COD database
                    using the COD web interface.
s3a://my_cod_bucket/cod-12345/hbase






Add your bucket to the IAM policy used by IDBroker.

For more information, see one of the following documentation:

AWS Environments: Minimal
                                            setup for cloud storage


Azure Environment: Minimal
                                            setup for cloud storage




Launch the hbase shell from the edge node.
For more information, see Launching HBase shell.

From the edge node, run the ExportSnapshot command. Use the
                    external bucket as the source location and  the COD cloud storage as the target. 
For example:
                    $ cd $HBASE_HOME
$ ./bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.snapshot.ExportSnapshot -snapshot “data-from-onprem” --copy-from s3a://cod-external-bucket/hbase --copy-to s3a://my_cod_bucket/cod-12345/hbase


Use the list_snapshots command and verify that your snapshot
                    is listed.

$ cd $HBASE_HOME
$ ./bin/hbase shell
$ hbase> list_snapshots
[‘snapshot_name’]



Use the restore_snapshot or the
                        clone_snapshot command to reconstitute the table.

warningThe restore_snapshot command overwrites an
                        existing table.

restore_snapshot: Overwrites current table state with
                            that of the snapshot. It means that any data modification applied after
                            the snapshot was taken would be lost. If the table does not exist in the
                            given cluster, the command automatically creates it.
clone_snapshot: Accepts a new table name for the table
                            in which it restores the table schema and data.



Validate that all rows are present in the table using the hbase
                        rowcounter or count command in the hbase
                    shell.
