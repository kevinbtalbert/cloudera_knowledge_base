User management in COD
 You can assign roles to the users to ensure that they are given the required
        permissions when accessing and using Cloudera Operational Database (COD). To provide access to
        COD resources, you must add users and groups, and assign roles and resources to them using
        the CDP Management Console.
A CDP PowerUser must assign roles to users who require
            access to the operational databases that are associated with specific environments.
            After you grant these roles to users and groups, they acquire a Sign-On (SSO) access to
            the operational database that is associated with an environment. For more information
            about configuring user roles, see Managing user access and
            authorization.
The following CDP resource roles are associated with the COD service:


ODAdmin- This role enables users or groups to grant a CDP
                    user or a group the ability to create, start, stop, and drop a database. 


ODUser- This role enables users or groups to view and use
                    operational databases that are associated with specific environments.
