Deploying applications on Cloudera Operational Database 
The edge node is a dedicated Data Hub cluster that enables you to communicate with
        your Cloudera Operational Database (COD) instance and your applications. You can deploy a cluster
        that works as an edge node to access your COD instance. Deploy the edge node cluster in the
        same environment as the COD instance to ensure that the security groups and data ingress
        rules that apply to the COD instance must also apply to the edge node cluster.

From the Cloudera Management Console, click Data Hub
                        Clusters.

Click Create Data Hub.

In the Selected Environment with running Data Lake
                    drop-down list, select the same environment used by your COD instance.

Select the Cluster Definition.

In the Cluster Definition drop-down list, select
                        the [***RUNTIME VERSION***] COD Edge Node for
                            [***CLOUD PROVIDER NAME***].
For example, select the 7.2.10 COD Edge Node for AWS
                    cluster template.



In the Cluster Name field, provide a cluster name that
                    you can identify later as an edge node of a specific COD instance.

Click Provision Cluster.


After you deploy the edge node, you can run your applications on this edge node using
                the Client connectivity information.
                See how to compile applications for COD in Compile an application for your
                    database.


Configuring KerberosAll Cloudera Operational Databases (CODs) are secured with Kerberos-based authentication,         meaning that only authorized users can connect to your database. All HBase and Phoenix Thick         JDBC clients must have a proper Kerberos configuration on the host where they run a         client.Configuring JWT authentication for HBase clientJWT (JSON Web Token)-based authentication uses an unique identifier and is a standard         way of securely transmitting signed information between two parties. Learn how to configure         JWT-based authentication for your HBase client.
