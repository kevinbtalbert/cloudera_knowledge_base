COD edge node overview
 An edge node is a resource dedicated to access private computing resources on the
  public cloud. You must configure an edge node in your public cloud environment if you use the
  Apache HBase Java API or the Apache Phoenix thick JDBC client. 
Cloudera Operational Database (COD) cannot be accessed directly by clients and resources
   on the public internet. The subnet security group and ingress rules of your public cloud
   providers prevent you from accessing your database from a public network.
If you have enabled a public endpoint access gateway while creating your environment,
   you can access your COD instance from outside the public cloud through Apache Knox. But, if you
   use a private subnet in your environment, you must configure a VPN for your client applications
   to access your COD instance using Apache Knox or use an edge node. 
Clients that use HTTP interfaces such as the HBase REST server, Thrift client and
   server, Phoenix Query Server, SQL over HTTP using Apache Phoenix thin JDBC driver, ODBC driver,
   Go driver, and Python phoenixdb library, need not use the edge node and can be
   proxied through the Apache Knox gateway.
However, you must create an edge node to use the Apache HBase Java API or the Apache
   Phoenix thick JDBC driver.
You can create an edge node in your COD cluster that acts as an individual node type and not as
   a separate Data Hub cluster. The edge node automatically synchronizes with the COD cluster, which
   means you do not need to manually configure the node.
