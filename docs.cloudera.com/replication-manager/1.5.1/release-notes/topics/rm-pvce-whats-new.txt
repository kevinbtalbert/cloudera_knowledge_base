This section lists major features and updates for the Replication Manager service in
        CDP Private Cloud Data Services.
You can edit the Ozone replication policy options to optimize the replication policy
            performance by configuring the queue name, maximum bandwidth, and maximum map slots as
            necessary. You can also modify the schedule as required.
For more information, see Managing Ozone replication policy.
