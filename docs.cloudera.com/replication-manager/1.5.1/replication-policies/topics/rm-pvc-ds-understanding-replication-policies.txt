Replication policies in Replication Manager
Replication Manager is a service in CDP Private Cloud Data Services. You can use this
        service to copy and migrate HDFS data, Hive external tables, and Ozone data between CDP
        Private Cloud Base 7.1.8 or higher clusters using Cloudera Manager version 7.7.3 or
        higher.
You can create HDFS replication policies, Hive replication policies, and Ozone
            replication policies to replicate HDFS data, Hive external tables, and Ozone data
            respectively. Before you create replication policies, you must verify whether the
            on-premises cluster versions are supported by Replication Manager, add the on-premises
            clusters in the Management Console, and configure the required ports for
            replication.
