You must configure the kerberized clusters with the necessary configurations in Cloudera
        Manager before you create replication policies in CDP Private Cloud Data Services
        Replication Manager to replicate data between CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.8 or higher
        clusters. You must also add the required user and group to all the hosts in the source and
        destination clusters in Cloudera Manager before you replicate data from unsecure to secure
        clusters using replication policies.
Replication between clusters using Kerberos authenticationAfter you enable Kerberos authentication on the source and destination clusters, you   must perform some additional steps to enable replication on the clusters. The additional steps   include opening the required ports on the clusters, checking the realm names to avoid conflicts   when running replication jobs, and configuring the source and target clusters.Configuring SSL/TLS certificate exchange between two Cloudera Manager instancesThe Replication Manager configures replication peers between two clusters before         running the replication job. You can manually set up an SSL/TLS certificate exchange between         two Cloudera Manager instances that manage source and target cluster respectively.         Replication Manager uses this information to set up the peers for secure data         replication.
