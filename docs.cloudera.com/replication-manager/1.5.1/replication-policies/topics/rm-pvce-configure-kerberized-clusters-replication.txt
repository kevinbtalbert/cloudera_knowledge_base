Configuring kerberized clusters for replication
To replicate data between CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.8 or higher clusters using
        Kerberos authentication, you must ensure the required ports are open and the clusters are
        configured as required.

Open the port used for the Kerberos KDC Server and KRB5 services on all the
                    hosts on the destination cluster. By default, this is port 88.

Use one of the following configurations to ensure that the realm names do not
                    create conflicts while running replication jobs:


If the clusters do not use the same KDC (Kerberos Key
                            Distribution Center), Cloudera recommends that you use different realm
                            names for each cluster.
You can use the same realm name if the clusters use the same
                            KDC or different KDCs that are part of a unified realm, for example
                            where one KDC is the master and the other is a worker KDC.note

If you have multiple clusters that are used to segregate
                                        production and non-production environments, this
                                        configuration might result in principals that have equal
                                        permissions in both environments. Make sure that permissions
                                        are set appropriately for each type of environment.
Replication fails if the source and destination clusters are
                                        in the same realm but do not use the same KDC or the KDCs
                                        are not part of a unified realm.





Configure the following steps on the source and destination clusters so that
                    Replication Manager can replicate data across clusters in two different realms
                    to set up trust between those clusters:


On the hosts in the destination cluster, ensure
                            that the krb5.conf file (typically located at the
                                /etc/kbr5.conf location) on each host has the
                            following information:
KDC information for the source cluster's
                                    Kerberos realm. For
                                    example:
[realms]
SRC.EXAMPLE.COM = {
    kdc = kdc01.src.example.com:88
    admin_server = kdc01.example.com:749
    default_domain = src.example.com
}
DST.EXAMPLE.COM = {
    kdc = kdc01.dst.example.com:88
    admin_server = kdc01.dst.example.com:749
    default_domain = dst.example.com
}
Realm mapping for the source cluster domain in the
                                        [domain_realm] section. For
                                    example:[domain_realm]
.dst.example.com = DST.EXAMPLE.COM
dst.example.com = DST.EXAMPLE.COM
.src.example.com = SRC.EXAMPLE.COM

noteIf you have a scenario where the
                                hostname(s) are inconsistent, ensure that all those hosts are
                                covered in a similar manner as seen in the domain_realm
                                section in the Cloudera Manager > Host > All Hosts section.
On the destination cluster, perform the following steps:
Search for the Trusted Kerberos
                                        Realms property on the HDFS service > Configuration tab.
Enter the source cluster realm name, and click
                                        Save Changes.
Search for the Domain Name(s)
                                    field in the Administration > Settings section.
Enter the domain or host names you want to map to the
                                    destination cluster KDC. Add as many entries as you need. The
                                        entries in this property are used to generate the
                                            domain_realm section in the
                                            krb5.conf file.
Click Save Changes.
Remove domain_realm entries in
                                    the Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                                        remaining krb5.conf property.
