Source Databases and Tables
Select one of the following options to choose the
                                        databases and tables to replicate:
Choose All
                                                  Databases or enter
                                                  * in the Select
                                                  Databases and Tables field.
Enter the database name, and then enter
                                                the table names separated by a whitespace. To enter
                                                multiple databases on a single line, separate the
                                                database names with the pipe (|) character. For
                                                example:
                                                  [***mydbname1***]|[***mydbname2***]|[***mydbname3***].
Enter a regular expression (regex) to
                                                specify the databases and tables to be replicated.
                                                Use one of the following formats to specify
                                                databases and table names:
[\w].+ to
                                                  specify a database or table name.
(?![***excludename***]\b).+
                                                  to specify a database or table except the one
                                                  named excludename.
[***db1***]|[***db2***]
                                                  [\w_]+  specifies all the tables in
                                                  db1 and db2
                                                  databases.




Run As Username (on source)
Optional. The replication policy uses the
                                            Default username to replicate data.Enter another username if you want the
                                            replication policy to use it to replicate data. Ensure
                                            that the user has the necessary permissions to replicate
                                            data.noteYou must provide a
                                            username for Kerberized clusters.

Destination cluster
Choose the target cluster.


Destination Path (Optional)
Enter the path on the target cluster to which
                                        the policy replicates data.By default, Hive metadata is
                                            exported to a default HDFS location
                                                /user/$[***user.name***]/.cm/hive
                                            and then imported from this HDFS file to the destination
                                            Hive metastore. In this example,
                                                user.name is the process user of
                                            the HDFS service on the destination cluster. To override
                                            the default HDFS location for this export file, you can
                                            enter specify a path in the Destination
                                                Path field.


Run as Username
Enter the user name to run the MapReduce job. By default,
                                        MapReduce jobs run as hdfs. To run the
                                        MapReduce job as a different user, enter the user name. If
                                        you are using Kerberos, you must provide a user name here,
                                        and it must have an ID greater than 1000.noteThe user running the MapReduce job
                                            must have read and execute permissions on the Hive
                                            warehouse directory on the source cluster.
                                            If you configure the replication job to preserve
                                            permissions, superuser privileges
                                            are required on the destination
                                            cluster.

                                            timezone.


Frequency
Choose one of the following options:

Does Not Repeat. 


Custom - In the Custom
                                                  Recurrence dialog box, choose the time,
                                                  date, and the frequency to run the policy.

noteEnsure that the frequency
                                            in a schedule enables a job to finish before the next
                                            job starts. Also, ensure that the jobs based on the same
                                            policy do not overlap. If a job is not completed before
                                            another job starts, the second job does not run and the
                                            job status appears as Skipped. If
                                            a job is consistently skipped, you might need to modify
                                            the frequency of the job.

On the Additional Settings page, enter the values as
                    necessary for the attributes:

Description



YARN Queue Name
Enter the name of the YARN queue for the cluster to which
                                        the replication job is submitted if you are using Capacity
                                        Scheduler queues to limit resource consumption. The default
                                        value for this field is default.


Maximum Maps Slots
Set the maximum number of map tasks (simultaneous copies)
                                        per replication job. The default value is 20.


Maximum Bandwidth
Adjust this setting so that each map task is throttled to
                                        consume only the specified bandwidth. The default value for
                                        the bandwidth is 100 MB per second for each mapper.Each
                                            map task (simultaneous copy) is restricted to consume
                                            only the specified bandwidth. This is not always exact.
                                            The map throttles back its bandwidth consumption during
                                            a copy in such a way that the net used bandwidth tends
                                            towards the specified value. You can adjust this setting
                                            so that each map task is throttled to consume only the
                                            specified bandwidth so that the net used bandwidth tends
                                            towards the specified value. 


Number of concurrent HMS connections
Enter the number of concurrent Hive Metastore
                                        connections. The connections are used to concurrently import
                                        and export metadata from Hive. Increase the number of
                                        threads to improve Replication Manager performance. By
                                        default, a new replication policy uses 4 connections.
If you set the value to 1 or more,
                                                Replication Manager uses multi-threading with the
                                                number of connections specified.
If you set the value to 0 or fewer,
                                                Replication Manager uses single threading and a
                                                single connection. 



Replication Option
Choose Metadata and Data to
                                        replicate metadata and data in files and directories.
                                        Otherwise, choose Metadata only to
                                        replicate the metadata of files and directories


Directory for metadata file
Enter / or a valid folder path in
                                        the target cluster to save the metadata file. If the field
                                        is empty or if the specified folder does not exist,
                                        Replication Manager creates a new folder.


Force Overwrite
Select to overwrite data in the destination metastore if
                                        incompatible changes are detected. For example,
                                            if the destination metastore was modified, and a new
                                            partition was added to a table, this option forces
                                            deletion of that partition, overwriting the table with
                                            the version found on the source. If you do not choose
                                            the option and the Hive replication process detects
                                            incompatible changes on the source cluster, Hive
                                            replication fails. This sometimes occurs with recurring
                                            replications, where the metadata associated with an
                                            existing database or table on the source cluster changes
                                            over time. 


Invalidate Impala Metadata on Destination
Choose the option to run the Impala INVALIDATE
                                            METADATA statement per table on the
                                        destination cluster after completing the replication. The
                                        statement purges the metadata of the replicated tables and
                                        views within the destination cluster’s Impala upon
                                        completion of replication, allowing other Impala clients at
                                        the destination to query these tables successfully with
                                        accurate results. importantDo not select this option if the source
                                            and target clusters are Auto-TLS-enabled.warningThis operation is
                                            potentially unsafe if DDL operations are being performed
                                            on any of the replicated tables or views while the
                                            replication is running. In general, directly modifying
                                            replicated data/metadata on the destination is not
                                            recommended. Ignoring this can lead to unexpected or
                                            incorrect behavior of applications and queries using
                                            these tables or views.noteIf the source contains User Defined Functions (UDF),
                                            you must run the INVALIDATE METADATA
                                            statement manually and without any tables specified even
                                            if you configure the automatic invalidation.



Replication Strategy
Choose one of the following replication strategies: 
Static distributes file
                                                replication tasks among the mappers up front to
                                                achieve an uniform distribution based on the file
                                                sizes. 
Dynamic distributes the file
                                                replication tasks in small sets to the mappers, and
                                                as each mapper completes its tasks, it dynamically
                                                acquires and processes the next set of unallocated
                                                tasks. 
The default replication strategy is
                                            Dynamic.


MapReduce Service
Choose the MapReduce or YARN service.


Log Path
Enter an alternate path for the logs, if
                                        required.


Error Handling
Select the following options as necessary: 
Skip Checksum Checks -
                                                Determines whether to skip checksum checks on the
                                                copied files. If selected, checksums are not
                                                validated. Checksums are checked by default. noteYou must skip checksum
                                                  checks to prevent replication failure due to
                                                  non-matching checksums in the following cases:

Checksums are used for two
                                                  purposes: 
To skip replication of files that have already
                                                  been copied. If Skip Checksum
                                                  Checks is selected, the replication
                                                  job skips copying a file if the file lengths and
                                                  modification times are identical between the
                                                  source and destination clusters. Otherwise, the
                                                  job copies the file from the source to the
                                                  destination.
To redundantly verify the integrity of data.
                                                  However, checksums are not required to guarantee
                                                  accurate transfers between clusters. HDFS data
                                                  transfers are protected by checksums during
                                                  transfer and storage hardware also uses checksums
                                                  to ensure that data is accurately stored. These
                                                  two mechanisms work together to validate the
                                                  integrity of the copied data.

Skip Listing Checksum Checks
                                                - Whether to skip checksum check when comparing two
                                                files to determine whether they are same or not. If
                                                skipped, the file size and last modified time are
                                                used to determine if files are the same or not.
                                                Skipping the check improves performance during the
                                                mapper phase. Note that if you select the
                                                  Skip Checksum Checks
                                                option, this check is also skipped.
Abort on Error - Whether
                                                to abort the job on an error. If selected, files
                                                copied up to that point remain on the destination,
                                                but no additional files are copied. Abort
                                                  on Error is not selected by
                                                default.
Abort on Snapshot Diff
                                                  Failures - If a snapshot diff fails
                                                during replication, the replication policy uses a
                                                complete copy to replicate data. If you select this
                                                option, the policy aborts the replication when it
                                                encounters an error instead.



Preserve
Choose the required options to preserve the block size,
                                        replication count, permissions (including ACLs), and
                                        extended attributes (XAttrs) as they exist on the source
                                        file system, or to use the settings as configured on the
                                        destination file system. By default, source system settings
                                        are preserved. When Permission is
                                            selected, and both the source and destination clusters
                                            support ACLs, replication preserves ACLs. Otherwise,
                                            ACLs are not replicated. When Extended
                                                attributes is selected, and both the
                                            source and destination clusters support extended
                                            attributes, replication preserves them. (This option
                                            only displays when both source and destination clusters
                                            support extended attributes.) If you select one
                                            or more of the Preserve options
                                            and you are replicating to S3 or ADLS, the values of all
                                            of these items are saved in metadata files on S3 or
                                            ADLS. When you replicate from S3 or ADLS to HDFS, you
                                            can select which of these options you want to
                                            preserve.noteTo preserve
                                            permissions to HDFS, you must be running as a superuser
                                            on the destination cluster. Use the
                                                Run As Username option to set
                                            the username.


Delete Policy
Choose the required options to determine whether the
                                        files that were deleted on the source should also be deleted
                                        from the destination directory. This policy also determines
                                        the handling of files in the destination location that are
                                        unrelated to the source. Options include: 
Keep Deleted Files - Retains
                                                the destination files even when they no longer exist
                                                at the source. This is the default option.
Delete to Trash - If the HDFS
                                                trash is enabled, files are moved to the trash
                                                folder. This is not supported when replicating to S3
                                                or ADLS.
Delete Permanently - Uses the
                                                least amount of space; use with caution.



Alerts
Choose the required options to generate alerts for
                                        various state changes in the replication workflow. You can
                                        generate an alert on failure, on start, on success, or when
                                        the replication workflow is aborted.




Click Create.
If you selected Run Now on the
                        Schedule page, the replication job starts data
