Managing Hive replication policy
After you create a Hive replication policy in CDP Private Cloud Data Services
        Replication Manager, you can perform and monitor various tasks related to the replication
        policy. You can view the job progress and replication logs. You can edit the advanced
        options to optimize a job run. You can suspend a job and also activate a suspended job. You
        can edit the replication policy as necessary.
On the Replication Policies page, you
            can perform the following actions and tasks on a replication policy and its
            jobs.

When you click Actions for a Hive replication policy,
                    the following actions appear:



Action
Description



Edit
Change the replication policy options as required for
                                        non-expired policies that are in active or suspended state.
                                        Based on the schedule you choose, the replication policy
                                        replicates data.You can edit the replication policies to
                                            better align with changing requirements. For example,
                                            you might want to change the frequency of a policy
                                            depending on the data size and importance of the data
                                            being replicated. noteA
                                                replication policy is associated with a cluster or a
                                                cluster pair, therefore you cannot change the
                                                clusters in the policy. Optionally,
                                            expand a replication policy on the Replication
                                                Policies page to edit the replication
                                            policy options which include frequency (start time
                                            cannot be modified if the policy has already started),
                                            queue name, maximum bandwidth, and maximum map
                                            slots.tipTo
                                            optimize the replication policy performance, you can
                                            configure the queue name, maximum bandwidth, and maximum
                                            map slots as necessary.


Delete
Deletes the replication policy permanently.


Suspend
Suspends a running replication policy.
                                            Activate the replication policy,
                                        if required.


View Log
Download, copy, or open the log to track the job and to
                                        troubleshoot any issues.tipOn the Overview > Issues & Updates panel, the Job
                                                Status column shows the current job
                                            status. If the job failed, click
                                                Failed to view the log details
                                            about the job.


Collect diagnostic bundle

                                        You can download the bundle as a ZIP file to your
                                        machine.




When you expand the policy details, the Job History panel
                    appears.

                        format in the reports.
