Preparing clusters for Ozone replication policiesCloudera Docs
Preparing clusters for Ozone replication policies
You must prepare the clusters, create buckets in the target cluster, and configure
        additional configurations for OBS bucket replication before you create Ozone replication
        policies.
Complete the following checklist to ensure that the
            clusters are ready to be used in an Ozone replication policy:

Have you added the source and target clusters on the Management Console > Clusters page? 
For more information, see Adding clusters to a CDP Private Cloud Data
                        Services deployment.

importantConsider the following limitations
                        before you add clusters:
Only users with admin and
                                    poweruser roles can add clusters to use
                                in Replication Manager.
When Auto-TLS is enabled for a cluster, you must use the
                                Cloudera Manager hostname to add a cluster.
If a Cloudera Manager instance manages multiple clusters,
                                you cannot include those clusters for replication in CDP Private
                                Cloud Data Services Replication Manager.



Have you created the bucket on the target cluster of the same type as the
                    bucket on the source cluster from which the replication policy replicates
                    data?

tipCreate a volume and then the bucket. For
                        more information, see Managing storage elements using
                            CLI.
The following sample commands create a volume and an FSO
                        bucket:
ozone sh volume create o3://ozone1/vol1
ozone sh bucket create o3://ozone1/vol1/buck1 --layout FILE_SYSTEM_OPTIMIZED


Are the additional configurations required for OBS bucket replication
                    configured when the source bucket is an OBS bucket? 
For more information, see Configuring properties for OBS bucket replication.

Do you need to replicate data securely? If so, ensure that the SSL/TLS
                    certificate exchange between two Cloudera Manager instances that manage source
                    and target clusters respectively is configured. For more information, see Configuring SSL/TLS certificate exchange between two Cloudera Manager instances.

Is Kerberos enabled on both the clusters? If so, perform the following
                    steps:


Configure a user with permissions to access HDFS and
                            Ozone.
Run the following command to add the group name of the user
                            (For example, the group name bdr) to the Ozone
                            service configuration in target Cloudera Manager:sudo usermod -a -G om bdr

importantIf Kerberos is enabled on both the
                        clusters, you must run the kinit -kt
                            /[***path***]/[***to***]/om.keytab om command (the absolute
                        path to the Ozone service's keytab) before you run any Ozone
                        commands.


Is Ranger enabled on the source cluster? If so, you must:


complete the following steps on the Ranger UI from source Cloudera
                            Manager:


Log into Ranger UI from source Cloudera Manager.
Click cm_ozone on the
                                        Service Manager page.
Add the user (that you configured in the previous
                                    step) to the all - volume, bucket, key
                                    policy name, and then set the groups for this policy as
                                    public.




complete the following steps for the Ranger service in source Cloudera
                            Manager:


Go to the source Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Ranger service > Configuration tab.
Locate the Ranger KMS Server with KTS
                                        Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                                        conf/kms-site.xml property.
Add the following key-value pairs:
hadoop.kms.proxyuser.om.hosts=*
hadoop.kms.proxyuser.om.groups=*
hadoop.kms.proxyuser.om.users=*

Save the changes.
Restart the Ranger service for the changes to take
                                    effect.






Configuring properties for OBS buckets to use in Ozone replication policiesBefore you replicate OBS buckets, you must configure additional properties that         assist Ozone replication policies to replicate data in OBS buckets. Parent topic: Ozone replication policies
