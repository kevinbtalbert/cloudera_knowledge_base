Classic Clusters
      page
The Classic Clusters page
      specifies the total number of clusters enabled for Replication Manager, the number of clusters
      that are in an error state, the number of clusters that are active, and the number of clusters
      for which a warning is issued.
The Classic Clusters page shows the cluster health status, cluster
         name, cluster version, number of nodes in the cluster, number of replication policies in
         the cluster, and the location of the cluster. Use the Actions menu
         to create a replication policy for the cluster, launch Cloudera Manager, or sync the
         cluster configuration. Click Add to create a replication policy. 
The Classic Clusters map panel shows the geolocation of each cluster and helps
         you to easily identify the status of cluster services, using the following interactive
         markers on the map:
Red indicates that at least one required service has stopped
               on the cluster.
Orange indicates that all the required services are running
               on the cluster but the remaining disk capacity on the cluster is less than 10%.
Green indicates that all the required services are running on
               the cluster and the remaining disk capacity is greater than 10%.

Hover over a marker on the map to view the data center associated with the
         cluster, the cluster name, and the number of Replication Manager policies that are
         associated with that cluster.
To investigate the issues associated with clusters that have an error or warning
         status, launch Cloudera Manager.
