Enabling and taking snapshots in Cloudera Manager
Before you take snapshots (in Cloudera Manager) for HDFS directories, you must enable
        snapshots for the directories in Cloudera Manager.

To enable snapshots for HDFS directories, navigate to the directory on the Cloudera Manager  > Clusters > HDFS service > File Browser tab, and click Enable Snapshots.

noteIf you enable snapshots for a directory, you cannot
                        enable snapshots for its parent directory. Snapshots can be taken only on
                        directories that have snapshots enabled.
tipTo disable snapshots for a directory that
                        has snapshots enabled, click Disable Snapshots.
                        Ensure that the snapshots of the directory are deleted before you disable
                        snapshots for the directory.


To take a snapshot of a directory or table, perform the following steps:


Navigate to the directory or folder.


Click Take Snapshot in the drop-down menu next
                            to the full file path.


Specify a unique name for the snapshot.
The snapshot name with the timestamp of its creation appears in the
                            snapshot list.



Click Actions  > Delete  to delete a snapshot. 

noteAfter you delete a snapshot, you can restore it, if required.
