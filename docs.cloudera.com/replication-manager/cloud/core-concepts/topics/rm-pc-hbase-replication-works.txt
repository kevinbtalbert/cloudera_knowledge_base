HBase replication policy
You can replicate HBase and Phoenix tables using HBase replication policies in CDP
        Public Cloud Replication Manager. An HBase replication policy replicates the data at
        table-level granularity. After you create an HBase replication policy, you can delete one or
        more tables from the policy. 
importantBefore you create replication policies, see
                Support matrix for Replication Manager on CDP Public
                Cloud to verify whether your clusters are supported by Replication
            Manager.
The replication policy replicates the data in the specified tables and continues to
            replicate the generated data (that is, future changes in data) unless you suspend the
            policy or delete the tables.
When you create an HBase replication policy, you can choose one or more of the

            following methods to replicate HBase data depending on your requirements:
Replicate only the generated data from chosen tables
In this method, you choose one or more tables during the replication policy creation
                process. Replication Manager replicates only the data that is generated after policy
                creation.

Replicate existing data and generated data from chosen tables
In this method, you choose one or more tables, and also choose the Select Source > Perform Initial Snapshot option during the HBase replication policy creation process.
                Replication Manager replicates the existing data and the data that is generated
                after policy creation. 
For example, you have two tables named 'Orders' and 'Customers' in the source cluster
                and you want to copy the data from these tables from March 1, 2021 onwards. To
                accomplish this task, you create an HBase replication policy without choosing the
                    Perform Initial Snapshot option in the Create
                    Replication Policy wizard on March 1, 2021. The data that you create,
                update, or delete in the source cluster after you created the HBase replication
                policy is automatically replicated to the target cluster.

Replicate existing tables and future tables in the database
In this method, you choose the Select Source  > Replicate Database option during the HBase replication policy creation process.
                Replication Manager replicates the generated data from the existing tables, and it
                replicates data from the future tables that are created after the HBase replication
                policy creation process is complete. 
To replicate data from the future tables successfully, you must create
                similar empty tables on the target cluster. You can perform this action when you
                create or add a table to the database on the source cluster.
You can choose the Replicate Database option only if
                the following conditions are true:
Target Cloudera Manager version is 7.11.0 or higher.
Source clusterâ€™s CDH version is 6.x or higher.CDH 5.16.2 and
                            higher versions also support the Replicate
                                Database option after you upgrade the source cluster
                            Cloudera Manager.
No existing HBase replication policies exist between the source
                        and target clusters.
tipIf you want to replicate the new tables
                    that are created after the replication policy creation is complete, you must
                    configure the replication scope to "1" for those tables on the source cluster.To configure the replication scope for a table on the master
                        cluster, run the alter [***table_name***], {NAME
                            => [***column-family***], REPLICATION_SCOPE =>
                            1} command for each column family that must be replicated.
                        REPLICATION_SCOPE is a column-family level attribute, where the value '0'
                        means replication is disabled, and '1' means replication is
                    enabled.

Replicate existing data and generated data from chosen tables and future
                tables
In this method, you choose the Perform Initial
                    Snapshot and Replicate Database options on
                the Select Source page during the HBase replication policy
                creation process. Replication Manager replicates the existing and generated data
                from the existing tables in addition to the data in the future tables.
