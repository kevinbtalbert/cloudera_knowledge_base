Table-level replication
To enable table-level replication, you must specify the list of tables to be
        replicated in a given replication policy. Table-level replication enables you to replicate
        just the critical tables. It also helps you to speed-up the replication process and also
        reduces network bandwidth utilization.
noteWhile using on-premises clusters for replicating to CDP,
            multiple databases and tables can be specified in a single replication policy. 
You can define table level replication policy using regular expressions, for
            example, db.marketing_*. You can dynamically add or remove tables to the list by
            manually changing the replication policy during run time. 
Hive supports database level replication policy of the format
                <db_name>.*. In the real-time world, the policy format is
            similar to <db_name>.(t1, t3, â€¦). The tables list can be specified
            using Java supported regular expressions in the replication policy of format:
                <db_name>.<include_regex>.<exclude_regex>. 
The replication policy has three parts separated with a dot
                (.). First part is the database name, the second part is single regular
            expression (regex) to represent the included tables list, and the third part is single regex to represent the
            tables that needs to be excluded from the list even if it matches the
                include_regex format.
The following examples illustrate the different ways to specify the tables list
            in the policy:
<db_name> - Full database replication which is currently
                    supported.
<db_name>.'.*?' - Full database replication.
<db_name>.'t1|t3' - Database replication with static list
                    of tables t1 and t3 included.
<db_name>.'(t1*)|t2'.'t100' - Database replication with all
                    tables having prefix t1 and also include table t2 which does not have prefix t1
                    and exclude t100 which has the prefix t1.

Limitations using table-level replication
If a table is dynamically added for replication due to changes in regular
                    expression or added to the include list, the tables' data
                    may not be point-in-time consistent with other tables which are already
                    replicated incrementally. However, this inconsistency is seen for a very small
                    duration until the completion of the next incremental replication after tables
                    are added in the bootstrapped manner.
Hive does not support overlapping replication policies such as db., db.[t1], and
                    *. to same target database but works as expected if the target databases are
                    different.
