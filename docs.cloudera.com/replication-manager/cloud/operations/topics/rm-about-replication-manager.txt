CDP Public Cloud Replication Manager
Replication Manager is a service in CDP Public Cloud. You can create replication
        policies in Replication Manager to copy or migrate HDFS, Hive external tables, and HBase
        data between on-premises clusters (CDH, CDP Private Cloud Base, or HDP) and CDP Public Cloud
        (Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure ADLS Gen2 (ABFS)). Replicating Hive managed tables using
        Replication Manager from HDP clusters to CDP Public Cloud is a beta feature and is not
        available for general use. 
importantBefore you create replication policies, see
                Support matrix for Replication Manager on CDP Public
                Cloud to verify whether your clusters are supported by Replication
            Manager.
Before you create a replication policy, you must prepare the clusters, register the
            on-premises clusters (CDH or CDP Private Cloud Base) as classic clusters in Management
            Console, register the cloud credentials in Replication Manager, and verify whether the
            minimum port configuration is configured.
After you create a replication policy, you can perform various actions on the replication
            policy. You can monitor the replication jobs, view job history, and perform actions on
            the replication job.
