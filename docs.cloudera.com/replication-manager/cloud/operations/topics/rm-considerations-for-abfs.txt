Considerations for ABFS
Blob container requirements for setting up ABFS cloud accounts.


ADLS Gen2 storage account is required. You need a cloud Blob container with user
                    credentials that you can use in Replication Manager service, so that Replication
                    Manager can access the container.
The container has to have enough space for the replicated data, and write
                    permissions to copy the data.
