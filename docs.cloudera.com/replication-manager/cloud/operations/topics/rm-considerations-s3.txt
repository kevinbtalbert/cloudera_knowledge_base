Considerations for Amazon S3
Consider the cloud bucket requirements to setting up an Amazon S3 cloud
        account.


You need a cloud bucket with user credentials that you can enter in Replication
                    Manager, so Replication Manager can access the bucket.
The bucket has to have enough space for the replicated data, and write
                    permissions to copy the data.
The bucket needs to support cloud storage encryption types supported by
                    Replication Manager (SSE-S3 & SSE-KMS).
