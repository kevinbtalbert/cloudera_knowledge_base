ABFS credentials
Currently, registering Azure cloud credentials using the Replication Manager UI does
        not automatically create the same authorisation rules on the source Cloudera Manager
        cluster. 
You need an ADLS Gen2 storage account and a cloud Blob container with user
            credentials to use in Replication Manager service. The container has to have enough
            space for the replicated data and write permissions to copy the data. 

noteThe required configurations to be entered by the user for the Azure
                cloud credentials are currently not available in the Replication Manager UI. When
                you plan to submit the replication policies with Azure as your cloud storage,
                Cloudera recommends that you must update cloud credentials in the
                    source cluster Cloudera Manager UI.
