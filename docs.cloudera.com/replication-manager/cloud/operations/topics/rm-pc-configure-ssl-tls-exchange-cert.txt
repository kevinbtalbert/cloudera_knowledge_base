Configuring SSL/TLS certificate exchange between two Cloudera Manager instances
The Replication Manager configures replication peers between two clusters before
        running the replication job. You can manually set up an SSL/TLS certificate exchange between
        two Cloudera Manager instances that manage source and target cluster respectively.
        Replication Manager uses this information to set up the peers for secure data
        replication.

importantThe sample commands use the
                        open-jdk-11 java version. Use the java version that
                    you use in CDP clusters in these commands.
Go to the truststore location in source Cloudera Manager, and
                    perform the following steps:


List the contents of the keystore file and password using the
                                    [***keytool path***] -list
                                -keystore [***truststore JKS file location ***]
                                -storepass [***truststore
                                password***] command.
For example, /usr/lib/jvm/java-openjdk-11/bin/keytool -
                                list -keystore
                                /var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks
                                -storepass [***truststore
                                password***]tip

The keytool path can be located in various
                                        locations including the keytool itself. For example, it can
                                        be located in
                                            /usr/lib/jvm/java-openjdk-11/bin/keytool
                                        or /usr/java/default/bin/keytool.
You can locate the truststore password using the
                                            cat /etc/hadoop/conf/ssl-client.xml
                                        command. You can enter the SSL password for the
                                            /etc/hadoop/conf/ssl-client.xml
                                        file when prompted.
Alternatively, you can also run the following
                                        commands instead of the command in Step
                                        a:export JAVA_HOME=[***keytool location***]

export TRUSTSTORE_JKS=[***truststore JKS file location***]

export TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD=[***password in the ssl-client.xml file***]
$JAVA_HOME/keytool -list -keystore
$TRUSTSTORE_JKS -storepass
$TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD




Export the certificate contents in the host to a file using the
                                    [***keytool***] -exportcert
                                    -keystore [***truststore JKS file location
                                    ***] -alias
                                    [***cm_alias_on_src_cm***] -file
                                    ./[***TXT file, for example:
                                    source-cert.txt***] -storepass
                                    [***truststore_password***]
                            command.
For example,
                            /usr/java/default/bin/keytool -exportcert -keystore /var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks -alias cmrootca-0 -file ./source-cert.txt -storepass [***truststore_password***]


Copy the text file to all the hosts of the target cluster
                            Cloudera Manager securely using the scp -i [***PEM
                                    file***]
[***TXT file - source-cert.txt***]
                                    root@[***host_ip***]:/home/
                            command.


Import the certificate into the keystore file on all the hosts of the
                                target cluster Cloudera Manager using the
                                    [***keytool***] -importcert
                                -noprompt -v -trustcacerts -keystore [***truststore JKS
                                    file location ***] -alias
                                    [***cm_alias_on_dest_cm***] -file
                                    ./[***TXT file - source-cert.txt***]
                                --storepass
                                [***truststore_password***]
                            command.
For example, /usr/java/default/bin/keytool -importcert
                                -noprompt -v -trustcacerts -keystore
                                /var/lib/cloudera-scm-agent/agent-cert/cm-auto-global_truststore.jks
                                -alias cmrootca-1 -file ./source-cert.txt --storepass
                                    [***truststore_password***]



Go to the truststore location in target Cloudera Manager, and
                    perform the following steps:


List the contents of the keystore file and password using the
                                    [***keytool path***] -list
                                -keystore [***truststore JKS file location ***]
                                -storepass [***truststore
                                password***] command.


Export the certificate contents in the host to a file using the
                                    [***keytool***] -exportcert
                                -keystore [***truststore JKS file location ***]
                                -alias [***cm_alias_on_dest_cm***] -file
                                    ./[***TXT file, for example:
                                    dest-cert.txt***] -storepass
                                    [***truststore_password***]
                            command.


Copy the text file to all the hosts of the source cluster
                            Cloudera Manager securely using the scp -i [***PEM
                                    file***]
[***TXT file - dest-cert.txt***]
                                    root@[***host_ip***]:/home/
                            command.


Import the certificate into the keystore file on all the hosts of the
                                source Cloudera Manager using the
                                    [***keytool***] -importcert
                                -noprompt -v -trustcacerts -keystore [***truststore JKS

                                [***truststore_password***]
                            command.
