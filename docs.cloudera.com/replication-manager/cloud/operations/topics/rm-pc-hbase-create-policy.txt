Creating HBase replication policy
You can replicate HBase data from a source classic cluster (CDH or CDP Private Cloud
        Base cluster), COD, or Data Hub to a target Data Hub or COD cluster in CDP Public Cloud
        Replication Manager.
Ensure that the HBase replication policy prerequisites are
            complete.

On the Management Console  > Replication Manager > Replication Policies page, click Add Policy.
The Create Replication Policy wizard appears.

On the General page, choose or enter the following
                    information:

Replicate Database

Replication Manager replicates:

Set HBase Replication Machine User
Optional. Choose the option and then enter the username

                                        an existing user because if the password is incorrect, the
                                        data is not replicated even though the policy is created
                                            successfully.Based on the username and password that
                                            you enter, one of the following possible scenarios is
                                            implemented by Replication Manager:

                                        This type of restart ensures that there is no disruption of
                                        service. During full restart, all the nodes are shut down at

                        cluster, you must perform the following steps to complete the HBase
                        replication policy setup:
Restart the HBase service on the on-premises source cluster when the
                                policy status on the Replication Policies page
                                shows Waiting for ‘Continue Setup’ action call. 
Click Continue setup for the policy on the
                                    Replication Policies page after the service
                                restart is complete. This action informs Replication Manager to
                                continue the replication policy setup.

The following image shows the Continue setup option
                        for the HBase replication policy on the Replication
                            Policies page:





After you create the first replication policy between a
            source cluster and target cluster (policy that is in setup/service
                restart state), Replication Manager creates and runs two schedules or
            jobs. The first schedule shows the service configuration and service restart progress,
            and the second schedule shows the policy creation progress. Subsequent replication
            policies between the same source cluster and target cluster creates only one job.
            Replication Manager restarts the HBase services on both the clusters if they are COD
                clusters.noteThe first HBase replication policy between a
                source cluster and target cluster takes more time to complete because of the
                first-time setup configuration process that runs in the background. You can continue
                creating more HBase replication policies while the setup process of the in-progress
                policies is running in the background. The subsequent replication policies for the
                same source and target cluster do not run the first-time setup
            configuration.

To verify whether a replication policy is running, you can either click the
                replication policy on the Replication Policies page, or click
                    Running Commands in Cloudera Manager.

                HBase replication policy between COD clusters:
