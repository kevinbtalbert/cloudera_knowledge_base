Monitor HBase RegionServer replication peer metrics in Replication Manager
When you click a replication policy on the "Replication Policies" page, the "Charts" tab
    appears. On this tab, when you choose the HBase replication peer metric, aggregate rollup level,
    start time, and end time, a graphical representation of HBase RegionServer metrics specific to
    the replication peer appears.
Cloudera Manager monitors several metrics which includes performance metrics for
      the HBase RegionServer. Replication Manager leverages this capability to display the HBase
      RegionServer metrics specific to a replication peer as a graph on the "Charts" tab for a
      replication policy, and stores it in the source cluster of the replication policy. You can use
      these metrics to monitor a HBase replication job and to find and diagnose issues related to
      the HBase replication peer. 
You can view these metrics for a replication peer only if the following conditions
      are true:

The source Cloudera Manager API version is 42 or higher and the target Cloudera
        Manager API version is 53 or higher. tipThe endpoint
              http://[***cm_host***]:[***cm_port***]/api/version
          shows the API version of the Cloudera Manager.
The HBase replication policy has been successfully created and is not in an
        erroneous state.

noteIf the target Cloudera Manager version is 45 or higher, the graphs
      generated for HBase replication policies are the same if they share the same source and target
      clusters. If the target Cloudera Manager version is lower than 45, the graph differs from one
      HBase replication policy to another because one replication peer is created for each HBase
      replication policy in these API versions.
