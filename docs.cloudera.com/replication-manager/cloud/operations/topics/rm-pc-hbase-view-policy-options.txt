Manage and monitor HBase replication policies
After you create an HBase replication policy in CDP Public Cloud Replication Manager,
        you can perform and monitor various tasks related to the replication policy. You can also
        view the job progress and replication logs. You can perform the following actions and tasks on the replication policy and its jobs on
            the Replication Policies page:

You can edit the policy name; view the source cluster name and tables selected
                    in it to be replicated; and view the destination Data Hub or COD and the tables
                    that have been replicated. You cannot remove the tables if you choose Select Source > Replicate Database option during the HBase replication policy creation
                    process.

On the Job History tab, you can view the previous
                    replication jobs, current running job, and one future scheduled job for the
                    replication policy. You can perform Actions on the HBase
                    replication policy.

On the Charts tab, you can view the HBase RegionServer
                    metrics for a specific replication peer.

Monitor HBase replication policy job detailsWhen you click a replication policy on the "Replication Policies" page, the "Job     History" tab appears. On this tab, you can view the previous replication jobs, current running     job, and one future scheduled job for the replication policy. Monitor HBase RegionServer replication peer metrics in Replication ManagerWhen you click a replication policy on the "Replication Policies" page, the "Charts" tab     appears. On this tab, when you choose the HBase replication peer metric, aggregate rollup level,     start time, and end time, a graphical representation of HBase RegionServer metrics specific to     the replication peer appears.Viewing HBase RegionServer replication peer metricsYou can view HBase RegionServer metrics specific to a replication peer as a graph on         the "Charts" tab for a replication policy on the "Replication Policies" page.Parent topic: Using HBase replication policies
