Preparing to create an HBase replication policy
Before you create HBase replication policies in CDP Public Cloud Replication Manager,
        you must prepare the clusters, register cloud storage in Replication Manager, and verify
        cluster access.

Do the source cluster and target cluster meet the requirements to create an
                    HBase replication policy? 
For more information, see Support matrix for Replication Manager on CDP
                        Public Cloud.

Is the source CDH cluster or source CDP Private Cloud Base cluster registered
                    as a classic cluster on the Management Console?
CDH clusters and CDP Private Cloud Base clusters are managed by Cloudera
                    Manager. To enable these on-premises clusters for Replication Manager, you must
                    register them as classic clusters on the Management Console. After registration,
                    you can use them for data migration purposes.importantWhen you register a CDP Private Cloud Base cluster as a
                        classic cluster, ensure that you use only the Cloudera Manager IP
                            Address and Cloudera Manager Port
                        options and not the Register KNOX endpoint (Optional)
                        option.For information about registering an on-premises
                        cluster as a classic cluster, see Adding a CDH cluster and Adding a CDP Private Cloud Base
                            cluster.noteCDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.6
                            and higher clusters must be Kerberos enabled to use them as source
                            classic clusters.

Are the following steps complete on the CDP Private Cloud Base source cluster
                    or CDH source cluster (these steps are not required for COD sources)?


Have you installed the HBase replication plugin parcel in the
                            CDH source clusters?Applicable for CDH versions 7.2.x that are lower
                                than 7.2.2, versions 7.1.x that are lower than 7.1.5, and for
                                versions lower than 7.x. For more information, see Cloudera Replication
                                    Plugin.
Have you created the /user/hbase folder
                            for the hbase user in HDFS in the source
                                cluster? Applicable for Cloudera Manager versions 7.4.3 or lower;
                                Cloudera Manager 7.4.4 only if the API version is lower than v45.
                                The endpoint
                                        http://[***cm_host***]:[***cm_port***]/api/version
                                shows the API version of the Cloudera Manager.tipTo create the folder, run the following
                                commands:sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hbase
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -chown hbase:hbase /user/hbaseThese
                                commands allow the HBase replication policy to replicate the
                                existing data in the source cluster.



Do you have the necessary permission to run the HBase replication jobs on
                    YARN?
To verify whether you have the necessary permission, perform the following
                        steps:
Go to the source Cloudera Manager > YARN service > Configuration tab.
Ensure one of the following conditions is met:
The Allowed System Users property must
                                    have hbase. Otherwise, add
                                        hbase to the existing property value.
                                        This property lists the users permitted (or allowed) to
                                        run containers. Note that the users with IDs lower than the
                                            Minimum User ID might be
                                        permitted (or allowed) to run containers.
The Minimum User ID property is set to a
                                    value that is lower than the HBase user's ID. To check the
                                        HBase user's ID, SSH into a cluster node and run the
                                            id hbase command. The following
                                        sample shows the HBase user's ID when you run the id
                                            hbase
                                        command:# id hbase
uid=39993(hbase) gid=39993(hbase) groups=39993(hbase)



Is the required cloud credential that you want to use in the replication policy
                    registered with the Replication Manager service? 
For more information, see Working with cloud credentials.
You can also add the following advanced configuration settings to use Google
                    Cloud, Amazon S3, and ADLS accounts in Replication Manager: 

Go to the source Cloudera Manager > Clusters > HDFS service > Configuration tab.


Locate the HDFS Client Advanced Configuration
                                    Snippet (Safety Valve) for hdfs-site.xml
                                property.


Add the following key-value pairs to register a Google
                                account to use in Replication Manager:

Add the following key-value pairs to register an S3 account to use in
                            Replication Manager:
fs.s3a.access.key=[***enter
                                            the session access key***]

                                            the session secret key***]

Add the following key-value pairs to register an ADLS account to use in
                            Replication Manager:
fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.id=[***enter
                                            the ABFS storage client

fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.secret=[***enter
                                            the ABFS storage client secret
                                        key***]


Save and restart the HDFS service for the changes to take
                                effect.



Have you assigned the managed identity of source roles, Storage Blob
                        Data Owner or Storage Blob Data
                        Contributor, to the destination storage data container and vice
                    versa for bidirectional replication when you are using COD on Microsoft
                    Azure?
The roles allow writing a snapshot in the destination cluster
                    container.

Is the required target cluster (Data Hub or COD) available and healthy? 

Do you have the required cluster access to create or view replication
                    policies?

Does DNS resolution work as expected between the source and destination
                    clusters?

tipIf the destination cluster is not
                        reachable from the source RegionServer hosts, add the hostname and IP
                        address of the destination hosts to the /etc/hosts file
                        on the RegionServers of the source cluster.


Is the outgoing SSH port open on the Cloudera Manager host?

Do you need to replicate data securely? If so, ensure that the SSL/TLS
                    certificate exchange between two Cloudera Manager instances that manage source
                    and target clusters respectively is configured. For more information, see
                        Configuring SSL/TLS certificate exchange between two Cloudera Manager
                        instances.

Are the following ports open and available for Replication Manager?

                                        the destination hosts uninterruptedly. For more information,

YARN Resource Manager
Open on the source and target cluster to access the YARN

Consider the following best practices while using CDP Public Cloud on
   Microsoft Azure ADLS Gen2 (ABFS):
Ensure that the on-premises cluster (port 443) can access the
      https://login.microsoftonline.com endpoint. This is because the Hadoop client in
     the on-premises cluster (CDH/CDP Private Cloud Base) connects to the endpoint to acquire the
     access tokens before it connects to Azure ADLS storage. For more information, see the
      General Azure guidelines row in the  Azure-specific endpoints table.
Ensure that the steps mentioned in the General Azure guidelines and Azure
      Data Lake Storage Gen 2 rows in the Azure-specific endpoints table are complete so that the
     endpoint connects to the target path successfully.



After the clusters and cloud storage requirements are met,
            you can create an HBase replication policy.
