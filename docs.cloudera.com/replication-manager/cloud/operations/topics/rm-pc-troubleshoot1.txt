Cannot find destination clusters for HBase replication policies
When you ping destination clusters using their host names, the source cluster hosts
        for HBase replication policies do not find the destination clusters. How to resolve this
        issue?

Cause
This might occur for on-premises clusters such as CDP Private Cloud Base clusters
                    or CDH clusters because the source clusters are not on the same network as the
                    destination Data Hub. Therefore, hostnames cannot be resolved by the DNS service
                    on the source cluster.

Remedy

Add the destination Region Server and Zookeeper IP to host name
                            mappings in the /etc/hosts files of all the Region
                            Servers on the source cluster.
The following snippet shows the contents in a sample
                                /etc/hosts
