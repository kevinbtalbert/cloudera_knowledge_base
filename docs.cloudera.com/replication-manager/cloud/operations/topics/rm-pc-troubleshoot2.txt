What are the different methods to identify errors while troubleshooting a failed
        replication policy?


You can choose one of the following methods to identify the errors
                        to troubleshoot a job failure:
On the Replication Policies page, click the failed
                            job in the Job History pane. The errors for the
                            failed job appear. 

The following sample image shows the Job

In the source and target Cloudera Manager, click Running
                                Commands on the left  navigation bar. The recent command
                            history shows the failed commands.
The following sample image shows the Running
                                Commands page for an HBase replication policy:



On the source cluster and target cluster, open the service logs to
                            track the errors (For example, HBase service logs). 

You can also search on the Cloudera Manager > Diagnostics  > Logs page to view the logs.
