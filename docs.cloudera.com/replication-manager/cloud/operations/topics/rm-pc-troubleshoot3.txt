HBase replication policy fails when Perform Initial Snapshot is chosen
An HBase replication policy fails for COD on Microsoft Azure when the "Perform
        Initial Snapshot" option is chosen but data replication is successful when the option is not
        chosen. How to resolve this issue?

Cause
This issue appears when the required managed identity of source roles are not
                    assigned.

Remedy

Assign the managed identity of source roles, Storage Blob
                                Data Owner or Storage Blob Data
                                Contributor, to the destination storage data container
                            and vice versa for bidirectional replication.
The roles allow writing a snapshot in the destination cluster
                            container.
