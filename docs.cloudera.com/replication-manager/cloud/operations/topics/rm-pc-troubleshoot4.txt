HDFS replication policy fails due to export HTTPS_PROXY environment variable
HDFS replication policies fail when the export HTTPS_PROXY environment variable is
        set to access AWS through proxy servers. How to resolve this issue?

Remedy
To resolve this issue, perform the following steps:
Open the core-site.xml file on the source
                            cluster.

Enter the following properties in the file:

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.proxy.host</name>
  <description>Hostname of the (optional) proxy server for S3 connections.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.proxy.port</name>
  <description>Proxy server port. If this property is not set
    but fs.s3a.proxy.host is, port 80 or 443 is assumed (consistent with
    the value of fs.s3a.connection.ssl.enabled).</description>
</property>



Save and close the file.

Restart the source Cloudera Manager.

Run the failed HDFS replication policies in Replication Manager.
Replication Manager completes the replication successfully.
