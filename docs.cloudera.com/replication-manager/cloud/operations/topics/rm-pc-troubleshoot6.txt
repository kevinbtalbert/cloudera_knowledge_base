 Partition metadata replication takes a long time to complete
How can partition metadata replication be improved when the Hive tables use several
        Hive partitions?


Hive metadata replication process takes a long time to complete when the Hive
                    tables use several Hive partitions. This is because the Hive partition
                    parameters are compared during the import stage of the partition metadata
                    replication process and if the exported and existing partition parameters do not
                    match, the partition is dropped and recreated. You can configure a key-value
                    pair to support partition metadata replication.



Go to the Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Hive service > Configuration tab.

Search for the Hive Replication Environment Advanced
                                Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) property.

Enter the
                                    HIVE_IGNORED_PARTITION_PARAMETERS=[***comma
                                    separated list of Hive partition
                                parameters***] key-value pair.
For example,
                                HIVE_IGNORED_PARTITION_PARAMETERS=transient_lastDdlTime,totalSize,numRows,COLUMN_STATS_ACCURATE,numFilesThe
                                partition parameter names you provide are not compared during the
                                import stage of the partition metadata replication process.
                                Therefore, even if the partition parameters do not match between the
                                exported and existing partitions, the partition is not dropped or
                                recreated. After you configure this key-value pair, the import stage
                                of the partition metadata replication process completes
                            faster.

Save the changes, and restart the Hive service.
