Replicating Hive nested tables
CDP Public Cloud Replication Manager does not support Hive nested tables. What do I
        do if there are Hive nested tables in the source cluster?


CDP Public Cloud Replication Manager does not support Hive nested tables for
                    replication. Therefore, it is recommended that you move the nested tables to a
                    different location in HDFS and then replicate Hive external tables. However, if
                    this is not possible, you can perform the following steps in the given order as
                    a workaround.

Solution

Create a Hive replication policy on the target cluster. Ensure that the Additional Settings > Replication Option > Metadata only option is selected to replicate the metadata of required
                            files and directories.

noteIf you are using CDP Public Cloud 7.2.15 or
                                lower and if you are using Amazon S3 as the disaster recovery
                                cluster, ensure that you (the administrator) run the following
                                command after the Hive metadata replication is
                                        complete:ALTER TABLE table SET LOCATION
                                            "[***[s3a://s3_bucket/warehouse_path]***]";


Create a HDFS replication policy on the source cluster to replicate the
                            table data.
