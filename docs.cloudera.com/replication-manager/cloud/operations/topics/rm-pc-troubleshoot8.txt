Target HBase folder is deleted when HBase replication policy fails
When the snapshot export fails during the HBase replication policy job run, the
        target HBase folder in the destination Data Hub or COD gets deleted. 

You can either revoke the delete permission for the user, or ensure that you use an
                access key/role that does not have delete permissions to the required storage
                component. 
The following steps show how to create an access key in AWS and an Azure service
                principal, which do not have delete permission for the storage component.


Solution in AWS
If the Data Hub or COD is on Amazon S3, you can perform the
                        following steps to create an access key that does not have delete permission
                        for the storage component:
Login to AWS.

Click Create policy on the IAM > Policies > Create policy page.
The following sample image shows the Policies
                            page in the AWS > IAM section to create a policy.



Choose the S3 Service, and then choose the
                            following permissions for generic access (assign resources as
                            required):


List/ListBucket
Read/GetBucketLocation
Read/GetObject
Write/AbortMultipartUpload
Write/PutObject
Permissions
                                        management/PutBucketPublicAccessBlock



Add Delete/DeleteObject  permission to the target COD
                            cluster’s snapshot temporary folder. 
For example, the target COD cluster’s snapshot temporary folder
                            might be located in [***target COD S3
                                    path***]/hbase/.hbase-snapshot/.tmp/*.
                        

Enter a Name for the policy, add tags, and click
                                Create policy.

Click Add Users to create a user on the IAM > Users page. 

Enter a Name, and click
                                Next.

Choose the Attach policies directly option on
                            the Set permission page, and then assign the
                            previously created policy to the user.

Optionally, add tags and create the user.

Click Create access key to create an access key
                            for the user on the IAM > Users > [***new user***] page. 

On the Security Credentials > Access keys page, choose Application running outside
                                AWS. Click Next.

Optionally, attach the tags, create and save the access key. This
                            access key is used as an external account for replication.
How do I verify whether the target HBase folder in the destination
                                Data Hub or COD does not get deleted if the snapshot export fails
                                during the HBase replication policy job run?
Perform the following steps to verify if the delete operation is
                                allowed for the access key that you previously created:
Run the aws configure --profile
                                            delete-test command to setup the credentials
                                        in AWS CLI.
Delete an arbitrarily created temporary file from the
                                        account using the aws s3 --profile delete-test rm
                                            --recursive s3://[***account
                                            name***]/delete-testing/
                                        command.
 The delete operation is not allowed.




Solution in Microsoft Azure
If the Data Hub or COD is on ABFS, you can perform the following
                        steps to create an Azure service principal that does not have delete
                        permission for the storage component:
Login to Microsoft Azure.

Click Add > Add a custom role on the Subscriptions > Select the subscription > Access Control (IAM) page in Microsoft Azure, and complete the following
                            steps:


On the Basics tab, provide a name for the
                                    role, select Clone a role for the
                                        Baseline permissions field, and choose
                                        Storage Blob Data Contributor for the
                                        Role to clone field. Click
                                        Next.


On the Permissions tab, remove the
                                        Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/delete
                                    and
                                        Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/delete
                                    permissions.


Click Review + create.

The following sample image shows the Access
                                            control (IAM) page in Microsoft Azure:






Click Add > Add role assignment on the Storage accounts > Select the account where snapshots will be
                                    written > Access Control (IAM) page, and complete the following steps:


On the Role tab, select the custom role
                                    previously created. Click Next.


On the Members tab, select
                                        User, group, or service principal for
                                        Assign access to field, and select the
                                    required service principal.


Click Review + assign.


Click Review + assign on the
                                        Conditions (optional) tab.



Click Add principal on the Storage accounts > [***account name***] > [***container where snapshots are to be
                                        written***] > Manage ACL page.


Select the required service principal.


Choose the Execute permission for the
                                    required container, and click Save.

importantEnsure that no
                                        other role containing delete access to the given storage
                                        account is assigned to the new service principal on the
                                        Access Control (IAM) page.



How do I verify whether the target HBase folder in the destination
                                Data Hub or COD does not get deleted if the snapshot export fails
                                during the HBase replication policy job run?
To verify if the delete operation is allowed on the service principal
                                that you previously created, perform the following steps:
Open the Azure Cloud Shell terminal.
Login using the service principal that you created
                                        previously using the az login --service-principal
                                            -u [***client id***] -p
                                                [***client secret***] --tenant
                                            [***tenant id***] command.
Delete an arbitrarily created temporary file from the
                                        account using the az storage fs file delete
                                            --path [***temporary file***] -f data
                                            --account-name [***account name***]
                                            --auth-mode login command.
The delete operation is not allowed.
