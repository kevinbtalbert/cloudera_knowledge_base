Support matrix for CDP Public Cloud Replication Manager
You can use Replication Manager or other alternate replication methods to replicate
        HDFS, Hive external tables, and HBase data between on-premises clusters (CDH clusters, CDP
        Private Cloud Base clusters, HDP clusters) and CDP Public Cloud (Amazon S3 and Microsoft
        Azure ADLS Gen2 (ABFS)) clusters. Replication Manager from HDP clusters to CDP Public Cloud
        Azure is a beta feature and is not available for general use.
noteBefore you create replication policies, you must verify whether
            the on-premises cluster versions are supported by Replication Manager, register the
            on-premises clusters as classic clusters in the Management Console, register the cloud
            account credentials in the Replication Manager service, verify cluster access, and
            configure minimum ports for replication.
See the other sections in this topic for the supported cluster and runtime
            versions.
Replication Manager provides the following functionalities that you can use to
            accomplish your data replication goals:
HDFS replication policies replicate HDFS data and metadata from:
on-premises clusters (CDH, CDP Private Cloud Base, and HDP) to
                            cloud storage. 
cloud storage to classic clusters (CDH or CDP Private Cloud
                            Base clusters). 
You can choose the frequency during policy creation to
                        replicate the data.
Hive replication policies support table-level replication and can replicate Hive
                    external tables from on-premises clusters (CDH and CDP Private Cloud Base) to
                    cloud storage and to Data Hubs. They also can:
replicate data stored in Hive tables, Hive metadata, data in
                            Hive metastore, and Impala metadata (catalog server metadata) associated
                            with Impala tables registered in the Hive metastore, andnoteHive2 managed tables are converted to external
                                tables after replication.
migrate Sentry permissions to Ranger.noteTo perform the Sentry policy replication, you
                                must be running the Sentry service on CDH 5.12 or higher, or any CDH
                                6.x version.You can choose the frequency during
                                policy creation to replicate the data.

HBase replication policies replicate HBase data from a source classic cluster
                    (CDH or CDP Private Cloud Base cluster), COD, or Data Hub to a target Data Hub
                    or COD cluster. You can also copy or replicate HBase data between different
                    environments within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using these policies. Table 1. Supported cluster and runtime versions for HBase replication

HBase replication policies replicate all the data from the specified
                        tables and then continue to replicate the changed data automatically without
                        user intervention.

noteAlternate replication methods:
Use the replication plugin for HBase data. For more information, see
                        COD replication in a Nutshell, Cloudera replication plugin, and HBase data replication. 
Contact Cloudera Support for Hive external tables.

Replicate data from CDP Private Cloud Base and CDP Public Cloud source clusters
Replication Manager replicates HDFS (CDP Private Cloud Base source clusters and CDP
        Public Cloud source clusters), Hive external tables (CDP Private Cloud Base source
        clusters), and HBase (CDP Private Cloud Base source clusters) data to CDP Public Cloud
        (Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure ADLS Gen2 (ABFS)) clusters. You can use the replication
        plugin as an alternate replication method to replicate HBase data for scenarios that are not
        supported by Replication Manager.

Replicate data from CDP Public Cloud source clusters
Consider the following limitations while using CDP Public Cloud source and CDP Public
                Cloud target clusters:
Replication across cross-cloud providers, that is from AWS to Azure and
                        vice-versa is not supported.
The source and target clusters must use the same account.

Replicate data from CDH and HDP source clusters
Replication Manager replicates HDFS data (CDH source clusters and HDP source
        clusters), Hive external tables (CDH source clusters), and HBase data (CDH 6 source
        clusters) to CDP Public Cloud (Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure ADLS Gen2 (ABFS)) clusters.
        Replication Manager from HDP clusters to CDP Public Cloud Azure is a beta feature and is not
        available for general use. You can use alternate methods to replicate Hive external tables
        and HBase data for scenarios that are not supported by Replication Manager.
