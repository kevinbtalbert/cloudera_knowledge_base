Creating HDFS replication policyCloudera Docs
Creating HDFS replication policy
After you register the classic clusters in Management Console and register the cloud
    credentials in CDP Public Cloud Replication Manager, you can create an HDFS replication policy
    to replicate HDFS data. An HDFS replication policy can replicate HDFS data from a classic
    cluster (CDH, CDP Private Cloud Base, and HDP clusters) to cloud storage, and from cloud storage
    to classic clusters (CDH or CDP Private Cloud Base clusters). You can replicate data on-premises
    to cloud storage account with a single cluster.
Ensure that the HDFS replication policy prerequisites are
      complete.

On the Management Console  > Replication Manager > Replication Policies page, click Add Policy.
The Create Replication Policy wizard appears.

On the General page, choose or enter the following
          information:

                        source data resides on the source cluster:
Enter the complete directory path.
Click File Browser to view and
                            navigate the existing directory list on the selected cluster. Select the
                            required directory that you want to replicate.



Run As Username (on source)
Optional. The replication policy uses the
                          Default username to replicate HDFS data. If you
                          are using a kerberized cluster, enter the required username. The
                          replication policy uses this username to replicate the data in the
                          kerberized cluster.

Description



Run Now
Starts to replicate the existing HDFS data after the replication policy
                    creation is complete. Choose the frequency to replicate data
                    periodically.


Schedule Run
Runs the replication policy to replicate data at a later time. Choose the
                    date and time for the first run, and then choose the frequency to replicate data
                      periodically.tipOn the
                        Replication Policies page, click 
                      to change the timezone.


Frequency

Choose one of the following options:

Does Not Repeat
Custom - In the Custom
                          Recurrence dialog box, choose the time, date, and the
                        frequency to run the policy.

noteEnsure that the frequency in a schedule enables a
                      job to finish before the next job starts. Also, ensure that the jobs based on
                      the same policy do not overlap. If a job is not completed before another job
                      starts, the second job does not run and the job status appears as
                        Skipped. If a job is consistently skipped, you might
                      need to modify the frequency of the job.

On the Additional Settings page, enter or choose the values as
          necessary:



Option
Description



YARN Queue Name
Enter the name of the YARN queue for the cluster to which the replication
                    job is submitted if you are using Capacity Scheduler queues to limit resource
                    consumption. The default value for this field is default.


Maximum Maps Slots
Set the maximum number of map tasks (simultaneous copies) per replication
                    job. The default value is 20.


Maximum Bandwidth
Adjust this setting so that each map task is throttled to consume only the
                    specified bandwidth.Each map task ((simultaneous copy) is restricted to
                      consume only the specified bandwidth. This is not always exact. The map
                      throttles back its bandwidth consumption during a copy in such a way that the
                      net bandwidth used tends towards the specified value. You can adjust this
                      setting so that each map task is throttled to consume only the specified
                      bandwidth so that the net bandwidth used tends towards the specified value.
                      The default value for the bandwidth is 100MB per second for each
                    mapper.


Path Exclusion
Enter one or more regular expressions separated by comma. Replication
                    Manager does not copy the subdirectories or files from the source that matches
                    one of the specified regular expressions to the target cluster.


Replication Strategy
Choose one of the following replication strategies to determine whether the
                    file replication tasks should be distributed among the mappers statically or
                    dynamically. 
Static distributes file replication tasks among the
                        mappers up front to achieve an uniform distribution based on the file sizes. 
Dynamic distributes the file replication tasks in
                        small sets to the mappers, and as each mapper completes its tasks, it
                        dynamically acquires and processes the next unallocated set of tasks. 
The default replication strategy is Dynamic.


MapReduce Service
Choose the MapReduce or YARN service to use.


Log Path
Enter an alternate path for the logs, if required.


Error Handling
Select the following options as necessary: 
Skip Checksum Checks
                        - Determines whether to skip checksum checks on the copied
                        files. If selected, checksums are not validated. Checksums are checked by
                        default. noteYou must skip checksum checks to
                          prevent replication failure due to non-matching checksums in the following
                          cases: 
Replications from an encrypted zone on the source cluster to an
                              encrypted zone on a destination cluster.
Replications from an encryption zone on the source cluster to an
                              unencrypted zone on the destination cluster.
Replications from an unencrypted zone on the source cluster to an
                              encrypted zone on the destination cluster.
Checksums are used for two purposes: 
To skip replication of files that have already been copied. If
                                Skip Checksum Checks is selected, the
                              replication job skips copying a file if the file lengths and
                              modification times are identical between the source and destination
                              clusters. Otherwise, the job copies the file from the source to the
                              destination.
To redundantly verify the integrity of data. However, checksums are
                              not required to guarantee accurate transfers between clusters. HDFS
                              data transfers are protected by checksums during transfer and storage
                              hardware also uses checksums to ensure that data is accurately stored.
                              These two mechanisms work together to validate the integrity of the
                              copied data.

Skip Listing Checksum Checks - Whether to skip
                        checksum check when comparing two files to determine whether they are same
                        or not. If skipped, the file size and last modified time are used to
                        determine if files are the same or not. Skipping the check improves
                        performance during the mapper phase. Note that if you select the
                          Skip Checksum Checks option, this check is also
                        skipped.
Abort on
                          Error - Whether to abort the job on an error. If selected,
                        files copied up to that point remain on the destination, but no additional
                        files are copied. Abort on Error is not selected by
                        default.
Abort on Snapshot Diff Failures - If a snapshot
                        diff fails during replication, the replication policy uses a complete copy
                        to replicate data. If you select this option, the policy aborts the
                        replication when it encounters an error instead.



Preserve
Choose the required options to preserve the block size, replication count,
                    permissions (including ACLs), and extended attributes (XAttrs) as they exist on
                    the source file system, or to use the settings as configured on the destination
                    file system. By default source system settings are preserved. When
                        Permission is selected, and both the source and
                      destination clusters support ACLs, replication preserves ACLs. Otherwise, ACLs
                      are not replicated. When Extended attributes is
                      selected, and both the source and destination clusters support extended
                      attributes, replication preserves them. (This option only displays when both
                      source and destination clusters support extended attributes.) If you
                      select one or more of the Preserve options and you are
                      replicating to S3 or ADLS, the values all of these items are saved in
                      metadata files on S3 or ADLS. When you replicate from S3 or ADLS to
                      HDFS, you can select which of these options you want to preserve.noteTo preserve permissions to HDFS, you must be running as
                      a superuser on the destination cluster. Use the Run As
                        Username option to set the username.


Delete Policy
Choose the required options to determine whether the files that were
                    deleted on the source should also be deleted from the destination directory.
                    This policy also determines the handling of files in the destination location
                    that are unrelated to the source. Options include: 
Keep Deleted Files - Retains the destination files
                        even when they no longer exist at the source. This is the default
                        option.
Delete to Trash - If the HDFS trash is enabled,
                        files are moved to the trash folder. This is not supported when replicating
                        to S3 or ADLS.
Delete Permanently - Uses the least amount of
                        space; use with caution.



Alerts
Choose the required options to generate alerts for various state changes in
                    the replication workflow. You can alert on failure, on start, on success, or
                    when the replication workflow is aborted.
