Updating Azure cloud credentials in Cloudera Manager
To register Azure credentials, you need an ADLS Gen2 storage account and a cloud Blob
        container with user credentials to use in Replication Manager service. The container has to
        have enough space for the replicated data and write permissions to copy the data. 

noteCurrently, registering Azure cloud credentials using the Replication
                Manager UI does not automatically create the same authorisation rules on the source
                Cloudera Manager cluster. When you plan to submit the replication policies with
                Azure as your cloud storage, it is recommended that you update cloud credentials in
                the source cluster Cloudera Manager. 


On the Cloudera Manager  > Administration > Azure Credentials  page for the source cluster instance , click Add AD
                        Service Principal.






Enter the name of the credential.

Enter the Client ID for the credential.

Provide the Client Secret Key for the credential.

Enter the Tenant Identity for the credential.

Click Add.
The Azure Cloud credentials are successfully registered with the
                    Cloudera Manager instance.



Create the required replication policy.
