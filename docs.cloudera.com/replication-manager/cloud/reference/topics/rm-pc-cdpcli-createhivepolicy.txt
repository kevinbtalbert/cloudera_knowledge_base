Creating Hive replication policy using CDP CLI
You can use CDP CLI to create an Hive replication policy. Only a non-machine user can
        run the "replicationmanager create-policy" CDP CLI command to create a replication
        policy.

Log into Replication Manager CDP CLI setup using the cdp --profile
                            [***profile-name***] replicationmanager
                    command.

List the clusters to verify whether the required clusters are available using
                    the cdp --profile [***profile-name***]
                        replicationmanager list-clusters command. 

Verify whether the required services are running on the source cluster using
                    the cdp --profile [***profile-name***]
                        replicationmanager list-cluster-service-statuses command.

Ensure that the cloud credentials are available using the cdp
                        --profile [***profile-name***] replicationmanager
                        list-all-credentials command. 

Create a policy definition JSON file.
To accomplish this task, perform the following steps:


Open a policy definition JSON file, or copy the output of the
                                cdp --profile [***profile_name***]
                                replicationmanager create-policy --generate-cli-skeleton
                            command to a JSON file to generate a policy definition JSON file.
For example, cdp --profile hive1 replicationmanager
                                create-policy --generate-cli-skeleton >
                            rm_hive1.json


Enter the required parameters.


Save the file.



noteRemove the key-value pairs that are not required in
                        the policy definition JSON file for the specific policy.


Run the cdp --profile [***profile_name***]
                        replicationmanager create-policy --cli-input-json [****policy
                            definition json file path using cat***]
 command to create the replication policy.

importantYou must use the
                            cat command to read the data from the policy
                        definition JSON file.
For example: cdp --profile local-dev replicationmanager
                            create-policy --cli-input-json “$(cat
                        temp/rm_hive1.json)”



Use one of the following methods to verify whether the replication policy
                is running as expected:
Run the cdp --profile
                                [***profile_name***] replicationmanager
                            list-policies command.
View the policy status on the Replication
                            Policies page in Replication Manager.



Related informationCreating Hive replication policy using Replication ManagerHive replication policy definition JSON fileThe policy definition JSON file contains all the parameters required to create a Hive         replication policy. When you edit the file to define a Hive replication policy, remove the         parameters that are not required for the replication policy.Managing Hive replication policies using CDP CLIYou can use CDP CLI to perform various actions on a replication policy. You can         suspend a running Hive replication policy job and then activate it. You can also delete a         replication policy.
