Prerequisites
To use CDP CLI commands for Replication Manager, ensure that the following
                are available:

CDP CLI client. For information about installing a CDP CLI client,
                        see Installing CDP CLI
                    client.
Access to CDP CLI. Choose one of the following methods to log into
                        CDP CLI:
Interactive method. This login method grants a 12-hour
                                access key to the CLI. For more information, see Logging into CLI/SDK.
Traditional method. In this method, you generate access
                                credentials and configure the
                                    ~/.cdp/credentials file with the key pair.
                                This login method allows you to withdraw the access permission by
                                removing the access credentials from the
                                    ~/.cdp/credentials file. For more
                                information, see Generating an API access
                                    key and Configuring CDP client with the
                                    API access key.
