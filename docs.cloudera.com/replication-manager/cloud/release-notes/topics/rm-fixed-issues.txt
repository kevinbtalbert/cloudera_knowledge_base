CDPSDX-2879: Ranger import fails when you create a Hive
                    replication policy for a medium duty Data Lake cluster
 When you create a Hive replication policy with the
                        Include Sentry Permissions with Metadata or
                        Skip URI Privileges option for a medium duty Data
                    Lake cluster, Ranger import fails. Before you choose the Include
                        Sentry Permissions with Metadata option for a Hive replication
                    policy for a medium duty Data Lake cluster, contact Cloudera
                        Support.


DMX-348: Export remote Hive Metastore step failed while
                    using Replication Manager 
While creating a replication policy with no Sentry
                    permissions for the source database/tables, with latest Data Lake clusters, an
                    error message appears The remote command failed with error message:
                        Command (HDFS replication (433)) has failed. 
 Make sure that while using CDH cluster(s), you do not use
                    MapReduce 1 service.


DMX-355: Currently, Replication Manager does not work
                    efficiently with high-frequency policies
Recommend using policy frequency which is greater than 30
                    minutes. 


DMX-364: Multiple instance of Replication Manager UI
                    displays as "In Progress"
 When the replication policy is scheduled with a specific
                    interval, it is seen from the UI that all the instances are "In
                        Progress" and one of the instances is failed.
Refresh the web browser and try again. 


DMX-391: Schedule Run option displays only "Does not
                    repeat" and "Custom" options
 Recommend to use "Does not repeat" or "Run now" option to
                    schedule the replication policy.


DMX-636: Inconsistency in the value of Timestamp Type
                    column when source ORC is replicated, and source and target clusters are in
                    different time zones
 From an Auto TLS source cluster, when a ORC table with
                    static data is replicated, the data in the Timestamp Type
                    column does not match in the target cluster.


DMX-666: Replication fails when the exception "connection
                    timed out" is not handled in Cloudera Manager
 Ensure there is connectivity between Source Cloudera
                    Manager and SDX CM. If the source hostname is not resolved to IP, add the host
                    mapping of Cloudera Manager host to /etc/hosts entries of SDX
                    CM.


OPSAPS-61288: Replication setup fails when a non-default
                    namespace is not created on the destination cluster
 Create a namespace on the destination cluster before you
                    create an HBase replication policy.


OPSAPS-61596: HBase policy returns "different schema" when
                    tables on source and destination clusters have the same column families
 This issue appears because HBase replication policies
                    handle tables that have table attributes incorrectly. Tables with table
                    attributes in replicated tables might lead to other errors as well.
Remove the table attributes for the HBase tables. 


OPSAPS-62910, OPSAPS-62948, OPSAPS-62956, and
                    OPSAPS-62998
 When you perform HBase replication policy creation,
                    policy update, or policy delete operations on multiple policies between the same
                    cluster pair at once, different failures appear. This is because the HBase peer
                    does not get synchronized during these operations as expected.
 Perform HBase replication policy creation, modification,
                    or deletion action one at a time on each HBase replication policy of a cluster
                    pair.


OPSAPS-62836
When the first HBase replication policy is created between
                    two clusters where the source cluster is an on-premises cluster, sometimes the
                    policy's status shows Waiting for 'Continue Setup' action
                        call for the first few seconds.
No user action is required. The status automatically
                    is updated to Configuring clusters after a few
                    seconds.


OPSAPS-62995
 The HBase replication policy first time setup fails when
                    the destination cluster is a Data Hub.
 This issue appears when the HBase classpath is not
                    configured automatically as expected.To resolve this issue, perform the
                        following steps in Cloudera Manager of the Data Hub before setting up an
                        HBase replication policy:

Navigate to the HBase service.

Search for the following Advanced Configuration
                                Snippet (Safety Valve) values, and add the key and value
                            as shown below:
HBase Service Environment Advanced
                                        Configuration Snippet (Safety
                                            Valve)Key:
                                        HBASE_CLASSPATHValue:
                                        HBASE_CLASSPATH="$HBASE_CLASSPATH:/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hbase-cdp-jars/"
HBase Client Environment Advanced
                                        Configuration Snippet (Safety
                                            Valve)Key:
                                        HBASE_CLASSPATHValue:
                                        HBASE_CLASSPATH="$HBASE_CLASSPATH:/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hbase-cdp-jars/"


Restart HBase service.




OPSAPS-63071
 HBase replication policies from on-premises (CDH5 and
                    CDH6) clusters fail when the source cluster Cloudera Manager version is
                    7.6.0.
 To resolve this issue, perform the following steps in the
                    source cluster Cloudera Manager before you create an HBase replication
                        policy:

Navigate to the HBase service.


Search for the following Advanced Configuration
                                    Snippet (Safety Valve) values, and add the key-value
                                pairs as shown below:

HBase Service Environment Advanced
                                        Configuration Snippet (Safety
                                            Valve)Key:
                                        HBASE_CLASSPATHValue:
                                            HBASE_CLASSPATH="$HBASE_CLASSPATH:[***location
                                            of HBase replication parcel jar
                                    file***]"
HBase Client Environment Advanced
                                        Configuration Snippet (Safety
                                            Valve)Key:
                                        HBASE_CLASSPATHValue:
                                            HBASE_CLASSPATH="$HBASE_CLASSPATH:[***location
                                            of HBase replication parcel jar
                                    file***]"

For example, the location of the HBase replication parcel
                                jar in your CDH source cluster might be
                                    /opt/cloudera/parcels/CLOUDERA_OPDB_REPLICATION-1.0-1.CLOUDERA_OPDB_REPLICATION5.14.4.p0.9261092/lib/


Restart HBase service.




OPSAPS-63138
 The HBase Replication First Time Setup
                    command runs successfully in the destination cluster though the Admin
                        Setup HBase replication subcommand fails on the source
                    cluster.


OPSAPS-63905
Replication Manager runs the
                        clone_snasphot command when restoring snapshots on
                    SFT-enabled clusters without setting the SFT attributes on the table.


OPSAPS-64034
When you delete an HBase replication policy, the HBase
                    peer used in the policy is also deleted if a replicated table name has the
                        - character. Note that the HBase peer is deleted even
                    when there are existing HBase replication policies using this peer. This issue
                    also occurs if a replicated table in any of the policies that uses this peer has
                    the - character in its name.


OPSAPS-65572
When you create an HBase replication policy between a
                    cluster pair where HBase policies between them are suspended (which also means
                    that the corresponding HBase peer is disabled), the HBase peer is enabled at the
                    end of the policy creation process which results in an inconsistent suspend
                    state for the suspended policies.
To resolve this issue, suspend the new policy after
                    policy creation to restore a consistent suspended state for all the HBase
                    replication policies between the cluster
                    pair.


OPSAPS-66305
If the snapshot export/import fails during HBase
                    replication policy creation, and then you choose the Actions > Retry Failed Snapshots option for the replication policy on the Replication
                        Policies page, the HBase peer is not enabled even if there were
                    no export/import failures during the retry action. In this scenario, the
                    replication peer in the HBase service remains disabled and the Retry
                        Failed Snapshots action fails.
Delete the replication policy and re-create
                    it.




OPSAPS-66988
You cannot create HBase replication policies if the target
                    CDP version is 7.2.16, 7.2.16.1, 7.2.16.2, or 7.2.16.3 and the source Cloudera
                    Manager version is 7.7.3 or lower, and the source Cloudera Manager API version
                    is v50 or higher.tipThe endpoint
                                http://[***cm_host***]:[***cm_port***]/api/version
                        shows the API version of the Cloudera
                    Manager.
