        Manager service.


DOCS-13504
When you create an HBase replication policy between a
                    source cluster using Cloudera Manager version is 7.6.0-patch5366 or higher and a
                    target cluster using Cloudera Manager version is 7.6.0 or lower, the first-time
                    setup is not initiated and the following misleading message appears during
                    policy creation:Skipping Replication Setup because it has already been
                            done.
To resolve this issue, upgrade the target cluster to
                    Cloudera Manager version to 7.6.0-patch5366 or higher.


DMX-489
With default replication configurations, small files
                    consuming more time to complete the replication process
You can increase the number of mappers to improve
                    the replication performance.


DMX-518
Hive replication policy fails when a table is dropped in
                    the source database (export tables) when the replication job is
                    running.


DMX-519
If snapshots on the
                        /user/hive/warehouse directory is not enabled, Hive
                    replication policy fails when inserts are done on a source table during
                    replication job run.
                    


DMX-521
While running Hive replication policy, if you drop a
                    table, it is not dropped on the target cluster. The data still remains and 'show
                    tables' displays the dropped table after successful replication
                    instances.


DMX-1455
An HBase replication policy from Cloudera Operational
                    Database COD to COD cluster fails if you select the Perform Initial
                        Snapshot option in the Create Replication
                        Policy wizard, and the source and destination COD clusters use
                    different AWS
                    accounts.


OPSAPS-64879
Replication policies with an empty name do not appear on
                    the Replication Policies page.
Provide a unique replication policy name during
                    replication policy creation.


OPSAPS-66303
A NullPointerException appears when you delete an HBase
                    replication policy for which the policy creation failed because a table in the
                    policy did not exist on the source cluster.
After the failed delete action (using the Actions > Delete option on the Replication Policies page),
                    select Actions > Force Delete to get the policy deleted.


DMX-2923
When you create an HBase replication policy with the
                        Perform Initial Snapshot option in a bi-directional
                    replication setup from the disaster recovery cluster to the production cluster,
                    the original table gets dropped and it is recreated with the content in the
                    disaster recovery cluster. Therefore, the original content of the table is lost. 
When you create the HBase replication policy in a
                    bi-directional replication setup from the disaster recovery cluster to the
                    production cluster, do not select the Perform Initial
                        Snapshot option.




OPSAPS-65573
HBase replication policy creation and the
                        Retry Failed Snapshots  option can be run
                    concurrently which is incorrect. 




OPSAPS-66327
The HBase peer can be created in the disabled state
                    in CDH 6.0 or higher clusters. However, HBase peer cannot be created in disabled
                    state in CDH 5 clusters and the peer remains enabled throughout the replication
                    setup process. As a workaround, you can create a ‘test’ HBase replication policy
                    with a small table in CDH 5 clusters. This creates the HBase
                    peer.




OPSAPS-66924
When the snapshot export fails during the HBase
                    replication policy job run, the target HBase folder in the destination Data Hub
                    or COD gets deleted. As a workaround, you can either revoke the delete
                        permission for the user, or ensure that you use an access key/role that does
                        not have delete permissions for the required storage component. For more
                        information on how to create an access key in AWS or Azure service
                        principal, see Target HBase folder is deleted when HBase
                            replication policy fails. 




OPSAPS-67042
Currently, when you create an HBase replication
                    policy for a table, a snapshot is created and then the replication scope is set
                    to “1”. Because of the order of steps, the data that is generated between
                    snapshot creation and setting the replication scope is not replicated.As a
                        workaround, you can set the replication scope of the tables on the source
                        cluster that you want to replicate to “1" and then create the HBase
                        replication policy.To configure the replication scope for a table on
                        the master cluster, run the “alter
                                [***table_name***], {NAME =>
                                [***column-family***], REPLICATION_SCOPE =>
                            1} command for each column family that must be replicated.
                            REPLICATION_SCOPE is a column-family level attribute,
                        where the value '0' means replication is disabled, and '1' means replication
                        is enabled.
