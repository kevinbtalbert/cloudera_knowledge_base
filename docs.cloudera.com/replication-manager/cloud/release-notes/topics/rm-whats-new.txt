Aug 29, 2023
This release of the Replication Manager service introduces the following new
        features.
Replicate HBase data in all the tables in a database
You can replicate HBase data (existing tables and future tables in a database) using
                the Select Source > Replicate Databases option during the HBase replication policy creation process. You can
                use this option only if the minimum target Cloudera Manager version is 7.11.0 and
                the minimum source cluster versions are CDH 5.16.2 (after you upgrade the source
                cluster Cloudera Manager), CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.6, or COD 7.2.17. 
 For more information, see HBase replication policy and Creating HBase replication policies.

Provide a unique replication policy name
You must provide a unique name to the replication policy during the
                replication policy creation process if the Cloudera Manager API version is 51 or
                higher. 
For other Cloudera Manager API versions, you can continue to use an
                existing replication policy with an empty name. However, if you edit the replication
                policy and provide a name for the replication policy, ensure that the name conforms
                to the validation rules.
For more information, see Managing HDFS replication policy, Managing Hive replication policy, or Managing HBase replication policy.

Load replication policies and their job history on the Replication Policies
                page
You can choose one of the following options to Load policies
                    faster by delaying to load their job history: 

Delay loading job history when history is too long
Always load job history
Never load job history

By default, the replication policies are loaded only partially on the
                    Replication Policies page, therefore the page might display
                incomplete statistics about a job status and replication policies with failed jobs
                might take a longer time to load. You can change the behavior depending on your
                requirements.
For more information, see Replication Policies page



June 26, 2023
This release of the Replication Manager service introduces the following new
        features.
HBase replication policy enhancements
You can view the HBase RegionServer metrics for a specific replication peer in
                Replication Manager. You can use these metrics to monitor HBase replication jobs and
                to find and diagnose issues with the HBase replication peer.
 For more information, see Graphical representation of HBase RegionServer
                    replication peer metrics

CDP CLI commands for Replication Manager
You can collect and download the diagnostic bundle, add ABFS and AWS cloud
                credentials to use in Replication Manager and delete credentials using CDP CLI
                commands.
For more information, see Adding cloud credentials in Replication Manager
                    using CDP CLI.
