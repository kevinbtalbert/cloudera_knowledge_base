This release of the Replication Manager service introduces the following new
        features.
Enhancements to HBase replication policies
The following enhancements are available for an HBase replication
                policy:


You do not need to create a schema similar to the source cluster on
                        the destination cluster.


Replication Manager performs the first-time setup configuration
                        steps which includes HBase service restart on both the clusters
                        automatically.


Optionally, you can also create or use an existing HBase
                        replication machine user during policy creation and then validate the
                        existing username with the UMS. The username and password is automatically
                        synchronized to the destination cluster’s environment (and to the source’s
                        as well if the source is Cloudera Operational Database (COD)).
