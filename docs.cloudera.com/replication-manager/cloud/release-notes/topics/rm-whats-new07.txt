This release of the Replication Manager service introduces the following new
        features.
Using CDP CLI for HDFS and Hive replication policies
The CDP CLI commands for Replication Manager are under the
                    replicationmanager CDP CLI option. 
You can create, suspend, activate, or delete HDFS and Hive replication policies using
                    create-policy, suspend-policy,
                    activate-policy, and delete-policy
                CDP CLI commands. You can also list the clusters, replication policies, service
                statuses, credentials, and get the credentials for a specific cluster using the
                    list-clusters, list-policies,
                    list-cluster-service-statuses,
                    list-all-credentials, and
                    get-credentials CDP CLI commands.
