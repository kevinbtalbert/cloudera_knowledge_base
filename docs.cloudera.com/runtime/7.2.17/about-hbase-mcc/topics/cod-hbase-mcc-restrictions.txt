HBase MCC Restrictions
HBase MCC contains a few restrictions when you are executing it in Spark compared to
  executing it in a standard Java application.
Only a single keytab can be used with Spark. In the Java implementation multiple UGIs can be
   called as long as a proper krb5.conf can connect easily to different
   clusters in different realms with multiple keytabs.
