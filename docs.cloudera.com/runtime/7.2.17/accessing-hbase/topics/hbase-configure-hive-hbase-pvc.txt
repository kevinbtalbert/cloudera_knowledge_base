Configure Hive to use with HBase
To use Hive with HBase, you must add the HBase service as a dependency to the Hive
        service in Cloudera Manager.
The following steps are applicable when both HBase and
            Hive are in the same cluster.

Go to Cloudera Manager.

Go to the Hive service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select the intended HBase service. For example, HBASE-1
                    as dependency under HBase Service.

Click Save Changes.
Repeat steps 2 to 5 for the HBase on Tez service.

Restart the Hive service.
Restart the Hive on Tez service, when applicable.
