Configure the HBase thrift server role
You must configure the Thrift Server Role to access certain features such as the Hue
        HBase browser.
The Thrift Server role is not added by default when you install HBase, but it is
            required before you can use certain other features such as the Hue HBase browser. To add
            the Thrift Server role:

Go to the HBase service.

Click the Instances tab.

Click the Add Role Instances button.

Select the host(s) where you want to add the Thrift Server role (you only need
                    one for Hue) and click Continue. The Thrift Server role
                    should appear in the instances list for the HBase server.

Select the Thrift Server role instance.

Select Actions for Selected >
                        Start.
