Adding Query Processor service to a cluster
The Query Processor service indexes Hive and Tez events and provides APIs to access
        them. It is required if you want to view the Queries tab (query history and query details)
        on the Hue Job Browser. 
You can either install the Query Processor service as a
            dependency while adding the Hue service or after adding the Hue service.

noteThis task is applicable only
                if you are upgrading to CDP 7.1.8 and higher. If you are upgrading to CDP 7.1.7 SP2,
                7.1.7 SP1, 7.1.7, or lower, then you can skip this task.


noteYou must be assigned the DataHubCreator role to perform
                this task.
This task assumes that you already have a PostgreSQL database installed on a host in
                your cluster.
Next, you need to create a database for the Query Processor service with the required
                roles. To create the Query Processor database:
SSH into your database host as a root user.
Start the psql terminal by entering the following command:
                        sudo -u postgres psql
Run the following statement while specifying the username, password, and a
                        database name for the Query Processor:
                        CREATE ROLE [***QP-USER***] WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '[***QP-PASSWORD***]';
ALTER ROLE [***QP-USER***] CREATEDB;
CREATE DATABASE [***QP-DATABASE***];
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE [***QP-DATABASE***] TO [***QP-USER***];



Log in to the CDP Management Console as an Administrator.

Go to your environment and click on CM UI to open
                    Cloudera Manager.

Go to Clusters >  > Add Service.

Select Query Processor on the Add Service to
                        Cluster page and click Continue.
The required dependencies are automatically selected.

Select the host on which you want to install the Query Processor by clicking
                        View By Host. Then click
                        Continue.

Select the database type, and specify the database hostname, database name, and
                    username and password to access the database on the Setup
                        Database page and click Test
                    Connection.
After the connection is verified, click
                    Continue.

On the Review Changes page, accept the default settings
                    and click Continue.
If 
                    Kerberos or Auto-TLS are set up on your Data Hub cluster, then
                    the corresponding settings are automatically configured.
The Command Details page is displayed, which shows the
                    status of the installation and configuration.

Click Continue if the operation is successful.

Click Finish on the Summary
                    page.

You are redirected to the Cloudera Manager home page. You
            can now see the Query Processor service listed within your cluster.
