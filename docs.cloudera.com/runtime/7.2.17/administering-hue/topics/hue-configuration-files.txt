Hue configuration files
Hue roles are configured with the following three configuration files: hue.ini,
    hue_safety_valve.ini, and hue_safety_valve_server.ini.
The hue.ini file is the first file that is auto-generated when you add the Hue service to
      your CDP cluster using Cloudera Manager. The hue_safety_valve.ini file is used to override
      bugs or configure properties that are missing from the Cloudera Manager UI. The
      hue_safety_valve_server.ini file is used to configure only the Hue role, and not the full Hue
      service (which includes the Hue Load Balancer). The hue_safety_valve_server.ini file is not
      used in practice.
Cloudera recommends that you do not edit the .ini files from the
      command line because they are stored in dynamic directories named by process ID and populated
      from the Cloudera Manager database. To add configurations that you cannot add directly from
      the Cloudera Manager UI, such as Authentication Backend for SAML, use the Hue
        Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini
      field under the Hue service configurations in Cloudera Manager.
Run the following command to view the .ini files per process
        ID:ls -ltr /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/`ls -valrt /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process | grep HUE_SERVER | tail -1 | awk '{print $9}'`Figure 1. Terminal showing Hue configuration files


The process directory for any given role is mirrored in Cloudera Manager. Go to Hue > Instances, select a role such as Hue Server, and then click the
        Processes tab.
