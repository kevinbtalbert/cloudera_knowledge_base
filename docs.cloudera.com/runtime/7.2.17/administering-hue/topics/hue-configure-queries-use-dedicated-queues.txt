Configurations for submitting a Hive query to a dedicated queue
When you run a Hive query from Hue or Beeline, HiveServer2 submits the query in YARN in
  the queue mapped from an end user instead of a hive user. If you run a query while specifying
  doAs=false, then the queries are submitted and run as a hive user, using impersonation. This is
  the default behaviour. You can change this behaviour by configuring the queue using
  "yarn_queue_manager" and "application tag" parameters in YARN.
If you see go to the Job Browser page in Hue and see that the Hive queries
   are appearing under the default queue, and not the actual user who ran the query, then this means
   that the queries are not being run in their dedicated queue in YARN. To submit a Hive query in
   its dedicated queue,
   you must enable
   application-tag based scheduling as described in Configuring queue mapping to use the user name from the
    application tag using Cloudera Manager and Configure Per Queue Properties.
