Customizing the Hue web interface
To customize the Hue web interface, add configuration properties
      in Cloudera Manager. You can customize the banner, the page logo, the cache timeout setting,
      and you can enable or disable anonymous usage data collection.
Adding a custom bannerYou can add a custom banner to the Hue web interface by adding your       custom HTML to the Top Banner Custom HTML property in Cloudera Manager.Changing the page logoYou can replace the Hue web interface logo with a custom log that is created with an     SVG code. Add any type of logo you want, but your custom logo should be designed to fit into a     160 x 40 pixel space.Setting the cache timeoutEnable Hue UI caching by setting a timeout value in milliseconds. The default is 10     days or 864000000 milliseconds. Set the timeout to 0 to disable caching.Enabling or disabling anonymous usage date collectionHue tracks anonymized pages and application versions to gather     information about application usage levels. The data collected does     not include hostnames or IDs. For example, the data collected has the format     /2.3.0/pig or /2.5.0/beeswax/execute.
