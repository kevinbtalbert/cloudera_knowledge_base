Disabling the share option in HueCloudera Docs
Disabling the share option in Hue
Hue allows you to share documents, queries, and workflows with other users, either
        for viewing only or viewing and modifying. Sharing is enabled by default in the
        Hue UI. For added privacy and control, you can disable sharing by setting the
            enable_sharing property to false in the Advanced Configuration Snippet. 
The sharing option is always available to the admin users. To
            disable the share option:

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                            hue_safety_valve.ini and set the value of the enable_sharing property
                    to false in the [desktop] section:

[desktop]
enable_sharing=false


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
