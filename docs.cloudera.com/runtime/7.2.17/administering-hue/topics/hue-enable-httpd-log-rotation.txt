Enabling httpd log rotation for Hue
Several log files, such as access logs and error logs, are produced by the Apache
        HTTP server. Over time, these files can grow in size and can cause disk issues. You can
        prevent this problem by using Apache's rotatelogs utility and defining when to rotate logs â€“
        either based on a time interval or maximum size of the log.

You can configure the Apache server to rotate the logs when a certain filesize is
                reached (for example, 5 Bytes or 10 KBytes) or at a set time interval (for example,
                daily or weekly), or both. If you want to specify both the time and size, the size
                must be specified after the time. Log rotation occurs whenever time or size limits
                are reached.
The log files are generated as per the configurations defined in the
                    httpd.conf file.

The rotatelogs utility must be present on your Operating
            System, and you must know its location so that you can use it. Run the following command
            from the Hue load balancer host system to get the path of the rotatelogs
            utility:[root@example-domain-hue-HUE_LOAD_BALANCER]# which rotatelogs
/usr/sbin/rotatelogs

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration.

Configure the log rotation policy based on your criteria in the Load
                        Balancer Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        httpd.conf field.
To rotate logs whenever the specific file size is reached, add the following
                    lines:CustomLog "|/usr/sbin/rotatelogs /var/log/hue-httpd/access_log.%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S [***FILE-SIZE***](B|K|M|G)" common
ErrorLog "|/usr/sbin/rotatelogs /var/log/hue-httpd/error_log.%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S [***FILE-SIZE***](B|K|M|G)"For
                    example:CustomLog "|/usr/sbin/rotatelogs /var/log/hue-httpd/access_log.%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S 5B" common
ErrorLog "|/usr/sbin/rotatelogs /var/log/hue-httpd/error_log.%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S 5B"This
                    configuration rotates the log file whenever it reaches a size of 5 bytes, and
                    the suffix to the log file name will be created with the format
                        access_log. YYYY-mm-dd-HH_MM_SS and
                        error_log.YYYY-mm-dd-HH_MM_SS.
To rotate logs daily, add the following
                    lines:CustomLog "|/usr/sbin/rotatelogs -l /var/log/hue-httpd/access_log.%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S 86400" common 
ErrorLog "|/usr/sbin/rotatelogs -l /var/log/hue-httpd/error_log.%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S  86400"This
                    creates the files /var/log/access_log.yyyy.mm.dd and
                        /var/log/error_log.yyyy.mm.dd where yyyy is the year,
                    mm is the month, and dd is the day of the month. The log operation switches to a
                    new file every day at midnight, local time.
