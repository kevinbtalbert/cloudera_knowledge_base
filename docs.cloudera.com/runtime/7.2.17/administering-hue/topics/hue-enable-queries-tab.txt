Enabling the Query Processor service in Hue
The Queries tab on Hue's Job Browser page allows you to view Hive query history and
        query details. You need to enable the Query Processor service from the Hue configurations to
        enable the Queries tab.

The Query Processor service is automatically enabled in Hue if you select it as a
                dependency on the Select Dependencies page while adding the Hue
                service to your cluster. But if you did not select it as a dependency while adding
                the Hue service, you can add the Query Processor service to your cluster (if not
                installed already) and then enable the Query Processor
                    Service option in Hue configurations.


Log in to the CDP Management Console as an Administrator.

Go to your environment and click on CM UI to open
                    Cloudera Manager.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration and select the Query Processor Service
                    option.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.

You can now view Hive query history and query details under the
                Queries tab on Hueâ€™s Job Browser
            page.
