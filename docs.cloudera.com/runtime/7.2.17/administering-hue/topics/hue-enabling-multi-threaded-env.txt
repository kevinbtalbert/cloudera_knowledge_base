Enabling a multi-threaded environment for Hue
A multi-threaded environment can help reduce the time it takes to migrate data from
        one database to other. By default,
        operations
        such as migrating data run on a single thread. For example, if you are switching from MySQL
        as the backend database for Hue to Oracle, then enabling a multi-threaded environment
        significantly reduces the data transfer time.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                            hue_safety_valve.ini.

Locate the [[database]] section under [desktop] and set
                        threaded to true:

[desktop]
[[database]]
options={"threaded":true}


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
