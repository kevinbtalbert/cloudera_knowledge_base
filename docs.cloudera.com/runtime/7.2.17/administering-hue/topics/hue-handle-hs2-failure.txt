Configuring Hue to handle HS2 failover
Hue can handle HiveServer2 (HS2) failovers using ZooKeeper without the need to set up
        a load balancer.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator. 

Go to Clusters > Hue > Configuration and add the following lines in the Hue Service
                        Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                    field:

[beeswax]
hive_discovery_hs2=true
hive_discovery_hiveserver2_znode=/hiveserver2


notehiveserver2 is the default value of the
                            hive_discovery_hiveserver2_znode property. If this
                        value is different from the Hive-On-Tez configuration, then you must obtain
                        the information from the hive.server2.zookeeper.namespace
                        property from Hive-On-Tez configuration. 


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
