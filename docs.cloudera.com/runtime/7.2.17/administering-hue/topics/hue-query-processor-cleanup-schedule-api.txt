Ways to clean up old queries from the Query Processor tables
Learn how to schedule a query clean-up and how to use the API to manually clean up
    queries from the following Query Processor tables: vertex_info, dag_details, dag_info,
    query_details, hive_query, tez_app_info.
Manually cleaning up queries using an API
The ability to clean up queries manually in addition to the scheduled clean-up routines is
        useful when you have a high load of queries in a particular week that are hogging resources
        that you must free up. The API also runs a VACUUM command on the Query Processor table to
        reclaim storage that is occupied by dead tuples.
You can send an API request using tools such as cURL or Postman.
API format:
     [***QUERY-PROCESSOR-ADDRESS***]/api/admin/cleanup/[***EPOCH-TIME***]
Where,
[***QUERY-PROCESSOR-ADDRESS***] is the query processor host address
[***EPOCH-TIME***] is the Unix epoch time in seconds

Queries that were run before the specified epoch time are purged.

    example:curl "http://machine1.company.com:30700/api/admin/cleanup/1670006742"
