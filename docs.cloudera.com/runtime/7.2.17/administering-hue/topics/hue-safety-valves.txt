Introduction to Hue Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety valves)
To customize and configure Hue properties, such as authentication or enabling S3 or
    ABFS browsers, and so on that you cannot directly configure from the Cloudera Manager UI, you
    can use the Advanced Configuration Snippet field under the Hue cluster configurations in
    Cloudera
    Manager.

Advanced safety valves
The field for hue_safety_valve.ini is service-wide and affects
      all Hue roles listed on the Instances tab. The field for
        hue_safety_valve_server.ini only affects Hue Server role
      instances.






Environment safety valves
Environment safety-valves let you configure environment
      variables across the service or for specific role instances. These safety-valves lack
      headers.
