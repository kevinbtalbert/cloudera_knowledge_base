Setting the cache timeout
Enable Hue UI caching by setting a timeout value in milliseconds. The default is 10
    days or 864000000 milliseconds. Set the timeout to 0 to disable caching.
When you browse tables using the left assist panel or run queries, Hue caches this
      information for fetching information faster and query autocompletion. You
        can configure the time for which you want to Hue to cache this information by setting the
        value of the cacheable_ttl property under the
          [desktop][[custom]] section in the Hue Service Advanced
          Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini configuration
        property in Cloudera Manager.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue > Configuration.

In the Search text box, type hue_safety_valve.ini to locate the
            Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
            hue_safety_valve.ini configuration parameter.

Add the following parameters with the cache timeout value to the Hue Service
            Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini
          configuration parameter:

[desktop]
[[custom]]
cacheable_ttl=[***VALUE-IN-MILLISECONDS***]
For example, the following configuration sets the cache timeout to the default value of
            86400000 milliseconds:
[desktop]
[[custom]]
cacheable_ttl=86400000
