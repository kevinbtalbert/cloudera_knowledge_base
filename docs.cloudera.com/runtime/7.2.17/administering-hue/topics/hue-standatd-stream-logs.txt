Standard stream logs
Cloudera Manager logs the start and stop of each supervised Hue process in standard
  stream logs (stdout.log, stderr.log).
When the Hue service restarts, Cloudera Manager generates a new directory for each supervised
   process of a Hue role
   instance:
ls -vrl /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process | grep HUE




It writes to a nested logs directory for each running instance: 



Configuration errors are written here because they prevent Hue servers and load balancers from
   starting properly. 

tipTesting the LDAP configuration from Cloudera Manager (Clusters > Hue service > Test LDAP Configuration) also writes to standard stream logs which you can search using the following
    command: ls -vrl /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process | grep ldaptest
