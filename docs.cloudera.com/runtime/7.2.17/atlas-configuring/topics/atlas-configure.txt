Configuring and Monitoring Atlas
Cloudera Manager manages Atlas as a service, including monitoring
    its health and collecting its logs. Use Cloudera Manager to configure
    additional health checks, set up extractors, and set other Atlas properties. 
Typically, you would need to make changes to Atlas configuration for the
      following reasons:
Expanding resources for the Atlas server. For example in CDP Data
          Center, the initial memory allocation for Atlas is 2 MB.
Changing Atlas security settings to add security levels or update
          parameters for Knox, LDAP, TLS, and Kerberos.
Updating Atlas for other environment changes such as log directory
          locations.

To start or stop metadata collection from a service, make the
      configuration change in the properties for that service.
Atlas collects metadata for services in a given cluster managed by
        Cloudera Manager. If Cloudera Manager manages more than one cluster, you
      may have multiple instances of Atlas, one in each cluster. When you check the health of Atlas or configure its properties, make
        sure you are working in the correct cluster.

Here are some of the Atlas operations you can perform from Cloudera
        Manager:

To understand if the Atlas UI is up and working for users,       check the health of the other services on which Atlas depends: HBase, Kafka, and Solr.Accessing Atlas logsYou can view and download Atlas logs through Cloudera     Manager.
