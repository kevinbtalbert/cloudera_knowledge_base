Prerequisites for HDFS lineage extraction
Before you start the extraction mechanism ensure you review the activities that need
        to be performed in Cloudera Manager.
You must enable the gateway role in Cloudera Manager. The following properties are
            visible in the Atlas configuration.

atlas.hdfs.lineage.blacklist.paths
atlas.hdfs.lineage.whitelist.paths

For example:
atlas.hdfs.lineage.blacklist.paths=/tmp/blacklist/./tmp/whitelist/blacklist/
atlas.hdfs.lineage.whitelist.paths=/tmp/whitelist/


Adding additional configuration
Before you commence the HDFS extraction, you must include the following
                properties in your Atlas setup to ensure that the HDFS entities reflect at the Atlas
                endpoint.


Set the following to atlas-application.properties manually
                            (NOT in Cloudera Manager) using the path:
                            /etc/atlas/conf/atlas-application.propertiesnoteThe user has to update the Atlas properties
                                (/etc/atlas/conf/atlas-application.properties) in
                            the Gateway node and run the extractor script from there. Any user who
                            is allowed or permitted or has the required access to publish messages
                            to Kafka can be used. For example: "atlas"

atlas.jaas.KafkaClient.option.keyTab
atlas.jaas.KafkaClient.option.principal



If you do not add these properties, the HDFS lineage entities do not
                reflect at the Atlas endpoint.
noteEntities created through Hook do not get consumed by Atlas
                    and are specifically observed while running the HDFS Lineage script. Once the
                    process to run the hdfs-lineage.sh script is completed, it is
                    seen that in a few instances the entity is not created in Atlas. This scenario
                    is observed on an intermittent basis and few entities are not viewed in Atlas.
                    In the case where this issue is observed, the publishing of messages to Kafka
                    topics consumes more than three seconds. This additional time consumption could
                    be because of:
Logging into Kerberos took more time to complete
Connecting to Kafka topic took more than three seconds
To overcome this scenario, the Async message processing
                        (atlas.notification.hook.asynchronous) must be disabled. You must
                    manually set this flag in
                        /etc/atlas/conf/atlas-application.properties to
                        false
