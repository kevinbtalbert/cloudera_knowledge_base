Extraction Prerequisites
Before you perform Atlas metadata extraction, you must understand the prerequisites
        of this feature, that includes the types of extraction.
Determine the Type of Extraction
Choose Running Bulk Extraction if you need to get the
                complete snapshot of the storage account, container or specific path (configured at
                allow list in extractor configuration file) metadata at Atlas. Normally recommended
                for the very first time.
Choose Running Incremental Extraction if you need to keep
                Atlas synchronized with the changes happening in ADLS. This takes more time to
                process the individual changes compared to bulk extraction. It needs to be run
                periodically if lineage has to be kept up to date. 
If incremental extractions need to be set up to run periodically, it can be
                done using your own scheduling tools or using crontabs. As you get familiar
                with the nature of changes within ADLS, viz. volume of changes and the speed of the
                extraction, you can determine the frequency with which to run the extractor.
For incremental extractions to function, you will need to set up Azure
                storage queues. Please see Configuring ADLS Gen2 Storage Queue for
                more details.

note The success of this operation is dependent on ensuring that the extraction is
                    done before the events are deleted from the ADLS queue.
