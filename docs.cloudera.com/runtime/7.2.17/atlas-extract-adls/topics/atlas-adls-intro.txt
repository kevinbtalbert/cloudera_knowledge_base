Introduction to Atlas ADLS Extractor
The Atlas metadata extractor, adls-extractor, for Azure Data Lake Storage is a
        stand-alone application that you can run on the Atlas host as needed to provide
        comprehensive metadata for data assets stored in ADLS Gen2.
The adls-extractor reads metadata relevant for Atlas
            from ADLS artifacts like blobs, directories, containers, storage accounts and publishes
            them to Atlas. 
In order for extraction to function, the following prerequisites must be
            met:

Determine the Type of Extraction
Updating Extractor Configuration with ADLS Authentication
Setting up Azure managed Identity for Extraction

 To perform the extraction follow Running ADLS Metadata Extractor.
Once the extraction process is completed, you must verify the data that has
            been published to Atlas. For more information, see Verifying Atlas for the extracted data.
