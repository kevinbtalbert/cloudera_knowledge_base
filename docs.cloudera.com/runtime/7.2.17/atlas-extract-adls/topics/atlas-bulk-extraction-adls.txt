Running Bulk Extraction
Bulk extraction mechanism employs direct calls on Azure API calls to fetch all blobs
        and containers in ADLS Gen2 storage account.
If there is a failure while extracting the complete Azure metadata, the bulk extraction
            must be resumed from the last checkpoint by changing
                atlas.adls.extraction.resume.from.progress.file=true configuration
            at adls.conf. 
The following command line example runs the bulk extraction. Assuming the mandatory
            properties are set in the default configuration file, only the parameter to enable bulk
            mode is required:
/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/atlas/extractors/bin/adls-extractor.sh
Or
/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/atlas/extractors/bin/adls-extractor.sh
                -e BULK



Refer to Extraction Configurationfor more details on different optional
            configurations.
