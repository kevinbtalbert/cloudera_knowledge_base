Configuration Parameter
Purpoose
Default Value



atlas.adls.extraction.account.name

Mandatory.


atlas.adls.extraction.account.key

ADLS account key if IDBroker is not
                                configured.

To be specified if Knox IDBroker is not
                            configured at CDP.

atlas.adls.extraction.allowlist.paths=abfs://<containername>@<accountname>.dfs.core.windows.net/<path>

Comma separated ABFS paths or patterns from which ADLS
                                metadata (directory, blob) needs to be extracted. Multiple values
                                can be configured by ',' separated.

adls_extractor_progress_file.props


atlas.adls.extraction.max.reconnect.count

IDBroker in case of
                                        credentials expiry.

atlas.adls.extraction.incremental.queueNames
Azure list of Account:QueueName which is
                                configured as part of Configuring ADLS Gen2 Storage Queue to get the

                                teststorageaccount:testqueue



atlas.adls.extraction.incremental.messagesPerRequest
The number of messages Incremental Extractor tries to fetch from ADLS
                            Queue in a single call. 
Default is 10. It ranges from 1 to 32.


atlas.adls.extraction.incremental.requestWaitTime
The wait time in seconds in a single call to ADLS Queue to fetch
                            atlas.adls.extraction.incremental.messagesPerRequest messages.
20


atlas.adls.extraction.incremental.max.retry
