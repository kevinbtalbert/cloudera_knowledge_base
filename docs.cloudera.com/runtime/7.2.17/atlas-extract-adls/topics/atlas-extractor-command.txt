Running ADLS Metadata Extractor
You must note about how you can run the ADLS Metadata Extractor.
The extractor script is located at: 
/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/atlas/extractors/bin/adls-extractor.sh
The configuration is located at:
/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/atlas/extractors/conf/adls.conf

noteThe extractor configuration file includes properties that require ADLS Gen2
                configuration values. Be sure to set those values in the configuration file before
                running the command.

Before running the extraction script, you must log in to Atlas using “atlas” user
            or a “root” user. 

noteEnsure that a valid Atlas Kerberos session is in place before
                running the script.
