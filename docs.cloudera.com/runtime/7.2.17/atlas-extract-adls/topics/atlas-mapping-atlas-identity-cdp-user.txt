Mapping Atlas Identity to CDP users
In order to use the created Managed Identity, a Atlas user must be mapped to the
        managed identity.
The option to add or modify these mappings is available in the
                Cloudera Manager UI.

Select Management Console under
                    Environments > click on an environment >
                    Actions > Manage Access >
                    IDBroker Mappings > Edit.
Under IDBroker Mappings, you can change the mappings of the
                Atlas user to managed identity. The user or group dropdown is prepopulated with CDP
                users and groups. On the right hand side, specify the Resource
                    ID (copied from the Azure Portal) for the Atlas user.

For example:

Cloudera Manager >
                    Configuration > Search for the user role and add
                    Knox
IDBroker Azure User Mapping information.
Restart the Knox service.


noteIf a user is mapped to multiple roles via group membership, the specific role to
                be used needs to be provided at runtime. If the user is mapped directly to a role,
                the direct mapping takes precedence over mapping via group membership. For
                information on how to specify the role, refer to Specifying a group when user belongs to multiple
                    groups .
