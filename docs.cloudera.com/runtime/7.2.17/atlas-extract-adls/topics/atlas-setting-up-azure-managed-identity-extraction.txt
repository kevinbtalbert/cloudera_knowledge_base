Setting up Azure managed Identity for Extraction
Once you have created and configured the storage account and setup the queue (for
        incremental extraction only), you must create the managed identities and later assign roles
        with specific scopes to these identities.

            create a new resource group that can act as a logical grouping of managed
            identities.
