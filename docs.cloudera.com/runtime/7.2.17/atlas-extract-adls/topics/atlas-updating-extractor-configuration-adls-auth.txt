Updating Extractor Configuration with ADLS Authentication
In the CDP environment Knox IDBroker is used for federated authentication. 
The extractor employs the Atlasâ€™ kerberized session to authenticate to
                Knox IDBroker. It receives the delegation token from
                IDBroker and uses it to request cloud credentials. No
            configuration change is necessary in this case.
To override this behaviour, the ADLS secret keys can be configured at:
/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/atlas/extractors/conf/adls.conf 
Default
Example: atlas.adls.extraction.account.key=<key>
