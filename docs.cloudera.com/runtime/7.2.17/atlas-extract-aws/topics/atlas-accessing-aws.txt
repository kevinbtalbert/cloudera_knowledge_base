Accessing AWS
Atlas is integrated with IDBroker for access to the AWS session credential using
    Kerberos credentials for the atlas service user. 
The Atlas S3 extractor authenticates with the service user and receives a delegation token
      fom IDBroker. The extractor uses the token to request AWS credentials. By default, this
      credential has a lifetime of seven days, which can be adjusted in Cloudera Manager by
      modifying the Knox configuration property IDBroker Knox Token TTL.
If IDBroker is not configured, you can provide AWS credentials (AWS access key and secret key
      or temporary security credential) on the extractor command line or in a configuration
      file.
