You need the following items to be set up for AWS before you can extract metadata from
    an S3 bucket:

AWS credentials

The account for this AWS credential must have appropriate permissions to read from
              S3 buckets and the configured SQS Queue. 
If you are using CDP in the cloud, these credentials are configured as part of SDX
              and there isn't anything extra you need to do.
If you are using CDP in a data center (installed on-premise or on virtual hardware
              in the cloud), you need to supply the extractor with AWS credentials. See Configure credentials for Atlas extraction.


S3 Bucket access policies

If you use a bucket other than the one specified by default when creating a CDP
              environment, you need to update the aws-cdp-bucket-access-policy with
              the additional bucket as a resource. See Minimal setup for cloud storage.


S3 Bucket encryption

 See AWS documentation "Amazon S3 default encryption for S3 buckets".
              Your choices for bucket and object encryption are transparent to Atlas as Atlas
              accesses the bucket through the authorized credentials you provide.


S3 Bucket event publication

If you intend to collect all activity that occurs on the data assets you are
              tracking, you should configure the buckets to publish, update and delete events. See
                To configure an S3 bucket to publish events.


SQS queue

Update an existing queue or configure a new one to pass S3 event information to
              Atlas. See To configure an SQS queue suitable for Atlas extraction.
