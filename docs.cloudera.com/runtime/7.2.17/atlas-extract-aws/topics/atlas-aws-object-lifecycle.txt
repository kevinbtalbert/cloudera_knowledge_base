AWS object lifecycle
Atlas can represent the lifecycle of a given S3 object when you use the incremental
    extractor to collect creation and deletion events from S3. 
To collect these events, you need to provide an existing SQS queue or create a new one and to
      configure your S3 bucket to publish the events to the queue. 

noteNote that when you configure Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies to
        automatically delete versions of objects or objects after an interval, S3 does not send
        event notifications and therefore Atlas will not reflect that these objects have been
        deleted.
