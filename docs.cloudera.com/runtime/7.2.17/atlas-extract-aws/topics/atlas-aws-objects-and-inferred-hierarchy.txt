AWS objects and inferred hierarchy
Atlas recreates the inferred hierarchy of objects in S3 by creating relationships among
    objects. 
Atlas creates entities for S3 objects following a file system path model. Virtual objects for
      intermediate directory names are ignored. For example,
        s3://sampleBucket/testDb/testTable/data.orc and
        s3://sampleBucket//testDb/testTable/data.orc are treated as the same.
