AWS S3 Contained
The S3 model includes two entity definitions that generalize the hierarchical relationship among the other entity types. Atlas does not generate entities of this type; it is used only as a supertype for other entity definitions. The "contained" relationship represents the one-to-one relationship between an object and its parent, either a directory or a bucket. The "container" entity type provides the opposite relationship: the one-to-many relationship between a bucket or directory and objects in the directory. 
The entity definition for aws_s3_v2_object inherits the attributes from the
      contained entity definition.
