AWS S3 Container
The S3 model includes two entity definitions that generalize the hierarchical relationship among the other entity types. Atlas does not generate entities of this type; it is used only as a supertype for other entity definitions. The "container" entity type includes a relationship that represents the one-to-many relationship between a directory and objects in the directory. The "contained" relationship looks the other way to represent the one-to-one relationship between an object and its parent, either a directory or a bucket. 
The entity definitions for aws_s3_v2_bucket and
        aws_s3_v2_directory inherit the attributes from the container entity
      definition.
