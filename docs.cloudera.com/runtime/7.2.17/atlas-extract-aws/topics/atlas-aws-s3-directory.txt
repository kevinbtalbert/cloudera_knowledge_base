AWS S3 DirectoryCloudera Docs
AWS S3 Directory
The Atlas entity type for "directory" metadata inherits attributes from the
      AWS_S3_V2_OBJECT entity type and includes additional attributes specific to
    object metadata. 



Identifier
Description



typeName
AWS_S3_V2_DIRECTORY


name
Name of the object as reported by S3.


description
Description provided in Atlas metadata. No value is collected from
                S3.


owner



ownerType
Not used.


qualifiedName
Fully qualified name of the directory object. The name includes
                Atlas's version of the S3 URI ending with a slash, followed by @cluster_name. For
                example: s3a://acme-finance-bucket/2018directory/@cm


region
AWS S3 region as reported by S3.


ownerName
Owner as reported by S3.


ownerID
Owner ID as reported by S3.


eTag
A hash of an object as reported by S3. This value is updated when a
                new version of an object is added to a bucket.


encryption
Encryption algorithm as reported by S3. If no directory-level
                encryption is specified, this value is the same as the bucket-level
                encryption.


awsTags
Object tags defined in S3. Atlas stores S3 tags as an array of
                key-value pairs.


storageLocation

relationship: contained
The relationship between a directory and an array of one or more
                objects, including other directories. 


relationship: container
The one-to-one relationship between a directory and its parent
                directory or bucket.




S3 relationshipsThe S3 model includes relationships that describe the perceived hierarchy among objects in a bucket. These relationships are created through "container" and "contained" relationship attributes.S3 entity audit entriesThe number of Atlas audits for S3 entities may vary based on whether or not you are using incremental extraction to collect metadata from S3. For example, if you run bulk extraction against a bucket, then objects in the bucket are updated twice before bulk extraction runs again, Atlas will show the creation audit event followed by a single update audit event. If instead you run bulk extraction against a bucket, then trigger incremental extraction, the Atlas audit will show the creation audit event followed by an update audit event for the first update and an update audit event for the second update.
