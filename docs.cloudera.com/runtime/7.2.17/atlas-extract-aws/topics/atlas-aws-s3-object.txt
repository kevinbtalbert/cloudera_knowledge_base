AWS S3 Object
Though AWS S3 includes both files and directories as objects, the Atlas model creates
    separate entity types for objects from directories. 
The Atlas entity type for object metadata inherits attributes from the
        AWS_S3_V2_BASE entity type and includes additional attributes specific to
      object metadata. Note that Atlas makes a distinction between files and directories. Atlas
      creates entities of this type for files; it creates entity types of
        AWS_S3_V2_DIRECTORY for directories.
