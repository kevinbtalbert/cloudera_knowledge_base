Configure credentials for Atlas extraction
When Atlas is running as part of SDX, you can skip this step but follow other
    instructions. 
The extractor is authenticated with AWS through integration with the IDBroker. To
      authenticate the extractor otherwise, you'll need to provide AWS credentials to the extractor,
      either through a configuration file or on the command line.

noteAny changes to the AWS credentials (for example, if you rotate credentials on a regular
        basis) must be for the same AWS account (IAM user). Changing the AWS credentials to those of
        a different IAM user results in errors from the Amazon Simple Queue Service (used
        transparently by Atlas).

Atlas can use either of the following authentication methods:

Basic credentials: AWS access key and secret key.
Temporary credentials: AWS session token along with access and
        secret key. See Getting Temporary Credentials with AWS
        STS.

Both methods require you to specify the region where the authentication is valid.

If the connection to AWS S3 expires, Atlas will retry X times to re-establish the
        connection. This property atlas.s3.extraction.max.reconnect.count controls the number of
          retries, which defaults to 2.
