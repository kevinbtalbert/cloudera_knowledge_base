Defining what assets to extract metadata for
By default, the Atlas S3 extractor collects metadata for all buckets that are visible
    through the active IAM policy.
You can specify the objects to include using configuration properties to include
      buckets, directory trees, and specific objects (whitelist.paths) or exclude buckets, directory
      trees, and specific objects (blacklist.paths). When you include a path in the whitelist, Atlas
      extracts metadata for that directory object and all objects underneath it. 
The include and exclude path lists are comma-separated lists of paths for any given
      bucket. Each item in the list can be as general as a bucket name or a directory path, or as
      specific as a low level directory or even a single object. The path names in the lists are
      formatted as S3 URIs, so it may be that they include repeated slash characters to represent
      virtual objects in S3.
If the same path ends up on both lists, the exclude list wins.
The following examples show how to include objects in or exclude objects from
      metadata collection.
This example includes a single file from the 2018 directory and all files in the
      data subdirectory for 2019 and 2020:
atlas.s3.extraction.whitelist.paths=s3a://acme-finance-set4/year-end/2018/data/storage/only-this-file.json,acme-finance-set4/year-end/2019/data,acme-finance-set4/year-end/2020/data
This example includes a single file from one bucket and all contents of a second
      bucket:
atlas.s3.extraction.whitelist.paths=s3a://demo-bucket/demo.txt,
        s3a://acme-finance-set4/
This example excludes specific files from a directory. If no include paths were
      given, only these files would be excluded from all the buckets available.
