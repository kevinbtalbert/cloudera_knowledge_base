Extraction Command
The extractor script is located in the extractors/bin directory in
      $ATLAS_HOME.
By default, the location is
        /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/atlas/extractors/bin/aws-s3-extractor.sh

noteThe extractor configuration file includes properties that require AWS S3 configuration
        values. Be sure to set those values in the configuration file before running the
        command.

Using the following command to start S3 extraction:

$ aws-s3-extractor.sh [--config <config file>]
                      [--extraction <mode>] 
                      [--failOnError]
                      [--logdir <log directory>]
