Logging Extractor Activity
The extractor produces a log file in the same location as the Atlas server log file.
        While the server log is available through Cloudera Manager, the extractor file is not. 
To locate the extractor log file.

SSH into the Atlas host.

Find the active Atlas configuration:

$ ps -ef | grep atlas.conf
In the output, look for the string
                        atlas.conf For example:
atlas.conf=/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/99-atlas-ATLAS_SERVER/conf


In the configuration directory you found in the previous step, read the
                        atlas-log4j.properties file.

Look for the log.dir entry. For example:
log.dir=/var/log/atlas


In the log directory, you'll see the extractor log file and the progress
                    file:



aws-s3-extractor.log
extractor_progress_file.log
