S3 actions that produce or update Atlas entities
As objects are created in S3, Atlas generates entities to represent those objects. Atlas does not create processes to represent S3 operations.
The following table lists the S3 actions that produce or update metadata in Atlas.

Yes





update



Yes (Bulk extraction updates entities only if the current bucket
                metadata differs from the metadata collected in the previous extractor run; interim
                changes are not captured.)
Yes





delete (No S3 event is produced to indicate that a bucket has been
                      deleted.)

Notable actions in S3 that do NOT produce metadata entities include any actions that affect only data and not metadata. Actions that do not create Atlas entities include:

Bucket deletion does not produce an event and is ignored by Atlas.
Events associated with subfolders when a folder is uploaded. When you upload a "folder" to S3, the objects in the folder are prefixed with the folder name, so the folder and any subfolders are not created as objects in S3. Atlas ignores metadata or events for subdirectories included in the uploaded folder; Atlas tracks metadata for the uploaded folder and the data asset objects in the uploaded folder.
Event notifications produced when a version other than the latest version is deleted.
