S3 entity audit entries
The number of Atlas audits for S3 entities may vary based on whether or not you are using incremental extraction to collect metadata from S3. For example, if you run bulk extraction against a bucket, then objects in the bucket are updated twice before bulk extraction runs again, Atlas will show the creation audit event followed by a single update audit event. If instead you run bulk extraction against a bucket, then trigger incremental extraction, the Atlas audit will show the creation audit event followed by an update audit event for the first update and an update audit event for the second update.
