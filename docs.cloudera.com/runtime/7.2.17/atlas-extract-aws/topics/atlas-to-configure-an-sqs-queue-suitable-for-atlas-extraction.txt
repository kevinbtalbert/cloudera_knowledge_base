To configure an SQS queue suitable for Atlas extraction
Use the following information to configure an SQS queue for Atlas
    extraction.
Prerequisite: You must add Amazon Resource
        Names (ARN) of the IAM role for the user / group configured under CDP. For more
      information, see Onboarding CDP users and groups for cloud storage.

 Log in to the AWS Management Console
          (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) with the AWS account (IAM user). Make sure
          that there are adequate privileges to administer the queue and the buckets involved in
          metadata extraction. 
Open the Simple Queue Service setup page and select
          Services > Application Integration >
          Simple Queue Service. 
Click Create New Queue or Get Started Now,
        if the region has no configured queues.
For each region that has Amazon S3 buckets, create a queue as follows:
Click Create Queue. Enter a Queue Name,
            name it, for example: aws-s3-cdp-atlas-events, click the
              Standard Queue (not FIFO), and next under configuration you
            must configure the queue using the following settings:Default Visibility Timeout =10
              minutesMessage Retention Period =14 daysDelivery Delay = 0
              secondsReceive Message Wait Time = 0 secondsMaximum message size = 256
              KB
Under Access Policy, choose method
              Advanced and insert the access policy similar to
              below:{
"Version": "2008-10-17",
"Id": "__default_policy_ID",
"Statement": [
{
“Xxxx”: "__owner_statement",
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": {
"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::00000000000:root"
},
"Action": "SQS:ReceiveMessage",
"Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-west-1:00000000000:aws-s3-cdp-atlas-events"
},
{
"xxxx": "__sender_statement",
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": {
"Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
},
"Action": "SQS:SendMessage",
"Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-west-1:00000000000:aws-s3-cdp-atlas-events"
}
]
}noteThe
              value above in the snippet arn:aws:iam::00000000000:root is the ARN
              for the AWS role mentioned as indicated in the prerequisite.
Configure at rest Encryption to meet your organization standards. In-transit
            encryption is configured automatically.
cautionDo NOT change other default configuration settings.

Click Create Queue.

 Repeat this process for each region that has Amazon S3 buckets.
