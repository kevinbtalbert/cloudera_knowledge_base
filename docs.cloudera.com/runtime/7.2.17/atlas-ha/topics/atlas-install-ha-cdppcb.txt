Installing Atlas in HA using CDP Private Cloud Base cluster
When you are using the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, you must install Atlas in HA
        using the Cloudera Manager UI. 

Log into Cloudera Manager and verify that
                        Atlas service is running.

Stop the Atlas service.

Go to Clusters > Select Atlas
                        >Instances > Add Role
                        Instances > Add Atlas Service role to the required host and
                    proceed with the wizard to complete the process.

Restart services for stale configurations.

noteCloudera recommends that the selected cluster in the Cloudera Manager must
                        be Kerberos enabled but it is not a mandatory
                        requirement.


Using the Cloudera Manager UI, verify that both Atlas services are running
                    (services are green).

The active Atlas instance can be found using a HTTP status request
                        to each Atlas instance:
http://<atlas_host_1>:3100/api/atlas/admin/status
http://<atlas_host_2>:3100/api/atlas/admin/status
The response for ACTIVE instance will
                            be:{"Status":"ACTIVE"} The response for PASSIVE
                        instance will be:{"Status":"PASSIVE"}

Atlas is currently running in the HA mode (active-passive
                    mode)
