Using the Hive shell
Using Hive, you can create an Iceberg table followed by using the CTAS command to
        alter or copy the existing Hive table and its properties into the Iceberg table. 
In this case, you create an external table and alter an existing Hive table to
            Iceberg table using the Hive engine. Run the following command in your Hive shell to
                create an Iceberg table.

create external table if not exists hive_ice_1 (CountryID int, CountryName
                    string, Capital         string, Population string) STORED BY ICEBERG STORED AS
                    PARQUET;

Navigate accordingly in the Atlas UI to view the changes.

                    process.












Run the following commands in your Hive shell to copy the contents
                        of one table (hive_ice_3) to another newly created table (hive_ice_4).



create external table if not exists hive_ice_3 (CountryID int,
                        CountryName string, Capital string, Population string) STORED BY ICEBERG
                        STORED AS PARQUET;


create external table if not exists hive_ice_4 STORED BY ICEBERG STORED
                        AS PARQUET as select * from hive_ice_3;
The following images provide information about copying contents from one table
                    to another.

                        PARQUET;


ALTER TABLEÂ  hive_ice_5 SET TBLPROPERTIES
                        ('storage_handler'='org.apache.iceberg.mr.hive.HiveIcebergStorageHandler');
