Using the Impala shell
Using Impala, you can create an Iceberg table followed by Schema evolution, partition
        specification, partition evolution and CTAS operation. 

Run the following command in your Impala shell to create a new Iceberg
                table


CREATE TABLE ice_t (i INT) STORED AS ICEBERG;

Navigate accordingly in the Atlas UI to view the changes.
The following images provide information about Iceberg table creation
                    process.


Run the following command in your Impala shell to create a scheme
                    evolution:

CREATE TABLE ice_t_2 (i INT) STORED AS ICEBERG;






Run the following command in your Impala shell to add a column to
                        the existing table (ice_t_2):


alter table ice_t_2 ADD COLUMNS (add_col_1 string );
Run the following command in your
                        Impala shell to create a partition specification.

CREATE TABLE ice_part_spec (s string , b string ) PARTITIONED BY SPEC
                    (truncate(3, s)) STORED AS ICEBERG ; 










Run the following command in your Impala shell to create a partition
                    evolution.

CREATE TABLE ice_p (i INT, d DATE, s STRING, t TIMESTAMP) PARTITIONED BY SPEC
                    (BUCKET(5, i), MONTH(d), TRUNCATE(3, s), HOUR(t))STORED AS ICEBERG;




Run the following command in your Impala shell to modify the
                        partition specification



ALTER TABLE ice_p SET PARTITION SPEC (VOID(i), VOID(d), TRUNCATE(3, s),
                    HOUR(t), i); 

Run the following commands in your Impala shell to create the contents of one
                    table (ice_t_3) to another table (ice_t_4).

CREATE TABLE ice_t_3 (i INT) STORED AS ICEBERG;

CREATE TABLE ice_t_4 STORED AS ICEBERG as select * from
                        ice_t_3;



The process is completed.
