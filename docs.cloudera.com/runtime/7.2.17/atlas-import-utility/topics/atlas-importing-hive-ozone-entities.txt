Using Atlas-Hive import utility with Ozone entities
The Atlas-Hive import script also supports creating the corresponding Ozone entities
        into Atlas, if the Hive entity has an Ozone path associated with it.
For example, if a table was created using an Ozone path, the Atlas-Hive import script
            creates Ozone related entities into Atlas.

noteIf a table was loaded using a file located into an Ozone path,
                Ozone entities will not be created into Atlas as HMS does not furnish the
                details.
