Adding attributes to Business Metadata
Business Metadata attributes allow you to extend the metadata for a
    given entity type. Create them in a Business Metadata collection from the
    Administration page.
importantAt this time, Atlas doesn't support searching on
      business metadata attributes that allow multiple entries (arrays).


       To access the Atlas Administration features, choose Administration from
          the user menu in the top right of the Atlas window.
        
        Users need administrator privileges to access the
        Administration panel features.
      
Open the Business Metadata tab.

For a new Business Metadata collection, you can add attributes when you
      define the Business Metadata collection. 



You can also add attributes to an existing Business Metadata
        collection.
