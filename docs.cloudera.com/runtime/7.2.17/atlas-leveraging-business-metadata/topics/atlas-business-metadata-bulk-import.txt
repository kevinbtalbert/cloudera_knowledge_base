Importing Business Metadata associations in bulk
After defining Business Metadata attributes, you can assign values
    to these attributes for individual entities in bulk by creating and
    importing a comma-separated values file, one row for each assigned attribute value.
To import business metadata attribute values:
Log into Atlas.
From the user menu, chose Bulk Import > Business Metadata > Download Import
          template to download a template for the bulk import file.
Fill in the template with the entity names and the attribute values you
        want to assign to the entities. Each line in the file assigns a value
          to one business metadata attribute on one entity. To assign the value
          for more than one business metadata attribute to an entity, include
          multiple lines in the file that refer to the same entity.

The value of the unique attribute that identifies the
                    entity. By default, the unique-attribute is
                      qualifiedName; however you can specify a
                    different unique attribute name in the optional field
                    EntityUniqueAttributeName (see below).

                    if EntityUniqueAttributeName is not set.

BusinessAttributeName
The name of the business metadata attribute to assign
                    to the entity. The name is in the form:

operations.itowner


BusinessAttributeValue
The business metadata attribute value to set for this
                    entity. The value must conform to the data type defined for
                    the attribute. Enclose the value in quotes if it includes
                    spaces or more than one value; use | to
                    separate values.

From the user menu, chose Bulk Import > Business Metadata > Import Business Metadata and select the file to upload.If a row in the input file does not import
          successfully, you will see an error in the UI; additional errors in the same import are
          not shown. Rows that are correct import even if you see an error for a row that does not
          import. If you see an error, fix the error and reimport the file. Rows that have already
          been successfully imported are reapplied without error. Note that if you provide a single
          entry for an array, the new value replaces all the values of the array. To see all the
          errors for a given import, look in the Atlas Server log.
