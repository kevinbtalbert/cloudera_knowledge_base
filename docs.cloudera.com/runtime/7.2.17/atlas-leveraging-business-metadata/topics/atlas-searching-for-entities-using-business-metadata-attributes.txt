Searching for entities using Business Metadata attributes
Because business metadata attributes are centrally defined and consistently 
      applied across entities, they provide an excellent framework for building an index of search 
      terms that reflect the terminology of your business users. You can add attribute values as 
      filters in Atlas searches.

After your organization has defined business metadata attributes and 
              data stewards have applied values to the attributes in Atlas entities, users can use the 
              attribute values for searching.


importantAt this time, the free-text search includes
            only string type Business
            Metadata attributes. 
            To search on business metadata attributes of other data
            types, use the attribute filter in Basic Search as shown here.
            Attributes that allow multiple string values (arrays) are not
            searchable in free-text or Basic search.



Select the type of entity you want to search for in the left
                navigation panel.

Click the filter icon.

Select the Business Metadata attribute to search for.

Form the filter criteria, using operators such as equal,
              contains, not null, etc.

Click Apply if you want to add more filters from the left
              navigator panel.

Click Search to apply this filter and run the search.

Entities with the attribute value appear in the search results.
