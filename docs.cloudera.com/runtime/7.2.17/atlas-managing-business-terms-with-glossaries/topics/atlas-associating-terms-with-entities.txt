Associating terms with entities
The value of terms comes with using them to identify data and data
    sets. You can associate terms with entities from search results and within
    an entity detail page.
When you associate a term with an entity, that entity is part of the
      group of entities returned when you search on the term. 
You can associate a term with an entity in the dashboard:

From an entity detail page:
        
          
From search results:
          

Both methods open a dialog box where you can search for the term or
      browse through the glossary hierarchy.
