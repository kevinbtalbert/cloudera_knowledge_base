Defining related terms
Can't agree on a single term among multiple organizations? Define
    two terms as synonyms so you can use either term to search for entities.
    Atlas provides many types of relationships to help data stewards build useful
    glossaries.
The glossary allows you to indicate relationships among terms. When you
      indicate a relationship, it is automatically added to the definition of
      the related term.
To create a relationship between two glossary terms, go to the detail
      page for one term, open the Related Terms tab, and add a term to the
      appropriate relationship type.

The relationship types are as follows:
