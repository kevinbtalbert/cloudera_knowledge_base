HBase actions that produce Atlas entities
As data assets are created in HBase, Atlas generates entities to
    represent those assets. Atlas does not create processes to represent HBase
    operations.
The following table lists the HBase actions that produce or
      update metadata in Atlas.

Notable actions in HBase that do NOT produce metadata entities include
      any actions that affect only data and not metadata. In addition, Atlas
      does not collect metadata for HBase columns. Actions that do not create
      Atlas entities include:

Truncate table
Put (cell value)]
Disable/enable table
