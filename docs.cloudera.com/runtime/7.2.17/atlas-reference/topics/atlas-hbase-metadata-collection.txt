HBase metadata collection
Atlas can collect metadata from HBase that describes the data
    assets HBase manages.
An Atlas hook runs in each HBase instance. This hook sends metadata to Atlas for 
      HBase data assets. HBase namespaces, tables, columns, and column families are 
      represented by entities in Atlas.


When an action occurs in the HBase instance...
The corresponding Atlas hook collects information for the action into
        metadata entities.
The hook publishes the metadata on a Kafka topic.
Atlas reads the message from the topic and determines what information
        will create new entities and what information updates existing
        entities.
Atlas creates and updates the appropriate entities.

The Atlas bridge for HBase pulls the same metadata as the hook, but
      instead of sending the metadata through Kafka, it passes message in bulk
      in an API call. The bridge creates entities in Atlas for all of the existing HBase namespaces, 
      tables, columns, and column families.

HBase actions that produce Atlas entitiesAs data assets are created in HBase, Atlas generates entities to     represent those assets. Atlas does not create processes to represent HBase     operations.HBase entities created in AtlasEach HBase data set entity in Atlas includes detailed metadata     collected from HBase. Hbase lineageAtlas collects lineage information for HBase data assets when HBase     tables are referenced in HiveServer or Impala operations.HBase audit entriesAtlas lists changes to metadata entities in the Audit tab in the     Dashboard.
