HiveServer entities created in Atlas
Each HiveServer entity in Atlas includes detailed metadata
    collected from Hive.
The following diagrams show a summary of the entities created in Atlas
      for Hive operations and assets. The supertypes that contribute attributes
      to the entity types are shaded.
