HiveServer lineage
Atlas collects metadata from HiveServer to represent the lineage
    among data assets.
The Atlas lineage graph shows the input and output processes that the current entity 
      participated in, specifically those relationships modeled as “inputToProcesses” and 
      “outputFromProcesses.” Entities are included if they were inputs to processes that lead 
      to the current entity or they are output from processes for which the current entity was an 
      input. HiveServer processes follow this pattern.
