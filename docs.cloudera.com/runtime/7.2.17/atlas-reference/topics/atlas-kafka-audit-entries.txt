Kafka audit entries
Atlas lists changes to metadata entities in the Audits tab in
        the Dashboard.
Atlas tracks the lifecycle of each Kafka entity, including its creation, update, and
            deletion. User access and actions that affect the data content of the source asset are
            not included in the audit.
