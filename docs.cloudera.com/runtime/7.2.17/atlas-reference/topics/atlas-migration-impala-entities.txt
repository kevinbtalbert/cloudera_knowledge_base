Impala entity metadata migration
Impala metadata entities are fully migrated from Navigator to
    Atlas.
The following sections describe how metadata is mapped from Navigator to
      Atlas; if Atlas requires metadata that wasn't available in Navigator, the
      migration notes describe how the Atlas metadata values are generated.
Migrated entities include:
    
Impala Process
Impala Column Lineage
Impala Process Execution

For entity metadata that is common to all entities, see System metadata migration.
Impala Process
Navigator impala_operation entities are migrated to Atlas
          impala_process entities.

Migration Notes



inputs
inputs
Points to the input entities as relationship
                attributes.


outputs
outputs
Points to the output entities as relationship
                attributes.


queryHash

Not used in Atlas.


queryText
attributes.queryText
Not used currently in Atlas (see Impala Process Execution).


sourceId

Not used in Atlas.

                entities, where each entity is noted by
                  <asset_qualifiedName>:<createTime> and
                entries are separated by colons, and an arrow shows the break
                between input and output entities. For example:
                dbblue.table_aqua@clustercolor:1589373411000->dbblue.table_teal@clustercolor:1589390050000

                attributes.


outputs
attributes.outputs
Points to the output column entities as relationship
                attributes.

originalName
attributes.qualifiedName
Generated as a string with the input entities, output
                entities, and target column name, where each entity is noted by

                entries are separated by colons, and an arrow shows the break
                between input and output entities. For example:
