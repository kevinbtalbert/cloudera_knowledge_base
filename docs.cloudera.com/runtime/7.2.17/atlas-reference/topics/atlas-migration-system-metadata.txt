System metadata migration
All migrated entities in Atlas include the same top-level metadata
    attributes, such as name, description, and creation time.
The following sections describe how Navigator "common" entity metadata is
      mapped to Atlas "system" metadata. If Atlas requires metadata that wasn't
      available in Navigator, the migration notes describe how the Atlas
      metadata values are generated.
