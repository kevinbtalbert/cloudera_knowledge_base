NiFi lineage
Atlas collects metadata from NiFi to represent the lineage among data assets in the
            Lineage tab.





The Atlas lineage graph shows the input and output processes that the current entity
            participated in, specifically those relationships modeled as “inputToProcesses”
            and “outputFromProcesses.” Entities are included if they are provided as an input
            to processes that lead to the current entity or they are output from processes for which
            the current entity is an input. NiFi processes follow this pattern.
