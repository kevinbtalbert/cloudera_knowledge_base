How the reporting task runs in a NiFi cluster
When the reporting task runs in a NiFi cluster, the following tasks are executed only
        by the primary node:


Create NiFi Atlas types in the Atlas type system.


Maintain NiFi flow structure and metadata in Atlas both which consists
                    of NiFi component entities such as 'nifi_flow', 'nifi_flow_path', and
                    'nifi_input(output)_port'.


Every node (including primary node) analyzes NiFi provenance events stored in a
            provenance event repository, to create lineage between 'nifi_flow_path' and other
            dataset (for example: Hive tables and HDFS path).
NiFi Atlas TypesThe reporting
                task creates the following NiFi specific types in Atlas Type system if these type
                definitions are not found.Green boxes represent sub-types of
                dataset and blue ones are sub-types of Process. Gray lines represent entity
                ownership. Red lines represent lineage.

Nifi_flow: Represents a NiFi data flow. As shown in the
                diagram, nifi_flow owns other nifi_component types. This owning relationship is
                defined by Atlas 'owned' constraint so that when a 'nifi_flow' entity is removed,
                all owned NiFi component entities are removed in a cascading manner.When the
                reporting task runs, it analyzes and traverses the entire flow structure, and
                creates NiFi component entities in Atlas. During later runs, it compares the current
                flow structure with the one stored in Atlas to figure out if any changes have been
                made since the last time the flow was reported. The reporting task updates NiFi
                component entities in Atlas if needed.NiFi components that are removed from a
                NiFi flow also get deleted from Atlas. However those entities can be seen in Atlas
                search results or lineage graphs because Atlas uses 'Soft Delete' by default.
Attributes:
qualifiedName: Root ProcessGroup ID@namespace (For example,
                            86420a14-2fab-3e1e-4331-fb6ab42f58e0@ns1)
name: Name of the Root ProcessGroup.
url: URL of the NiFi instance. This can be specified using the
                            reporting task 'NiFi URL for Atlas' property.

Nifi_flow_path: Part of a NiFi data flow containing one or
            more processing NiFi components such as Processors and RemoteGroupPorts. The reporting
            task divides a NiFi flow into multiple flow paths. 
Attributes:
qualifiedName: The first NiFi component Id in a path@namespace
                            (for example: 529e6722-9b49-3b66-9c94-00da9863ca2d@ns1)
name: NiFi component names within a path are concatenated (for
                            example: GenerateFlowFile, PutFile, LogAttribute)
url: A deep link to the first NiFi component in corresponding
                            NiFi UI

nifi_input/output_port: Represents a RootGroupPort which can
            be accessed by RemoteProcessGroup through Site-to-Site protocol.
Attributes:
qualifiedName: Port ID@namespace (for example:
                            3f6d405e-6e3d-38c9-c5af-ce158f8e593d@ns1)
name: Name of the Port.

Nifi_data: Represents unknown datasets created by
                CREATE/SEND/RECEIVE NiFi provenance events that do not have a particular provenance
                event analyzer.
Attributes:
qualifiedName: ID of a Processor which generated the provenance
                            event@namespace (for example:
                            db8bb12c-5cd3-3011-c971-579f460ebedf@ns1)
name: Name of the Processor.

Nifi_queue: An internal dataset of NiFi flows which
                connects nifi_flow_paths. Atlas lineage graph requires a dataset in between Process
                entities.
Attributes:
qualifiedName: ID of the first Processor in the destination
                            nifi_flow_path.
name: Name of the Processor.
