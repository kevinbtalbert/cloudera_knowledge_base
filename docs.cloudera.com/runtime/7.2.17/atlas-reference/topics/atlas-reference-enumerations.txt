Defining Apache Atlas enumerations
Atlas lets you define enumerations to use as attribute values.
Enumerations are a top-level objects in the Atlas data model. They can be
    used to standardize values available for users to select when assigning
    Business Metadata attributes to entities.
Users need administrator privileges to create or update enumerations.
To define enumerations:  
Log in to Atlas.

       To access the Atlas Administration features, choose Administration from
          the user menu in the top right of the Atlas window.
        
        Users need administrator privileges to access the
        Administration panel features.
      
Go to the Enumerations tab.
Enter the name of the new enumeration and select it in the
            list.Enumeration names must start with a letter and can include
            letters, numbers, spaces, and underscores.
Enter the enumeration values, separating each value by pressing
            Enter.Enumeration values are stored as strings and can include
            UTF-8 characters including spaces.
Click Update.

The enumeration is now available to be used as the type for Business
      Metadata attributes.
If the enumeration name or values don't meet the requirements, you'll see
      an error in the top right corner of the Atlas UI.
