Schema Registry actions that produce Atlas entities
Once the Schema Registry application is integrated with Atlas, entities are created
        in Atlas to represent the metadata.
The following table shows a summary of the entities created in Atlas to
            represent the metadata.


Atlas Entity
Description


Schema metadata
Contains the properties of a schema.


Schema version
A schema can have one or more versions. They are all
                            connected to one metadata.


Kafka topic
If a Kafka topic exists and the Atlas-Kafka integration is
                            enabled, then a topic entity is created. When a schema is created with
                            the same name as the topic then a relationship is created between
                            them.
