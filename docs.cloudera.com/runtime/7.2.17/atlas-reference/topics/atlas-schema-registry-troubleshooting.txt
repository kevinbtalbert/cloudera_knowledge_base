Troubleshooting Schema Registry
What do you do if you are not able to view Atlas metadata from Schema
        Registry?
Mirroring schemas from Schema Registry to Atlas is done by an asynchronous
            process. When a schema or schema version is created, the information about this event is
            generally stored in the database table atlas_events. When an
            event has been processed, its status will be updated to either success or failure.
Mirroring a schema to Atlas can fail for multiple reasons but not limited to the
            following:


Atlas may be down


Network connection failure


If you have analyzed the problem and can fix it by “replaying” the event, you
            must update the table and set the failure flag to false. In this
            case, the event will be picked up again and processed once again.
The SQL format to perform the above:
update atlas_events set processed=0, failed=0 where id = <event
            id>
