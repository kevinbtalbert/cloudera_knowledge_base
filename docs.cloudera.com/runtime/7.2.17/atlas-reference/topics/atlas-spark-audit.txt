Spark audit entries
Atlas lists changes to metadata entities in the Audit tab in the
    Dashboard.
Atlas tracks the lifecycle of each Spark entity, including its creation,
      update, and deletion. Note that if you change the name of an application
      in Atlas, the change will cause each related Spark process entity to be
      updated. User access and actions that affect the data content of the
      source asset are not included in the audit.
