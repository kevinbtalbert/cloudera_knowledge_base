Understanding the data that flow into Atlas
The reporting task stores two types of NiFi flow information.


NiFi flow structure


NiFi data lineage


'NiFi flow structure' indicates what components are running within a NiFi flow
            and how these are connected. It is reported by analyzing current NiFi flow structure,
            specifically NiFi component relationships.
'NiFi data lineage' indicates what part of NiFi flow interacts with different
            datasets such as HDFS files or Hive tables. It is reported by analyzing NiFi provenance
            events.
