Ability to download search results from Atlas UI
Atlas supports improved search results capabilities.You can download search results for
  both basic and advanced search options. You can configure the parameters to specify a directory
  path and configure automatic cleaning up of files to manage space efficiently.
You can use the new Download option to capture the search results of both Basic and Advanced
   (DSL) searches, in CSV file format. The CSV files are stored on the local file system. This
   download option queues up the search results and downloads the files in the following format:
   User type_type_of_search_timestamp. For example: admin_DSL_2023-04-29_04-56.csv indicates that
   the file contains results of search performed using the advanced search option. 
Atlas employs the API path to route the requests to queue up the search results and
   later convert them to CSV files. The following are commonly used for the search and download
   operations.

/atlas/v2/search/<basic/dsl>/download/create_file
/atlas/v2/search/download/status - Status API
/atlas/v2/search/download/{filename} - Download request API

Search results configuration
You can configure the search result size The default value of search result size is
    10000 and only 50 simultaneous requests can be done. You can configure the search request using
    the atlas.download.search.max.pending.tasks property.
You can configure the parameters in such a way that the downloaded CSV files are
    available in a specified directory path for a fixed time period and they are automatically
    cleaned up to free up the storage space. You can search for specific type definitions in Atlas
    and download them as appropriate.
The following APIs can be used to manage the download options and can be included in
    the Configuration tab in the Cloudera Manager instance under Atlas Server
     Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
     conf/atlas-application.properties.
atlas.download.search.dir.path - Use this parameter to define
      the path for storing the downloaded CSVs. 
atlas.download.search.file.expiry.millis - Use this parameter to
      set the time limit for the downloaded file to live in the storage. As an example: 180000
      milliseconds → 3 minutes.

noteFor every logged in user, a separate directory is created
    automatically under the path defined by the atlas.download.search.dir.path property and the
    user’s requested search files are stored in that directory. Users can only download files
    created by them using UI / API.
