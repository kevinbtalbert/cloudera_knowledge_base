Using Relationship search
Entities in Atlas can be searched based on the relationships that describe various
  metadata between a couple of entity end-points.
As an example, a relationship between entities hive_table1 and hive_db1 can be
   attributed or defined as hive_table1_db1, which has a standalone metadata that can be
   added as an attribute to this format. By searching for hive_table1_db1, you can retrieve
   the relationship between hive_table1 and hive_db1 entities. This enhancement ensures that those
   relationships which are tied to the entities and that match the filter criteria on attributes of
   the relationships, can be searched.
Configuring relationship search
For the entities to be searchable in the relationship definition model before
   starting the Atlas service, the attributes must be added and marked as indexable. 
As an example configuration setup:
{
“attributeDefs”: [{
“Name”: “edge_property1”,
“typeName”: “string”,
“isIndexable”: true
}]
In Atlas, when you commence search using the relationship option, you can use the
   toggle button to enable the same.



You can search for the relationship using the drop-down list to select a relationship
   between entities and explore them in Atlas.



The list of entities with the type “user_post” contains additional information
   about the connected entities.



You can add specific filters to search for relationship entities.



In the example image, end 1 and end 2 are the entities with which the
   relationship is created.



By clicking on each search result you can navigate to the details page to view
   additional details and pertinent information.
