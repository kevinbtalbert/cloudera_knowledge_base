How to configure Kerberos Authentication for Apache Atlas
noteIn CDP Cloud, authentication is configured through Free IPA, which
      uses Kerberos to secure user identities in the environment. There is no
      need to manually configure authentication settings for Atlas. For more
      information, see "Managing user access and authorization" in the CDP Cloud
      Management Console documentation.
Kerberos authentication for Apache Atlas is automatically configured
        when you use Cloudera Manager to enable Kerberos authentication for the
        cluster (typically using the Cloudera Manager Kerberos Wizard).
A prerequisite for using Kerberos authentication is that your cluster
        is configured for TLS/SSL encryption. There are Atlas-specific steps to
        complete to enable TLS for Atlas.
Enabling Atlas log in via browser using kerberos keytab
To enable Atlas to log in using the kerberos keytab, you need to set the value of the
        property
          atlas.authentication.method.kerberos.support.keytab.browser.login=true
        in the Safety Valve on Cloudera Manager.
noteIt is not recommended to use this authentication to log in through the browser. Instead
        use the Knox trusted proxy to access Atlas UI with Kerberos identity.
