Associating classifications with entities
Assign classifications to entities in the entity detail page or in
    the search results.
There are two ways to associate a classification with an entity:

Add the classification to the entity in the entity detail page. 
Add the classification to the entity in the search results. 

When you associate a classification with an entity, you can set the
      classification’s behavior with these controls:


Propagate: Any entities in the impact chain of
        this entity will automatically be tagged with this classification. The
        classification can’t be removed from the “downstream” entities without
        being removed from this source entity. See more at Propagate
        classifications to derived entities.
Apply validity period: You can set a time
        period after which this classification is removed from the entity. Set
        the start time or end time or both. If you do not choose a time zone,
        the local time of the Atlas server is used.
Remove propagation on entity delete: When an
        entity is deleted in the source and marked as deleted in Atlas, you can
        choose to maintain the propagation path, or to break propagation at the
        deleted entity. 

You can change the behavior of classifications after they are assigned:
      go to the Classifications tab for an entity.
You can remove classifications from an entity using the X button on
      search results or entity detail page. Don't see an X on the classification
      name? That classification was assigned through propagation; to remove it,
      you have to turn off propagation for the source entity or term.
