Propagating classifications through lineage
Classifications on table columns can automatically apply to other
    tables where the same data is found when the data transformations are
    captured in lineage.
Viewing propagated classifications
When you look at the classifications assign to an entity, you can see
      which classifications where originally assigned to this entity and which
      were propagated here through lineage. From the Classifications tab, you
      can:
Show or hide propagated classifications (Show Propagated
        Classifications button)
Navigate to the
          original entity where a classification was assigned (Propagated
            From button)
Navigate to the source of the classification 


Setting propagation behavior
You can set propagation for a classification when you create the
      classification or in the lineage for an entity where the classification is
      assigned:

Set propagation at the time when the classification is associated with an
      entity or term. 
    
Set propagation at a specific point in the lineage.
