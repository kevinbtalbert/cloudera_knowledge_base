Searching for entities using classifications
After you tag entities with classifications, it's very easy to
    search for the entities.
The Atlas dashboard makes it easy to find entities that you've tagged
      with classifications: in the left navigation pane, go to the
      Classification tab and select the classification you want. You can refine
      your search results by adding criteria on the Search tab (Basic
      search).
