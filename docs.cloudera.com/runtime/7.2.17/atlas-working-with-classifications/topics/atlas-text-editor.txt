Text-editor for Atlas parameters
In Atlas, while creating Classification, Glossary, and Business
   metadata, a new text editor is available, which can also be used for adding and customizing
  string attribute values of Business metadata on the Entity details page.
On the Atlas entities details page, when you add the business metadata and select the
   attribute type as “String”, you can view a text editor with which you can customize content /
   description that is entered.

important While adding a Business metadata attribute, you
    MUST select the “Type” as “String”. If you do not fulfill this criteria, you cannot add
    formatting to the value of the attribute using the text-editor on the Entity details page under
    the Business metadata tab.







Note that while creating and editing Glossary, Term, and Category, the text editor is
   available only for the Long Description field. For creating and editing Business Metadata
   and Classification, text editor is available only for the Description field.
