Validations for parent types
In Atlas, validations for scenarios where multiple parent types are involved for both
  entity types as well as Classifications.

noteThese validations are also applicable for the Classification
    types.

Use case 1: When there are two types having same name
   attributes, these two types cannot be assigned as parent-types to a child type. If a user tries
   to create such a child type, Atlas service does not allow it to create child type and raises an
   exception.
As an example:
Suppose two types "MyType01" and "MyType02" have a common attribute
    "attributeA".
A user tries to create a "ChildType" type by assigning both types
    "MyType01" and "MyType02" as its parents. Atlas service does not allow creation of
    "ChildType" because both parent types have the same name attribute.
Use case 2: A child type cannot be updated as a child of two
   parent types which have the same name attribute. If a user tries to update such a child type,
   Atlas service does not allow that and raises an exception.
As an example:
Suppose a type "ParentType01" has attribute "attributeA" and its child
   type is "ChildType". Also, another independent type "MyType02" which has the
   attribute "attributeA". The user wants to update the "ChildType" and tries to make
   it a child of "MyType02". Atlas service does not allow updating "ChildType",
   because both parent types have the same name attribute.
