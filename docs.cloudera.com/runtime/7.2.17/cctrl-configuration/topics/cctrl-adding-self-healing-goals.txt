Adding self-healing goals to Cruise Control in Cloudera Manager
As self-healing is enabled by default for Cruise Control, you only need to specify
        the actions Cruise Control should take when detecting anomaly types by providing
        self-healing goals in Cloudera Manager.

Access Cloudera Manager for the Cruise Control configurations.


Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where you have created your
                cluster.


Select the Streams Messaging cluster from the list of Data
                Hub clusters.


Select Cloudera Manager from the services.


Select Clusters > Cruise Control.


Click Configuration.



Search for Self-Healing Goals.

Add the required self-healing goals to the corresponding field.

Click Save changes.

Click on Action > Restart next to the Cruise Control service name to restart Cruise
                    Control.
