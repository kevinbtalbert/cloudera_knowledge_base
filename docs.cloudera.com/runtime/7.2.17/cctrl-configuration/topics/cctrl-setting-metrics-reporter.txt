Configuring Metrics Reporter in Cruise Control
You can choose between using the default Cruise Control Metrics Reporter or using the
        Cloudera Manager Metrics Reporter for fetching metrics in Cruise Control. Cloudera
        recommends using the Cloudera Manager solution with light installation, and the default
        solution with heavy installations of Kafka deployments. 

Access Cloudera Manager for the Cruise Control configurations.


Navigate to Management Console > Environments, and select the environment where you have created your
                cluster.


Select the Streams Messaging cluster from the list of Data
                Hub clusters.


Select Cloudera Manager from the services.


Select Clusters > Cruise Control.


Click Configuration.



Search for Metrics Reporter.

Select CM metrics reporter or Cruise Control metrics reporter based on your
                    requirements.

Click Save changes.

Click on Action > Restart next to the Cruise Control service name to restart Cruise
                    Control.
