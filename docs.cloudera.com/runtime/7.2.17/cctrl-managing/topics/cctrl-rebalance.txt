Rebalancing with Cruise Control
In CDP Public Cloud, when you scale your Kafka nodes that are
            running in your Data Hub clusters, Cruise Control is responsible for rebalancing the
            partitions based on the goals previously set.
When using the scaling functionality of Data Hub, you can set
            the number of Kafka nodes that you want to add or you want to remove, and the partition
            rebalancing is automatically completed in the background with Cruise Control. You do not
            need to manually initiate the rebalancing process after managing the Kafka brokers, as
            the Resize action in Data Hub does this automatically.
For more information, see the Scaling Kafka broker nodes in
                a Streams Messaging cluster documentation.
