Propagation of tags as deferred actions
You can enable the propagation of tags as deferred action (or in asynchronous
        manner).
You must set this property atlas.tasks.enabled  = true. By default, this
            is disabled. You can set the this property in Cloudera Manager
            under Atlas Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
            for conf/atlas-application.properties.



While the background task is processing the tag propagation request, you can view the
            notification of propagation of tags in the Atlas UI on the
                Entities details page. The Task tab
            displays the progress of this request.
