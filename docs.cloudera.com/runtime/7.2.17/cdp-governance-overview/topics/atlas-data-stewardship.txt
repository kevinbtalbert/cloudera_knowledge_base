Data Stewardship with Apache Atlas
Concepts for collecting, creating, and using metadata.
The value of Atlas metadata for organizing and finding data increases
      when you augment the generated “technical” metadata by using your
      organization's business vocabulary. Here’s how you would do that:
Tools. You can add metadata to entities using labels, classifications, attributes, and a
        glossary of terms. The glossary allows you to identify synonyms so that the vocabulary from
        different teams does not get in the way of identifying the same data.
Planning. Figure out who and how to apply the tools; set up an overall plan for
        what kinds of metadata you want to apply, design some conventions for how to apply them and
        who can apply them. Design some processes to oversee metadata as it collects to make sure
        the results are consistent and useful; identify synonyms and antonyms.
Examples. This document includes examples of ways you can organize your metadata; 
        strategies that describe how to optimize for specific use cases.
