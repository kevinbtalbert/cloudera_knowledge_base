Authorization
 Authorization is a basic security requirement in a digital environment.
Authorization controls what users can and cannot access within a system. These
   permissions include viewing, editing, using, or controlling information. In a physical
   environment, this can also include accessing servers, rooms, and devices. 
Apache Ranger is a component of CDP that provides authorization solutions to your
   cluster. Ranger defines the policies that determine what users can and cannot access.noteAuthorization through Apache Ranger is just one element of a secure
    production cluster: Cloudera supports Ranger only when it runs on a cluster where Kerberos is
    enabled to authenticate users.
The owner of a Google Doc can share their document with others.
   When sharing, they can set the access permissions of others as either editors, viewers, or
   commenters to determine their level of interaction with the file.
