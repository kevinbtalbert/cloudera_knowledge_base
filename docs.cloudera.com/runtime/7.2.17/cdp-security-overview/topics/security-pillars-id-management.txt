Identity Management
Identity management is how user and group identities are centrally stored.
Identity Management functions in conjunction with authentication and authorization as
   a form of security that ensures everyone has appropriate access to the resources needed to
   perform their roles. Managing identities of users and groups involves implementing policies and
   allowing or denying permissions.
