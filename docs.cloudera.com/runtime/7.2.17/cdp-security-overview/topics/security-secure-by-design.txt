Secure by Design
Our CDP platform is secure by design.
We treat security as the top-tier design requirement to manage risk, reduce attack
   surface and vulnerabilities, and develop design concepts and patterns in an industry-preferred
   way.
We have designed CDP to meet technical audit requirements out-of-the-box. In fact,
   many CDP services require security components prior to their installation.
The CDP platform gives you the ability to manage your cluster securely, allowing you
   to audit and understand how and what has happened on your cluster, and manage data policy and
   governance.
