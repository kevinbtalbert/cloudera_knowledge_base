Table 1. Optional Properties Related to Google Cloud Storage

Property
Description



fs.gs.project.id
Allows you to enter Google Cloudâ€™s Project ID with access to configured GCS
                     buckets. By default, this option is unset. 


fs.gs.block.size
This does not have any effect on storage but allows you to change the way split
                     sizes are computed. The value should be in bytes.
                     We recommend that you set this to the HDFS block size on the
                     cluster, or 134217728 for a block size of 128MB.
