ADLS Trash Folder Behavior
If the fs.trash.interval property is set to a value other than
        zero on your cluster and you do not specify the -skipTrash flag with your
            rm command when you remove files, the deleted files are moved to
        the trash folder in your ADLS account. The trash folder in your ADLS account is located at
            adl://your_account.azuredatalakestore.net/user/user_name/.Trash/current/.
