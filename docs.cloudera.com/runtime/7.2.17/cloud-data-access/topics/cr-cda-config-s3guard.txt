Configuring S3Guard
You can enable S3Guard when configuring your CDP environment. 

To configure S3Guard on CDP Private Cloud Base, perform the following tasks:

Preparing the S3 Bucket
Choosing a DynamoDB Table and IO Capacity
Creating DynamoDB Access Policy
Restricting Access to S3Guard Tables
Configuring S3Guard in Cloudera Manager
Create the S3Guard Table in DynamoDB



Preparing the S3 BucketS3Guard can protect any read/write or read-only S3 bucket. To begin "guarding" a bucket,             the first step is to create that bucket if it does not already exist.            Choosing a DynamoDB Table and IO CapacityWhen using DynamoDB, you must pay for the IO as well as the data storage: reads,             writes and queries. Creating DynamoDB Access PolicyIn order to configure S3Guard, you must provide read and write permissions for the             DynamoDB table that S3Guard will create and use.Restricting Access to S3Guard TablesYou must set permission to restrict access to S3Guard tables.Configuring S3Guard in Cloudera ManagerYou must set permission to restrict access to S3Guard tables.Create the S3Guard Table in DynamoDBUnless the property fs.s3a.bucket.test.s3guard.ddb.table.create             is set to enable the table to be automatically created, the table must be created on the             command line using the hadoop s3guard init command.Parent topic: Using S3Guard for Consistent S3 Metadata
