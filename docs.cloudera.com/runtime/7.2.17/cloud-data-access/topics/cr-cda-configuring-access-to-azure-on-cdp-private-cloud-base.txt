Configuring Access to Azure on CDP Private Cloud Base
You can use Shared Key, Managed Instance, Shared Access Signature, and so on to
    configure access credentials to authorise access to Azure containers. For example, a shared key
    account can be configured for use regardless of which account is accessed with the property
      fs.azure.account.key or you can configure an identity to be used only for a
    specific storage account with fs.azure.account.key.<BUCKET
      NAME>.blob.core.windows.net. After you create a storage account, Azure generates two 512-bit storage account access keys.
      You can use these keys to authorize access to data in your storage account. For information on
      how to access this Shared Key, see View account access keys. To configure access to the
      Azure container, add the Shared Key details in the core-site.xml file
      using Cloudera Manager.

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters >
            HDFS service.




Click the Configuration tab.

Search for core-site.

In the Cluster-wide Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
            core-site.xml option, click the + sign and add the
          below properties:

Name: fs.azure.account.auth.type.<account_name>.dfs.core.windows.net 
Value: <Shared_Key> (or_any_other_Auth_type)
            
Name:fs.azure.account.key.<your_storage_account_name>.dfs.core.windows.net
Value: <Access_key>





Click Save Changes. 

Next to the HDFS title, click ig>
