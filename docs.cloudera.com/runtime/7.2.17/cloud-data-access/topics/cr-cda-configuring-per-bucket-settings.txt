Configuring Per-Bucket Settings
You can specify bucket-specific configuration values which override the common
    configuration values.

Authentication mechanisms and credentials
Encryption settings
The specific S3 endpoints to send HTTP requests to. This is essential when working with S3
        regions which only support the "V4 authentication API", in case of which callers must always
        declare the explicit region.

All fs.s3a options other than a small set of unmodifiable values (currently
          fs.s3a.impl) can be set on a per-bucket basis.
To set a bucket-specific option: 

Add a new configuration, replacing the fs.s3a. prefix on an option
              with fs.s3a.bucket.BUCKETNAME, where BUCKETNAME is the name of the
            bucket.
For example, if you are configuring access key for a bucket called "nightly",
            instead of using fs.s3a.access.key property name, use
              fs.s3a.bucket.nightly.access.key.


When connecting to a bucket, all options explicitly set for that bucket will
            override the base fs.s3a. values, but they will not be picked up by
            other buckets.


Example
You may have a base configuration to use the IAM role information available when deployed
        in Amazon EC2 VM or an AWS container service.
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.auth.IAMInstanceCredentialsProvider</value>
</property>

This will be the default authentication mechanism for S3A buckets.
A bucket s3a://nightly/ used for nightly data uses a session
        key, so its bucket-specific configuration
        is:<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.bucket.nightly.access.key</name>
  <value>AKAACCES-SKEY-2</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.bucket.nightly.secret.key</name>
  <value>SESSION-SECRET-KEY</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.bucket.nightly.session.token</name>
  <value>SHORT-LIVED-SESSION-TOKEN</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.bucket.nightly.aws.credentials.provider</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.TemporaryAWSCredentialsProvider</value>
</property>

Finally, the public s3a://landsat-pds/ bucket could be accessed
        anonymously, so its bucket-specific configuration
        is:<property>
   <name>fs.s3a.bucket.landsat-pds.aws.credentials.provider</name>
   <value>org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.AnonymousAWSCredentialsProvider</value>
</property>

For all other buckets, the base configuration is used.

Customizing Per-Bucket Secrets Held in Credential FilesJCEKs credential files support the same per-bucket settings as those in XML files. To         provide different credentials for different buckets, simply create par-bucket entries in the         JCEKS file with the relevant secrets.Configuring Per-Bucket Settings to Access Data Around the WorldS3 buckets are hosted in different AWS regions, the default being "US-East". The     S3A client talks to this region by default, issuing HTTP requests to the server       s3.amazonaws.com. This central endpoint can be used for accessing any     bucket in any region which supports using the V2 Authentication API, albeit possibly at a     reduced performance.Parent topic: Working with Amazon S3
