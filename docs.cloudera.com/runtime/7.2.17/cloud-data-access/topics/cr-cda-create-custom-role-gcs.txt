Create a Custom Role
Specific permissions are required for the Google Cloud Storage Connector to access
            buckets. This set of permissions is the combination of the permissions associated with the
            existing Google Cloud IAM Role called 
            "Storage Object Admin" and the Google
                  Cloud IAM Permission called "storage.buckets.get".

 In the Google Cloud Platform web console, navigate to IAM & admin >
                              Roles


                        Click on +Create Role.
                  
 Provide the following: 
 Enter a title under Title

 Enter the ID under ID

 Under Role launch stage select General
                                          Availability

 Click on Add Permissions and add the following permissions: 
 storage.bucket.get 
 storage.objects.create 
 storage.objects.delete 
 storage.objects.get 
 storage.objects.getIamPolicy 
 storage.objects.list 
 storage.objects.setIamPolicy 
 storage.objects.update 





                        Once done adding permissions, click on Create.
                  

After performing these steps, a new role will be created.
