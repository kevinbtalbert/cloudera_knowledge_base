Disabling S3Guard and Destroying a S3Guard Database 
 You can disable S3Guard and destroy a S3Guard database.

Delete the per-bucket fs.s3a.metadatastore.impl parameter or set it back to the default
            org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.s3guard.NullMetadataStore.
 If you are not using a shared table, in DynamoDB console on AWS, delete the DynamoDB table to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.
      
The command hadoop s3guard destroy can be used on the command line to destroy a table.
        
> hadoop s3guard destroy s3a://guarded-table/
            
            2019-07-31 20:48:18,448 [main] INFO  s3guard.S3GuardTool (S3GuardTool.java:initMetadataStore(321)) - Metadata store DynamoDBMetadataStore{region=eu-west-2, tableName=s3guard-metadata, tableArn=arn:aws:dynamodb:eu-west-2:980678866538:table/s3guard-metadata} is initialized.
            2019-07-31 20:48:18,450 [main] INFO  s3guard.DynamoDBMetadataStore (DynamoDBMetadataStore.java:destroy(1416)) - Deleting DynamoDB table s3guard-metadata in region eu-west-2
            Metadata store is deleted
          
Destroying a table does not destroy the data in S3; it merely removes the summary data used by S3Guard to provide consistent listings.We can verify this by listing the bucket:
          
> hadoop fs -ls -R  s3a://guarded-table/
            -rw-rw-rw-   1 alice alice          0 2019-07-31 20:45 s3a://guarded-table/example
          
noteEven though hadoop fs commands can print the owner and permissions of a file, these
            are not real attributes of the object, and generated for the benefit of applications
            which check them. The owner and group of a file or directory is always the user for whom
            the S3A Filesystem was instantiated File permissions are always read and write, while
            directories are read, write and execute â€”irrespective of any underlying access
            permissions on the objects.
