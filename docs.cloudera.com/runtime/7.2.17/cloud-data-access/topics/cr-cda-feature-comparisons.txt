ADLS Gen 2 is where all future development of Azure Big Data storage is taking place,
    in the cloud server as well as the client connector. In contrast, ADLS Gen 1 must be considered
    a maintenance only data store, which is not being rolled out across more Azure regions.

Differences between ADLS Gen 1 and ADLS Gen 2
ADLS Gen 2 should be considered as a reimplementation of the ADLS Gen 1 features, but integrated with the original Azure Storage.

Features of ADLS Gen 2

Supports the Hadoop FileSystem API, with directories, file and directory permissions, and other key features.
Reads and writes data stores in the original Azure Storage (which has previously used the wasb:// URL)
No integration with ADLS Gen1. The adls:// connector must be used there.
Available in all Azure regions.
If an ADLS Gen 2 account is created "without hierarchical namespaces" then the wasb:// connector can read/write data stored in ADLS Gen 2.
Capable of storing many Petabytes of data.
