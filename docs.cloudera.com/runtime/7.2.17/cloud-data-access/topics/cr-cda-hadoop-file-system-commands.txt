Hadoop File System commands
You can execute Hadoop file system commands using CLI on your cluster.

Access your cluster by using the URL of the container.
          abfs://<NAME OF CONTAINER>@<NAME OF ACCOUNT>.dfs.core.windows.net/
Create a directory using the mkdir command. For example,
            hadoop fs -mkdir abfs://abfscontainer@abfstorageacc.dfs.core.windows.net/myDir/
hadoop fs -ls abfs://abfscontainer@abfstorageacc.dfs.core.windows.net/

drwxr-x--- - root root 0 2020-05-20 12:50
abfs://abfscontainer@abfstorageacc.dfs.core.windows.net/testSimilarly,
            you can use the put command to add a file to one of the directories,
              ls
command to list the items in your cluster, and cat
            command to read the contents of the file.

noteIf you name a file with the same file name that is already present in the directory, the
        existing file is not overwritten.
