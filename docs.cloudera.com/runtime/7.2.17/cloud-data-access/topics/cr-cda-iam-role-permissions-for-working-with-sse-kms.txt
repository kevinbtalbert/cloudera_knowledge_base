IAM Role permissions for working with SSE-KMS
All IAM roles which need to read data encrypted with SSE-KMS must have the
    permissions to decrypt using the specific key the data was encrypted with:
      kms:Decrypt
All IAM roles which need to both read and write data need the encrypt and decrypt
      permissions (encrypt-only permission is not supported). 
kms:Decrypt
kms:GenerateDatakey   
If a role does not have the permissions to read data, it will fail with an
        java.nio.AccessDeniedException.noteThe renaming files require the
        permission to decrypt the data, as it is decrypted and then re-encrypted as it is copied.
        See AWS KMS API Permissions: Actions and Resources
          Reference for more details on KMS permissions.
