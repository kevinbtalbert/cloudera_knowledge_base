S3 Performance Checklist
There are various types of checklists that you can use to ensure optimal performance
    when working with data in S3.


Checklist for Data




[ ] Amazon S3 bucket is in same region as the EC2-hosted cluster. 



[ ] The directory layout is "shallow". For directory listing
            performance, the directory layout prefers "shallow" directory trees with many files over
            deep directory trees with only a few files per directory. 



[ ] The "pseudo" block size set in fs.s3a.block.size
            is appropriate for the work to be performed on the data. 



[ ] Copy to HDFS any data that needs to be repeatedly read to HDFS.
          



Checklist for Cluster Configurations




[ ] Set yarn.scheduler.capacity.node-locality-delay to
            0 to improve container launch times. 
          



Checklist for Code




[ ] Application does not make rename() calls. Where it
            does, it does not assume the operation is immediate. 



[ ] Application does not assume that delete() is
            near-instantaneous. 



[ ] Application uses FileSystem.listFiles(path, recursive=true)
             to list a directory tree. 



[ ] Application prefers forward seeks through files, rather than full
            random IO. 



[ ] If making "random" IO through seek() and
              read() sequences or and Hadoop's PositionedReadable
            API, fs.s3a.experimental.input.fadvise is set to
              random.
