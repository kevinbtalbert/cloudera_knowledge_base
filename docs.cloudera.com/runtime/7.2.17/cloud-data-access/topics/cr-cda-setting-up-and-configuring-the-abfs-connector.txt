Setting up and configuring the ABFS connector
You must have an Azure storage account with hierarchical namespace enabled and Azure container prior to configuring the ABFS connector.
  
You can use the following steps to create a new storage account, create a new container, and configure the ABFS connector:

Create Azure storage account
Every storage account must belong to an Azure resource group. A resource group is a logical container for grouping your Azure services. 
        When you create a storage account, you have the option to either create a new resource group, or use an existing resource group.
You can create an Azure storage account using Azure CLI or Azure portal. When creating a
            Storage Account, you must ensure to enable namespace support by selecting the
              Hierarchical Namespace option. For information on creating an Azure
            storage account, see  Create a storage account.

Create Azure Container
 You must create a container to organize the blobs. One Azure storage account can have multiple containers, each with the container 
          name as the user information field of the URI used to reference it.
For example, the container container1 in the storage account will
            have the URL abfs://container1@<storage_account>.dfs.core.windows.net/
            .
For information on creating a container in Azure, see 
            Create a container.

Configure ABFS
You can configure access credentials to authorise access to Azure containers. For information on configuring ABFS, 
        see Configuring ABFS.
      
noteDelete Azure storage account - Deleting a storage account
            deletes the entire account, including all data in the account, and cannot be undone. For
            information about deleting an Azure storage account, see Delete a storage account.
