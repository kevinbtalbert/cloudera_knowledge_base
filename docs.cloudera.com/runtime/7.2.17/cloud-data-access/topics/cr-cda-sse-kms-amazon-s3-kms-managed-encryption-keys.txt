SSE-KMS: Amazon S3-KMS Managed Encryption Keys
Amazon offers a pay-per-use key management service, AWS
    KMS. This service can be used to encrypt data on S3 using keys which can be centrally
    managed and assigned to specific roles and IAM accounts.
The AWS KMS can
        be used by S3 to encrypt uploaded data. When uploading data encrypted with
        SSE-KMS, the named key that was used to encrypt the data is retrieved from the KMS
        service, and used to encode the per-object secret which encrypts the uploaded data. To
        decode the data, the same key must be retrieved from KMS and used to unencrypt the
        per-object secret key, which is then used to decode the actual file.
KMS keys can be managed by an organization's administrators in AWS, including having
        access permissions assigned and removed from specific users, groups, and IAM roles. Only
        those "principals" with granted rights to a key may access it, hence only they may encrypt
        data with the key, and decrypt data encrypted with it.
        This allows KMS to be used to provide a cryptographically secure access control mechanism
        for data stores on S3.
note
AWS KMS service is not related to the Key
            Management Service built into Hadoop (Hadoop KMS).
            The Hadoop KMS primarily focuses on managing keys
            for HDFS Transparent Encryption. Similarly, HDFS
            encryption is unrelated to S3 data encryption.

Enabling SSE-KMSTo enable SSE-KMS, the property       fs.s3a.server-side-encryption-algorithm must be set to SSE-KMS in       core-site.xml.IAM Role permissions for working with SSE-KMSAll IAM roles which need to read data encrypted with SSE-KMS must have the     permissions to decrypt using the specific key the data was encrypted with:       kms:DecryptParent topic: Encrypting Data on S3
