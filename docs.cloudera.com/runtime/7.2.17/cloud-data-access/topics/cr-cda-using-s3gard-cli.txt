Using the S3Guard CLI
The S3Guard CLI offers other maintenance commands. for information on how to use
        them, refer toApache documentation.
One useful command to use is hadoop s3guard prune -tombstone, which
            removes "tombstone markers" from the table. These are entries created when files are
            deleted, so as to identify recently deleted files which should be omitted from listings.
            After the S3 Store has become consistent with these deletions, the markers are no longer
            deleted.> hadoop s3guard prune -tombstone -days 1 s3a://hwdev-steve-ireland-new/
