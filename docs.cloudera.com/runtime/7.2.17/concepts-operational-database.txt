Operational Database


Cloudera Operational Database is powered by Apache HBase and Apache
Phoenix. Apache HBase is a column-oriented NoSQL database management
system that runs on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), a
main component of Apache Hadoop. It enables random, strictly consistent,
and real-time access to petabytes of data. Apache Phoenix enables OLTP
and operational analytics in Hadoop for low latency applications by
combining the best of both worlds:

The power of standard SQL and JDBC APIs with full ACID transaction
capabilities.
The flexibility of late-bound, schema-on-read capabilities from the
NoSQL world by leveraging HBase as its backing store.

Apache Phoenix provides a SQL interface for managing data in Apache
HBase. Operational Database powered by Apache Accumulo is the Cloudera
package of Apache Accumulo.
