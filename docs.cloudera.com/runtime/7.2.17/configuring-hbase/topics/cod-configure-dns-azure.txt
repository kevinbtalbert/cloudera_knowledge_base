Configure DNS
You must configure your edge node to perform forward and reverse DNS lookups with
        your Cloudera Operational Database (COD). Obtain the private IP address of your CDP environment
        and configure your edge node to resolve hostnames from your COD. An edge node must resolve
        the hostnames from your COD. 

Each CDP environment acts as its own DNS nameserver. Obtain the private IP address
                information of your environment and configure resov.conf on your
                edge node to list your CDP environment's private IP address as a nameserver.


Go to the Management Console.

Click Environments and select your environment from the
                    list.

Click Summary.

Find the FreeIPA section and copy the contents of the
                        Private IP field.

Add the private IP address as a nameserver to the
                        /etc/resolv.conf file in your edge node. You can do
                    this using the cat resolv.conf nameserver [***NAMESERVER IP
                            ADDRESS***] command.

noteWhen the server running application with HBase client cannot be set up
                        with reverse DNS lookup and can only perform forward DNS, then the
                        hbase.unsafe.client.kerberos.hostname.disable.reversedns property can be set
                        to true at the client configuration.  So that HBase client connects to the
                        HBase cluster through SASL Kerberos using the hostname of the principal and
                        skips the reverse DNS lookup.
