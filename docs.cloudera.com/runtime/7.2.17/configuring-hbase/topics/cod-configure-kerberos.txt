Configure Kerberos
All Cloudera Operational Databases (CODs) are secured with Kerberos-based authentication,
        meaning that only authorized users can connect to your database. All HBase and Phoenix Thick
        JDBC clients must have a proper Kerberos configuration on the host where they run a
        client.

Run the following command to obtain the necessary Kerberos information and a
                    sufficient krb5.conf file encoded with Base64 :

$ cdp opdb describe-client-connectivity --environment-name [***YOUR ENVIRONMENT***] \
		--database-name [***YOUR DATABASE NAME***] | jq -r \
		‘.kerberosConfiguration.krb5Conf’ | base64 --decode



Copy the output of the command.

Add the contents into the /etc/krb5.conf  file on your edge node.


Validate that Kerberos is correctly set up. Use the kinit command to
                validate that you are able to obtain a Kerberos
                ticket:$ kinit [***CDP WORKLOAD NAME***]
Password: [***CDP WORKLOAD PASSWORD***]
For more information, see CDP workload user and Setting the
                    workload password.
If you successfully authenticate, you will not receive an error and will be able to
                validate that you have a ticket using the klist command. For more
                information, see Installing CDP CLI beta.
