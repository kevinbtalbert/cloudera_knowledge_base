Configuring network line-of-sight
An edge node must be able to access the HBase services running inside of your CDP
        Operational Database (COD). These services are bound to the private network interfaces.
        Therefore, your edge node must be able to resolve the private IP addresses in your CDP
        VNet.
There are multiple methods how you can allow your edge node to resolve the private IP
            addresses in your CDP VPC. For example:
Re-use the subnets created for CDP
Direct connect
Virtual Private Network

Reuse the subnets created for CDP
As a part of the initial CDP setup, you have already created three subnets or CDP
                would have automatically created this for you. You can use the standard computer
                service in the Azure Marketplace to launch a Virtual Machine on the same resource
                group and subnet as your COD. For more information, see Reuse the subnets created for CDP.

Direct connect
To enable computers in your corporate network to communicate with the CDP VNet, you
                can use Azure ExpressRoute. Azure ExpressRoute enables hardware which you control to
                communicate with resources on Azure. For more information about Direct Connect, see
                    Azure ExpressRoute Overview: Connect over a
                        private connection.

Virtual Private Network
If you are using a corporate VPN network, you can use establish a VPN connection over
                the Internet to your COD. For more information, see About Azure VPN Gateway.


Reuse the subnets created for CDPTo configure and edge node on Azure for your Cloudera Operational Database (COD), you have         to configure network line-of-sight. One way to configure network line-of-slight is to reuse         the subnets that were created for CDP.Parent topic: Configuring edge node on Azure for COD
