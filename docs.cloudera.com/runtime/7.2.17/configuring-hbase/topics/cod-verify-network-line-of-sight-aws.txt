Verify the network line-of-sight
After you create your edge node and SSH into it, validate that you have a networking
        line-of-sight correctly configured. You can validate this using the ping command from your
        edge node to an IP address within your CDP VPC.

Create and edge node and SSH into it.


Navigate to CDP Control Plane > Management Console.

Click Environments and select your environment from the
                    list.

Click Summary.

Find the FreeIPA section and copy the content of the Private IP field.






Open a terminal.

Run the ping [***PRIVATE IP***]
                    command.
The host will respond to your ping request.

If you ping request fail: Run the telnet [***PRIVATE
                            IP***] 88 command.
A blank screen is displayed if the connection succeeds.

If the ping request failes, it
            does not necessarily mean that you have failed to configure the edge node, it might
            indicate that you must take additional steps to validate your line-of-sight. You may
            have configured your CDP VPC to have security groups which do not respond to ping or
            your KDC listen port might not be open for communication.
