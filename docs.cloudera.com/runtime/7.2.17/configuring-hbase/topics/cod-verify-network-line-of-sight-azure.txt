Verify the network line-of-sight
After you have created your edge node and can SSH into it, validate that you have a
        networking line-of-sight correctly configured. You can validate this using the
            ping command from your edge node to an IP address from within your CDP
        VNet.

Create and edge node and SSH into it.


Navigate to CDP Control Plane > Management Console.

Click Environments and select your environment from the
                    list of environments.

Click Summary.

Find the FreeIPA section and copy the content of the
                        Private IP field.

Open a terminal.

Run the ping [***PRIVATE IP***]
                    command.
The host will respond to your ping request.


If the ping fails, it does not necessarily mean that you have failed to configure the
                edge node, but it indicates that you have to take additional steps to validate your
                line-of-sight. You may have configured your CDP VNet to have security groups which
                do not respond to ping.
