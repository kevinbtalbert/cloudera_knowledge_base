Advanced configuration for write-heavy workloads
HBase includes several advanced configuration parameters for adjusting the number of
    threads available to service flushes and compactions in the presence of write-heavy workloads.
    Tuning these parameters incorrectly can severely degrade performance and is not necessary for
    most HBase clusters. If you use Cloudera Manager, configure these options using the
      HBase Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
      hbase-site.xml


hbase.hstore.flusher.count
The number of threads available to flush writes from memory to disk. Never increase
              hbase.hstore.flusher.count to more of 50% of the number of disks
            available to HBase. For example, if you have 8 solid-state drives (SSDs),
              hbase.hstore.flusher.count should never exceed 4. This allows
            scanners and compactions to proceed even in the presence of very high writes.
hbase.regionserver.thread.compaction.large and
              hbase.regionserver.thread.compaction.small
The number of threads available to handle small and large compactions, respectively.
            Never increase either of these options to more than 50% of the number of disks available
            to HBase.

Ideally, hbase.regionserver.thread.compaction.small should be
              greater than or equal to hbase.regionserver.thread.compaction.large,
              since the large compaction threads do more intense work and will be in use longer for
              a given operation.



In addition to the above, if you use compression on some column
        families, more CPU will be used when flushing these column families to
        disk during flushes or compaction. The impact on CPU usage depends on
        the size of the flush or the amount of data to be decompressed and
        compressed during compactions.
