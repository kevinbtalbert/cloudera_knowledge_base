Best practices when using RegionServer grouping
You must keep in mind the following best practices when using rsgroups.

Isolate system tables: You can either have a system rsgroup where all the system tables
        are present or just leave the system tables in default rsgroup and have all
        user-space tables in non-default rsgroups.
Handle dead nodes: You can have a special rsgroup of dead or questionable nodes to help
        you keep them without running until the nodes are repaired. Be careful when replacing dead
        nodes in an rsgroup, and ensure there are enough live nodes before you start moving out the
        dead nodes. You can move the good live nodes first before moving out the dead nodes. If
          you have configured a table to be in a rsgroup, but all the RegionServers in that rsgroup
          die, the tables become unavailable and you can no longer access those tables.
