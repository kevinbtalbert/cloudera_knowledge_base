Configure the HBase canary
The HBase canary is an optional service that you can configure to check periodically
        if a RegionServer is alive. The HBase canary is disabled by default.
This canary is different from the Cloudera Service Monitoring canary and is
            provided by the HBase service. After enabling the canary, you can configure several
            different thresholds and intervals relating to it, as well as exclude certain tables
            from the canary checks. The canary works on Kerberos-enabled clusters if you have the
            HBase client configured to use Kerberos.

Go to the HBase service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select Scope > HBase or HBase
                        Service-Wide.

Select Category >
                    Monitoring.

Locate the HBase Canary property or search for it by
                    typing its name in the Search box. Several properties have Canary in the
                    property name.

Select the checkbox.

Review other HBase Canary properties to configure the specific behavior of the
                    canary. To apply this configuration property to other role groups as needed,
                    edit the value for the appropriate role group.See Modifying Configuration
                    Properties Using Cloudera Manager.

                        Save Changes to commit the changes.
