Configure the MOB cache using Cloudera Manager
To configure the MOB cache within Cloudera Manager, edit the HBase Service advanced
        configuration snippet for the cluster. Cloudera recommends testing your configuration with
        the default settings first.

Go to the HBase service.

Click Configuration.

Search for the property HBase Service Advanced Configuration Snippet
                        (Safety Valve) for hbase-site.xml.

Paste your configuration into the Value field and save your changes. The
                    following example sets the hbase.mob.cache.evict.period property to 5000
                    seconds. See MOB Cache Properties for a list of configurable
                    properties.

<property>
  <name>hbase.mob.cache.evict.period</name>
  <value>5000</value>
</property>



Restart your cluster for the changes to take effect.
