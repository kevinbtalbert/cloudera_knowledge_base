Configure RegionServer grouping
When you add a new rsgroup, you are creating an rsgroup other than the default group. 

To configure a rsgroup, in the HBase shell: 


Add an rsgroup: $hbase> add_rsgroup
                        'mygroup'.

Add RegionServers and tables to this rsgroup: $hbase>
                        move_servers_tables_rsgroup ‘mygroup’,
                            ['server1:port','server2:port'],['table1','table2'].

Run the balance_rsgroup command if the tables are slow to
                    migrate to the group's dedicated server.

noteThe term rsgroup refers to servers in a cluster with only the
                        hostname and port. It does not make use of the HBase ServerName type
                        identifying RegionServers (hostname + port + start time) to distinguish
                        RegionServer instances.
