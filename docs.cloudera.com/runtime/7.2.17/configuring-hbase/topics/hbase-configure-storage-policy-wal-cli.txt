Configure the storage policy for WALs using the Command Line
You can configure the preferred HDFS storage policy for HBase's write-ahead log (WAL)
        replicas using the command line.

importantFollow these command-line instructions on systems that do not use
                Cloudera Manager.


Paste the following XML into hbase-site.xml. Uncomment the <value> line that
                    corresponds to your desired storage policy.

<property>
  <name>hbase.wal.storage.policy</name>
  <value>NONE</value>
  <!--<value>ONE_SSD</value>-->
  <!--<value>ALL_SSD</value>-->
</property>
warning ONE_SSD mode has not been thoroughly tested with HBase and
                        is not recommended.


Restart HBase. Changes will take effect for a given region during its next
                    major compaction.
