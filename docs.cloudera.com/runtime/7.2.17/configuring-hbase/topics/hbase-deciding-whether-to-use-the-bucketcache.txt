Decide to use the BucketCache
 The BucketCache manages areas of memory called buckets
    for holding the cached blocks. You can use BucketCache if any of the conditions listed in here
    are are true.


If the result of a Get or Scan typically fits completely in the heap, the default
          configuration, which uses the on-heap LruBlockCache, is the best choice,
          as the L2 cache will not provide much benefit. If the eviction rate is low, garbage
          collection can be 50% less than that of the BucketCache, and throughput
          can be at least 20% higher.
Otherwise, if your cache is experiencing a consistently high eviction rate, use the
            BucketCache, which causes 30-50% of the garbage collection of
            LruBlockCache when the eviction rate is high. 
BucketCache using file mode on solid-state disks has a better
          garbage-collection profile but lower throughput than BucketCache using
            off-heap memory.
