Disable loading of coprocessors
You can disable loading of coprocessors using Cloudera Manager. 
Cloudera recommends against disabling loading of system coprocessors, because HBase
      security functionality is implemented using system coprocessors. However, disabling loading of
      user coprocessors may be appropriate.

Select the HBase service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Search for HBase Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
            hbase-site.xml.

To disable loading of all coprocessors, add a new property with the name
            hbase.coprocessor.enabled and set its value to false.
            Cloudera does not recommend this setting.

To disable loading of user coprocessors, add a new property with the name
            hbase.coprocessor.user.enabled and set its value to
            false.

Enter a Reason for change, and then click Save
            Changes to commit the changes.
