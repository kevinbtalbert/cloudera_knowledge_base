Quota enforcement
When a quota limit is exceeded, the Master server instructs RegionServers to
        enable an enforcement policy for the namespace or table that violated the quota.It is important to note the storage quota is not reported in real-time. There is a window when
            threshold is reached on RegionServers but the threshold accounted for on the Master
            server is not updated.
noteSet a storage limit lower than the amount of available disk space to provide extra buffer.
