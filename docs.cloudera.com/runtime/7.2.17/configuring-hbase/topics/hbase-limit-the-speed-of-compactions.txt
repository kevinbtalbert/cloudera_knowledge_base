Limiting the speed of compactions
You can limit the speed at which HBase compactions run, by configuring
      hbase.regionserver.throughput.controller and its related
    settings.
 The default controller is
        org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.throttle.PressureAwareCompactionThroughputController,
      which uses the following algorithm:
If compaction pressure is greater than 1.0, there is no speed limitation.
In off-peak hours, use a fixed throughput limitation, configured using
            hbase.hstore.compaction.throughput.offpeak,
            hbase.offpeak.start.hour, and
          hbase.offpeak.end.hour.
In normal hours, the max throughput is tuned between
            hbase.hstore.compaction.throughput.higher.bound and
            hbase.hstore.compaction.throughput.lower.bound (which default to 20
          MB/sec and 10 MB/sec respectively), using the following formula, where
            compactionPressure is between 0.0 and 1.0. The
            compactionPressure refers to the number of store files that require
          compaction.lower + (higher - lower) * compactionPressure

To disable compaction speed limits, set
        hbase.regionserver.throughput.controller to
        org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.throttle.NoLimitThroughputController.
