Monitor the BlockCache
Cloudera Manager provides metrics to monitor the performance of the
      BlockCache, to assist you in tuning your configuration.You can view further detail and graphs using the RegionServer UI. To
          access the RegionServer UI in Cloudera Manager, go to the Cloudera
          Manager page for the host, click the RegionServer process, and
            click HBase RegionServer Web UI. If you do not use Cloudera Manager, access the
            BlockCache reports at
              http://regionServer_host:22102/rs-status#memoryStats,
          replacing regionServer_host with the hostname
          or IP address of your RegionServer.
