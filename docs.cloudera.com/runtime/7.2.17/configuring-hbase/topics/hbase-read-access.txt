In most cases, quota violation policies can affect the ability to read the
        data stored in HBase. You must understand how a quota violation policy affects your ability
        to read the data stored in HBase. In most cases, quota violation policies can affect the ability to read the data stored in HBase.
            A goal of applying these HBase quotas is to ensure that the storage remains healthy and
            sustains a higher level of availability to HBase users. Guaranteeing that there is
            always free space in your HDFS can yield a higher level of health of the physical
            machines and the DataNodes. This leaves the HDFS-reserved space percentage as a
            fail-safe mechanism.
