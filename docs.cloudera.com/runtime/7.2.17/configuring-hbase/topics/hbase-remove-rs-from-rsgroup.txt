Remove a RegionServer from RegionServer grouping
You can remove a RegionServer by moving it to the default rsgroup.
        Edits made using shell commands to all rsgroups, except the default
        rsgroup, are persisted to the system hbase:rsgroup table. If an rsgroup
        references a decommissioned RegionServer, then the rsgroup should be updated to undo the
        reference.

Move the RegionServer to the default rsgroup using the command:
                        $hbase> move_servers_rsgroup
                            'default',['server1:port'].

Check the list of RegionServers in your rsgourp to ensure that that the
                    RegionServer is successfully removed using the command: $hbase>
                        get_rsgroup 'mygroupâ€™

The default rsgroup's RegionServer list mirrors the current state of the
                        cluster. If you shut down a RegionServer that was part of the
                            default rsgroup, and then run the get_rsgroup
                            'default' command to list its content in the shell, the server
                        is no longer listed. If you move the offline server from the non-default
                        rsgroup to default, it will not show in the
                            default list; the server will just be removed from the
                        list.
