Using HBase scanner heartbeat
 A scanner heartbeat check enforces a time limit on the execution of scan RPC
    requests. This helps prevent scans from taking too long and causing a timeout at the
    client.
When the server receives a scan RPC request, a time limit is calculated
      to be half of the smaller of two values:
        hbase.client.scanner.timeout.period and
        hbase.rpc.timeout (which both default to 60000
      milliseconds, or one minute). When the time limit is reached, the server
      returns the results it has accumulated up to that point. This result set
      may be empty. If your usage pattern includes that scans will take longer
      than a minute, you can increase these values.
To make sure the timeout period is not too
      short, you can configure
        hbase.cells.scanned.per.heartbeat.check to a minimum
      number of cells that must be scanned before a timeout check occurs. The
      default value is 10000. A smaller value causes timeout checks to occur
      more often.
