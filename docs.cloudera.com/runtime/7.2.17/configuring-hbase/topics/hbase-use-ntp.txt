Use the Network Time Protocol (NTP) with HBase
Ensure that that the clocks on all the cluster members are sychronized for your
      cluster to function correctly. You must configure NTP to synchronize the clock.
The clocks on cluster members must be synchronized for your cluster to function
         correctly. Some skew is tolerable, but excessive skew could generate odd behaviors.
            Using NTP and DNS ensures that you won’t run into odd behaviors when one node A thinks
            that the time is tomorrow and node B thinks it’s yesterday. You will also prevent
            situations where the master node tells node C to serve a region but node C doesn’t know
            its own name and doesn’t answer.

Run NTP or another clock synchronization mechanism on your cluster.

Verify that the system time is sychronized across your cluster nodes.
