Accessing the Oozie server with the Oozie Client
The Oozie client is a command-line utility that interacts with the Oozie server using
    the Oozie web-services API.

Use the /usr/bin/oozie script to run the Oozie client.
For example, if you want to invoke the client on the same machine where the Oozie
          server is
          running:$ oozie admin -oozie https://<oozie_server>:11443/oozie -status
System mode: NORMAL

To make it convenient to use this utility, set the environment variable
            OOZIE_URL to point to the URL of the Oozie server. Then you can skip
          the -oozie option.
For example, if you want to invoke the client on the same machine where the Oozie
          server is running, set the OOZIE_URL to
            https://<oozie_server>:11443/oozie.$ export OOZIE_URL=https://<oozie_server>:11443/oozie
$ oozie admin -version
Oozie server build version: 4.0.0-cdh5.0.0

importantIf Oozie is configured with Kerberos Security enabled:
You must have a Kerberos session running. For example, you can start a session by
                running the kinit command.
Do not use localhost.
As with every service that uses Kerberos, Oozie has a Kerberos principal
              in the form <SERVICE>/<HOSTNAME>@<REALM>. In a
              Kerberos configuration, you must use the <HOSTNAME>
              value in the Kerberos principal to specify the Oozie server; for example, if the
                <HOSTNAME> in the principal is
                myoozieserver.mydomain.com, set OOZIE_URL as
              follows:export OOZIE_URL=https://myoozieserver.mydomain.com:11443/oozieIf
              you use an alternate hostname or the IP address of the service, Oozie will not work
              properly.


If you want to access Oozie client through Knox:

export OOZIE_URL=https://<knox_host>:<knox_port>/gateway/cdp-proxy-api/oozie

When you access Oozie client through Knox, you need to specify a username and password
          in the command line as Knox needs
          it:export OOZIE_URL=https://<knox_host>:<knox_port>/gateway/cdp-proxy-api/oozie
oozie admin -version -auth BASIC -username <username> -password <password>
