Additional considerations when configuring TLS/SSL for Oozie HA
To enable clients to connect to Oozie servers (the target servers) through the load
    balancer using TLS/SSL, configure the load balancer for TLS/SSL pass-through. 
This means that the load balancer does not perform encryption or decryption but instead
      passes traffic from clients and servers to the appropriate target host. See the documentation
      for your load balancer for details.
