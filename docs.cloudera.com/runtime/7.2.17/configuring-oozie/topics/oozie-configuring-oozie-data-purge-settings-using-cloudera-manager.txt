Configuring Oozie data purge settings using Cloudera Manager
You can change your Oozie configuration to control when data is purged to improve
    performance, reduce database disk usage, or keep the history for a longer period of time.
    Limiting the size of the Oozie database can also improve performance during upgrades. 
All Oozie workflows older than 30 days are purged from the
      database by default. However, actions associated with long-running coordinators do not purge
      until the coordinators complete. If, for example, you schedule a coordinator to run for a
      year, all those actions remain in the database for the year. 

In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to the Oozie service. 

Click the Configuration tab.

Type purge in the Search box.

Set the following properties as required for your environment:


Enable Purge for Long-Running Coordinator JobsSelect this
                property to enable purging of long-running coordinator jobs for which the workflow
                jobs are older than the value you set for the Days to Keep Completed
                  Workflow Jobs property.
Days to Keep Completed Workflow Jobs
Days to Keep Completed Coordinator Jobs
Days to Keep Completed Bundle Jobs



Enter a Reason for change, and then click Save
            Changes to commit the changes.

Select Actions > Restart to restart the Oozie Service.
