Configuring Oozie to enable MapReduce jobs to read or write from Amazon S3
MapReduce jobs controlled by Oozie as part of a workflow can read from and write to
    Amazon S3. You will need your AWS credentials (the appropriate Access key ID and Secret access key
      obtained from Amazon Web Services for your Amazon S3 bucket). After storing these credentials
      in the keystore (the JCEKS file), specify the path to this keystore in the Oozie workflow
      configuration.
This setup is for use in the context of Oozie workflows only,
      and does not support running shell scripts on Amazon S3 or other types of scenarios.noteIn
        the following steps, replace the path/to/file with the HDFS directory
        where the .jceks file is located, and replace
          access_key_ID and secret_access_key with your AWS
        credentials. Create the credential store (.jceks) and add your AWS access key to it as
          follows: 
hadoop credential create fs.s3a.access.key -provider \
jceks://hdfs/path/to/file.jceks -value access_key_id

          For example:
          
hadoop credential create fs.s3a.access.key -provider \
jceks://hdfs/user/root/awskeyfile.jceks -value AKIAIPVYH....

Add the AWS secret to this same keystore.

hadoop credential create fs.s3a.secret.key -provider \
jceks://hdfs/path/to/file.jceks -value secret_access_key


Set hadoop.security.credential.provider.path to the path of the
            .jceks file in Oozie's workflow.xml file in the
          MapReduce Action's <configuration> section so that the MapReduce
          framework can load the AWS credentials that give access to Amazon S3.

<action name="S3job">
    <map-reduce>
        <job-tracker>${jobtracker}</job-tracker>
        <name-node>${namenode}</name-node>
        <configuration>
            <property>
                <name>hadoop.security.credential.provider.path</name>
                <value>jceks://hdfs/path/to/file.jceks</value>
            </property>  
            ....
            ....
</action>
