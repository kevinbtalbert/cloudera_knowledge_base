Disabling Oozie UI using Cloudera Manager
From the Cloudera 7.1.7 SP1 release onwards, the Oozie UI is enabled by default. You
    can disable it by setting a new property in the Oozie site configuration.

In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to the Oozie service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Locate the Oozie Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
            oozie-site.xml property or search for it by typing its name in the
            Search box.

Add the following property:

Name: oozie.ui.enabled
Value: false


Enter a Reason for change, and then click Save
            Changes to commit the changes.

Restart the Oozie service.

To enable the Oozie UI again, delete the oozie.ui.enabled
            property set using the safety valve.
