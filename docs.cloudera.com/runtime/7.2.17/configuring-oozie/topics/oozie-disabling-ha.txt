Disabling Oozie High Availability
Based on your requirements, you can disable Oozie High Availability (HA) using
        Cloudera Manager.
In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to the Oozie service.
Select Actions > Disable High Availability to see all hosts currently running Oozie servers.
Select the one host to run the Oozie server and click
                        Continue.
Cloudera Manager stops the Oozie service, removes the additional Oozie
                    servers, configures Hue to reference the Oozie service, and restarts the Oozie
                    service and dependent services.
