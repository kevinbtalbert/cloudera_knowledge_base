Advanced settings: Overriding default configurations 
You can override the default value set using Cloudera Manager, if required. For
        example, you have five different actions in the workflow and four of them use S3 buckets and
        one use ABFS. In this case, the S3 can be set as a default credential and can be overridden
        in only that one action to have a different value. 

Using Cloudera Manager, set the credentials to use s3 bucket in the
                        Oozie Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        action-conf/default.xml field: 

Name: oozie.action.credentials.filesystem.myCustomCredential 
Value: s3a://<bucket-name>


 Using the HUE editor, edit the action for which you want to use a different
                    credential and add the following: 
Name: oozie.action.credentials.filesystem.myCustomCredential
Value: abfs://myAbfsBucketName
                    Add the following property as described in the Step 4 and 5 of the  Option 1: Setting file system
                        credentials for Oozie through hadoop properties using Hue Editor . 
Now Oozie actions will use the default S3 credential except the one which has
                    the non-default value. It is also possible to combine the global configuration,
                    where you define the possible file-system credentials, and in HUE you use the
                    pre-defined global credentials.
