Prerequisites for configuring TLS/SSL for Oozie
There are certain prerequisites that must be fulfilled for configuring TLS/SSL for
    Oozie.

Keystores for Oozie must be readable by the oozie user. This can be a
        copy of the Hadoop services' keystore with permissions set to 0440 and
        owned by the oozie group.
Truststores must have permissions set to 0444, which means that all users
        can read them.
Specify absolute paths to the keystore and truststore files. These settings apply to all
        hosts on which daemon roles of the Oozie service run so the paths you choose must be valid
        on all hosts.
If there is a DataNode and an Oozie server running on the same host, they can use the same
        certificate.
