Setting default credentials using Cloudera Manager
In scenarios where you need to set a credential for every action of every workflow,
        you can set the credential definitions and its usages using Cloudera Manager. You can also
        set these as the default configurations.

In Cloudera Manager, click the
                        Oozie service. 

Click the Configuration tab.

 Search for action_conf and add the following in the
                        Oozie Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        action-conf/default.xml field:

Definition (can be seen by all the actions started by Oozie)

Name: oozie.action.credentials.filesystem.myCustomCredential
Value: s3a://<bucket-name>

Name: oozie.action.credentials.filesystem.myotherCustomCredential
Value: abfs://<bucket-name>
Usage (applies to all the actions started by Oozie)

Name: oozie.action.credentials.filesystem
Value: myCustomCredential,myotherCustomCredential


Click Save Changes on the bottom right corner. 


Click Stale Service Restart  that is next to the Oozie
                    service name. 

Review the properties added to the default action configuration. All these
                    properties will be available in every Oozie action. 


Click Restart Stale Services to make this change happen
                    on the Oozie instances. 

noteAfter this configuration, you need not add anything in
                        HUE, Oozie obtains a delegation token for those file-system paths for every
                        action.
