Setting file system credentials for Oozie through hadoop properties using Hue
        Editor
This option allows you to configure additional Oozie credentials with configuration
        properties. The following example shows how to set up an Oozie workflow with a shell action
        which uses additional file system credentials.

note Hue Limitation - Hue is not capable of adding user defined file
                system credentials to the Oozie workflow, only built-in credentials can be added.
                Hence, you must manually define file system credentials for Oozie workflow. 


In Hue web UI, click Scheduler >
                        Workflow to create a new workflow. 

Click Documents and select
                        Actions in the drop-down list. 

Select the Shell icon to the workflow to add a shell
                    action. The shell command can be echo and its parameter
                    can be Hello world for this example.


Select the settings under the Edit menu to add
                    properties to the workflow. The Workflow Settings dialog box is
                    displayed.


In the Workflow Settings dialog box, under the
                        Hadoop Properties section, click + Add
                        property and add the necessary credentials. The property name
                    must be in the format similar to
                        oozie.action.credentials.filesystem.<myCustomCredential>
                    where myCustomCredential is the description of the
                    credential. The value of this property must be set to a valid filesystem URI,
                    for example, an S3 bucket URL. Click + Add property to
                    add additional properties if you want to access more than one s3 bucket, and so
                    on, as shown in the below figure. 


Click Action Settings to set the credential defined in the previous step
                    to use it in the workflow action where it is needed.


Add a new property to the action with the name
                        oozie.action.credentials.filesystem and its value must be a
                    comma-separated list of credential names defined in the hadoop properties. For
                    example “myCustomCredential,myOtherCustomCredential”. Based on this
                    property, Oozie requests delegation tokens for the file-systems defined in the
                    given credentials.


Now the workflow is ready to be submitted and the following is the generated
                workflow.xml file.
