Enabling Spark authentication
Spark authentication here refers to an internal authentication
    mechanism, and not to Kerberos authentication, which is enabled
    automatically for all Cloudera Data Platform deployments.

Minimum Required Role:
Security Administrator (also provided by
          Full Administrator)


 Spark has an internal mechanism that authenticates executors with the
        driver controlling a given application. This mechanism is enabled using
        the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, as detailed below. Cluster
        administrators can enable the spark.authenticate
        mechanism to authenticate the various processes that support a Spark
        application. 
To enable this feature on the cluster:

 In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Management Console, go to
            Data Hub Clusters. Find and select the cluster you want to
        configure. Click the link for the Cloudera Manager URL. Go to Clusters > <Cluster Name> > Spark
              service > Configuration.  Scroll down to the Spark Authentication
          setting, or search for spark.authenticate to find it.
         In the Spark Authentication setting, click the checkbox next
          to the Spark (Service-Wide) property to
          activate the setting.  Enter the reason for the change at the bottom of the screen,
          and then click Save Changes.  Restart YARN: 
 Select Clusters  > YARN. 
 Select Restart from the
                Actions drop-down selector.
            
 Re-deploy the client configurations:  
 Select Clusters > 
Cluster_name


 Select Deploy Client
                Configurations from the
                Actions drop-down selector.
            
Restart stale services.
