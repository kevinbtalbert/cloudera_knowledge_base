Enabling Spark Encryption


Before enabling encryption, you must first enable Spark
        authentication.
 In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Management Console, go to
            Data Hub Clusters. Find and select the cluster you want to
        configure. Click the link for the Cloudera Manager URL. Go to Clusters > <Cluster Name> > Spark
              service > Configuration.  Search for the Enable Network Encryption property. Use the
        checkbox to enable encrypted communication between Spark processes
        belonging to the same application.Search for the Enable I/O Encryption property. Use the checkbox
        to enabled encryption for temporary shuffle and cache files stored by
        Spark on local disks. Enter the reason for the change at the bottom of the screen,
          and then click Save Changes.  Re-deploy the client configurations: 
 Select Clusters >

 Select Deploy Client
                Configurations from the
                Actions drop-down selector.
