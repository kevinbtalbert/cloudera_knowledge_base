Active Directory Settings
This section provides additional information about Shiro Active Directory settings.  

Active Directory (AD) stores users and groups in a hierarchical tree structure, built
            from containers including the organizational unit (ou), organization (o), and domain
            controller (dc). The path to each entry is a Distinguished Name (DN) that uniquely
            identifies a user or group.
User and group names typically have attributes such as a common name (cn) or unique ID
            (uid).
Specify the DN as a string, for example cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com.
            White space is ignored.


activeDirectoryRealm


specifies the class name to use for AD authentication. You should set this to
                        org.apache.zeppelin.realm.ActiveDirectoryGroupRealm. 


activeDirectoryRealm.url


specifies the host and port where Active Directory is set up. .
If the protocol element is specified as ldap, SSL is not used.
                     If the protocol is specified as ldaps, access is over SSL.

Note: If Active Directory uses a self-signed
                     certificate, import the certificate into the truststore of the JVM running
                     Zeppelin; for example:
echo -n | openssl s_client –connect ldap.example.com:389 | \
    sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > /tmp/examplecert.crt

keytool –import \
    -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts \
    -storepass changeit \
    -noprompt \
    -alias mycert \
    -file /tmp/examplecert.crt


activeDirectoryRealm.principalSuffix


simplifies the logon information that users must use to log in. Otherwise, AD
                     requires a username fully qualified with domain information. For example, if a
                     fully-qualified user account is user@hdpqa.example.com, you
                     can specify a shorter suffix such as user@hdpqa.
activeDirectoryRealm.principalSuffix = @<user-org-level-domain>


activeDirectoryRealm.searchBase


defines the base distinguished name from which the directory search starts. A
                     distinguished name defines each entry; "dc" entries define a hierarchical
                     directory tree.


activeDirectoryRealm.systemUsername


activeDirectoryRealm.systemPassword


defines the username and password that Zeppelin uses to connect to Active
                     Directory when it searches for users and groups. These two settings are used
                     for controlling access to UI features, not for authentication. The Bind method
                     does not require a valid user password.
Example: activeDirectoryRealm.systemPassword = passwordA



activeDirectoryRealm.groupRolesMap


a comma-separated list that maps groups to roles. These settings are used by
                     Zeppelin to restrict UI features to specific AD groups. The following example
                     maps group hdpdv_admin at hdp3.example.com to
                     the "admin" role:
CN=hdpdv_admin,DC=hdp3,DC=example,DC=com:admin


activeDirectoryRealm.authorizationCachingEnabled


specifies whether to use caching to improve performance. To enable caching, set
                     this property to true.
