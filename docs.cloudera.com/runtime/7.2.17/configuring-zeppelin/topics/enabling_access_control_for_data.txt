Enable Access Control for
      Data
This section describes how to restrict access to Apache Zeppelin data. 

Access control for data brought into Zeppelin depends on the underlying data source:



To configure access control for Spark data, Zeppelin must be running as an end
                     user ("identity propagation"). Zeppelin implements access control using Livy.
                     When identity propagation is enabled via Livy, data access is controlled by the
                     type of data source being accessed. For example, when you access HDFS data,
                     access is controlled by HDFS permissions.


To configure access control for Hive data, use the JDBC interpreter.


To configure access control for the Spark shell, define permissions for end
                     users running the shell.
