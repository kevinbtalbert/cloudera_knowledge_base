LDAP Settings
This section provides additional information about Shiro LDAP settings.  

LDAP stores users and groups in a hierarchical tree structure, built from containers
            including the organizational unit (ou), organization (o), and domain controller (dc).
            The path to each entry is a Distinguished Name (DN) that uniquely identifies a user or
            group.
User and group names typically have attributes such as a common name (cn) or unique ID
            (uid).
Specify the DN as a string, for example cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com.
            White space is ignored.
Zeppelin LDAP authentication uses templates for user DNs. 


ldapRealm


specifies the class name to use for LDAP authentication. You should set this to
                        org.apache.zeppelin.realm.LdapRealm unless you are familiar
                     with LDAP and prefer to use
                        org.apache.shiro.realm.ldap.JndiLdapRealm. ..


ldapRealm.contextFactory.environment[ldap.searchBase]


defines the base distinguished name from which the LDAP search starts. Shiro
                     searches for userDnTemplate at this address.
If the protocol is specified as ldap, SSL is not used. If the
                     protocol is specified as ldaps, access is over SSL.


ldapRealm.userDnTemplate


specifies the search location where the user is to be found. Shiro replaces
                        {0} with the username acquired from the Zeppelin UI.
                     Zeppelin uses User DN templates to configure associated realms.


ldapRealm.contextFactory.url


specifies the host and port on which LDAP is running.
If the protocol element is specified as ldap, SSL will not be
                     used. If the protocol is specified as ldaps, access will be
                     over SSL.

Note: If LDAP is using a self-signed certificate,
                     import the certificate into the truststore of JVM running Zeppelin; for
                     example:
echo -n | openssl s_client –connect ldap.example.com:389 | \
    sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > /tmp/examplecert.crt

keytool –import \
    -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts \
    -storepass changeit \
    -noprompt \
    -alias mycert \
    -file /tmp/examplecert.crt


ldapRealm.contextFactory.systemUsername


ldapRealm.contextFactory.systemPassword


define the username and password that Zeppelin uses to connect to LDAP, to
                     search for users and groups. These two settings are used for controlling access
                     to UI features, not for authentication. The Bind method does not require a
                     valid user password.
Examples:
ldapRealm.contextFactory.systemUsername=uid=guest,ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org
ldapRealm.contextFactory.systemPassword=somePassword


ldapRealm.authorizationCachingEnabled


specifies whether to use caching to improve performance. To enable caching, set
                     this property to true.
