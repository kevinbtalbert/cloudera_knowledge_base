Introduction
Zeppelin uses Apache Shiro to provide authentication and authorization (access
      control). 

Clusters created in CDP have security enabled by default. Disabling
        security on a cluster in CDP is not supported.
If Ranger is enabled on your cluster, no additional configuration steps are required to
    have Ranger work with Zeppelin. Note, however, that a Ranger policy change takes about five to
    ten minutes to take effect.
