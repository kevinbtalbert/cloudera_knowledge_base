Problem area: Reports page
Only the admin users can view the Reports page. If you are a
  non-admin user, then you lack the privileges to view the Reports
  page.
To enlist yourself as the admin user, go to Cloudera Manager > Clusters > DAS > Configuration, and add your user name in the Admin Users field. 
For example, hive,admin1,admin2. To make all users administrators, specify an
   asterik (*).
