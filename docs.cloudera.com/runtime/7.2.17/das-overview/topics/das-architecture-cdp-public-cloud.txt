DAS architecture
In a CDP public cloud deployment, DAS is available as one of the many Cloudera Runtime
  services within the Data Engineering template. To use DAS, create a Data Hub cluster from the
  Management Console, and select the Data Engineering template from the
   Cluster Definition dropdown menu.
Each Data Hub cluster that is deployed using the Data Engineering template has an instance of
   Hive Metastore (HMS), HiveServer2 (HS2), and DAS. The HMS communicates with the Hive RDS in the
   Data Lake for storing the metadata information. It also communicates with Ranger in the Data Lake
   for authorization. Hive is configured to use the HMS in the Data Hub cluster, and Ranger in the
   Data Lake cluster.
DAS comprise of an Event Processor and a Webapp. The Event Processor processes Hive and Tez
   events, and also replicates the metadata. The Webapp serves as the DAS UI. It serves data from
   the local Postgres instance which is populated by the event processor, and uses the HiveServer2
   to run Hive queries triggered through the Query Compose page. The Event
   Processor communicates with the Data Hub HS2 instance for the repl dump operation, and reads the
   events published by Hive and Tez from the cloud storage (S3 or ADLS).
The following diagram shows the components inside the Data Hub cluster which use the shared
   resources within the Data Lake, such as Ranger, Hive RDS, and the cloud storage:
