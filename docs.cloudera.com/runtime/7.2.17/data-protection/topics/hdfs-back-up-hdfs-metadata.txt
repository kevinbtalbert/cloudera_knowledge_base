Back up HDFS metadata
You can back up HDFS metadata without taking down either HDFS or the
        NameNodes.

Prepare to back up the HDFS metadataRegardless of the solution, a full, up-to-date continuous backup of the                         namespace is not possible. Some of the most recent data is always lost. HDFS                         is not an Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) system. Most data can be                         easily recreated if you re-run Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) or processing                         jobs.Backing up NameNode metadataYou must back up the VERSION file and then back up the NameNode metadata.Back up HDFS metadata using Cloudera ManagerHDFS metadata backups can be used to restore a NameNode when both NameNode roles have     failed. In addition, Cloudera recommends backing up HDFS metadata before a major     upgrade.Restoring NameNode metadataIf both the NameNode and the secondary NameNode were to suddenly go offline, you can     restore the NameNode.Restore HDFS metadata from a backup using Cloudera ManagerWhen both the NameNode hosts have failed, you can use Cloudera Manager to restore HDFS     metadata.Perform a backup of the HDFS metadataYou can back up HDFS metadata without affecting the                 availability of NameNode.Parent topic: Backing up HDFS metadata
