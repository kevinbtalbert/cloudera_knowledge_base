HDFS commands for metadata files and directories
You can use HDFS commands to manipulate metadata files and
                directories.

hdfs namenode

Automatically saves a new checkpoint at NameNode startup. As stated
                            earlier, checkpointing is the process of merging any outstanding edit
                            logs with the latest fsimage, saving the full state to a
                            new fsimage file, and rolling edits. Rolling
                                edits means finalizing the current
                                edits_inprogress and starting a new one.

hdfs dfsadmin -safemode enter
hdfs dfsadmin -saveNamespace

Saves a new checkpoint (similar to restarting NameNode) while the
                            NameNode process remains running. The NameNode must be in safe mode, and
                            all attempted write activity fails while this command runs.

hdfs dfsadmin -rollEdits

Manually rolls edits. Safe mode is not required.
This can be useful if a standby NameNode is lagging behind the active
                            NameNode and you want it to get caught up more quickly. The standby
                            NameNode can only read finalized edit log segments, not the current in
                            progress edits file.

hdfs dfsadmin -fetchImage

Downloads the latest fsimage from the NameNode. This can
                            be helpful for a remote backup type of scenario.
