Configuring HDFS trash
The Hadoop trash feature helps prevent accidental deletion of files and directories. 
When you delete a file in HDFS, the file is not immediately expelled from HDFS. Deleted files
      are first moved to the /user/<username>/.Trash/Current directory, with
      their original filesystem path being preserved. After a user-configurable period of time
        (fs.trash.interval), a process known as trash checkpointing renames the
        Current directory to the current timestamp, that is,
        /user/<username>/.Trash/<timestamp>. The checkpointing process
      also checks the rest of the .Trash directory for any existing timestamp
      directories and removes them from HDFS permanently. You can restore files and directories in
      the trash simply by moving them to a location outside the .Trash
      directory.
importantThe trash feature is enabled by default. Cloudera recommends that
      you enable it on all production clusters.
      
    

Trash behavior with HDFS Transparent Encryption enabledYou can delete files or directories that are part of an HDFS encryption zone. Moving         and renaming files or directories is an important part of trash handling in HDFS. Enabling and disabling trashYou can use Cloudera Manager to enable and disable HDFS trash.Setting the trash intervalYou can use Cloudera Manager to specify the time period after which a trash         checkpoint directory is deleted.Parent topic: Data protection
