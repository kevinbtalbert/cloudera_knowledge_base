Create snapshots using Cloudera Manager
You can use Cloudera Manager to create snapshots on a snapshottable
        directory.

From the Clusters tab, select the HDFS
                    service.

Go to the File Browser tab.

Go to the directory for which you want to create the snapshot.

Click the drop-down menu next to the full path name and select Take
                        Snapshot.
The Take Snapshot screen displays.

Enter a name for the snapshot.

Click OK.
The Take Snapshot button is present, enabling an
                    immediate snapshot of the directory.

To take a snapshot, click Take Snapshot, specify the
                    name of the snapshot, and click Take Snapshot. 
The snapshot is added to the snapshot list. Any snapshots that have been taken
                    are listed by the time at which they were taken, along with their names and a
                    menu button.
