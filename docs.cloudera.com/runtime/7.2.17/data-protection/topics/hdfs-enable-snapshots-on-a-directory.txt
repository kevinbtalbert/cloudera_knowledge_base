Enable snapshot creation on a directory
You must enable snapshot creation on a directory before creating snapshots on that
        directory. If the snapshot creation is enabled, the directory becomes
            snapshottable.


You can perform this task only if you have the superuser privilege.
You cannot enable snapshot creation on any directory if its parent or child
                    directory is already enabled for snapshot creation.



Run the hdfs dfsadmin command with the
                        -allowSnapshot option and specify the directory on which
                    you want to enable snapshot creation.
The following example shows how you can enable snapshot creation for the
                    directory
                        /data/dir1:hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot /data/dir1If
                        snapshot creation is successfully enabled on the specified directory, a
                        confirmation message
                        appears.Allowing snapshot on /data/dir1 succeeded
