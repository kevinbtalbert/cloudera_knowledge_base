Persistence of HDFS metadata is implemented using fsimage file and edits files.
note
Do not attempt to modify metadata directories or files. Unexpected
                    modifications can cause HDFS downtime, or even permanent data loss. This
                    information is provided for educational purposes only.

Persistence of HDFS metadata broadly consist of two categories of files:

fsimage

Contains the complete state of the file system at a point in time.
                            Every file system modification is assigned a unique, monotonically
                            increasing transaction ID. An fsimage file represents the
                            file system state after all modifications up to a specific transaction
                            ID.

edits file

Contains a log that lists each file system change (file creation,
                            deletion or modification) that was made after the most recent
                                fsimage.


Checkpointing is the process of merging the content of the most recent
                    fsimage, with all edits applied after that
                    fsimage is merged, to create a new fsimage.
                Checkpointing is triggered automatically by configuration policies or manually by
                HDFS administration commands.

NameNodesUnderstand the HDFS metadata directory details taken from a NameNode.JournalNodesUnderstand the components of the JournalNode metadata directory.DataNodesAlthough DataNodes do not contain metadata about the directories and files                     stored in an HDFS cluster, they do contain a small amount of metadata about the                     DataNode itself and its relationship to a cluster.
