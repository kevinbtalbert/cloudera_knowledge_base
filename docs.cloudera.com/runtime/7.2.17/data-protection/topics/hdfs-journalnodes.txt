JournalNodes
Understand the components of the JournalNode metadata directory.
In an HA deployment, edits are logged to a separate set of
                    daemons called JournalNodes. A JournalNode’s metadata directory is configured by
                    setting dfs.journalnode.edits.dir. The JournalNode contains
                    a VERSION file, multiple edits__ files and an
                        edits_inprogress_, just like the NameNode. The
                    JournalNode does not have fsimage files or
                        seen_txid. In addition, it contains several other files
                    relevant to the HA implementation. These files help prevent a split-brain
                    scenario, in which multiple NameNodes could think they are active and all try to
                    write edits.

committed-txid

Tracks last transaction ID committed by a NameNode.

last-promised-epoch

Contains the “epoch,” which is a monotonically increasing number.
                                When a new NameNode, starts as active, it increments the epoch and
                                presents it in calls to the JournalNode. This scheme is the
                                NameNode’s way of claiming that it is active and requests from
                                another NameNode, presenting a lower epoch, must be ignored.

last-writer-epoch

Contains the epoch number associated with the writer who last
                                actually wrote a transaction.

paxos

Specifies the directory that temporary files used in the
                                implementation of the Paxos distributed consensus protocol. This
                                directory often appears as empty.
