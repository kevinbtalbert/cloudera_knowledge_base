Perform a backup of the HDFS metadata
You can back up HDFS metadata without affecting the
                availability of NameNode.Make sure the Standby NameNode checkpoints the namespace to
                            fsimage_ once per hour.
            
         
Deploy monitoring on both NameNodes to confirm that checkpoints are triggering
                    regularly.
This helps reduce the amount of missing transactions in the event that you
                    need to restore from a backup containing only fsimage files
                    without subsequent edit logs. It is good practice to monitor this because edit
                    logs that are large in size and without checkpoints can cause long delays after
                    a NameNode restart while it replays those transactions.

Back up the most recent “fsimage_*” and
                        “fsimage_*.md5” from the standby NameNode
                    periodically.
Try to keep the latest version of the file on another machine in the
                    cluster.

Back up the VERSION file from the standby NameNode.
