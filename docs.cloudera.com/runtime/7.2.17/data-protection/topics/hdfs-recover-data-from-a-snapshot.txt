Recover data from a snapshot
If data is erroneously removed from a directory for which snapshots are available,
        you can recover the lost data using snapshots. The snapshot ensures that the file blocks
        corresponding to the deleted files or directories are not removed from the file system. Only
        the metadata is modified to reflect the deletion.
You must have read access to the files or directories that you want to
            restore.

Run the hdfs dfs command with the cp option
                    to copy the deleted data from the snapshot to the destination directory.
The following example shows how you can recover a file
                        imp_details.xls from a snapshot of the directory
                        (/data/dir1) that contained the
                    file:hdfs dfs -cp /data/dir1/.snapshot/s20180412-065533.159/imp_details.xls /data/dir1/
