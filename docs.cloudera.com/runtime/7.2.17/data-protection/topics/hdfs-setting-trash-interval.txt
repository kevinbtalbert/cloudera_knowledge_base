Setting the trash interval
You can use Cloudera Manager to specify the time period after which a trash
        checkpoint directory is deleted.

Go to the HDFS service.

Click the Configurations tab.

Select Scope > NameNode.

Specify the Filesystem Trash Interval property, which controls the
                    number of minutes after which a trash checkpoint directory is deleted and the
                    number of minutes between trash checkpoints. 
For example, to enable trash so that deleted files are deleted after 24 hours,
                    set the value of the Filesystem Trash Interval property to 1440.noteThe
                        trash interval is measured from the point at which the files are moved to
                        trash, not from the last time the files were modified.
To apply this configuration property to other role groups as needed, edit the
                    value for the appropriate role group.

Restart all NameNodes.
