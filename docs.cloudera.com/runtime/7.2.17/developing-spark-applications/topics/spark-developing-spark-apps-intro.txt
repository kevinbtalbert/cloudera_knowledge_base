Introduction
 Apache Spark enables you to quickly develop applications and process jobs. 
Apache Spark is designed for fast application development and processing.
      Spark Core is the underlying execution engine; other services, such as
      Spark SQL, MLlib, and Spark Streaming, are built on top of the Spark
      Core.
Depending on your use case, you can extend your use of Spark into several
      domains, including the following:


Spark DataFrames


Spark SQL


Calling Hive user-defined functions from Spark SQL


Spark Streaming


Accessing HBase tables, HDFS files, and ORC data (Hive)


Using custom libraries
