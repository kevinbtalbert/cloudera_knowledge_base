Enabling Native Acceleration For MLlib

 MLlib algorithms are compute intensive and benefit from hardware
      acceleration. To enable native acceleration for MLlib, perform the
      following tasks. 
Install Required Software

 Install the appropriate libgfortran 4.6+ package
            for your operating system. No compatible version is available for
            RHEL 6.
            
               

 OS 
 Package Name 
 Package Version 



 RHEL 7.1 
 libgfortran 
 4.8.x 


 SLES 11 SP3 
 libgfortran3 
 4.7.2 


 Ubuntu 12.04 
 libgfortran3 
 4.6.3 


 Ubuntu 14.04 
 libgfortran3 
 4.8.4 


 Debian 7.1 
 libgfortran3 
 4.7.2 



 Install the GPL Extras parcel or package. 


Verify Native Acceleration

          You can verify that native acceleration is working by examining logs after running an
          application. To verify native acceleration with an MLlib example application:
          
 Do the steps in "Running a Spark MLlib Example." 


                Check the logs. If native libraries are not loaded successfully, you see the
                following four warnings before the final line, where the RMSE is printed:
              
15/07/12 12:33:01 WARN BLAS: Failed to load implementation from: com.github.fommil.netlib.NativeSystemBLAS
15/07/12 12:33:01 WARN BLAS: Failed to load implementation from: com.github.fommil.netlib.NativeRefBLAS
15/07/12 12:33:01 WARN LAPACK: Failed to load implementation from: com.github.fommil.netlib.NativeSystemLAPACK
15/07/12 12:33:01 WARN LAPACK: Failed to load implementation from: com.github.fommil.netlib.NativeRefLAPACK
Test RMSE = 1.5378651281107205.

                You see this on a system with no libgfortran. The same error
                occurs after installing libgfortran on RHEL 6 because it installs
                version 4.4, not 4.6+.
              

                After installing libgfortran 4.8 on RHEL 7, you should see
                something like this:
15/07/12 13:32:20 WARN BLAS: Failed to load implementation from: com.github.fommil.netlib.NativeSystemBLAS
15/07/12 13:32:20 WARN LAPACK: Failed to load implementation from: com.github.fommil.netlib.NativeSystemLAPACK
Test RMSE = 1.5329939324808561.
