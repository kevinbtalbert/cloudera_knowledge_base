Accessing external storage from Spark

 Spark can access all storage sources supported by Hadoop, including a
      local file system, HDFS, HBase, Amazon S3, and Microsoft ADLS. 
 Spark supports many file types, including text files,
        RCFile, SequenceFile, Hadoop
        InputFormat, Avro, Parquet, and compression of all
      supported files. 
 For developer information about working with external storage, see
        External Datasets in the upstream
      Apache Spark RDD Programming Guide.
