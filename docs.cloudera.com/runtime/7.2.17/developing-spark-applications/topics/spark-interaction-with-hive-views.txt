Interacting with Hive views

 When a Spark job accesses a Hive view, Spark must have privileges to
      read the data files in the underlying Hive tables. Currently, Spark cannot
      use fine-grained privileges based on the columns or the
        WHERE clause in the view definition. If Spark does not
      have the required privileges on the underlying data files, a SparkSQL
      query against the view returns an empty result set, rather than an error.
