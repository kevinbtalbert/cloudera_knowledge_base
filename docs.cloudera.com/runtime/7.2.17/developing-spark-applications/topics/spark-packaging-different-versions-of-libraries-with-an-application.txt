Packaging different versions of libraries with an Apache Spark
    application

 To use a version of a library in your application that is different
      than the version of that library that is shipped with Spark, use the Apache Maven Shade Plugin. This
      process is technically known as relocation, and often referred to as
      shading. 

        See Relocating Classes for an example.
