Configuring HDFS High Availability
The HDFS NameNode High Availability (HA) feature enables you to run redundant
    NameNodes in the same cluster in an Active/Passive configuration with a hot standby. This
    eliminates the NameNode as a potential single point of failure (SPOF) in an HDFS
    cluster.
In a standard configuration, the NameNode is a single point of failure (SPOF) in an HDFS
      cluster. Each cluster has a single NameNode, and if that machine or process becomes
      unavailable, the cluster as a whole is unavailable until the NameNode is either restarted or
      brought up on a separate machine. This situation impacts the total availability of the HDFS
      cluster in two major ways:


In the case of an unplanned event such as a machine crash, the cluster would be unavailable until an 
              operator restarted the NameNode.


Planned maintenance events such as software or hardware upgrades on the NameNode machine would result 
              in periods of cluster downtime.


HDFS NameNode HA avoids this by facilitating either a fast failover to a standby NameNode
      during machine crash, or a graceful administrator-initiated failover during planned
      maintenance. 

NameNode architectureIn a typical HA cluster, two different machines are configured as NameNodes. In a       working cluster, one of the NameNode machine is in the Active state,       and the other is in the Standby state.Preparing the hardware resources for HDFS High AvailabilityMake sure that you prepare the required hardware resources for High Availability.Using Cloudera Manager to manage HDFS HAYou can use Cloudera Manager to configure your CDP cluster for HDFS HA and automatic         failover. Administrative commandsThe subcommands of hdfs haadmin are extensively used for       administering an HA cluster.Parent topic: High Availability on HDFS clusters
