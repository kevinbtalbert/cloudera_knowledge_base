Configuring the Hive Metastore to use HDFS HA
The Hive metastore can be configured to use HDFS high availability by using Cloudera
    Manager or by using the command-line for unmanaged clusters.In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to the
          Hive service.
Select Actions > Stop. 

noteYou may want to stop the Hue and Impala services first, if present, as they depend
            on the Hive service.

Click Stop again to confirm the command.
Back up the Hive metastore database.Select
              Actions > Update Hive
              Metastore NameNodes and confirm the
          command.Select
              Actions > Start
          and click Start to confirm the command.Restart the Hue and Impala services if you stopped them prior to
          updating the metastore.
