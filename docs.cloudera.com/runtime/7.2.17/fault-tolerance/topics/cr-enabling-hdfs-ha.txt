Enabling HDFS HA
An HDFS high availability (HA) cluster uses two NameNodes -- an active NameNode and a
    standby NameNode. Only one NameNode can be active at any point in time.
 HDFS HA depends on maintaining a log of all namespace modifications in a location available
      to both NameNodes, so that in the event of a failure, the standby NameNode has up-to-date
      information about the edits and location of blocks in the cluster. importantEnabling and disabling HA causes a service outage for the HDFS service and all
          services that depend on HDFS. Before enabling or disabling HA, ensure that there are
        no jobs running on your cluster.
