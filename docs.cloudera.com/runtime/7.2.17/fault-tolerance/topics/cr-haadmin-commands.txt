Additional HDFS haadmin commands to administer the cluster
After your HA NameNodes are configured and started, you will have access to some
        additional commands to administer your HA HDFS cluster.

The following are high-level uses of some important subcommands. For specific usage
                information of each subcommand, you should run hdfs haadmin -help
                    <command>.

getservicestate
Determine whether the given NameNode is active or standby
Connect to the provided NameNode to determine its current state, printing either
                "standby" or "active" to STDOUT as appropriate. This subcommand
                might be used by cron jobs or monitoring scripts which need to
                behave differently based on whether the NameNode is currently active or standby.

checkhealth
Check the health of the given NameNode
Connect to the provided NameNode to check its health. The NameNode is capable of
                performing some diagnostics on itself, including checking if internal services are
                running as expected. This command will return 0 if the NameNode is healthy, non-zero
                otherwise. One might use this command for monitoring purposes.
