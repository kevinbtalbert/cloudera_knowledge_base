NameNode architecture
In a typical HA cluster, two different machines are configured as NameNodes. In a
      working cluster, one of the NameNode machine is in the Active state,
      and the other is in the Standby state.
The Active NameNode is responsible for all client operations in the cluster, while the
                  Standby NameNode acts as a backup. The Standby machine maintains enough state to
                  provide a fast failover (if required).
In order for the Standby node to keep its state synchronized with the Active node, both
                  nodes communicate with a group of separate daemons called JournalNodes (JNs). When the Active node performs any namespace
                  modification, the Active node durably logs a modification record to a majority of
                  these JNs. The Standby node reads the edits from the JNs and continuously watches
                  the JNs for changes to the edit log. Once the Standby Node observes the edits, it
                  applies these edits to its own namespace. When using QJM, JournalNodes act as the
                  shared editlog storage. In a failover event, the Standby ensures that it has read
                  all of the edits from the JounalNodes before promoting itself to the Active state.
                  (This mechanism ensures that the namespace state is fully synchronized before a
                  failover completes.)
note
Secondary NameNode is not required in HA configuration because the Standby node also performs 
            the tasks of the Secondary NameNode.

To provide a fast failover, it is also necessary that the Standby node has up-to-date
         information on the location of blocks in your cluster. To get accurate information about
         the block locations, DataNodes are configured with the location of all the NameNodes, and
         send block location information and heartbeats to all the NameNode machines.



It is vital for the correct operation of an HA cluster that only one of the NameNodes
                  should be Active at a time. Failure to do so would cause the namespace state to
                  quickly diverge between the NameNode machines, thus causing potential data loss.
                  (This situation is referred to as a split-brain
                  scenario.)
To prevent the split-brain scenario, the JournalNodes allow only one NameNode to be a
                  writer at a time. During failover, the NameNode, that is chosen to become active,
                  takes over the role of writing to the JournalNodes. This process prevents the
                  other NameNode from continuing in the Active state and thus lets the new Active
                  node proceed with the failover safely.
