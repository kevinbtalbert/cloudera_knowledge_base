Cloudera Manager metrics overview
Cloudera Manager provides a default metric store for Streams Messaging Manager (SMM).
  SMM fetches the required metrics from Cloudera Manager whenever required and caches the subset of
  metrics in the SMM server for which the historical values appear in the SMM UI. The cache
  refreshes every minute. 
A metric is a property that can be measured to quantify the state of an entity or
   activity. They include properties such as the number of open file descriptors or CPU utilization
   percentage across your cluster.
Cloudera Manager monitors a number of performance metrics for services and role
   instances running on your clusters. These metrics are monitored against configurable thresholds
   and can be used to indicate whether a host is functioning as expected or not. You can view these
   metrics in the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
Cloudera agents collect the metrics from individual brokers and report them to
   Cloudera Manager once in a minute (through Heartbeat). The collected metrics are stored in the
   Cloudera Manager level database to query or search for historical data.
