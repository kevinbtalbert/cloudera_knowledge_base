Nginx configuration for Prometheus
Prometheus does not, by default, support TLS encryption for connections to Prometheus
  instances. If you want to enforce TLS encryption for the connections, you can use Prometheus in
  conjunction with a reverse proxy and apply TLS at the proxy layer. You can use any reverse proxy,
  but in this guide you see an Nginx example.
For details about securing Prometheus using TLS encryption, see Prometheus documentation.noteIn the above linked
        documentation it is presumed that you want to run Ningx in the 443 port. If it is not the
        case (for example, it runs on 9443 port), it is not necessary to run Nginx as
          root. However, you must pay attention to the following things:
Ensure that the nginx user has access to the TLS certificates.
The web.external-url parameter of the Prometheus start command must
            contain the port number. For example,
            --web.external-url=https://myprometheus.com:9443/prometheus

After you configure a server for Prometheus, you may want to disable the default server in
   Nginx configuration. The following example shows the default server commented
   out:#    server {
#        listen       80 default_server;
#        listen       [::]:80 default_server;
#        server_name  _;
#        root         /usr/share/nginx/html;
#
#        # Load configuration files for the default server block.
#        include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;
#
#        location / {
#        }
#
#        error_page 404 /404.html;
#        location = /404.html {
#        }
#
#        error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
#        location = /50x.html {
#        }
#    }
