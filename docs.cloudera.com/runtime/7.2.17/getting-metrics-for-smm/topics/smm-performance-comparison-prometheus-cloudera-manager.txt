Prometheus can handle more than twice the amount of TimeSeries entities than Cloudera
     Manager while maintaining the consistency of the metrics.
Metrics queries for shorter time periods (30 minutes, 1 hour) take about half the time in
     case of Prometheus compared to Cloudera Manager.
Metrics queries for larger time periods (2 weeks, 1 month), Prometheus seems to be about 30%
     slower than Cloudera Manager.
Metric inconsistencies are not observed while testing Prometheus.
