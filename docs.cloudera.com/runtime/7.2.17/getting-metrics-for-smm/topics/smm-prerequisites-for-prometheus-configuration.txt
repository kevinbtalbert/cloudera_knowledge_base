Prerequisites for Prometheus configuration
Learn the prerequisites before you configure Prometheus for Streams Messaging Manager
  (SMM).


You must download Prometheus and install Prometheus and Prometheus node exporters for each
     Kafka broker. SMM requires system-level metrics for each Kafka broker and therefore, Prometheus
     node exporter must be configured for each Kafka broker. Cloudera only supports Linux node
     exporters.
Cloudera recommends using a dedicated Prometheus instance for SMM because other services
     querying Prometheus could use the capacity causing SMM query to timeout.
