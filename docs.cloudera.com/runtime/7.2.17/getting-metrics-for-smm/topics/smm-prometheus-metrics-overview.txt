Prometheus metrics overview
Prometheus is a metrics store that pulls metrics from different endpoints which you
  configure. Prometheus is not the default metric store for Streams Messaging Manager (SMM). If you
  want to use Prometheus as the metric store for SMM, you need to download and configure
  it.
Prometheus supports a larger number of time series entities compared to the Cloudera
   Manager metric store.
If you use Prometheus, you can configure the roll up policy, delete specific time
   series entities, and configure scrape interval and metrics retention period.
For SMM, you need to configure the following endpoints for Prometheus to pull metrics
    from:
KafkaKafka exposes a Prometheus metrics endpoint for Kafka metrics to be pulled.
Kafka ConnectKafka Connect, through configuration, exposes a Prometheus endpoint for
      Kafka connect metrics to be pulled.
Prometheus Node ExporterYou need to configure a separate Node Exporter on each Kafka
      broker host and enable Prometheus to pull the system metrics.

SMM queries Prometheus for metrics over time. Prometheus fetches the metrics from the
   endpoints.
Prometheus relies on external tools for security. For example, you can secure your
   Prometheus with Nginx in the following scenarios:
TLS
TLS with basic authentication
mTLS
