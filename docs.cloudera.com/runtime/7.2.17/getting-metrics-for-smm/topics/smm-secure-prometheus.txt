Secure Prometheus for SMM
Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) supports connecting to Prometheus servers behind a TLS
  proxy (for example, Nginx).
You can connect to Prometheus servers behind a TLS proxy in the following scenarios:
TLSSMM verifies the proxy’s certificate.
TLS with basic authenticationSMM verifies the proxy’s certificate and authenticates
      itself with username and password.
mTLSSMM verifies the proxy’s certificate and authenticates itself with its TLS
      Certificate (TLS proxy should recognize it).
