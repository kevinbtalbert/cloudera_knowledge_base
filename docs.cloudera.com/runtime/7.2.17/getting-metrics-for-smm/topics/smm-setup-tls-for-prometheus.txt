Setting up TLS for Prometheus
You need to configure Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) when a TLS proxy is configured
    over Prometheus.
You need to configure the following:
Ensure that Cloudera Manager or SMM recognizes Nginx’s TLS certificate. For details, see
      Configure SMM to recognize Prometheus’s TLS certificate.
Update the Prometheus URL in SMM settings. You must update the
      prometheus.metrics.url property to point to the TLS proxy’s endpoint (for
     example, https://myprometheus.com:9443/prometheus) and restart SMM.

Cloudera recommends using         the auto-TLS feature for CDP clusters.Parent topic: Secure Prometheus for SMM
