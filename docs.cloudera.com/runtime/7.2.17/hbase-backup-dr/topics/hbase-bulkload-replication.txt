Configure bulk load replication
Bulk loading is the process of preparing and loading HFiles directly into HBase
        RegionServers bypassing the write path. If you bulk load data into HBase frequently and want
        to replicate this data, you must configure and use bulk load replication.
Because bulk loading data bypasses the write path, and this process does not generate
            WALs, your data will not be replicated to the backup cluster.
