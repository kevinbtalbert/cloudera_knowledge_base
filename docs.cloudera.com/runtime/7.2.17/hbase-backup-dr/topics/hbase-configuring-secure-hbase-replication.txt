Configuring secure HBase replication
You must configure cross realm support for Kerberos, ZooKeeper, and Hadoop to
        configure secure HBase replication.

There must be at least one common encryption mode between the two realms. note
                    HBase peer-to-peer replication from a non-Kerberized cluster to a Kerberized
                    cluster is not supported.


Create krbtgt principals for the two realms.
For example, if you have two realms called EXAMPLE.com and
                        COMPANY.TEST, you need to add the following principelas:
                        krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@COMPANY.TEST and
                        krbtgt/COMPANY.TEST@EXAMPLE.COM

Add the two principals at both realms. 

kadmin: addprinc -e "<enc_type_list>" krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@COMPANY.TEST
kadmin: addprinc -e "<enc_type_list>" krbtgt/COMPANY.TEST@EXAMPLE.COM

Add rules creating short names in ZooKeeper:
Add a system level property in java.env, defined in the
                        conf directory. 
The following example rule illustrates how to add support for the realm called
                        EXAMPLE.COM and have two members in the principal (such as
                        service/instance@EXAMPLE.COM):-Dzookeeper.security.auth_to_local=RULE:[2:\$1@\$0](.*@\\QEXAMPLE.COM\\E$)s/@\\QEXAMPLE.COM\\E$//DEFAULTThis
                        example adds support for the EXAMPLE.COM realm
                        in a different realm. So, in the case of replication, you must add a rule
                        for the primary cluster realm in the replica cluster realm.
                            DEFAULT is for defining the default
                        rule
Add rules for creating short names in the Hadoop processes:
Add the hadoop.security.auth_to_local property in the
                        core-site.xml file in the replica cluster.
For example to add support for the EXAMPLE.COM
                    realm:<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.auth_to_local</name>
  <value>
    RULE:[2:$1@$0](.*@\QEXAMPLE.COM\E$)s/@\QEXAMPLE.COM\E$//
  DEFAULT
  </value>
</property>
