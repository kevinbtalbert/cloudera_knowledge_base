Configuring HBase snapshots
HBase snapshots enable you to take a point-in-time copy of a table with little
        performance impact on HBase. When you create and restore snapshots, it do not copy any data;
        therefore the impact is very low. In addition, you can export or copy snapshots from one
        cluster to another without significant impact on HBase because the table files are copied
        directly rather than reading table data from RegionServers.
About HBase snapshotsHBase snapshots allow you to clone a table without making data copies, and with       minimal impact on RegionServers. Exporting the table to another cluster has little impact on       the RegionServers.Manage HBase snapshots using Cloudera Operational Database CLIData backup and restore operations are important for your Cloudera Operational       Database (COD) database to support data recovery. COD CLI offers multiple commands that help       you manage the HBase snapshots on your CDP environment.Manage HBase snapshots using the HBase shellYou can manage snapshots by using the HBase shell, or you can use a shell       script.Export a snapshot to another clusterYou can export any snapshot from one cluster to another. Exporting the snapshot copies       the table's hfiles, logs, and the snapshot metadata, from the source cluster to the       destination cluster.Information and debuggingYou can use the SnapshotInfo tool to       get information about a snapshot, including status, files, disk usage, and debugging       information.
