Disable replication at the peer level
You can disable replication for a specific peer.
Use the command disable_peer ("<peerID>") to disable replication for a
   specific peer. This will stop replication to the peer, but the logs are kept for future
   reference. noteThis log accumulation is a powerful side effect of the
     disable_peer command and can be used to your advantage.
To re-enable the peer, use the command
   enable_peer(<"peerID">). Replication
   resumes.
Examples:

To disable peer 1:

disable_peer("1")

To re-enable peer 1:

enable_peer("1")
