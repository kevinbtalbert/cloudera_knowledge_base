Effects of WAL rolling on replication
Adding and removing peer clusters with unpredictable WAL rolling occurring have effects
  on the replication.
When you add a new peer cluster, it only receives new writes from the
   source cluster since the last time the WAL was rolled.
The following diagram shows the consequences of adding and removing
   peer clusters with unpredictable WAL rolling occurring. Follow the time
   line and notice which peer clusters receive which writes. Writes that
   occurred before the WAL is rolled are not retroactively
   replicated to new peers that were not participating in the cluster
   before the WAL was rolled.
