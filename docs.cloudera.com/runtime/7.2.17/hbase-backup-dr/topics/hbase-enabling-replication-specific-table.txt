Enable replication on a specific table
You can enable HBase replication for a specific table on the source
        cluster.
To enable replication for a specific table on the source cluster, run the
                enable_table_replication <table>
            command from the HBase shell on a cluster where a peer has been configured.
Running enable_table_replication
                <table> does the following:

Verifies that the table exists on the source cluster.
If the table does not exist on the remote cluster, uses the peer configuration to
                duplicate the table schema, inclusing splits, on the remote cluster.
Enables replication on that table.
