Manage HBase snapshots using Cloudera Operational Database CLI
Data backup and restore operations are important for your Cloudera Operational
      Database (COD) database to support data recovery. COD CLI offers multiple commands that help
      you manage the HBase snapshots on your CDP environment.
Using the COD CLI, you can:

Create a snapshot.
View the list of saved snapshots currently maintained. These can
            include one-off immediate snapshots, as well as scheduled policy-based snapshots.
Restore from a saved snapshot.
List all the restore operations in your CDP environment.
Delete snapshots.
