Replicate pre-exist data in an active-active deployment
You can replicate pre-exist data in an active-active deployment if you run the
            copyTable job before starting the replication.

You have to run the copyTable job before starting the replication.
                If you start the job after enabling replication, the second cluster will re-send the
                data to the first cluster, because copyTable does not
                edit the clusterId in the mutation objects.


Run the copyTable job and note the start timestamp of the
                    job.

Start replication.

Run the copyTable job again with a start time equal to the
                    start time you noted in step 1.
Some data being pushed back and forth between the two clusters; but it minimizes the amount of data.
