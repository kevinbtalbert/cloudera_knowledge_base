Using HBase replication
If your data is already in an HBase cluster, replication is useful for getting the data into additional HBase clusters.
Common replication topologiesYou must learn about the common replication topologies before you configure and deploy   HBase replication.Notes about replicationYou must consider a few things before using HBase replication.Replication requirementsBefore configuring replication, make sure your environment meets all   requirements.Deploy HBase replicationOnce you have source and destination clusters, you can enable and configure HBase         replication to use it as your data import method.Configure secure replicationSecure replication configuration is the same whether your clusters are all in the         same realm or not, with the exception of the last step.Configure bulk load replicationBulk loading is the process of preparing and loading HFiles directly into HBase         RegionServers bypassing the write path. If you bulk load data into HBase frequently and want         to replicate this data, you must configure and use bulk load replication.Create empty table on the destination clusterYou can create table on the destination cluster by extracting the schema using HBase         Shell.Disable replication at the peer levelYou can disable replication for a specific peer.Stop replication in an emergencyIf replication is causing serious problems, you can stop it while the clusters are     running.Initiate replication when data already existYou can initiate replication when data already exist by taking advantage of the         accumulation that happens when a replication peer is disabled.Effects of WAL rolling on replicationAdding and removing peer clusters with unpredictable WAL rolling occurring have effects   on the replication.Configuring secure HBase replicationYou must configure cross realm support for Kerberos, ZooKeeper, and Hadoop to         configure secure HBase replication.Restore data from a replicaRecover HBase data from a replicated cluster in a disaster recovery scenario.Verify that replication worksConfirm data has been replicated from a source cluster to a remote destination cluster.Replication caveatsNote these caveats when you use HBase replication.
