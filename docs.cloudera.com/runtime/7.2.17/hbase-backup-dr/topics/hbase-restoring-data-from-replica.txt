Restore data from a replica
Recover HBase data from a replicated cluster in a disaster recovery scenario.

One of the main reasons for replications is to be able to restore data, whether
                during disaster recovery or for other reasons. During restoration, the source
                and sink roles are reversed. The source is the replica cluster, and the sink
                is the cluster that needs restoration. This can be confusing, especially if you are
                in the middle of a disaster recovery scenario. The following image illustrates the
                role reversal between normal production and disaster recovery.






Change the value of the column family property
                        REPLICATION_SCOPE on the sink to 0 for
                    each column to be restored, so that its data will not be replicated during the
                    restore operation.

Change the value of the column family property
                        REPLICATION_SCOPE on the source to 1 for
                    each column to be restored, so that its data will be replicated.

Use the copyTable or distcp commands to
                    import the data from the backup to the sink cluster. 

Add the sink as a replication peer to the source, using the
                        add_peer command.

If you used distcp in step 3,restart or
                    rolling restart both clusters.
The RegionServers pick up the new files.
When restoration is complete, do the following:
Change the REPLICATION_SCOPE values back to their values
                    before initiating the restoration.
