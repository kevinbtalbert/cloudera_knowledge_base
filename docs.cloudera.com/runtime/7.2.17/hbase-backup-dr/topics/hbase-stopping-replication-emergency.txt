Stop replication in an emergency
If replication is causing serious problems, you can stop it while the clusters are
    running.
Open the shell on the source cluster and use the
   disable_peer command for each peer, then the
   disable_table_replication command. For example:
hbase> disable_peer("1")
   hbase> disable_table_replication 'table_name'
Already queued edits will be replicated after you use the
    disable_table_replication command, but new entries will not.
To start replication again, use the enable_peer
   command.
