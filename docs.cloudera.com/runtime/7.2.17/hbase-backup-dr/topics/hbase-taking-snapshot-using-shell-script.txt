Take a snapshot using a shell script
You can take a snapshot using an operating system shell script, such as a Bash script,
      in the HBase Shell noninteractive mode.
 This
         example Bash script shows how to take a snapshot in this way. This script is provided as an
         illustration only; do not use it in
         production.#!/bin/bash
# Take a snapshot of the table passed as an argument
# Usage: snapshot_script.sh table_name
# Names the snapshot in the format snapshot-YYYYMMDD

# Parse the arguments
if [ -z $1 ]||[$1 == '-h' ]; then
	echo "Usage: $0 &lt;table&gt;"
	echo "       $0 -h"
	exit 1
fi

# Modify to suit your environment
export HBASE_PATH=/home/user/hbase
export DATE=`date +"%Y%m%d"`
echo "snapshot '$1', 'snapshot-$DATE'" | $HBASE_PATH/bin/hbase shell -n 
status=$?
if [$status -ne 0]; then
	echo "Snapshot may have failed: $status"
fi
exit $status  

HBase Shell returns an exit code of 0 on successA non-zero exit code
          indicates the possibility of failure, not a definite failure. Your
          script should check to see if the snapshot was created before taking
          the snapshot again, in the event of a reported failure.
