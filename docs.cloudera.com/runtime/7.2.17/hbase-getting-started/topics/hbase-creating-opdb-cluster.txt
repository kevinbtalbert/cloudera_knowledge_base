Creating an operational database cluster
After you have set up your environment, you can create an operational database as a
        Data Hub cluster. Data Hub clusters are those clusters that you can create and manage for
        your specific use case, and it is powered by Cloudera Runtime.
You can create multiple Data Hub clusters using the same environment. For example, you
            can create an operational database cluster to replicate data from an on-prem cluster
            using HBase replication, and using the same environment you can create an operational
            database cluster that can be used for storing new data.

Default operational database cluster definitionWhen you create an operational database cluster, you can use the Operational             Database with SQL template, and the default cluster definition. The cluster can be         scaled up or down later, but the underlying cluster definition is unchanged to support the         master services and the minimum required configuration.Provision an operational database clusterYou can provision an operational database cluster that has the default cluster         definition or you can define the custom number of worker nodes that you need.
