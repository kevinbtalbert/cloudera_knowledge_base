Default operational database cluster definition
When you create an operational database cluster, you can use the Operational
            Database with SQL template, and the default cluster definition. The cluster can be
        scaled up or down later, but the underlying cluster definition is unchanged to support the
        master services and the minimum required configuration.
The cluster definition primarily defines cloud provider settings. The Operational
                Database with SQL template has the following cluster definition:


One gateway node that hosts the Knox gateway and Cloudera Manager, and
                    a ZooKeeper Server. 


One node running the HDFS NameNode, and a ZooKeeper Server. 


One node running the HBase Master, and a ZooKeeper Server.


At least three worker nodes. Each worker node has a RegionServer and a
                    DataNode.


A Phoenix Query Server runs on each worker node. 


note

You cannot access HBase, HDFS, and ZooKeeper from outside your AWS virtual
                    private cloud (VPC) or Azure VNet because there is no network connectivity from
                    outside your cloud instance. You can SSH to a node in the cluster that you
                    started, or to another node which is within the cloud instance that is provided
                    to you. The node provided to you should have the HBase client installation and
                    the required HBase configuration files.
An HDFS instance stores HBase Write Ahead Logs (WALs) because object storage
                    currently does not provide the durability guarantees that HBase requires for
                    WALs.
