Operational database cluster
You can use the Operational Database Data Hub cluster definition in CDP to create an
        operational database workload cluster that has Apache HBase, Apache Phoenix, and additional
        services that are required such as HDFS and ZooKeeper.

importantYou can create Data Hub clusters only in a CDP Public Cloud
                deployment.

Based on the CDP Environment that you select, the operational database Data Hub cluster
            uses Amazon S3 or â€ŽAzure Data Lake Storage Gen2 as the storage layer for HBase. This
            means, that the HFiles are written to the object storage, but the Write Ahead Logs
            (WALs) are written to HDFS.
Data Hub makes use of cluster definitions and reusable cluster templates. The operational
            database Data Hub cluster includes cloud-provider specific cluster definitions and
            prescriptive cluster configurations called cluster templates.
The Operational Database with SQL cluster definition consists of  Apache HBase,
            Apache Phoenix, and the underlying HDFS and Apache ZooKeeper services that it needs to
            operate. Apache Knox is used for the proxying of the different user interfaces.
Each cluster definition must reference a specific cluster template. You can also create
            and upload your custom cluster templates. For example, you can export a cluster template
            from an existing on-prem HDP cluster and register it in CDP to use it for creating Data
            Hub clusters.
