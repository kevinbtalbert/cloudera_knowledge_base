Activate read replicas on a table
After enabling read replica support on your RegionServers, configure the tables for
        which you want read replicas to be created.

After enabling read replica support on your RegionServers, configure the tables for
                which you want read replicas to be created. 


At table creation, to create a new table with read replication capabilities
                    enabled, set the REGION_REPLICATION property on the table. Use a command like
                    the following, in HBase Shell:

hbase> create 'myTable', 'myCF', {REGION_REPLICATION => '3'}


By altering an existing table, you can also alter an existing column family to
                    enable or change the number of read replicas it propagates, using a command
                    similar to the following. The change will take effect at the next major
                    compaction.

hbase> disable 'myTable'
hbase> alter 'myTable', 'myCF', {REGION_REPLICATION => '3'}
hbase> enable 'myTable'
