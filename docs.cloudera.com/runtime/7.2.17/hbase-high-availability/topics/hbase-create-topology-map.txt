Create a topology map
The topology map assigns hosts to racks. You can create a topology map using Cloudera
        Manager.

The topology map assigns hosts to racks. It is read by the topology script. A rack is
                a logical grouping, and does not necessarily correspond to physical hardware or
                location. Racks can be nested. If a host is not in the topology map, it is assumed
                to be a member of the default rack. The following map uses a nested structure, with
                two data centers which each have two racks. All services on a host that are
                rack-aware will be affected by the rack settings for the host.


If you use Cloudera Manager, do not create the map manually. Instead, go to
                        Hosts, select the hosts to assign to a rack, and
                    select Actions for Selected > Assign Rack.
