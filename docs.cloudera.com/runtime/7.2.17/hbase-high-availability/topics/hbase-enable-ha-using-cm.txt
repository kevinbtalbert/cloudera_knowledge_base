Enable HBase high availability using Cloudera Manager 
You can configure one or more backup Master role in Cloudera Manager to ensure that
        every component is highly available.

HBase administrators can configure HBase clusters with High Availability, or HA. You
                must configure HA when HBase applications require low-latency queries and can
                tolerate minimal (near-zero-second) staleness for read operations. Examples include
                queries on remote sensor data, distributed messaging, object stores, and user
                profile management.
Most aspects of HBase are highly available in a standard configuration. A cluster
                typically consists of one Master and three or more RegionServers. To ensure that
                every component is highly available, configure one or more backup Masters. The
                backup Masters run on other hosts than the active Master. 


In Cloudera Manager, select the HBase service.

Follow the process for adding a role instance and add a backup Master to a
                    different host than the one on which the active Master is running.
