Using rack awareness for read replicas
Rack awareness for read replicas is modeled after the mechanism used for rack awareness
  in Hadoop.
The default implementation, which you can override by setting
    hbase.util.ip.to.rack.determiner, to custom implementation, is
    ScriptBasedMapping, which uses a topology map and a topology script to enforce
   distribution of the replicas across racks.

Create a topology mapThe topology map assigns hosts to racks. You can create a topology map using Cloudera         Manager.Create a topology scriptThe topology script determines rack topology using the topology map.
