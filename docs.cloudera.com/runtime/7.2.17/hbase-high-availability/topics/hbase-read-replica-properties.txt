Read replica properties
You must understand the various properties to configure to enable support for read
  replicas in HBase.

Property Name
Default Value
Description



hbase.region.replica.replication.enabled
false

The mechanism for refreshing the secondary replicas. If set to false,
        secondary replicas are not guaranteed to be consistent at the row level. Secondary replicas
        are refreshed at intervals controlled by a timer
         (hbase.regionserver.storefile.refresh.period), and so are guaranteed to be
        at most that interval of milliseconds behind the primary RegionServer. Secondary replicas
        read from the HFile in HDFS, and have no access to writes that have not been flushed to the
        HFile by the primary RegionServer.
If true, replicas are kept up-to-date using replication.



hbase.regionserver.storefile.refresh.period
0 (disabled)
The period, in milliseconds, for refreshing the store files for the secondary
        replicas. The default value of 0 indicates that the feature is disabled.
        Secondary replicas update their store files from the primary RegionServer at this
        interval.If refreshes occur too often, this can create a burden for the NameNode. If
       refreshes occur too infrequently, secondary replicas will be less consistent with the primary
       RegionServer.


hbase.ipc.client.specificThreadForWriting
true
Whether or not to enable interruption of RPC threads at the client. This is required
       for region replicas with fallback RPC’s to secondary regions. The default value of
        true enables primary RegionServers to access data from other regions'
       secondary replicas.


hbase.client.primaryCallTimeout.get
10000 μs
The timeout period, in microseconds, an HBase client waits for a response before the
       read is submitted to a secondary replica if the read request allows timeline consistency. The
       default value is 10000 μs. Lower values increase the number of remote procedure calls while
       lowering latency.


hbase.client.primaryCallTimeout.multiget
10000 μs
The timeout period, in milliseconds, before an HBase client's multi-get request, such
       as HTable.get(List<GET>)), is submitted to a secondary replica if the
       multi-get request allows timeline consistency. Lower values increase the number of remote
       procedure calls while lowering latency.
