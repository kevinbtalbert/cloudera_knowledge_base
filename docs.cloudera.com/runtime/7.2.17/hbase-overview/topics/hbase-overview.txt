Apache HBase overview
Apache HBase is a scalable, distributed, column-oriented datastore. Apache HBase
    provides real-time read/write random access to very large datasets hosted on HDFS.As a natively non-relational database, Apache HBase can combine data sources that use a wide
      variety of structures and schemas. HBase is designed for resilient data storage and is
      intended for hosting very large tables with sparse data. Apache HBase can host big data tables
      because it scales linearly to handle very large (petabyte scale), column-oriented data sets.
      The data store is predicated on a key-value model that supports low latency reads, writes, and
      updates in a distributed environment.
