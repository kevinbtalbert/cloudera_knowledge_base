HBase authorization
After configuring HBase authentication, you must define rules on resources that are
  allowed to access. Apache Ranger manages access control through a user interface that ensures
  consistent policy administration across Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Data Lake
  components.
Once a user has been authenticated, their access rights must be determined. Authorization
   defines user access rights to resources. Authorization is concerned with who or what has access
   or control over a given resource or service. For example, a user may be allowed to create a
   policy and view reports, but not allowed to edit users and groups. HBase rules can be defined for
   individual tables, columns, and cells within a table. 
For more information about how to set up HBase authorization using Ranger, see Configure
    a Resource-based Service: HBase, and then Configure a Resource-based Policy:
    HBase.
