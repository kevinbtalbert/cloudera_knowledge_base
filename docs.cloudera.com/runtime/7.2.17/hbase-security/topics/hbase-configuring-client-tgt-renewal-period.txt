Configure the HBase client TGT renewal period
 You must configure the HBase Client TGT Renewal Period to a value that allows the user
  enough time to finish HBase client processes.
An HBase client user must have a Kerberos principal which typically has a password that only
   the user knows. Configure the maxrenewlife setting for the client's principal to
   a value that allows the user enough time to finish HBase client processes before the ticket
   granting ticket (TGT) expires.
For example, if the HBase client processes require up to four days to complete, you should
   create the user's principal and configure the maxrenewlife setting by using this
   command:kadmin: addprinc -maxrenewlife 4days
