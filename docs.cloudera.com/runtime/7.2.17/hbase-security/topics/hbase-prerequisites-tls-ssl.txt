Prerequisites to configure TLS/SSL for HBase
Before configuring TLS/SSL for HBase, ensure that all prerequisites are
  fulfilled.


Before enabling TLS/SSL, ensure that keystores containing certificates
     bound to the appropriate domain names will need to be accessible on all hosts on which at least
     one HBase daemon role is running.
Keystores for HBase must be owned by the hbase group, and have permissions 0440 (that is, readable by owner and group).
You must specify absolute paths to the keystore and truststore files.
     These settings apply to all hosts on which daemon roles of the HBase service run. Therefore,
     the paths you choose must be valid on all hosts.
Cloudera Manager supports the TLS/SSL configuration for HBase at the
     service level. Ensure you specify absolute paths to the keystore and truststore files. These
     settings apply to all hosts on which daemon roles of the service in question run. Therefore,
     the paths you choose must be valid on all hosts.An implication of this is
      that the keystore file names for a given service must be the same on all hosts. If, for
      example, you have obtained separate certificates for HBase daemons on hosts node1.example.com and node2.example.com, you might have chosen to store
      these certificates in files called hbase-node1.keystore and hbase-node2.keystore (respectively). When deploying these keystores, you must give
      them both the same name on the target host â€” for example, hbase.keystore.
