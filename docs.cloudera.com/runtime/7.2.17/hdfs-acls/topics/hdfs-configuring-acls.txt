Configuring ACLs on HDFS
ACLs are enabled by default. You can use Cloudera Manager to disable ACLs based on
      your requirements.
Go to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console and navigate to the
                  HDFS service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select Scope > Service _name.

Select Category > Security.

Locate the Enable Access Control Lists property and clear
               its checkbox to disable the HDFS ACLs.

Enter a Reason for change, and then click Save
                  Changes to commit the changes. 

Restart the NameNode.
