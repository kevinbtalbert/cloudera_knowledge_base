Enable authorization for additional HDFS web UIs
You can enforce authorization for the following HDFS web UI servlets, which may
        contain sensitive data: /jmx, /stack,
            /conf, and /metrics. When you enforce authorization
        for the servlets, only the users listed in the dfs.cluster.administrators
        property can access them.
Cloudera Manager requires access to the
                /jmx and /metrics servlets and uses the
                HTTP user as well as the Service Monitor Kerberos Principal to
            access them. Make sure to add both users to dfs.cluster.administrators,
            as mentioned in Enable authorization for HDFS web UIs.

In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, go to Clusters > <HDFS service>.

Navigate to the Configurations tab and search for the
                    following property: HDFS Service Advanced
                        Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hdfs-site.xml.

Add the hadoop.security.instrumentation.requires.admin
                    property and set its value to true.

Save the configuration. 

Restart all stale HDFS services.
