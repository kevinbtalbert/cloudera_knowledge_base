Configure storage balancing for DataNodes using Cloudera Manager
You must configure certain dfs.datanode properties to enable storage
    balancing for DataNodes.Go to the HDFS service.Click the Configuration tab.Select
              Scope > DataNode.Select
              Category > Advanced.
Configure the following properties (you can use the Search box to locate the
          properties).

Enables storage balancing among the DataNode's volumes.

10737418240 (default)

The amount by which volumes are allowed to differ from each other in terms of
                      bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. The default is
                      10737418240 (10 GB).
If the free space on each volume is within this range of the other volumes,
                      the volumes will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on
                      a pure round-robin basis.

fraction

0.75 (default)
What proportion of new block allocations will be sent
                    to volumes with more available disk space than others. The allowable range is
                    0.0-1.0, but set it in the range 0.5 - 1.0 (that is, 50-100%), since there
                    should be no reason to prefer that volumes with less available disk space
                    receive more block allocations.
