Configuring storage balancing for DataNodes
You can configure HDFS to distribute writes on each DataNode in a manner that balances
    out available storage among that DataNode's disk volumes.
By default a DataNode writes new block replicas to disk volumes solely on
      a round-robin basis. You can configure a volume-choosing policy that
      causes the DataNode to take into account how much space is available on
      each volume when deciding where to place a new replica.
You can configure
how much DataNode volumes are allowed to differ in terms of bytes of
          free disk space before they are considered imbalanced, and
what percentage of new block allocations will be sent to volumes
          with more available disk space than others.
