Moving the JournalNode edits directory for a role group using
        Cloudera Manager
Depending on your requirements, you can change the location of the edits directory for
    each JournalNode in the JournalNode Default Group.

Stop all services on the cluster in Cloudera Manager.


Go to the Cluster.


Select Actions > Stop.



Find the list of JournalNode hosts.


Go to the HDFS service.


Click JournalNode under Status Summary.



Move the location of each JournalNode (jn) directory at the command
          line.


Connect to each host with a JournalNode.


Per host, copy the JournalNode (jn) directory to its new location
              with the -a option to preserve permissions.

cp -a /<old_path_to_jn_dir>/jn /<new_path_to_jn_dir>/jn



Per host, rename the old jn directory to avoid confusion.

mv /<old_path_to_jn_dir>/jn /<old_path_to_jn_dir>/jn_to_delete




Reconfigure the JournalNode Default Group.


Go to the HDFS service.


Click the Configuration tab.


Click JournalNode under Scope.


Set dfs.journalnode.edits.dir to the path of the new
                jn directory for all JournalNodes in the group.


Click Save Changes.



Redeploy the client configuration for the cluster.


Go to the Cluster.


Select Actions > Deploy Client Configuration.



Start all services on the cluster by selecting Actions > Start.

Delete the old jn_to_delete directories from the command line.
