NameNodes
NameNodes maintain the namespace tree for HDFS and a mapping of file blocks to
    DataNodes where the data is stored. 
A simple HDFS cluster can have only one primary NameNode, supported by a secondary NameNode
      that periodically compresses the NameNode edits log file that contains a list of HDFS metadata
      modifications. This reduces the amount of disk space consumed by the log file on the NameNode,
      which also reduces the restart time for the primary NameNode. A high-availability cluster
      contains two NameNodes: active and standby.

Moving NameNode rolesDepending on your cluster configuration, you can follow either of the two approaches to     migrate the NameNode role: using the Cloudera Manager wizard in a highly available cluster to     automate the migration process, or manually moving the NameNode role to a new host.Sizing NameNode heap memoryEach workload has a unique byte-distribution profile. Some workloads can use the     default JVM settings for heap memory and garbage collection, but others require tuning. You can     size your NameNode JVM if the dynamic heap settings cause a bottleneck.Remove or add storage directories for NameNode data directoriesThis is a cluster administration task where existing Namenode DataDir must be changed. Perform the following steps to change the Namenode directories with downtime.
