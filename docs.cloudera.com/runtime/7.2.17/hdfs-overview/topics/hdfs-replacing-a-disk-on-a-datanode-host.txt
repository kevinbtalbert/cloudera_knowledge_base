Replace a disk on a DataNode host
In your CDP Private Cloud Base cluster, you can replace faulty disks on the DataNode host. You
    must stop all the managed services and decommission the DataNode role instance before replacing
    the faulty disk.


Stop managed services.

Decommission the DataNode role instance.

Replace the failed disk.

Recommission the DataNode role instance.

Run the HDFS fsck utility to validate the health of HDFS.
The utility normally reports over-replicated blocks immediately after a DataNode is
          reintroduced to the cluster, which is automatically corrected over time.

Start managed services.
