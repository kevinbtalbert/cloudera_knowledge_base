Best practices for performance tuning
Review certain performance tuning guidelines related to configuring the cluster,
        storing data, and writing queries so that you can protect your cluster and dependent
        services, automatically scale resources to handle queries, and so on.
Best practices

Use Ranger security service to protect your cluster and dependent services.
 Store data using the ORC File format. Others, such as Parquet are supported,
                    but not as fast for Hive queries.
Ensure that queries are fully vectorized by examining explain plans.
