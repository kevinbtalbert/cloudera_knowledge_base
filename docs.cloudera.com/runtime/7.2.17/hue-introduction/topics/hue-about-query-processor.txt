About Hue Query Processor
The Hue Query Processor service indexes Hive and Impala query history and provides APIs
  to access them. Enabling the processor allows you to view Hive query history and query details on
  the Queries tab on the Hue Job Browser page.
noteQuery Processor is set up by default in clusters
   created using the Data Engineering template. Administrators have the privilege to add or remove
   services in Data Hub clusters.
You can enable or disable Hue to display the Queries tab by
   selecting or deselecting the Query Processor Service option in the Hue
   Advanced Configuration Snippet in Cloudera Manager.
