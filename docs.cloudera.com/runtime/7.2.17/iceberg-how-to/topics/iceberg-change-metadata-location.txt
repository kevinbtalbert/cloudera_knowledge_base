Changing the metadata location
From Hive, you can change the table metadata location, also known as the snapshot
  location.
Prerequisites



The new location must contain exactly the same metadata json file as the old
       location.


Before changing the metadata location, you must migrate the table to Iceberg.
      



After migrating a table to Iceberg, you can change the metadata location using ALTER TABLE as shown below:
   

Hive example
ALTER TABLE t set TBLPROPERTIES ('metadata_location'='<path>/hivemetadata/00003-a1ada2b8-fc86-4b5b-8c91-400b6b46d0f2.metadata.json');
