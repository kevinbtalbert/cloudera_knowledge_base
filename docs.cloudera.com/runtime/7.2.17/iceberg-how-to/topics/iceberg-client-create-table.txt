Creating an Iceberg table
A step-by-step procedure describes how to create an Apache Iceberg table from a
        client connection to Hive or Impala, or from Hue in Data Hub. You see how to access and use
        the query editor Hue to create an Iceberg table. 
In this task, from a Data Hub cluster, you open Hue, and use Hive or Impala to
            create a table. 


You must meet the prerequisites to query Iceberg tables, including obtaining
                    Ranger access permissions.



Log into CDP, and click Data Hub.






Click Hue.

Select a database.

Enter a query to create a simple Iceberg table in the default Parquet
                    format.
Hive example:
                    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ice_t1 (i int, s string, ts timestamp, d date)
STORED BY ICEBERG;Impala
                    example:CREATE TABLE ice_t2 (i int, s string, ts timestamp, d date)
STORED BY ICEBERG;
In CDP, CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE, and just CREATE TABLE, are valid from Hive. You
                    use the EXTERNAL keyword from Hive to create the Iceberg table to purge the data
                    when you drop the table. In CDP, from Impala, you must use CREATE TABLE to
                    initialize the Iceberg table.

Click  to run the query.
