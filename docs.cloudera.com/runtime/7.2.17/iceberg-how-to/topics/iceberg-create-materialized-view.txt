Materialized view feature
Using a materialized view can accelerate query execution. Creating a materialized
        view on top of Iceberg tables in CDP can further accelerate the performance. You can create
        a materialized view of an Iceberg V1 or V2 table based on an existing Hive or Iceberg table. 
The materialized view is stored in Hive ACID or Iceberg format. Materialized view source
            tables either must be native ACID tables or must support table snapshots. Automatic
            rewriting of a materialized view occurs under the following conditions:
The view definition contains the following operators only: 
TableScan
Project
Filter
Join(inner) 
Aggregate

Source tables are native ACID or Iceberg v1 or v2
The view is not based on time travel queries because those views do not
                    have up-to-date data by definition.


Hive example
The following example creates a materialized view of an Iceberg table from Hive.
drop table if exists tbl_ice;
create external table tbl_ice(a int, b string, c int) stored by iceberg stored as orc tblproperties ('format-version'='2');
                
create materialized view mat1 as
select b, c from tbl_ice for system_version as of 5422037307753150798;
The following example creates a materialized view of two Iceberg tables.  Joined
                tables must be in the same table format, either Iceberg or Hive ACID.

drop table if exists tbl_ice2;
create table tbl_ice2(a int, b string, c int) stored as orc TBLPROPERTIES ('transactional'='true');
INSERT INTO tbl_ice2 VALUES (2, 'apache', 3);

drop table if exists tbl_ice;
create external table tbl_ice(a int, b string, c int) stored by iceberg stored as orc tblproperties ('format-version'='2');
INSERT INTO tbl_acid VALUES (4, 'iceberg', 5);

create materialized view mat1 as
select tbl_ice2.b, tbl_ice2.c from tbl_ice join tbl_ice2 on tbl_ice.a = tbl_ice2.a;
The following example uses explain to examine a materialized view and then creates a materialized view of an Iceberg V1 table from Hive.
drop materialized view if exists mat1;
drop table if exists tbl_ice;

create table tbl_ice(a int, b string, c int) stored by iceberg stored as orc tblproperties ('format-version'='1');
insert into tbl_ice values (1, 'one', 50), (2, 'two', 51), (3, 'three', 52), (4, 'four', 53), (5, 'five', 54);

explain create materialized view mat1 stored by iceberg stored as orc tblproperties ('format-version'='1') as
select tbl_ice.b, tbl_ice.c from tbl_ice where tbl_ice.c > 52;

create materialized view mat1 stored by iceberg stored as orc tblproperties ('format-version'='1') as
select tbl_ice.b, tbl_ice.c from tbl_ice where tbl_ice.c > 52;
