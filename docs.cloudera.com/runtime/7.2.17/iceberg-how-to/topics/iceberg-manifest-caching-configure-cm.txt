Configuring manifest caching in Cloudera Manager
 In CDP 7.2.x, you can enable or disable manifest caching for Impala Coordinators and
  Catalogd by setting properties in Cloudera Manager.

By default, only 8 catalogs can have their manifest cache active in memory. 
To connect to more than 8 HDFS clusters, in Cloudera Manager, configure
    iceberg.io.manifest.cache.fileio-max in catalogd_java_opts and the coordinator
    impalad_embedded_java_opts. 
In the following task, you enable Iceberg manifest caching for the Impala Coordinator and
    Catalog Server.

 


Navigate to Cloudera Manager. .
 

Search for Iceberg.

By default, manifest caching is enabled, but if you have turned it off, check Impala-1 (Service-Wide) to re-enable.
