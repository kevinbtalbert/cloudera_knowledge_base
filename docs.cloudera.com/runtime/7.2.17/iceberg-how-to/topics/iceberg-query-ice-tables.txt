Select Iceberg data feature
You can read Iceberg tables from Impala as you would any table. Joins, aggregations, and
    analytical queries, for example, are supported.
  
Impala supports reading V2 tables with position deletes.
Hive or Impala example
SELECT * FROM ice_t;

SELECT count(*) FROM ice_t i LEFT OUTER JOIN other_t b
ON (i.id = other_t.fid)
WHERE i.col = 42;
