Snapshot management
In addition to time travel queries, expiring a snapshot, and using a snapshot to
  rollback to a version of a table, you can also set any snapshot to be the current snapshot from
  Hive.
Hive syntax
ALTER TABLE TBL_ICEBERG_PART EXECUTE SET_CURRENT_SNAPSHOT (<snapshot ID>)

Hive example
ALTER TABLE TBL_ICEBERG_PART EXECUTE SET_CURRENT_SNAPSHOT (7521248990126549311)
