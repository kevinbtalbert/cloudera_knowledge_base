Migrate Hive table to Iceberg feature
CDP supports table migration from Hive tables to Iceberg tables using ALTER TABLE to set
  the table properties. You set the storage_handler table property to the Iceberg storage handler. 
Impala does not support table migration in this release. The topic "Test driving Iceberg from Impala" shows how to create
   Iceberg tables from Impala tables. 
noteDo not drop or move the old table during a migration operation. Doing so
   will delete the data files of the old and new tables. Exception: If you set the table property
   'external.table.purge'='FALSE', no data loss occurs when you drop the table.
In-place table migration process
In-place table migration saves time generating Iceberg tables. There is no need to regenerate
    data files. Only metadata, which points to source data files,  is regenerated, as shown in the
    following diagram:




Hive example
ALTER TABLE table_name SET TBLPROPERTIES
('storage_handler'='org.apache.iceberg.mr.hive.HiveIcebergStorageHandler');


Changing the metadata locationFrom Hive, you can change the table metadata location, also known as the snapshot   location.Parent topic: Apache Iceberg features
