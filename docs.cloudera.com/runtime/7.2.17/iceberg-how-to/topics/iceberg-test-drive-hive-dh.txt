Test driving Iceberg from Hive
 You learn how to access the Hive demo data, which you can use to get hands-on
        experience running Iceberg queries.
  query sample airline demo data in Hue. 


You must meet the prerequisites to query Iceberg tables.
You obtained the Ranger permissions to run Hive queries.



Connect to Hive running in a Data Hub cluster.

Run the queries in the previous topic, "Hive demo data" to set up the following
                    databases: airline_ontime_iceberg, airline_ontime_orc,
                    airline_ontime_parquet.

Use the airline_ontime_iceberg database.

Take a look at the tables in the airline_ontime_iceberg database.
USE airline_ontime_iceberg;
SHOW TABLES;
Flights is the fact table. It has 100M rows and three dirmensions, ariline,

                    includes the following details:

air time


Query the demo data from Hive.
For example, find the flights that departed each year, by IATA code,
                    airport, city, state, and country. Find the average departure
                    delay.SELECT f.month, a.iata, a.airport, a.city, a.state, a.country
FROM flights f,
airports a
WHERE f.origin = a.iata
GROUP BY 
f.month,
a.iata,

a.city,
a.state,
a.country
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10000
ORDER BY AVG(f.DepDelay) DESC
