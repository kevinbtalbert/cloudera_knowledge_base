Enabling Admission Control
Enable admission control on all production clusters to alleviate
    possible capacity issues. The capacity issues could be because of a high
    volume of concurrent queries, because of heavy-duty join and aggregation
    queries that require large amounts of memory, or because Impala is being
    used alongside other Hadoop data management components and the resource
    usage of Impala must be constrained to work well. 

Navigate to
              Clusters > Impala.
In the Configuration tab, navigate to
              Category > Admission
              Control. Select or clear both the Enable Impala Admission
            Control and the Enable Dynamic Resource
            Pools. Enter a Reason for change, and then
          click Save Changes to commit the
        changes.Restart the Impala service.After completing this task, for further configuration settings,
          customize the configuration settings for the dynamic resource pools.
