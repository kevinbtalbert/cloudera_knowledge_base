Automatic Invalidation of Metadata Cache
To keep the size of metadata bounded, the Impala Catalog Server
    periodically scans all the tables and invalidates those not recently used. 

      There are two types of configurations in Catalog Server that control the automatic
      invalidation of metadata in the Catalog Server Command Line Argument Advanced
      Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) field in Cloudera Manager.
    


          Time-based cache invalidation
        

Catalogd invalidates tables that are not recently used in the
          specified time period (in seconds).
        

          The ‑‑invalidate_tables_timeout_s flag needs to be
          applied to both impalad and catalogd.
        

          Memory-based cache invalidation
        

          When the memory pressure reaches 60% of JVM heap size after a Java garbage collection
          in catalogd, Impala invalidates 10% of the least recently used
          tables.
        

          The ‑‑invalidate_tables_on_memory_pressure flag needs to
          be applied to both impalad and catalogd.
        


      Automatic invalidation of metadata provides more stability with lower chances of running
      out of memory, but the feature could potentially cause performance issues and may require
      tuning.
