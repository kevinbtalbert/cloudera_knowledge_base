Estimating memory limits
Use Cloudera Manager Chart Builder to determine memory limits for
   resource pools.
To identify what is the appropriate minimum, maximum, and default
     memory limit for each of the pools, Cloudera recommends that you run real
     queries on your datasets, and then review the memory usage during peak
     periods of this test.
After you have run a set of your real queries on your datasets, use
     Cloudera Manager Chart Builder to view charts that reflect memory usage:


On the Cloudera Manager Admin Console home page, from the
         left navigation tree, select Charts > Chart Builder:



On the Chart Builder page, enter the following query, and then
         click Build Chart:
select memory_per_node_peak from IMPALA_QUERIES where
service_name="impala"
Chart Builder then returns a chart that might look similar to
         the following example:

This type of chart can be used to determine the memory limits for a particular
         pool. Note that most queries use less than 1.2 GB per node. See Admission Control and Query Queuing
         for more information about Impala admission control.
