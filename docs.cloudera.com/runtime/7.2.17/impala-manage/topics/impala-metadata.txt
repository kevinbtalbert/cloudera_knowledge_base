Managing Metadata in Impala
This section describes various knobs you can use to control how
    Impala manages its metadata in order to improve performance and
    scalability.
On-demand Metadata With the on-demand metadata feature, the Impala coordinators pull     metadata as needed from catalogd and cache it locally. The     cached metadata gets evicted automatically under memory pressure. Automatic Invalidation of Metadata CacheTo keep the size of metadata bounded, the Impala Catalog Server     periodically scans all the tables and invalidates those not recently used. Automatic Invalidation/Refresh of MetadataIn this release, you can invalidate or refresh metadata automatically after changes to     databases, tables or partitions render metadata stale. You control the synching of tables or     database metadata by basing the process on events. You learn how to access metrics and state     information about the invalidate event processor.
