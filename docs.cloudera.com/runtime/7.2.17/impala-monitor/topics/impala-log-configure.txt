Managing Logs
You must configure the Impala log settings to change the default log
    locations, to rotate logs, or to log verbose levels.

To change log file locations: 
In Cloudera Manager, navigate to
                  Impala
                  service > Configuration.
In the search field, type
              log_dir.
Specify the new log directories for Impala Daemon,
              Catalog Server, or StateStore in the respective fields:

Impala Daemon Log Directory
Catalog Server Log Directory
StateStore Log Directory


Click Save Changes and restart
              Impala.

 To set up log rotation:
In Cloudera Manager, navigate to
                  Impala
                  service > Configuration.
In the search field, type
                max_log_files.
Specify the values for Impala Daemon, Catalog Server, or
              StateStore in the respective fields:

Impala Daemon Maximum Log Files
Catalog Server Maximum Log Files
StateStore Maximum Log Files


Click Save Changes and restart
              Impala.

 The above configuration option specifies how many log files to
            keep at each severity level (INFO,
              WARNING, ERROR, and
              FATAL).

 A value of 0 preserves all log files, in which case you would
              set up set up manual log rotation using your Linux tool or
              technique of choice. 
 A value of 1 preserves only the very latest log file. 
 The default value is 10. 

 For some log levels, Impala logs are first temporarily buffered in
            memory and only written to disk periodically. The
              --logbufsecs setting controls the maximum time
            that log messages are buffered for. For example, with the default
            value of 5 seconds, there may be up to a 5 second delay before a
            logged message shows up in the log file. 
 It is not recommended that you set --logbufsecs
            to 0 as the setting makes the Impala daemon to spin in the thread
            that tries to delete old log files. 
To specify how often the log information is written to
          disk:
In Cloudera Manager, navigate to
                  Impala
                  service > Configuration.
In the search field, type
                logbuflevel.
Specify the values for Impala Daemon, Catalog Server, or
              StateStore in the respective fields:

Impala Daemon Log Buffer Level
Catalog Server Log Buffer Level
StateStore Log Buffer Level

The default is 0, meaning that the log is immediately
              flushed to disk when Impala outputs an important messages such as
              a warning or an error, but less important messages such as
              informational ones are buffered in memory rather than being
              flushed to disk immediately. 
Click Save Changes and restart
              Impala.
To set the logging  verbose levels:
In Cloudera Manager, navigate to
                  Impala
                  service > Configuration.
In the search field, type
              GLOG_v.
Specify the values for Impala Daemon, Catalog Server, or
              StateStore in the respective fields:

Impala Daemon Verbose Log Level
Catalog Server Verbose Log Level
StateStore Verbose Log Level


Click Save Changes and restart
              Impala.

 As logging levels increase, the categories of information logged
            are cumulative. For example, GLOG_v=2 records everything GLOG_v=1
            records, as well as additional information. 
 Increasing logging levels imposes performance overhead and
            increases log size. Cloudera recommends
            using GLOG_v=1 for most cases: this level has minimal performance
            impact but still captures useful troubleshooting information. 
 Additional information logged at each level of
              GLOG_v is as follows: 

 1: The default level. Logs information about each connection
              and query that is initiated to an impalad
              instance, including runtime profiles. 
 2: Everything from the previous level plus information for each
              RPC initiated. This level also records query execution progress
              information, including details on each file that is read. 
 3: Everything from the previous level plus logging of every row
              that is read. This level is only applicable for the most serious
              troubleshooting and tuning scenarios, because it can produce
              exceptionally large and detailed log files, potentially leading to
              its own set of performance and capacity problems. 

note For performance reasons, Cloudera highly recommends not setting
            the most verbose logging level to 3.
