Configuring Impala Web UI
 As an administrator, you can diagnose issues with each daemon on a particular host, or
    perform other administrative actions such as cancelling a running query from the built-in web
    server's UI. The built-in web server is inlcuded within each of the Impala-related daemons. By
    default, these web servers are enabled. You can turn them off in a high-security configuration
    where it is not appropriate for users to have access to this kind of monitoring information
    through a web interface.Enabling and Disabling Access to Impala Web Servers
 By default, these web servers are enabled. You might turn them off in
        a high-security configuration where it is not appropriate for users to
        have access to this kind of monitoring information through a web
        interface. 
To enable or disable Impala Web Servers for Web UI in Cloudera
        Manager:

Impala Daemon
Navigate to
                  Clusters > Impala
                  Service > Configuration.
Select
                  Scope > Impala
                  Daemon .
Select
                  Category > Ports
                  and Addresses.
Select or clear Enable Impala Daemon Web
                Server.
Click Save Changes, and restart the
              Impala service.

Impala StateStore
Navigate to
                  Clusters > Impala
                  Service > Configuration.
Select
                  Scope > Impala
                  StateStore.
Select
                  Category > Main.
Select or clear Enable StateStore Web
                Server.
Click Save Changes, and restart the
              Impala service.

Impala Catalog Server
Navigate to
                  Clusters > Impala
                  Service > Configuration.
Select
                  Scope > Impala
                  Catalog Server.
Select
                  Category > Main.
Check or clear Enable Catalog Server Web
                Server.
Click Save Changes, and restart the
              Impala service.


Configuring Secure Access for Impala Web Servers
Cloudera Manager supports two methods of authentication for secure access to the Impala
        Catalog Server, Impala Daemon, and StateStore web servers: password-based authentication and
        SPNEGO authentication. 
Authentication for the three types of daemons can be configured
        independently.
Configuring Password Authentication

Navigate to
              Clusters > Impala
              Service > Configuration.
Search for "password" using the Search box in the
            Configuration tab. This should display the
          password-related properties (Username and Password properties) for the
          Impala Daemon, StateStore, and Catalog Server. If there are multiple
          role groups configured for Impala Daemon instances, the search should
          display all of them.
Enter a username and password into these fields.
Click Save Changes, and restart the Impala
          service.

Now when you access the Web UI for the Impala Daemon, StateStore, or
        Catalog Server, you are asked to log in before access is granted.

Enabling Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO Authentication for Web UI
 To provide security through Kerberos, Impala Web UIs support SPNEGO.
        SPNEGO is a protocol for securing HTTP requests with Kerberos by passing
        negotiation tokens through HTTP headers. 
 To enable authorization using SPNEGO in Cloudera Manager:

Navigate to
              Clusters > Impala
              Service > Configuration.
Select Scope > Impala 1
              (Service-Wid).
Select the Enable Kerberos Authentication for HTTP
            Web-Consoles field. This setting is effective only
            Kerberos is enabled for the HDFS service.
Click Save Changes, and restart the Impala
          service.

Configuring TLS/SSL for Web UI

Create or obtain an TLS/SSL certificate.
Place the certificate, in .pem format, on the hosts
          where the Impala Catalog Server and StateStore are running, and on
          each host where an Impala Daemon is running. It can be placed in any
          location (path) you choose. If all the Impala Daemons are members of
          the same role group, then the .pem file must have the
          same path on every host.
Navigate to
              Clusters > Impala
              Service > Configuration.
Search for "certificate" using the Search box in the
            Configuration tab. This should display the
          certificate file location properties for the Impala Catalog
            Server, Impala Daemon, and StateStore. If there are multiple
          role groups configured for Impala Daemon instances, the search should
          display all of them.
In the property fields, enter the full path name to the certificate file, the private
          key file path, and the password for the private key file..
Click Save Changes, and restart the Impala
          service.

importantIf Cloudera Manager cannot find the
          .pem file on the host for a specific role instance,
        that role will fail to start.
When you access the Web UI for the Impala Catalog Server, Impala
          Daemon, and StateStore, https will be used.

Opening Impala Web UIs

Navigate to
              Clusters > Impala
              Service > Configuration.Open the appropriate Web UI:Select Web

To open Catalog Server Web UI, select
                  Web UI > Impala
                  Catalog Web UI.
To open Impala Daemon Web UI:
Click the Instances tab.
