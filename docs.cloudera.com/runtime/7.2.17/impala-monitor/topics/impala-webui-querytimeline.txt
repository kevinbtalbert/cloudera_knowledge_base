Debug Web UI for Query Timeline
For a detailed report on how a query was executed and to understand the detailed
  performance characteristics of a query, you can use the built-in web serverâ€™s UI and look at the
  Gantt chart.
The Gantt chart is an alternative to the profile command and is a graphical display in the WebUI
   that renders timing information and dependencies. This chart allows you to determine where
   queries are spending time instead of looking for timing information in the profile. Once you
   identify which fragments or operators are consuming the most time you may need to look at the
   summary profile or full profile to drill down further.
In subsequent releases, the timeline will be enhanced to display additional details so that
   looking at the profiles will not be necessary.
Here is the screenshot of the Gantt chart that shows the Query timeline of a TPC_DS query.
