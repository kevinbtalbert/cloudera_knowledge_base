Setting up Data Cache for Remote Reads
When Impala compute nodes and its storage are not co-located, the
    network bandwidth requirement goes up as the network traffic includes the
    data fetch as well as the shuffling exchange traffic of intermediate
    results. To mitigate the pressure on the network, you can enable the compute
    nodes to cache the working set read from remote filesystems, such as, remote
    HDFS data node, S3, ABFS, ADLS.
To enable remote data cache as follows. 

 In Cloudera Manager, navigate to
              Clusters > Impala
              Service > .


 In the Configuration tab, select
          Enable Local Data Cache to enable the local Impala Daemon data cache for caching of remote reads.
        

In Impala Daemon Data Cache Directories, add the directories
          Impala Daemon will use for caching of remote read data.

In Impala Daemon Data Cache Per Directory Capacity, specify the
          maximum amount of local disk space Impala will use per daemon in each of the configured
          directrories for caching of remote read data.

 Click Save Changes and restart the Impala
          service.
