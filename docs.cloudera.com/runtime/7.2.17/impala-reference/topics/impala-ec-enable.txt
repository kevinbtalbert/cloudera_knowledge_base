Enable EC ReplicationCloudera Docs
Enable EC Replication
You can enable EC replication configuration cluster wide or at the bucket level or at
  file levels. The details of which can be found here.
Verify the created keys
You can use the following Ozone subcommand to verify that the keys in the bucket are erasure coded.
ozone sh key ls s3v/ecbucket
The resulting key description should contain a similar attribute: 
"replicationConfig" : {
"data" : 3,
"parity" : 2,
"ecChunkSize" : 1048576,
"codec" : "RS",
"replicationType" : "EC",
"requiredNodes" : 5
}

Set up EC policies
Once you have set up the EC replication configuration at your desired level, you can set up
    supported EC policies, using the Ozone EC subcommands, for a new directory or an already
    existing directory. If you want to use EC for existing data, set up an EC policy for the already
    existing directory and then copy the data to the directory using the distcp tool or Cloudera
    Manager's Backup and Disaster Recovery process.
