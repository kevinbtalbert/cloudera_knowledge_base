Using RCFile Data Files
 Impala supports creating and querying RCFile tables.
Creating RCFile Tables and Loading Data
 To create a table in the RCFile format, use the STORED AS
          RCFILE clause in the CREATE TABLE statement. 
 Because Impala can query RCFile tables but cannot currently write to,
        after creating RCFile tables, use the Hive shell to load the data. 
After loading data into a table through Hive or other mechanism outside
        of Impala, issue a REFRESH
          table_name statement the next time you
        connect to the Impala node, before querying the table, to make Impala
        recognize the new data. 

Query Performance for RCFile Tables
 In general, expect query performance with RCFile tables to be faster
        than with tables using text data, but slower than with Parquet tables.
      

Enabling Compression for RCFile Tables
 You may want to enable compression on existing tables. Enabling
        compression provides performance gains in most cases and is supported
        for RCFile tables. 
 The compression type is specified in the SET
          mapred.output.compression.codec command.
For example, to enable Snappy compression, you would specify the
        following additional settings when loading data through the Hive
        shell.
SET mapred.output.compression.codec=org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.SnappyCodec;
