Using SequenceFile Data Files
Impala supports creating and querying SequenceFile tables. 
Creating SequenceFile Tables and Loading Data
 To create a table in the SequenceFile format, use the STORED
          AS SEQUENCEFILE clause in the CREATE TABLE
        statement. 
 Because Impala can query SequenceFile tables but cannot currently
        write to, after creating SequenceFile tables, use the Hive shell to load
        the data. 
After loading data into a table through Hive or other mechanism outside
        of Impala, issue a REFRESH
          table_name statement the next time you
        connect to the Impala node, before querying the table, to make Impala
        recognize the new data. 

Enabling Compression for SequenceFile Tables
 You may want to enable compression on existing tables. Enabling
        compression provides performance gains in most cases and is supported
        for SequenceFile tables. 
 The compression type is specified in the SET
          mapred.output.compression.codec command.
For example, to enable Snappy compression, you would specify the
        following additional settings when loading data through the Hive
        shell.
SET mapred.output.compression.codec=org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.SnappyCodec;

Query Performance for SequenceFile Tables
 In general, expect query performance with SequenceFile tables to be
        faster than with tables using text data, but slower than with Parquet
        tables.
