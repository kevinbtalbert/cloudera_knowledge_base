Configure Impala Daemon to spill to Ozone
You can use Ozone as a scratch space for writing intermediate files
  during large sorts, joins, aggregations, or analytic function operations.
Before you begin

Identify the Ozone scratch directory where you want your new Impala to write the
    temporary data.
Identify the IP address, host name, or service identifier of Ozone.
Identify the port number of the Ozone Manager (if not-default).

Configuring the Start-up Option in Impala daemon
You can use the Impalad start option scratch_dirs to specify the locations of the
   intermediate files.
--scratch_dirs="ofs://authority/path(:max_bytes), local_buffer_dir (,local_dirâ€¦)"

Where ofs://authority/path is
    the remote directory.
authority may include ip_address or
    hostname and port, or service_id.
max_bytes is optional.

Using the above format:

You can specify only one remote directory. When you configure a remote directory, you
    must specify a local buffer directory as the buffer. However you can use multiple local
    directories with the remote directory. If you specify multiple local directories, the
    first local directory would be used as the local buffer directory.
If you configure both remote and local directories, the remote directory is only used
    when the local directories are fully utilized.
The size of a remote intermediate file could affect the query performance, and the
    value can be set by --remote_tmp_file_size=size in
    the start-up option. The default size of a remote intermediate file is 16MB while the
    maximum is 512MB.

Examples

An Ozone scratch dir with one local buffer dir, file size 64MB. The space of Ozone
    scratch dir is limited to 300G.
    --scratch_dirs=ofs://10.0.0.49:29000/tmp:300G,/local_buffer_dir --remote_tmp_file_size=64M
An Ozone scratch dir with one local buffer dir limited to 512MB, and one local dir
    limited to 10GB. The space of Ozone scratch dir is limited to 300G. The Ozone Manager
    uses its default port (9862).
    --scratch_dirs=ofs://ozonemgr/tmp:300G,/local_buffer_dir:512M,/local_dir:10G
An Ozone scratch dir with one local buffer dir, and multiple prioritized local dirs. The
    space of Ozone scratch dir is unlimited. The Ozone service identifier is ozone1.
    --scratch_dirs=ofs://ozone1/tmp,/local_buffer_dir,/local_dir_1:5G:1,/local_dir_2:5G:2

Even though max_bytes is optional, it is highly recommended to configure for spilling to
   Ozone because the Ozone cluster space is limited.
