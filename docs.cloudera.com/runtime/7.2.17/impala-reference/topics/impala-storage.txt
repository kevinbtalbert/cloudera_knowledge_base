Storage Systems Supports
This section describes the storage systems that Impala
    supports.
Impala with KuduYou can use Impala to query tables stored by Apache Kudu. This     capability allows convenient access to a storage system that is tuned for     different kinds of workloads than the default with Impala.Impala with HBaseYou can use Impala to query data residing in HBase tables, a     key-value data store where the value consists of multiple fields. The key is     mapped to one column in the Impala table, and the various fields of the     value are mapped to the other columns in the Impala table.Impala with Azure Data Lake Store (ADLS)You can use Impala to query data residing on the Azure Data Lake     Store (ADLS) filesystem and Azure Blob File System (ABFS). This capability     allows convenient access to a storage system that is remotely managed,     accessible from anywhere, and integrated with various cloud-based services. Impala with Amazon S3You can use Impala to query data residing on the Amazon S3 object     store. This capability allows convenient access to a storage system that is     remotely managed, accessible from anywhere, and integrated with various     cloud-based services.  Impala with OzoneYou can use Impala to query data files that reside on Apache Ozone distributed storage,   rather than in HDFS.
