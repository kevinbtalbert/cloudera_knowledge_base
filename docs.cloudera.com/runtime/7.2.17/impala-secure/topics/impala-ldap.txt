Configuring LDAP Authentication
Impala uses LDAP for authentication, verifying the credentials of
    each user who connects through impala-shell, Hue, a
    Business Intelligence tool, JDBC or ODBC applications.

 Authentication is the process of allowing only specified named users
        to access the server (in this case, the Impala server). This feature is
        crucial for any production deployment, to prevent misuse, tampering, or
        excessive load on the server. 
 Only the connections between clients and Impala can be authenticated
        by LDAP. 


 To enable and configure LDAP:
In Cloudera Manager, select the Impala service.In the Configuration tab, type
            ldap in the search box. The fields for LDAP
          configuration will be listed.Set the following fields to enable LDAP.


Enable LDAP Authentication (enable_ldap_auth)

Enables LDAP-based authentication between the client and
                  Impala. 

LDAP URL (ldap_uri)

Sets the URI of the LDAP server to use. Typically, the URI is
                  prefixed with ldap://. You can specify secure
                  SSL-based LDAP transport by using the prefix
                    ldaps://. The URI can optionally specify
                  the port, for example:
                    ldap://ldap_server.example.com:389 or
                    ldaps://ldap_server.example.com:636. (389
                  and 636 are the default ports for non-SSL and SSL LDAP
                  connections, respectively.) 



Set the following fields to support custom bind strings.
 When Impala connects to LDAP, it issues a bind call to the LDAP
            server to authenticate as the connected user. Impala clients,
            including the Impala-shell, provide the short name of the user to
            Impala. This is necessary so that Impala can use role-based access,
            which uses short names. 
 However, LDAP servers often require more complex, structured
            usernames for authentication. Impala supports three ways of
            transforming the short name (for example, 'henry')
            to a more complicated string. If necessary, specify one of the
            following configuration options when starting the
              impalad daemon.

Active Directory Domain (--ldap_domain)

Replaces the username with a string
                      username@ldap_domain.

 LDAP BaseDN (--ldap_baseDN)

Replaces the username with a distinguished name (DN)
                  of the form:
                    uid=userid,ldap_baseDN.
                  (This is equivalent to a Hive option).

LDAP Pattern (--ldap_bind_pattern)

This is the most general option, and replaces the username
                  with the string ldap_bind_pattern where all
                  instances of the string #UID are replaced
                  with userid. For example, an
                    ldap_bind_pattern of
                    "user=#UID,OU=foo,CN=bar" with a username
                  of henry will construct a bind name of
                    "user=henry,OU=foo,CN=bar". 


 The above options are mutually exclusive, and Impala does not
            start if more than one of these options are specified. 
Set the following fields for secure LDAP connections.
 To avoid sending credentials over the wire in cleartext, you must
            configure a secure connection between both the client and Impala,
            and between Impala and the LDAP server. The secure connection could
            use SSL or TLS. 

Secure LDAP connections through SSL:

 For SSL-enabled LDAP connections, specify a prefix of
              ldaps:// instead of ldap://.
            Also, the default port for SSL-enabled LDAP connections is 636
            instead of 389. 

Secure LDAP connections through TLS:

 TLS, the successor to the SSL protocol, is supported by most
            modern LDAP servers. Unlike SSL connections, TLS connections can be
            made on the same server port as non-TLS connections. To secure all
            connections using TLS, specify the following flags as startup
            options to the impalad daemon: 

Enable LDAP TLS (--ldap_tls_

Tells Impala to start a TLS connection to the LDAP server,
                  and to fail authentication if it cannot be done.

LDAP Server CA Certificate (--ldap_ca_certificate)

Specifies the location of the certificate in standard
                    .PEM format. Store this certificate on the
                  local filesystem, in a location that only the
                    impala user and other trusted users can
                  read.
