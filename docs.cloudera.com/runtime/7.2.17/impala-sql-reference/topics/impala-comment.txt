COMMENT statement
The COMMENT statement adds, changes, or removes a comment about a
    database, a table, or a column.
      You can alternatively use the CREATE and ALTER
      statements to add comments to the objects.
    
      You can view the comment on a database, a table, or a column using the
      SHOW or DESCRIBE statement.
    
Syntax:
COMMENT ON DATABASE db_name IS {'comment' | NULL}COMMENT ON TABLE [db_name.]table_name IS {'comment' | NULL}COMMENT ON COLUMN [db_name.]table_name.column_name IS {'comment' | NULL}
Parameters:


db_name: Specify the database name if not for the current database.
      

NULL: If given for the comment, removes the existing comment.
      

        The comment string can be up to 256 characters long.
      

Privileges required:

      To add a comment, the ALTER privilege on the object is required.
