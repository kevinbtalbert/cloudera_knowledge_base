Impala databases
 Provides information about how to manage Impala databases that are logical containers
    for a group of tables.
Each database defines a separate namespace. Creating a database is a lightweight operation. There are minimal
        database-specific properties to configure, such as
          LOCATION and COMMENT. You can
        change the owner of a database with the ALTER DATABASE
        statement.  Typically, you create a separate database for each
        project or application, to avoid naming conflicts between tables and to
        make clear which tables are related to each other. The
          USE statement lets you switch between databases.
        Unqualified references to tables, views, and functions refer to objects
        within the current database. You can also refer to objects in other
        databases by using qualified names of the form
            dbname.object_name.
         Each database is physically represented by a directory in HDFS.
        When you do not specify a LOCATION attribute, the
        directory is located in the Impala data directory with the associated
        tables managed by Impala. When you do specify a
          LOCATION attribute, any read and write operations for
        tables in that database are relative to the specified HDFS directory.
      Impala includes two predefined databases:
defaultBy default, you use the
              default database when you connect to Impala.
            Tables created in the default database are
            physically located at one level higher in HDFS than all the
            user-created databases.

            reside in this database.
