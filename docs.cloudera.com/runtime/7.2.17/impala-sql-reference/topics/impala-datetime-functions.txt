Impala date and time functions
The underlying Impala data type for date and time data is
      TIMESTAMP and DATE. Some of the datetime functions are affected by the setting of
        the
          ‑‑use_local_tz_for_unix_timestamp_conversions
        startup flag for the impalad daemon. 
This setting is off by default, meaning that functions such as
              FROM_UNIXTIME() and
              UNIX_TIMESTAMP() consider the input values to
            always represent the UTC time zone. 
This setting also applies when you CAST() a
              BIGINT value to TIMESTAMP, or a
              TIMESTAMP value to BIGINT. When
            this setting is enabled, these functions and operations convert to
            and from values representing the local time zone. See TIMESTAMP data type for details about how
            Impala handles time zone considerations for the
              TIMESTAMP data type.

 ADD_MONTHS(TIMESTAMP / DATE date, INT months),
            ADD_MONTHS(TIMESTAMP / DATE date, BIGINT months) 

Purpose: Adds months to
              date and returns the new date value. 
Return type:

 If date is TIMESTAMP,
                  returns TIMESTAMP. 
 If date is DATE,
                  returns DATE. 


Usage notes: Same as MONTHS_ADD(). Available in Impala 1.4 and
              higher. For compatibility when porting code with vendor
              extensions. 

 ADDDATE(TIMESTAMP / DATE date, INT / BIGINT days) 

Purpose: Adds days to
              date and returns the new date value.  The
                days value can be negative, which gives the
              same result as the SUBDATE() function. 

Return type:

 If date is TIMESTAMP,
                  returns TIMESTAMP. 
 If date is DATE,
                  returns DATE. 



 CURRENT_DATE() 

Purpose: Returns the current date.  Any references to the
                CURRENT_DATE() function are evaluated at the
              start of a query. All calls to CURRENT_DATE()
              within the same query return the same value, and the value does
              not depend on how long the query takes. 

Return type:
DATE


 CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() 

Purpose: Alias for the NOW() function. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


 DATE_ADD(TIMESTAMP / DATE date, INT / BIGINT days),
            DATE_ADD(TIMESTAMP / DATE date, interval_expression) 

Purpose: Adds a specified number of days to the
              date argument. 
 With an INTERVAL expression as the second
            argument, you can calculate a delta value using other units such as
            weeks, years, hours, seconds, and so on. 
Return type:

 If date is TIMESTAMP,
                  returns TIMESTAMP. 
 If date is DATE,
                  returns DATE. 


 The following examples show the shorthand notation of an
                INTERVAL expression, instead of specifying the
              precise number of days. The INTERVAL notation
              also lets you work with units smaller than a single day. 

select now() as right_now, date_add(now(), interval 3 weeks) as in_3_weeks;
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| right_now                     | in_3_weeks                    |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| 2016-05-20 11:05:39.173331000 | 2016-06-10 11:05:39.173331000 |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

select now() as right_now, date_add(now(), interval 6 hours) as in_6_hours;
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| right_now                     | in_6_hours                    |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| 2016-05-20 11:13:51.492536000 | 2016-05-20 17:13:51.492536000 |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

 Like all date/time functions that deal with months,
                date_add() handles nonexistent dates past the
              end of a month by setting the date to the last day of the month.
              The following example shows how the nonexistent date April 31st is
              normalized to April 30th: 

select date_add(cast('2016-01-31' as timestamp), interval 3 months) as 'april_31st';
+---------------------+
| april_31st          |
+---------------------+
| 2016-04-30 00:00:00 |
+---------------------+


 DATE_CMP(DATE date1, DATE date2) 

Purpose: Compares date1 and
              date2 and returns: 

0 if the dates are identical. 
 1 if date1 > date2. 
 -1 if date1 < date2. 

NULL if date1 or
                  date2 is NULL. 


Return type:
INT


 DATE_PART(STRING part, TIMESTAMP / DATE date) 

Purpose: Similar to EXTRACT(), with the
            argument order reversed. Supports the same date and time units as
              EXTRACT(). For compatibility with SQL code
            containing vendor extensions. 
Return type:
BIGINT


 DATE_SUB(TIMESTAMP startdate, INT days), DATE_SUB(TIMESTAMP
            startdate, interval_expression) 

Purpose: Subtracts a specified number of days from a
              TIMESTAMP value. With an
              INTERVAL expression as the second argument, you
            can calculate a delta value using other units such as weeks, years,
            hours, seconds, and so on.
Return type:

 If date is TIMESTAMP,
                  returns TIMESTAMP. 
 If date is DATE,
                  returns DATE. 


Examples:
 The following example shows the simplest usage, of subtracting a
              specified number of days from a TIMESTAMP value: 

select now() as right_now, date_sub(now(), 7) as last_week;
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| right_now                     | last_week                     |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| 2016-05-20 11:21:30.491011000 | 2016-05-13 11:21:30.491011000 |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

 The following examples show the shorthand notation of an
                INTERVAL expression, instead of specifying the
              precise number of days. The INTERVAL notation
              also lets you work with units smaller than a single day. 

select now() as right_now, date_sub(now(), interval 3 weeks) as 3_weeks_ago;
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| right_now                     | 3_weeks_ago                   |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| 2016-05-20 11:23:05.176953000 | 2016-04-29 11:23:05.176953000 |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

select now() as right_now, date_sub(now(), interval 6 hours) as 6_hours_ago;
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| right_now                     | 6_hours_ago                   |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| 2016-05-20 11:23:35.439631000 | 2016-05-20 05:23:35.439631000 |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

 Like all date/time functions that deal with months,
                date_add() handles nonexistent dates past the
              end of a month by setting the date to the last day of the month.
              The following example shows how the nonexistent date April 31st is
              normalized to April 30th: 

select date_sub(cast('2016-05-31' as timestamp), interval 1 months) as 'april_31st';
+---------------------+
| april_31st          |
+---------------------+
| 2016-04-30 00:00:00 |
+---------------------+


 DATE_TRUNC(STRING unit, TIMESTAMP / DATE ts) 

Purpose: Returns the ts value truncated to
            the specified unit. 
Argument: The unit argument is not
              case-sensitive. This argument string can be one of:

Usage notes:
 Although this function is similar to calling
                TRUNC() with a TIMESTAMP or
                DATE argument, the order of arguments and the
              recognized units are different between TRUNC()
              and DATE_TRUNC(). Therefore, these functions are
              not interchangeable. 
 This function is typically used in GROUP BY
              queries to aggregate results from the same hour, day, week, month,
              quarter, and so on. You can also use this function in an
                INSERT ... SELECT into a partitioned table to
              divide TIMESTAMP or DATE values
              into the correct partition. 

Return type:


TIMESTAMP if the second argument,
                    ts, is TIMESTAMP. 

DATE if the second argument,
                    ts, is DATE. 



Examples:


DATE_TRUNC('HOUR', NOW()) returns
                2017-12-05 13:00:00. 

DATE_TRUNC('MILLENNIUM', DATE'2019-08-02')
              returns 2001-01-01. 

 DATEDIFF(TIMESTAMP / DATE enddate, TIMESTAMP / DATE startdate) 

Purpose: Returns the number of days from
              startdate to enddate.  If
                enddate > startdate, the
              return value is positive. 
 If enddate < startdate,
              the return value is negative. 
 If enddate = startdate,
              the return value is zero. 

Return type:
INT


Usage notes:

 The time portions of the enddate and
                startdate values are ignored. For example,
              11:59 PM on one day and 12:01 AM on the next day represent a
                DATEDIFF() of -1 because the date/time values
              represent different days, even though the
                TIMESTAMP values differ by only 2 minutes. 

 DAY(TIMESTAMP / DATE date), DAYOFMONTH(TIMESTAMP / DATE date) 

Purpose: Returns the day value from the
              date argument. The value represents the day of
            the month, therefore is in the range 1-31, or less for months
            without 31 days.  Returns NULL for nonexistent
              dates, e.g. Feb 30, or misformatted date strings,
              e.g. '1999-02-013'. 

Return type:
INT


 DAYNAME(TIMESTAMP / DATE date) 

Purpose: Returns the day name of the date
            argument. The range of return values is 'Sunday' to
              'Saturday'. Used in report-generating queries, as
            an alternative to calling DAYOFWEEK() and turning
            that numeric return value into a string using a
              CASE expression. 
Return type:
STRING


 DAYOFWEEK(TIMESTAMP / DATE date) 

Purpose: Returns the day field of the date
            arguement, corresponding to the day of the week. The range of return
            values is 1 (Sunday) to 7 (Saturday). 
Return type:
INT


 DAYOFYEAR(TIMESTAMP / DATE date) 

Purpose: Returns the day field from the
              date argument, corresponding to the day of the
            year. The range of return values is 1 (January 1) to 366 (December
            31 of a leap year). 
Return type:
INT


 DAYS_ADD(TIMESTAMP / DATE date, INT / BIGINT days) 

Purpose: Returns the value with the number of
              days added to date. 
Return type:

 If date is TIMESTAMP,
                  returns TIMESTAMP. 
 If date is DATE,
                  returns DATE. 



 DAYS_SUB(TIMESTAMP / DATE date, INT / BIGINT days) 

Purpose: Returns the value with the number of
              days subtracted from date. 
Return type:

 If date is TIMESTAMP,
                  returns TIMESTAMP. 
 If date is DATE,
                  returns DATE. 



 EXTRACT(TIMESTAMP / DATE ts, STRING unit), EXTRACT(unit FROM
            TIMESTAMP / DATE ts) 

Purpose: Returns one of the numeric date or time fields,
            specified by unit, from ts. 
Argument: The unit argument value is not
              case-sensitive. The unit string can be one of: 



 Unit 
 Supported for TIMESTAMP ts 
 Supported for DATE ts 




'EPOCH'

 Yes 
 No 



'MILLISECOND'

Usage notes:
 Typically used in GROUP BY queries to
              arrange results by hour, day, month, and so on. You can also use
              this function in an INSERT ... SELECT statement
              to insert into a partitioned table to split up
                TIMESTAMP values into individual parts, if the
              partitioned table has separate partition key columns representing
              year, month, day, and so on. If you need to divide by more complex
              units of time, such as by week or by quarter, use the
                TRUNC() function instead. 

Return type:
BIGINT

Examples:EXTRACT(DAY FROM
              DATE'2019-08-17') returns 17.  If you
              specify 'MILLISECOND' for the
                unit argument, the function returns the
              seconds component and the milliseconds component. 

EXTRACT(CAST('2006-05-12 18:27:28.123456789' AS
                TIMESTAMP), 'MILLISECOND') returns
                28123. 

 FROM_TIMESTAMP(TIMESTAMP datetime, STRING pattern),
            FROM_TIMESTAMP(STRING datetime, STRING pattern) 

Purpose: Converts a TIMESTAMP value into a
            string representing the same value. 
Return type:
STRING

Usage notes: The FROM_TIMESTAMP()
              function provides a flexible way to convert
                TIMESTAMP values into arbitrary string formats
              for reporting purposes. 
 Because Impala implicitly converts string values into
                TIMESTAMP, you can pass date/time values
              represented as strings (in the standard yyyy-MM-dd
                HH:mm:ss.SSS format) to this function. The result is a
              string using different separator characters, order of fields,
              spelled-out month names, or other variation of the date/time
              string representation. 
 The allowed tokens for the pattern string are the same as for
              the FROM_UNIXTIME() function. 

 FROM_UNIXTIME(BIGINT unixtime[, STRING pattern]) 

Purpose: Converts the number of seconds from the Unix epoch
            to the specified time into a string in the local time zone. 
Return type:
STRING

 The pattern string supports the
              following subset of Java SimpleDateFormat. 

 Pattern 
 Description 




y

 Year 



M

 Month 



d

 Day 



H

 Hour 



m

 Minute 



s

 Second 



S

 Fractional second 



+/-hh:mm

 Time zone offset 



+/-hhmm

 Time zone offset 



+/-hh

 Time zone offset 

 The following rules apply to the
                pattern string: 
 The pattern string is case-sensitive. 
 All fields are variable length, and thus must use separators
                to specify the boundaries of the fields, with the exception of
                the time zone values. 
 Time zone offset formats must be at the end of the
                  pattern string. 
 Formatting character groups can appear in any order along
                with any separators except for the time zone offset. For
                example: 

yyyy/MM/dd


dd-MMM-yy


(dd)(MM)(yyyy) HH:mm:ss


yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss+hh:mm



 In Impala 1.3 and later, you can switch the
              order of elements, use alternative separator characters, and use a
              different number of placeholders for each unit. Adding more
              instances of y, d,
                H, and so on produces output strings
              zero-padded to the requested number of characters. The exception
              is M for months, where M
              produces a non-padded value such as 3,
                MM produces a zero-padded value such as
                03, MMM produces an
              abbreviated month name such as Mar, and sequences
              of 4 or more M are not allowed.  A date string including all fields could be
                'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS',
                'dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS', 'MMM dd,
                yyyy HH.mm.ss (SSSSSS)' or other combinations of
              placeholders and separator characters. Usage notes:
The way this function deals with time zones when converting
              to or from TIMESTAMP values is affected by the
                ‑‑use_local_tz_for_unix_timestamp_conversions
              startup flag for the impalad daemon.

 FROM_UTC_TIMESTAMP(TIMESTAMP ts, STRING timezone) 

Purpose: Converts a specified UTC timestamp value into the appropriate value for
            a specified time zone. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


Usage notes: Often used to translate UTC time zone data stored in a table back
              to the local date and time for reporting. The opposite of the
                TO_UTC_TIMESTAMP() function. 
To determine the time zone of the server you are connected to, you can call the
                TIMEOFDAY() function, which includes the time zone specifier in its
              return value. Remember that with cloud computing, the server you interact with might
              be in a different time zone than you are, or different sessions might connect to
              servers in different time zones, or a cluster might include servers in more than one
              time zone.  See discussion of time zones in TIMESTAMP data type for information about using this function
              for conversions between the local time zone and UTC. 

 HOUR(TIMESTAMP ts) 

Purpose: Returns the hour field from a
              TIMESTAMP field. 
Return type:
INT


 HOURS_ADD(TIMESTAMP date, INT hours), HOURS_ADD(TIMESTAMP date,
            BIGINT hours) 

Purpose: Returns the specified date and time plus some number
            of hours. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


 HOURS_SUB(TIMESTAMP date, INT hours), HOURS_SUB(TIMESTAMP date,
            BIGINT hours) 

Purpose: Returns the specified date and time minus some
            number of hours. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


 INT_MONTHS_BETWEEN(TIMESTAMP / DATE enddate, TIMESTAMP / DATE
            startdate) 

Purpose: Returns the number of months from
              startdate to enddate,
            representing only the full months that passed. 
Return type:
INT
Usage notes: Typically used in business
              contexts, for example to determine whether a specified number of
              months have passed or whether some end-of-month deadline was
              reached. 
 The method of determining the number of elapsed months includes
              some special handling of months with different numbers of days
              that creates edge cases for dates between the 28th and 31st days
              of certain months. See MONTHS_BETWEEN() for
              details. The INT_MONTHS_BETWEEN() result is
              essentially the FLOOR() of the
                MONTHS_BETWEEN() result. 
 If either value is NULL, which could happen for
              example when converting a nonexistent date string such as
                '2015-02-29' to a TIMESTAMP,
              the result is also NULL. 
 If the first argument represents an earlier time than the second
              argument, the result is negative. 

 LAST_DAY(TIMESTAMP / DATE ts) 

Purpose: Returns the beginning of the last calendar day in
            the same month of ts. 
Return type:

 Returns TIMESTAMP if ts
                  is of the TIMESTAMP type. 
 Returns DATE if ts is
                  of the DATE type. 

Usage notes:
 If the input argument does not represent a valid Impala
                TIMESTAMP including both date and time
              portions, the function returns NULL. For example,
              if the input argument is a string that cannot be implicitly cast
              to TIMESTAMP, does not include a date portion, or
              is out of the allowed range for Impala TIMESTAMP
              values, the function returns NULL. 

 MICROSECONDS_ADD(TIMESTAMP date, INT microseconds),
            MICROSECONDS_ADD(TIMESTAMP date, BIGINT microseconds) 

Purpose: Returns the specified date and time plus some number
            of microseconds. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


 MICROSECONDS_SUB(TIMESTAMP date, INT microseconds),
            MICROSECONDS_SUB(TIMESTAMP date, BIGINT microseconds) 

Purpose: Returns the specified date and time minus some
            number of microseconds. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


 MILLISECOND(TIMESTAMP ts) 

Purpose: Returns the millisecond portion of a
              TIMESTAMP value. 
Return type:
INT
Usage notes:

 The millisecond value is truncated, not rounded, if the
                TIMESTAMP value contains more than 3
              significant digits to the right of the decimal point. 

 MILLISECONDS_ADD(TIMESTAMP date, INT milliseconds),
            MILLISECONDS_ADD(TIMESTAMP date, BIGINT milliseconds) 

Purpose: Returns the specified date and time plus some number
            of milliseconds. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


 MILLISECONDS_SUB(TIMESTAMP date, INT milliseconds),
            MILLISECONDS_SUB(TIMESTAMP date, BIGINT milliseconds) 

Purpose: Returns the specified date and time minus some
            number of milliseconds. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


 MINUTE(TIMESTAMP date) 

Purpose: Returns the minute field from a
              TIMESTAMP value. 
Return type:
INT


 MINUTES_ADD(TIMESTAMP date, INT minutes), MINUTES_ADD(TIMESTAMP
            date, BIGINT minutes) 

Purpose: Returns the specified date and time plus some number
            of minutes. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


 MINUTES_SUB(TIMESTAMP date, INT minutes), MINUTES_SUB(TIMESTAMP
            date, BIGINT minutes) 

Purpose: Returns the specified date and time minus some
            number of minutes. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


 MONTH(TIMESTAMP / DATE date) 

Purpose: Returns the month field, represented as an integer,
            from the date argument. 
Return type:
INT


 MONTHNAME(TIMESTAMP / DATE date) 

Purpose: Returns the month name of the
              date argument. 
Return type:
STRING


 MONTHS_ADD(TIMESTAMP / DATE date, INT / BIGINT months) 

Purpose: Returns the value with the number of
              months added to date. 
Return type:

 If date is TIMESTAMP,
                  returns TIMESTAMP. 
 If date is DATE,
                  returns DATE. 



Usage notes:

 If date is the last day of a month, the
              return date will fall on the last day of the target month, e.g.
                MONTHS_ADD(DATE'2019-01-31', 1) returns
                DATE'2019-02-28'. 

 MONTHS_BETWEEN(TIMESTAMP / DATE enddate, TIMESTAMP / DATE
            startdate) 

Purpose: Returns the number of months from
              startdate to enddate. 
 This result can include a fractional part representing extra days
            in addition to the full months between the dates. The fractional
            component is computed by dividing the difference in days by 31
            (regardless of the month). 
Return type:
DOUBLE
Usage notes:
 Typically used in business contexts, for example to
              determine whether a specified number of months have passed or
              whether some end-of-month deadline was reached. 
 If the only consideration is the number of full months and any
              fractional value is not significant, use
                INT_MONTHS_BETWEEN() instead. 
 The method of determining the number of elapsed months includes
              some special handling of months with different numbers of days
              that creates edge cases for dates between the 28th and 31st days
              of certain months. 
 If either value is NULL, which could happen for
              example when converting a nonexistent date string such as
                '2015-02-29' to a TIMESTAMP,
              the result is also NULL. 
 If the first argument represents an earlier time than the second
              argument, the result is negative. 
 The time portion of the input arguements are ignored. 

 MONTHS_SUB(TIMESTAMP / DATE date, INT / BIGINT months) 

Purpose: Returns the value with the number of
              months subtracted from date. 
Return type:

 If date is TIMESTAMP,
                  returns TIMESTAMP. 
 If date is DATE,
                  returns DATE. 



Usage notes:

 If date is the last day of a month, the
              return date will fall on the last day of the target month, e.g.
                MONTHS_SUB(DATE'2019-02-28', 1) returns
                DATE'2019-01-31'. 

 NANOSECONDS_ADD(TIMESTAMP date, INT nanoseconds),
            NANOSECONDS_ADD(TIMESTAMP date, BIGINT nanoseconds) 

Purpose: Returns the specified date and time plus some number
            of nanoseconds. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP

Kudu considerations:
The nanosecond portion of an Impala
                TIMESTAMP value is rounded to the nearest
              microsecond when that value is stored in a Kudu table.

 NANOSECONDS_SUB(TIMESTAMP date, INT nanoseconds),
            NANOSECONDS_SUB(TIMESTAMP date, BIGINT nanoseconds) 

Purpose: Returns the specified date and time minus some
            number of nanoseconds. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP

Kudu considerations:

The nanosecond portion of an Impala TIMESTAMP
              value is rounded to the nearest microsecond when that value is
              stored in a Kudu table.

 NEXT_DAY(TIMESTAMP / DATE date, STRING weekday) 

Purpose: Returns the date of the weekday
            that follows the specified date. 
Argument: The weekday is not
              case-sensitive. 
 The following values are accepted for
              weekday:
                "Sunday"/"Sun",
                "Monday"/"Mon",
                "Tuesday"/"Tue",
                "Wednesday"/"Wed",
                "Thursday"/"Thu",
                "Friday"/"Fri",
                "Saturday"/"Sat"


Return type:

 Returns TIMESTAMP if
                    date is of the TIMESTAMP
                  type. 
 Returns DATE if date is
                  of the DATE type. 

Examples:
NEXT_DAY('2013-12-25','Saturday') returns
                '2013-12-28 00:00:00' which is the first
              Saturday after December 25, 2013. 

 NOW() 

Purpose: Returns the current date and time (in the local time
            zone) as a TIMESTAMP value. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP

Usage notes:
 To find a date/time value in the future or the past relative to
              the current date and time, add or subtract an
                INTERVAL expression to the return value of
                NOW().
 To produce a TIMESTAMP representing the current
              date and time that can be shared or stored without
              interoperability problems due to time zone differences, use the
                TO_UTC_TIMESTAMP() function and specify the
              time zone of the server. When TIMESTAMP data is
              stored in UTC form, any application that queries those values can
              convert them to the appropriate local time zone by calling the
              inverse function, FROM_UTC_TIMESTAMP(). 
To determine the time zone of the server you are connected to,
              you can call the timeofday() function, which
              includes the time zone specifier in its return value. Remember
              that with cloud computing, the server you interact with might be
              in a different time zone than you are, or different sessions might
              connect to servers in different time zones, or a cluster might
              include servers in more than one time zone.  Any references
              to the NOW() function are evaluated at the start
              of a query. All calls to NOW() within the same
              query return the same value, and the value does not depend on how
              long the query takes. 

 QUARTER(TIMESTAMP / DATE date) 

Purpose: Returns the quarter in the input
              date argument as an integer value, 1, 2, 3, or
            4, where 1 represents January 1 through March 31. 
Return type:
INT


 SECOND(TIMESTAMP date) 

Purpose: Returns the second field from a
              TIMESTAMP value. 
Return type:
INT


 SECONDS_ADD(TIMESTAMP date, INT seconds), SECONDS_ADD(TIMESTAMP
            date, BIGINT seconds) 

Purpose: Returns the specified date and time plus some number
            of seconds. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


 SECONDS_SUB(TIMESTAMP date, INT seconds), SECONDS_SUB(TIMESTAMP
            date, BIGINT seconds) 

Purpose: Returns the specified date and time minus some
            number of seconds. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


 SUBDATE(TIMESTAMP / DATE date, INT / BIGINT days) 

Purpose: Subtracts days from
              date and returns the new date value.  The
                days value can be negative, which gives the
              same result as the ADDDATE() function. 

Return type:

 If date is TIMESTAMP,
                  returns TIMESTAMP. 
 If date is DATE,
                  returns DATE. 



 TIMEOFDAY() 

Purpose: Returns a string representation of the current date
            and time, according to the time of the local system, including any
            time zone designation. 
Return type:
STRING

Usage notes:
The result value represents similar information as the
                now() function, only as a
                STRING type and with somewhat different
              formatting. For example, the day of the week and the time zone
              identifier are included. This function is intended primarily for
              compatibility with SQL code from other systems that also have a
                timeofday() function. Prefer to use
                now() if practical for any new Impala code.
            

 TIMESTAMP_CMP(TIMESTAMP t1, TIMESTAMP t2) 

Purpose: Tests if one TIMESTAMP value is
            newer than, older than, or identical to another
              TIMESTAMP


 If the first argument represents a later point in time than
                  the second argument, the result is 1. 


 If the first argument represents an earlier point in time
                  than the second argument, the result is -1. 


 If the first and second arguments represent identical points
                  in time, the result is 0. 


 If either argument is NULL, the result is
                    NULL. 



Return type:
INT (either -1, 0, 1, or NULL) 
Usage notes:
A comparison function for TIMESTAMP values
              that only tests whether the date and time increases, decreases, or
              stays the same. Similar to the SIGN() function
              for numeric values. 

 TO_DATE(TIMESTAMP ts) 

Purpose: Returns a string representation of the date field
            from the ts argument. 
Return type:
STRING


 TO_TIMESTAMP(BIGINT unixtime), TO_TIMESTAMP(STRING date, STRING
            pattern) 

Purpose: Converts an integer or string representing a
            date/time value into the corresponding TIMESTAMP
            value. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


Usage notes:
 An integer argument represents the number of seconds past
              the epoch (midnight on January 1, 1970). It is the converse of the
                UNIX_TIMESTAMP() function, which produces a
                BIGINT representing the number of seconds past
              the epoch. 
 A string argument, plus another string argument representing the
              pattern, turns an arbitrary string representation of a date and
              time into a true TIMESTAMP value. The ability to
              parse many kinds of date and time formats allows you to deal with
              temporal data from diverse sources, and if desired to convert to
              efficient TIMESTAMP values during your ETL
              process. Using TIMESTAMP directly in queries and
              expressions lets you perform date and time calculations without
              the overhead of extra function calls and conversions each time you
              reference the applicable columns. 

Examples:

 The following examples demonstrate how to convert an arbitrary
              string representation to TIMESTAMP based on a
              pattern string: 

select to_timestamp('Sep 25, 1984', 'MMM dd, yyyy');
+----------------------------------------------+
| to_timestamp('sep 25, 1984', 'mmm dd, yyyy') |
+----------------------------------------------+
| 1984-09-25 00:00:00                          |
+----------------------------------------------+

select to_timestamp('1984/09/25', 'yyyy/MM/dd');
+------------------------------------------+
| to_timestamp('1984/09/25', 'yyyy/mm/dd') |
+------------------------------------------+
| 1984-09-25 00:00:00                      |
+------------------------------------------+

 The following examples show how to convert a
                BIGINT representing seconds past epoch into a
                TIMESTAMP value: 

-- One day past the epoch.
select to_timestamp(24 * 60 * 60);
+----------------------------+
| to_timestamp(24 * 60 * 60) |
+----------------------------+
| 1970-01-02 00:00:00        |
+----------------------------+

-- 60 seconds in the past.
select now() as 'current date/time',
  unix_timestamp(now()) 'now in seconds',
  to_timestamp(unix_timestamp(now()) - 60) as '60 seconds ago';
+-------------------------------+----------------+---------------------+
| current date/time             | now in seconds | 60 seconds ago      |
+-------------------------------+----------------+---------------------+
| 2017-10-01 22:03:46.885624000 | 1506895426     | 2017-10-01 22:02:46 |
+-------------------------------+----------------+---------------------+


 TO_UTC_TIMESTAMP(TIMESTAMP ts, STRING timezone) 

Purpose: Converts a specified timestamp value in a specified time zone into the
            corresponding value for the UTC time zone. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP


Usage notes:

 Often used in combination with the now() function, to translate
              local date and time values to the UTC time zone for consistent representation on disk.
              The opposite of the FROM_UTC_TIMESTAMP() function. 
 See discussion of time zones in TIMESTAMP data type for
              information about using this function for conversions between the local time zone and
              UTC. 

Examples:

 The simplest use of this function is to turn a local date/time value to one with the
              standardized UTC time zone. Because the time zone specifier is not saved as part of
              the Impala TIMESTAMP value, all applications that refer to such data
              must agree in advance which time zone the values represent. If different parts of the
              ETL cycle, or different instances of the application, occur in different time zones,
              the ideal reference point is to convert all TIMESTAMP values to UTC
              for storage. 

select now() as 'Current time in California USA',
  to_utc_timestamp(now(), 'PDT') as 'Current time in Greenwich UK';
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| current time in california usa | current time in greenwich uk  |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| 2016-06-01 15:52:08.980072000  | 2016-06-01 22:52:08.980072000 |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+

 Once a value is converted to the UTC time zone by
                TO_UTC_TIMESTAMP(), it can be converted back to the local time zone
              with FROM_UTC_TIMESTAMP(). You can combine these functions using
              different time zone identifiers to convert a TIMESTAMP between any
              two time zones. This example starts with a TIMESTAMP value
              representing Pacific Daylight Time, converts it to UTC, and converts it to the
              equivalent value in Eastern Daylight Time. 

select now() as 'Current time in California USA',
  from_utc_timestamp
  (
    to_utc_timestamp(now(), 'PDT'),
    'EDT'
  ) as 'Current time in New York, USA';
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| current time in california usa | current time in new york, usa |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| 2016-06-01 18:14:12.743658000  | 2016-06-01 21:14:12.743658000 |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+


 TRUNC(TIMESTAMP / DATE ts, STRING unit) 

Purpose: Returns the ts truncated to the
              unit specified. 
Argument: The unit argument is not
              case-sensitive. This argument string can be one of:

                        even for the HH12 argument string.
                      



'MI'

 Yes 
 No 
 Minute 



Usage notes:

 The TIMESTAMP form is typically used in
                GROUP BY queries to aggregate results from the
              same hour, day, week, month, quarter, and so on. You can also use
              this function in an INSERT ... SELECT into a
              partitioned table to divide TIMESTAMP values into
              the correct partition. 

Return type:


TIMESTAMP if the first argument,
                    ts, is TIMESTAMP. 

DATE if the first argument,
                    ts, is DATE. 



Example:


TRUNC(DATE'2019-05-08','YEAR') returns
                2019-01-01. 

TRUNC(DATE'2019-05-08', 'QUARTER') returns
                2019-04-01. 

 UNIX_TIMESTAMP(), UNIX_TIMESTAMP(STRING datetime),
            UNIX_TIMESTAMP(STRING datetime, STRING pattern),
            UNIX_TIMESTAMP(TIMESTAMP datetime) 

Purpose: Returns a Unix time, which is a number of seconds
            elapsed since '1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC. If called with no argument,
            the current date and time is converted to its Unix time. If called
            with arguments, the first argument represented as the
              TIMESTAMP or STRING is converted
            to its Unix time. 
Return type:
BIGINT


Usage notes:

 See FROM_UNIXTIME() for details
              about the patterns you can use in the pattern
              string to represent the position of year, month, day, and so on in
              the date string. In Impala 1.3 and higher, you
              have more flexibility to switch the positions of elements and use
              different separator characters. 
You can include a trailing uppercase
                Z qualifier to indicate Zulu time, a
              synonym for UTC. 
You can include a timezone offset specified as
              minutes and hours, provided you also specify the details in the
                pattern string argument. The offset is
              specified in the pattern string as a plus or
              minus sign followed by hh:mm,
                hhmm, or hh. The
                hh must be lowercase, to distinguish it from
              the HH represent hours in the actual time value.
              Currently, only numeric timezone offsets are allowed, not symbolic
              names. 
Built-in functions that accept or return integers representing
                TIMESTAMP values use the
                BIGINT type for parameters and return values,
              rather than INT. This change lets the date and
              time functions avoid an overflow error that would otherwise occur
              on January 19th, 2038 (known as the Year 2038 problem or
                  Y2K38 problem). This change affects the
                FROM_UNIXTIME() and
                UNIX_TIMESTAMP() functions. You might need to
              change application code that interacts with these functions,
              change the types of columns that store the return values, or add
                CAST() calls to SQL statements that call these
              functions.
UNIX_TIMESTAMP() and
                FROM_UNIXTIME() are often used in combination
              to convert a TIMESTAMP value into a particular
              string format. For example,
                FROM_UNIXTIME(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(NOW() + interval 3 days),
                'yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm'). The way this function deals
              with time zones when converting to or from
                TIMESTAMP values is affected by the
                ‑‑use_local_tz_for_unix_timestamp_conversions
              startup flag for the impalad daemon. See TIMESTAMP data type for details
              about how Impala handles time zone considerations for the
                TIMESTAMP data type.
              Examples: The following examples show
              different ways of turning the same date and time into an integer
              value. A pattern string that Impala recognizes
              by default is interpreted as a UTC date and time. The trailing
                Z is a confirmation that the timezone is UTC.
              If the date and time string is formatted differently, a second
              argument specifies the position and units for each of the date and
              time values. 
 The final two examples show how to specify a timezone offset of
              Pacific Daylight Saving Time, which is 7 hours earlier than UTC.
              You can use the numeric offset -07:00 and the
              equivalent suffix of -hh:mm in the
                pattern string, or specify the mnemonic name
              for the time zone in a call to
              TO_UTC_TIMESTAMP(). This particular date and time
              expressed in PDT translates to a different number than the same
              date and time expressed in UTC.

 UTC_TIMESTAMP() 

Purpose: Returns a TIMESTAMP corresponding
            to the current date and time in the UTC time zone. 
Return type:
TIMESTAMP

Examples:
 Similar to the NOW() or
                CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() functions, but does not use
              the local time zone as those functions do. Use
                UTC_TIMESTAMP() to record
                TIMESTAMP values that are interoperable with
              servers around the world, in arbitrary time zones, without the
              need for additional conversion functions to standardize the time
              zone of each value representing a date/time. 
 For working with date/time values represented as integer values,
              you can convert back and forth between TIMESTAMP
              and BIGINT with the
                UNIX_MICROS_TO_UTC_TIMESTAMP() and
                UTC_TO_UNIX_MICROS() functions. The integer
              values represent the number of microseconds since the Unix epoch
              (midnight on January 1, 1970). 
Examples:
 The following example shows how NOW() and
                CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() represent the current
              date/time in the local time zone (in this case, UTC-7), while
                utc_timestamp() represents the same date/time
              in the standardized UTC time zone: 

select now(), utc_timestamp();
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| now()                         | utc_timestamp()               |

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

select current_timestamp(), utc_timestamp();
