DROP FUNCTION statement
The DROP FUNCTION statement removes a user-defined function (UDF), so
    that it is not available for execution during Impala SELECT or
      INSERT operations.
Syntax:

      To drop C++ UDFs and UDAs:
    DROP [AGGREGATE] FUNCTION [IF EXISTS] [db_name.]function_name(type[, type...])note
 The preceding syntax, which includes the function
          signature, also applies to Java UDFs that were created using the corresponding
            CREATE FUNCTION syntax that includes the argument and return types.
          After upgrading to Impala 2.5 or higher, consider re-creating all Java UDFs with the
            CREATE FUNCTION syntax that does not include the function signature.
          Java UDFs created this way are now persisted in the metastore database and do not need to
          be re-created after an Impala restart. 

      To drop Java UDFs (created using the CREATE FUNCTION syntax with no function signature):
    DROP FUNCTION [IF EXISTS] [db_name.]function_name
Statement type: DDL
      
Usage notes:

      Because the same function name could be overloaded with different argument signatures, you specify the
      argument types to identify the exact function to drop.
    
Restrictions:
 In Impala 2.5 and higher, Impala
        UDFs and UDAs written in C++ are persisted in the metastore database. Java UDFs are also
        persisted, if they were created with the new CREATE FUNCTION syntax for
        Java UDFs, where the Java function argument and return types are omitted. Java-based UDFs
        created with the old CREATE FUNCTION syntax do not persist across restarts
        because they are held in the memory of the catalogd daemon. Until you
        re-create such Java UDFs using the new CREATE FUNCTION syntax, you must
        reload those Java-based UDFs by running the original CREATE FUNCTION
        statements again each time you restart the catalogd daemon. Prior to
        Impala 2.5 the requirement to reload functions after a restart applied to both C++ and Java
        functions. 
Cancellation: Cannot be cancelled.
      
HDFS permissions:

      The user ID that the impalad daemon runs under,
      typically the impala user, does not need any
      particular HDFS permissions to perform this statement.
      All read and write operations are on the metastore database,
      not HDFS files and directories.
    
Examples:
 The following example shows how to drop Java functions created
        with the signatureless CREATE FUNCTION syntax in Impala 2.5 and higher.
        Issuing DROP FUNCTION function_name removes all the
        overloaded functions under that name. See the CREATE FUNCTION statement for a
        longer example showing how to set up such functions in the first place.
