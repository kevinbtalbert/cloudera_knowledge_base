HAVING clauseCloudera Docs
HAVING clause
Performs a filter operation on a SELECT query, by examining the
    results of aggregation functions rather than testing each individual table row. Therefore, it is
    always used in conjunction with a function such as COUNT(),
      SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), or
      MAX(), and typically with the GROUP BY clause also. 
Restrictions:

      The filter expression in the HAVING clause cannot include a scalar subquery.
