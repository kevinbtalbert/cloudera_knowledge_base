Impala identifiers
Provides information about using Identifiers as the names of databases, tables, or
    columns when creating the objects.
The following rules apply to identifiers in Impala:

 The minimum length of an identifier is 1 character. 


 The maximum length of an identifier is currently 128 characters,
            enforced by the Metastore database. 


 An identifier must start with an alphanumeric or underscore
            character. The remainder can contain any combination of alphanumeric
            characters and underscores. 
Quoting the identifier with backticks has no effect on the allowed
            characters in the name. 


 An identifier can contain only ASCII characters. 


 To use an identifier name that matches one of the Impala reserved
            keywords, surround the identifier with ``
            characters (backticks). Quote the reserved word even if it is part
            of a fully qualified name. 
The following example shows how a reserved word can be used as a
            column name if it is quoted with backticks in the CREATE
              TABLE statement, and how the column name must also be
            quoted with backticks in a query: 
[localhost:21000] > create table reserved (`data` string);

[localhost:21000] > select data from reserved;
ERROR: AnalysisException: Syntax error in line 1:
select data from reserved
       ^
Encountered: DATA
Expected: ALL, CASE, CAST, DISTINCT, EXISTS, FALSE, IF, INTERVAL, NOT, NULL, STRAIGHT_JOIN, TRUE, IDENTIFIER
CAUSED BY: Exception: Syntax error

[localhost:21000] > select reserved.data from reserved;
ERROR: AnalysisException: Syntax error in line 1:
select reserved.data from reserved
                ^
Encountered: DATA
Expected: IDENTIFIER
CAUSED BY: Exception: Syntax error

[localhost:21000] > select reserved.`data` from reserved;

[localhost:21000] >

important Because the list of reserved words grows over
            time as new SQL syntax is added, consider adopting coding
            conventions (especially for any automated scripts or in packaged
            applications) to always quote all identifiers with backticks.
            Quoting all identifiers protects your SQL from compatibility issues
            if new reserved words are added in later releases. 


 Impala identifiers are case-insensitive.
