INT data type
A 4-byte integer data type used in CREATE TABLE and ALTER
      TABLE statements.
Syntax:

      In the column definition of a CREATE TABLE statement:
    column_name INT
Range: -2147483648 .. 2147483647. There is no UNSIGNED subtype.
    
Conversions: Impala automatically converts to a larger integer type (BIGINT) or a
      floating-point type (FLOAT or DOUBLE) automatically. Use
      CAST() to convert to TINYINT, SMALLINT,
      STRING, or TIMESTAMP.
      Casting an integer or floating-point
          value N to TIMESTAMP produces a
          value that is N seconds past the start of the epoch
          date (January 1, 1970). By default, the result value represents a date
          and time in the UTC time zone. If the setting
            ‑‑use_local_tz_for_unix_timestamp_conversions=true
          is in effect, the resulting TIMESTAMP represents a
          date and time in the local time zone.

Usage notes:

      The data type INTEGER is an alias for INT.
    
      For a convenient and automated way to check the bounds of the INT type, call the functions
      MIN_INT() and MAX_INT().
    
      If an integer value is too large to be represented as a INT, use a BIGINT
      instead.
    
NULL considerations: Casting any non-numeric value to this type produces a NULL
        value.
      
Examples:
CREATE TABLE t1 (x INT);
SELECT CAST(1000 AS INT);

Partitioning: Prefer to use this type for a partition key column. Impala can process the numeric
        type more efficiently than a STRING representation of the value.
      
HBase considerations: This data type is fully compatible with HBase tables.
      
Text table considerations: Values of this type are potentially larger in text tables than in tables
        using Parquet or other binary formats.
      
Internal details: Represented in memory as a 4-byte value.
      
Added in: Available in all versions of Impala.
      
Column statistics considerations: Because this type has a fixed size, the maximum and average size
        fields are always filled in for column statistics, even before you run the COMPUTE STATS
        statement.
