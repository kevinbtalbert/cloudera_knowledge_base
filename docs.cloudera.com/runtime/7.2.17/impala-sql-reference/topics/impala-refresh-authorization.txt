REFRESH AUTHORIZATION statement
The REFRESH AUTHORIZATION statement explicitly
    refreshes authorization data, including privileges and principals. When
    there is an external update to authorization metadata, use this statement to
    force Impala to refresh its authorization data without having to wait for
    the Ranger polling or run INVALIDATE METADATA.
      Once issued, the REFRESH AUTHORIZATION statement cannot be cancelled.
    
Syntax:
REFRESH AUTHORIZATION
Usage notes: If authorization is not enabled, Impala returns an error.
    
Added in: Impala 3.2
