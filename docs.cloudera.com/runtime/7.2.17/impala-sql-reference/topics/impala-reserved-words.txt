Impala reserved words
Impala reserves a set of keywords that cannot be used directly as identifiers in Impala
    SQL. You must be aware of the list of reserved words to avoid name conflicts with any of your
    table, columns, or other object names. 

If you need to use it as an identifier, you must quote it with backticks. For example: 

CREATE TABLE select (x INT): fails 

CREATE TABLE `select` (x INT): succeeds 


 Because different database systems have different sets of reserved words, and the reserved
        words change from release to release, carefully consider database, table, and column names
        to ensure maximum compatibility between products and versions. 
 Also consider whether your object names are the same as any Hive keywords, and rename or
        quote any that conflict as you might switch between Impala and Hive when doing analytics and
        ETL. 
 To future-proof your code, you should avoid additional words in case they become reserved
        words if Impala adds features in later releases. This kind of planning can also help to
        avoid name conflicts in case you port SQL from other systems that have different sets of
        reserved words. The Future Keyword column in the table below indicates those additional
        words that you should avoid for table, column, or other object names, even though they are
        not currently reserved by Impala. 
 The following is a summary of the process for deciding whether a particular SQL 2016 word
        is to be reserved in Impala. 

 By default, Impala targets to have the same list of reserved words as SQL 2016. 
 At the same time, to be compatible with earlier versions of Impala and to avoid
          breaking existing tables/workloads, Impala built-in function names are removed from the
          reserved words list, e.g. COUNT, AVG, as Impala generally does not need to reserve the
          names of built-in functions for parsing to work. 
 For those remaining SQL 2016 reserved words, if a word is likely to be in-use by users
          of older Impala versions and if there is a low chance of Impala needing to reserve that
          word in the future, then the word is not reserved. 
 Otherwise, the word is reserved in Impala. 

The following table lists the reserved words in Impala.
