Performance considerations for UDFs
Because a UDF typically processes each row of a table, potentially being called billions
        of times, the performance of each UDF is a critical factor in the speed of the overall ETL
        or ELT pipeline. Tiny optimizations you can make within the function body can pay off in a
        big way when the function is called over and over when processing a huge result set.
