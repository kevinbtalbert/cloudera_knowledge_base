USE statement
The USE statement switches the current session to a specified
    database. The current database is where any CREATE TABLE,
      INSERT, SELECT, or other statements act when you specify a
    table or other object name, without prefixing it with a database name. The new current database
    applies for the duration of the session or unti another USE statement is
    executed.
Syntax:
USE db_name
      By default, when you connect to an Impala instance, you begin in a database named default.
    
Usage notes:

      Switching the default database is convenient in the following situations:
    

        To avoid qualifying each reference to a table with the database name. For example, SELECT * FROM t1
        JOIN t2 rather than SELECT * FROM db.t1 JOIN db.t2.
      

        To do a sequence of operations all within the same database, such as creating a table, inserting data, and
        querying the table.
      

      To start the impala-shell interpreter and automatically issue a USE
      statement for a particular database, specify the option -d db_name for
      the impala-shell command. The -d option is useful to run SQL scripts,
      such as setup or test scripts, against multiple databases without hardcoding a USE statement
      into the SQL source.
    
Examples:
 See the CREATE DATABASE statement for examples covering CREATE
          DATABASE, USE, and DROP DATABASE. 
Cancellation: Cannot be cancelled.
      
HDFS permissions: This statement does not touch any HDFS files or directories,
        therefore no HDFS permissions are required.
