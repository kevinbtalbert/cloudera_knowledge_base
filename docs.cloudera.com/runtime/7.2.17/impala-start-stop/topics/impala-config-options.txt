Modifying Impala Startup Options
You can view and edit the configuration options for the Impala
    daemons to customize your Impala environment, such as to specify which hosts
    and ports to use, to assign directories for logging,and to control resource
    usage and security.
Configuring Impala Startup Options
Navigate to the following page to configure the settings for all the
        Impala-related daemons:

Clusters > Impala > Configuration. 
 If the Cloudera Manager interface does not yet have a form field for a
        newly added option, or if you need to use special options for debugging
        and troubleshooting, the Advanced category page
        for each daemon includes one or more Safety Valve
        fields where you can enter option names directly. 

Checking the Values of Impala Startup Options
 You can check the current runtime value of all these settings through
        the Impala Web UI, available by default at:
http://impala_hostname:25000/varz
            for the impalad daemon
http://impala_hostname:25010/varz
            for the statestored daemon
http://impala_hostname:25020/varz
            for the catalogd daemon
