Adjusting Heartbeat TCP Timeout IntervalCloudera Docs
Adjusting Heartbeat TCP Timeout Interval
Using the TCP flag, you can prevent the Statestore from waiting indefinitely for a
        response from the subscribers that fail to respond to the heartbeat RPC within the set
        period.

This flag statestore_heartbeat_tcp_timeout_seconds defines the time
                that may elapse before a heartbeat RPC connection request from a Statestore
                server to an Impalad or a Catalog server (subscribers) should be considered dead.
You can increase the flag value if you see intermittent heartbeat RPC timeouts listed
                in the statestore's log. You may find the max value of
                "statestore.priority-topic-update-durations" metric on the statestore to get an idea
                of a reasonable value to be used in this flag.
noteThe priority topic updates are only small amounts of data
                that take little time to process, similar to the heartbeat complexity.


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Impala
                service > Configuration.
In the Impala Daemon Command Line Argument Advanced Configuration
                        Snippet (Safety Valve) field, add the flag
                        statestore_heartbeat_tcp_timeout_seconds with an
                    appropriate value.

You can also control the maximum number of consecutive heartbeat messages an
                    impalad can miss before being declared failed by the statestore by adding this
                    flag statestore_max_missed_heartbeats. Typically, you will not
                    have to change this value.
Click Save Changes and restart
                Impala.
