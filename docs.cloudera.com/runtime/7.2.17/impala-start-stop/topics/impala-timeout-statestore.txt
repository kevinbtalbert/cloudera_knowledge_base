Increasing StateStore Timeout
If you have an extensive Impala schema, for example, with
    hundreds of databases, tens of thousands of tables, you might encounter
    timeout errors during startup as the Impala catalog service broadcasts
    metadata to all the Impala nodes using the StateStore service. To avoid such
    timeout errors on startup, increase the StateStore timeout value from its
    default of 10 seconds. 
Increase the timeout value of the StateStore service if you see
      messages in the impalad log such as:
      Connection with state-store lost
Trying to re-register with state-store

In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Impala
              service > Configuration.In the search field, type
            -statestore_subscriber_timeout_seconds.In the StateStoreSubscriber Timeout
          field, specify a new timeout value larger than the current
          value.Click Save Changes and restart
          Impala.
