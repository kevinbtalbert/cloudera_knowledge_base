 Performance Issues Related to Data Encryption
To troubleshoot any performance issues related to data encryption, run the PROFILE
    statement directly after running a query to view the encrypted bytes read.
Viewing the encrypted bytes read using query profile
When Impala executes any query on an Ozone encrypted file, the query PROFILE captures the
        runtime details of the execution including the total number of encrypted bytes read from
        Ozone by the query.noteThe PROFILE statement should be run
          immediately after running the query. You cannot revisit later and view an earlier
          session.
You can view query profiles from the command line by logging in to the Impala shell and
        running the profile; command. You can also collect from Cloudera Manager Web UI, by
        navigating to  CM > Impala > Queries, locate the query you just ran and click on Query Details. Look for the excerpts “BytesReadEncrypted” in the profile output.
