Getting the JDBC or ODBC driver in Data Hub
You need to download the Cloudera Hive JDBC or ODBC driver to your Data Hub cluster
        and provide it to your client. In the BI tool on the client's cluster, you need to provide
        the HiveServer (HS2) host name portion of the JDBC URL. The BI tool requires this
        information to connect to Hive in CDP.

Download the JDBC or ODBC driver from the Cloudera Downloads page.

Follow instructions in the documentation to install the driver on the same downloads page.
