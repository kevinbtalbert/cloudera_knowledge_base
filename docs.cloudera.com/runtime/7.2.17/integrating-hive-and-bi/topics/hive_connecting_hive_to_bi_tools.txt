Connecting Hive to BI tools
         using a JDBC/ODBC driver in Data Hub

To query, analyze, and visualize data stored in CDP, you use drivers provided by
      Cloudera to connect Apache Hive to Business Intelligence (BI) tools.
 How you connect to Hive depends on a number of factors: the location of Hive inside
         or outside the cluster, the HiveServer deployment, the type of transport, transport-layer
         security, and authentication. HiveServer is the server interface that enables remote
         clients to run queries against Hive and retrieve the results using a JDBC or ODBC
         connection.
         


Choose a Hive authorization model.
Configure authenticated users for querying Hive through JDBC or ODBC driver. For
               example, set up a Ranger
               policy. 



Getting the JDBC or ODBC driver in Data HubYou need to download the Cloudera Hive JDBC or ODBC driver to your Data Hub cluster         and provide it to your client. In the BI tool on the client's cluster, you need to provide         the HiveServer (HS2) host name portion of the JDBC URL. The BI tool requires this         information to connect to Hive in CDP.Configuring the BI toolAfter you download an ODBC or JDBC driver and give it to your client, you need to         provide the information that the BI tool requires to connect to Hive in CDP.
