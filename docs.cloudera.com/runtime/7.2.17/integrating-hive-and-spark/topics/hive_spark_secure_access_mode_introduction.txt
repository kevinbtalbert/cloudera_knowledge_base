Secure access mode introduction
Use Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC) secure access mode if you want fine-grained access
  control (FGAC) column masking and row filtering to secure managed (ACID); or external, Hive table
  data that you read from Spark. If you have large workloads, low-latency requirements, and require
  fine-grained access control, secure access mode is recommended over the Direct Reader
  mode.
As an administrator, you set up Ranger FGAC, consisting of column masking and row
   filtering, to secure the data. You select a staging
    location in your cloud storage service, such as S3 or ADLS. After you configure secure
   access mode, HWC creates external tables on your designated staging location when users launch
   Spark. HWC uses CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) to create the tables. No code refactoring is
   necessary. Ranger policies are applied and FGAC is enforced during the CTAS operation. Users read
   external tables in the secure staging location.
Requirements

As an administrator, you set up Ranger policies. 
As a user, you launch Spark and query Hive tables in secure access mode. 


Considerations

Intermediate data is generated every time the Spark job runs even if it is running on the
     same underlying data.
Intermediate data is automatically cleared when the Spark session ends.
Additional storage requirements depend on concurrent Spark jobs running.
