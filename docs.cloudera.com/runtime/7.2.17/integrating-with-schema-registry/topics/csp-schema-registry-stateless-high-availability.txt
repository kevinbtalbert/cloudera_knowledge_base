Improving performance in Schema Registry
Adding Knox as a load balancer can increase the performance of Schema
  Registry.
You can increase the performance of Schema Registry by adding Apache Knox, the CDP load
   balancer, to your Schema Registry configuration. This increase in performance offsets the minor
   decrease in performance caused by the lack of server-side caching.
By default, Schema Registry does not have server-side caching. Each time a client sends a
   query, the client reads the data directly from the database.
The lack of server-side caching creates a minor performance impact. However, it enables Schema
   Registry to be stateless and be distributed over multiple hosts. All hosts use the same database.
   This enables a client to insert a schema on host A and query the same schema on host B.
You can store JAR files similarly in HDFS and retrieve a file even if one of the hosts is
   down.
To make Schema Registry highly available in this setup, include a load balancer on top of the
   services. Clients communicate through the load balancer. The load balancer then determines which
   host to send the requests to. If one host is down, the request is sent to another host. In CDP,
   the load balancer is Apache Knox.
