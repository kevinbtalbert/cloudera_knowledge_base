Setting the Schema Registry
      instance in NiFi
To enable Schema Registry to communicate with NiFi dataflows, you need to configure
      the HortonworksSchemaRegistry Controller Service with the Schema Registry instance
      URL.
To configure Schema Registry to communicate with NiFi
         dataflows, you need to specify in NiFi the Schema Registry instance with which you want to
         communicate. You can do this from the NiFi UI, using the HortonworksSchemaRegistry
         Controller Service.

You have already installed Schema Registry.

From the Global Menu, click Controller
                  Settings and select the Controller Services
               tab. 

Click the + icon to display the Add Controller
                  Service dialog. 

Use the filter box to search for HortonworksSchemaRegistry, and click
                  Add. 

Click the Edit icon to display the Configure
                  Controller Service dialog. 

Provide the Schema Registry URL with which you want NiFi to communicate, and click
                  Apply. 

tip
If you are running an Ambari-managed cluster, you can find this value in the
                     Streaming Analytics Manager Service in Ambari for the configuration property
                     called registry.url. The URL looks similar to
                        http://$REGISTRY_SERVER:7788/api/v1.



Enable this HortonworksSchemaRegistry by clicking the Enable
               icon, selecting the Scope, and clicking
                  Enable.
