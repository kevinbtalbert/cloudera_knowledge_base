Adding and configuring
      record-enabled Processors
To streamline your dataflows and improve overall performance, you can use
      record-enabled RecordReader and RecordWriter Processors.
Record-enabled Processors allow you to convert data between
         formats by specifying Controller Services for record reading and record writing. To add and
         configure record-enabled Processors, perform the following tasks:
From the NiFi UI, drag the Processor icon onto your canvas to display the
                  Add Processor dialog. 

Use the Filter box to find the processor you want to add.
               Available record-enabled processors are: 


ConsumeKafkaRecord_0_10
ConvertRecord
PublishKafkaRecord_0_10
PutDatabaseRecord
QueryRecord
SplitRecord



Select the processor you want, and click Add. 

Right-click the processor on the canvas, and select
                  Configure to display the Configure
                  Processor dialog. 

Click the Properties tab and select a Controller Service
               value for the Record Reader and Record
                  Writer values. 

Click OK, and then Apply.
