Cluster discovery using load balancers
In case of more complex Kafka cluster setups, you might need a cluster discovery
  solution more sophisticated than a DNS server. In such cases, you should consider using a load
  balancer. 
Cluster discovery using load balancers is less lightweight than using DNS servers, but a viable
   solution for more complex cases. With a load balancer, it is possible to poll the nodes, check
   their health status and exclude stopped nodes from targets, automatically redirect requests to
   living nodes. When using a load balancer the requests are forwarded to a broker as shown in the
   figure:



Because the client connects to the load balancer and is then forwarded to a broker, SSL
   handshake and SASL authentication errors can occur (this is a defending mechanism to avoid
   man-in-the-middle attacks), therefore, additional setup is needed.
The configuration depends on your security protocol:


No security in the cluster (security protocol is PLAINTEXT)
Setup steps are not required before connecting to the Kafka cluster, the load balancers
     should work out of the box with Kafka.


SASL with Kerberos enabled
Perform the setup described in section Setup for SASL with Kerberos.


TLS/SSL encryption is enabled
Perform the setup described in section Setup for TLS/SSL encryption.


SASL with Kerberos and TLS/SSL are both enabled
Perform the setup described in Setup for SASL with Kerberos and Setup for
      TLS/SSL encryption.
