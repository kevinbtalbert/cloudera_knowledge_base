Performance considerations
A collection of basic recommendations for Kafka clusters.
The simplest recommendation for running Kafka with maximum performance is to have dedicated
      hosts for the Kafka brokers and a dedicated ZooKeeper cluster for the Kafka cluster. If that
      is not an option, consider these additional guidelines for resource sharing with the Kafka
      cluster:

Running in VMs
It is common practice in modern data centers to run processes in virtual machines. This
          generally allows for better sharing of resources. Kafka is sufficiently sensitive to I/O
          throughput that VMs interfere with the regular operation of brokers. For this reason, it
          is generally not recommended to run Kafka in VMs. However, if you are running Kafka in a
          virtual environment you will need to rely on your VM vendor for help with optimizing Kafka
          performance.
Do not run other processes with Brokers or ZooKeeper
Due to I/O contention with other processes, it is generally recommended to avoid running
          other such processes on the same hosts as Kafka brokers.
Keep the Kafka-ZooKeeper Connection Stable
Kafka relies heavily on having a stable ZooKeeper connection. Putting an unreliable
          network between Kafka and ZooKeeper will appear as if ZooKeeper is offline to Kafka.
          Examples of unreliable networks include: 
Do not put Kafka/ZooKeeper nodes on separated networks
Do not put Kafka/ZooKeeper nodes on the same network with other high network
              loads
