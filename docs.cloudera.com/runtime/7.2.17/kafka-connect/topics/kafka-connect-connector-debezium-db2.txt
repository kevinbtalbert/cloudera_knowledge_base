In CDP, before deploying an instance of the Debezium Db2 Source connector, you
        must download and deploy the Db2 JDBC driver on all Kafka Connect hosts. Otherwise, you will
        not be able to deploy the connector. The following list of steps walks you through this
        process.
For more information regarding how the Debezium DB2 connector works as well as its
        configuration and properties, see Debezium connector for Db2 in the Debezium
        documentation.
importantIn addition to the following configuration steps, appropriately
        configuring your Db2 tables is also required. Ensure that you review Setting up
          Db2 in the Debezium documentation and complete all setup tasks either before or
        after completing the following steps.

Download the Db2 JDBC driver. The JDBC driver can be downloaded from
            Maven Central. Cloudera recommends that you use version 11.5.0.0.
        Copy and rename the driver to the location specified in the JDBC Driver
            Jars Path For Debezium Kafka property. The default location is
            /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc. The JDBC driver must be renamed to
            db2-connector-java.jar. For
          example:cp ./jcc-[***VERSION***].jar var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc/db2-connector-java.jarSet correct file permissions. For example: 
chmod 644 /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc/db2-connector-java.jar
In Cloudera Manager, restart the Kafka service.
The Db2 JDBC driver is deployed on all Kafka Connect hosts. Deploying an instance of
      the Debezium Db2 Source connector in your cluster is now possible.
