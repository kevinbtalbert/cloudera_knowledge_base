Setting up the Debezium MySQL Source connector
Learn about the CDP specific setup steps required before you can deploy the Debezium
    MySQL Source connector.

In CDP, before deploying an instance of the Debezium MySQL Source connector, you must
        download and deploy the MySQL JDBC driver on all Kafka Connect hosts. Otherwise, you will
        not be able to deploy the connector. The following list of steps walks you through this
        process. 
For more information regarding how the Debezium MySQL connector works as well as its
        configuration and properties, see the Debezium connector for MySQL in the
        Debezium documentation.
importantIn addition to the following configuration steps, appropriately
        configuring your MySQL server is also required. Ensure that you review Setting up
          MySQL in the Debezium documentation and complete all setup tasks either before or
        after completing the following steps.

Download the MySQL JDBC driver. The JDBC driver can be downloaded from
          the MySQL Community Downloads page. Download the platform independent
          version. Cloudera recommends that you use version 8.0.27.Extract the files from the downloaded archive. You can use the tar
          command or any other archive manager to extract the archive. For example:
          tar -xf mysql-connector-java-[***VERSION***].tar.gzNavigate to the directory where the driver was extracted. 
cd mysql-connector-java-[***VERSION***]
Copy and rename the driver to the location specified in the JDBC Driver
            Jars Path For Debezium Kafka property. The default location is
            /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc. The JDBC driver must be renamed to
            mysql-connector-java.jar. For example:
          cp ./mysql-connector-java-[***VERSION***].jar /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc/mysql-connector-java.jarSet correct file permissions. For example: 
chmod 644 /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc/mysql-connector-java.jar

The MySQL JDBC driver is deployed on all Kafka Connect hosts. Deploying an instance
      of the Debezium MySQL Source connector in your cluster is now possible.
Deploy an instance of the Debezium MySQL Source connector. Additionally, review
        Debezium connector for MySQL in the Debezium documentation to learn more about
      the connector and its features.
