Setting up the Debezium PostgreSQL Source connector
Learn about the CDP specific setup steps required before you can deploy the Debezium
    PostgreSQL Source connector.

In CDP, before deploying an instance of the Debezium PostgreSQL Source connector, you must
        download and deploy the PostgreSQL JDBC driver on all Kafka Connect hosts. Otherwise, you
        will not be able to deploy the connector. The following list of steps walks you through this
        process. 
For more information regarding how the Debezium PostgreSQL connector works as well as its
        configuration and properties, see the Debezium connector for PostgreSQL
        in the Debezium documentation.importantIn addition to the following
          configuration steps, appropriately configuring your PostgreSQL server is also required.
          Ensure that you review the Set up section in the Debezium documentation for
          the PostgreSQL connector and complete all setup tasks either before or after completing
          the following steps.

Download the PostgreSQL JDBC driver. The JDBC driver can be downloaded
          from Maven Central. Cloudera recommends that you use version 42.2.24.
        Copy and rename the driver to the location specified in the JDBC Driver
            Jars Path For Debezium Kafka property. The default location is
            /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc. The JDBC driver must be renamed to
            postgresql-connector-java.jar. For example:
          cp ./postgresql-[***VERSION***].jar /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc/postgresql-connector-java.jarSet correct file permissions. For example: 
chmod 644 /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc/postgresql-connector-java.jar

The PostgreSQL JDBC driver is deployed on all Kafka Connect hosts. Deploying
      instance of the Debezium PostgreSQL Source connector in your cluster is now possible
Deploy an instance of the Debezium PostgreSQL Source connector. Additionally,
      review Debezium connector for PostgreSQL in the Debezium documentation to learn
      more about the connector and its features.
