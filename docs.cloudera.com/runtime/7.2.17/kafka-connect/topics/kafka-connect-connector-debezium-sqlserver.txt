Setting up the Debezium SQL Server Source connector
Learn about the CDP specific setup steps required before you can deploy the Debezium
    SQL Server Source connector. 

In CDP, before deploying an instance of the Debezium SQL Server Source connector, you must
        download and deploy the SQL Server JDBC driver on all Kafka Connect hosts. Otherwise, you
        will not be able to deploy the connector. The following list of steps walks you through this
        process. 
For more information regarding how the Debezium PostgreSQL connector works as well as its
        configuration and properties, see the Debezium connector for SQL Server in the
        Debezium documentation.
importantIn addition to the following configuration steps, appropriately
        configuring your SQL Server database is also required. Ensure that you review the
          Setting up SQL Server in the Debezium documentation and complete all setup
        tasks either before or after completing the following steps.

 Download the SQL Server JDBC driver.The JDBC driver can be downloaded
          from the Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server downloads page. Cloudera recommends that you
          use version 7.2.2.jre8. Download the zipped tar file, do not download the executable
          version. Extract the files from the downloaded archive. You can use the tar
          command or any other archive manager to extract the archive. For example:
          tar -xf sqljdbc_[***VERSION***]_enu.tar.gzNavigate to the directory where the driver was extracted. 
cd sqljdbc_[***VERSION***]/enu
Copy and rename the driver to the location specified in the JDBC Driver Jars Path
          For Debezium Kafka property. The default location is
            /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc. The JDBC driver must be renamed to
            mssql-connector-java.jar. For example:
          cp ./mssql-jdbc-[***VERSION***].jre8.jar /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc/mssql-connector-java.jar
Set correct file permissions. For example: 
chmod 644 /var/lib/kafka_connect_jdbc/mssql-connector-java.jar

The SQL Server JDBC JDBC driver is deployed on all Kafka Connect hosts. Deploying
      instance of the Debezium SQL Server Source connector in your cluster is now possible.
Deploy an instance of the Debezium SQL Server Source connector. Additionally,
      review Debezium connector for SQL Server in the Debezium documentation to learn
      more about the connector and its features.
