MQTT Source connector
The MQTT Source connector is a Stateless NiFi dataflow developed by Cloudera that is
    running in the Kafka Connect framework. Learn about the connector, its properties, and
    configuration.
The MQTT Source connector consumes messages from an MQTT broker and transfers them to Kafka.
      The Kafka topic this connector transfers messages to is determined by the value of the
        topics property in the configuration. This connector does not perform
      record processing. The messages are transferred to Kafka as they are consumed from the MQTT
      broker. TLS can be used to establish a secure connection between the connector and the MQTT
      broker. The keystore and truststore files necessary for securing the connection must be
      present on the cluster node that the connector runs on.
Properties and configuration
Configuration is passed to the connector in a JSON
      file during creation. The properties of the connector can be categorized into three groups.
      These are as follows:

Common connector properties
These are the properties of the Kafka Connect framework that are accepted by all
          connectors. For a comprehensive list of these properties, see the Apache Kafka
            documentation.
Stateless NiFi Source properties
These are the properties that are specific to the Stateless NiFi Source connector. All
          Stateless NiFi Source connectors share and accept these properties. For a comprehensive
          list of these properties, see the Stateless NiFi Source property
          reference.
Connector/dataflow-specific properties
These properties are unique to this specific connector. Or to be more precise, unique
            to the dataflow running within the connector. These properties use the following
            prefix:parameter.[***CONNECTOR NAME***] Parameters:For
            a comprehensive list of these properties, see the MQTT Source properties
              reference.

tipWhen creating a new connector
        using the SMM UI, all valid properties for this connector are presented in the default
        configuration template. You can use the template in the UI as a quick reference to view all
        accepted properties. 

Notes and limitations

Required properties must be assigned a valid value even if they
            are not used in the particular configuration. If a required property is not used, either
            leave its default value, or completely remove the property from the configuration
            JSON.
If a property that has a default value is completely removed from
            the configuration JSON, the system uses the default value.
Properties not marked as required must be completely removed from
            the configuration JSON if not set.
If the keystore-related properties are removed and an empty truststore is provided, the
          connector does not use TLS for connecting to the MQTT broker. TLS is used if a truststore
          is provided that has a key in it.


Configuration example
In this example, the connector fetches messages from an MQTT broker and transfers them to a
        Kafka topic.noteAll properties that are not present in
        this example have suitable default values or are unnecessary for this specific use
        case.

}

The following list collects the properties from the configuration example that must be
        customized for this use case:
topics
The name of the Kafka topic that the connector sends messages to.
MQTT Broker URI
The URI of the MQTT broker. In this example, the connection is not secure. As a
              result, the URI starts with tcp://. The port number you  typically
              use in a case like this is 1883. If TLS is used, the URI should start
              with ssl://, and typically you use port number
              88883.
MQTT Topics
The comma-separated list of MQTT topics that the connector fetches messages
              from.
