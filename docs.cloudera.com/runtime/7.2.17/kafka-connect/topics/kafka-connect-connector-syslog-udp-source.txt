Syslog UDP Source connector
The Syslog UDP Source connector is a Stateless NiFi dataflow developed by Cloudera that
    is running in the Kafka Connect framework. Learn about the connector, its properties, and
    configuration.
The Syslog UDP Source connector listens on a port for syslog messages over UDP and transfers
      them to Kafka. The connector accepts messages in one of the following formats: Syslog 3164,
      Syslog 5424, or Grok. If the input messages are in Grok format, the connector can either
      derive the schema using the field names from the value of the Grok Expression
      property or  read the schema from Schema Registry.
The connector can write messages into Kafka in one of the following formats: Avro, JSON, or
      text. If the output format is text, the raw message is transferred to Kafka. If the output
      format is JSON, the input message is processed and converted into JSON format before it is
      transferred to Kafka. If the output format is Avro, the input message is processed and
      converted into Avro format before it is transferred to Kafka. The record schema is embedded
      into Avro messages if the schema is not fetched from Schema Registry. If Schema Registry is
      used for getting the schema of the records, then the schema does not get embedded in the Avro
      messages. 
If Schema Registry is used, and it is on a Kerberized cluster, the krb5.file
      property must point to the krb5.conf file that provides access to the cluster
      on which Schema Registry is present. This means that the krb5.conf file must
      be on the same cluster node that the connector runs on. 
The Kerberos keytab that is used to access Schema Registry must also be on the same cluster
      node that the connector runs on. The connection to Schema Registry can be secured by TLS. The
      truststore file necessary for securing the connection must also be on the same cluster node
      that the connector runs on.
Properties and configuration
Configuration is passed to the connector in a JSON
      file during creation. The properties of the connector can be categorized into three groups.
      These are as follows:

Common connector properties
These are the properties of the Kafka Connect framework that are accepted by all
          connectors. For a comprehensive list of these properties, see the Apache Kafka
            documentation.
Stateless NiFi Source properties
These are the properties that are specific to the Stateless NiFi Source connector. All
          Stateless NiFi Source connectors share and accept these properties. For a comprehensive
          list of these properties, see the Stateless NiFi Source property
          reference.
Connector/dataflow-specific properties
These properties are unique to this specific connector. Or to be more precise, unique
            to the dataflow running within the connector. These properties use the following
            prefix:parameter.[***CONNECTOR NAME***] Parameters:For
            a comprehensive list of these properties, see the Syslog UDP Source properties
              reference.

tipWhen creating a new connector
        using the SMM UI, all valid properties for this connector are presented in the default
        configuration template. You can use the template in the UI as a quick reference to view all
        accepted properties. 

Notes and limitations

Required properties must be assigned a valid value even if they
            are not used in the particular configuration. If a required property is not used, either
            leave its default value, or completely remove the property from the configuration
            JSON.
If a property that has a default value is completely removed from
            the configuration JSON, the system uses the default value.
Properties not marked as required must be completely removed from
            the configuration JSON if not set.
The Schema Registry URL property is mandatory
            even if Schema Registry is not used. If Schema Registry is not used, use the default
            value, or completely remove the property from the configuration JSON.
Schemas are only read from Schema Registry if Input Data
              Format is set to GROK and Schema Access
              Strategy is set to Schema Registry.
If Output Format is AVRO, the
            schema of the records can be embedded in the output data. Whether the schema is embedded
            is determined by the Schema Access Strategy property. If this property
            is set to Schema Registry, the schema is not embedded in the output
            messages. The schema is embedded in all other cases.
Schema Branch and Schema Version
            can not be specified at the same time.


Configuration example
In this example, the connector receives data in Syslog 3164 format and transfers it to
        Kafka in JSON format.noteAll properties that are not present in
        this example have suitable default values or are unnecessary for this specific use
        case.

Determines what format incoming messages are expected in.
Output Format
Determines the format in which messages are transferred to Kafka.
