Kafka Connect Overview
Get started with Kafka Connect.
Kafka Connect is a tool for streaming data between Apache Kafka
        and other systems in a reliable and scalable fashion. Kafka Connect makes it simple to
        quickly define connectors that move large collections of data into and out of Kafka. Source
        connectors can ingest entire databases or collect metrics from all your application servers
        into Kafka topics, making the data available for stream processing with low latency. Sink
        connectors can deliver data from Kafka topics into secondary storage and query systems or
        into batch systems for offline analysis.
Kafka Connect in CDP is shipped with many different
        Cloudera developed as well as publicly available sink and source connectors. Each of which
        cover a specific use case for streaming data. In addition to the connectors available by
        default, installing custom developed or third-party connectors is also possible. All
        connectors can be deployed, managed, and monitored using the Streams Messaging Manager UI
        (recommended), Streams Messaging Manager REST API, or Kafka Connect REST API.
See the Related Information section for more information regarding how to set up,
   configure, use, manage, and monitor Kafka Connect and its connectors.
