Configuring Kerberos authentication for the Kafka Connect role
Learn how Kerberos authentication is configured for the Kafka Connect role.
Kafka Connect roles inherit the Kerberos configuration of the parent Kafka service. If you are
      deploying Kafka Connect roles under a Kafka service that already has Kerberos enabled,
      Cloudera Manager will automatically enable Kerberos for Kafka Connect as well. Other than
      making sure that the Kafka serviceâ€™s Kerberos configuration is correctly set, no additional
      user action is required.
