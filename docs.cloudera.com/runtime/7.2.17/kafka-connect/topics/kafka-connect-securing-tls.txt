Configuring TLS/SSL encryption for the Kafka Connect role
Kafka Connect roles inherit the TLS/SSL configuration of the parent Kafka service. If
    you are deploying Kafka Connect roles under a Kafka service that already has TLS/SSL enabled,
    Cloudera Manager will automatically enable TLS/SSL for Connect as well. If required however, you
    can manually enable or disable TLS/SSL. 
In Cloudera Manager, select the Kafka service. Go to Configuration.Find and configure the following properties based on your cluster and
          requirements.

Description




Enable TLS/SSL for Kafka Connect
ssl_enabled

Encrypt communication between clients and Kafka Connect using Transport
                    Layer Security (TLS) (formerly known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL)).



Kafka Connect TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore File
                        Location
ssl_server_keystore_location

The path to the TLS/SSL keystore file containing the server certificate and
                    private key used for TLS/SSL. Used when Kafka Connect is acting as a TLS/SSL
                    server.



Kafka Connect TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore File
                        Password
ssl_server_keystore_password

The password for the Kafka Connect keystore file.



Kafka Connect TLS/SSL Server JKS Keystore Key
                      Password
ssl_server_keystore_keypassword

The password that protects the private key contained in the JKS keystore
                    used when Kafka Connect is acting as a TLS/SSL server.



Kafka Connect TLS/SSL Trust Store File
ssl_client_truststore_location

The location on disk of the trust store, used to confirm the authenticity
                    of TLS/SSL servers that Kafka Connect might connect to. This trust store must
                    contain the certificate(s) used to sign the service(s) connected to. If this
                    parameter is not provided, the default list of well-known certificate
                    authorities is used instead.



Kafka Connect TLS/SSL Trust Store Password
ssl_client_truststore_password

The password for the Kafka Connect TLS/SSL Trust Store File. This password
                    is not required to access the trust store; this field can be left blank. This
                    password provides optional integrity checking of the file. The contents of trust
                    stores are certificates, and certificates are public information.


ssl.client.auth
Client authentication mode for SSL connections. This configuration has
                    three valid values, required, requested, and none. If set to required, client
                    authentication is required. If set to requested, client authentication is
                    requested and clients without certificates can still connect. If set to none,
                    which is the default value, no client authentication is required
