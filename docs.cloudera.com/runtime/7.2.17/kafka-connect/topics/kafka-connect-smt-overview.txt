Single Message Transforms
Single Message Transforms (SMT) is a message transformation framework that you can
  deploy on top of Kafka Connect connectors to apply message transformations and filtering. Learn
  about the SMT framework as well as the transformation plugins available in CDP.
Kafka Connect connectors provide ready-to-use tools to integrate between Kafka and external
      data stores. Still, in many use cases, the data moved by the connectors require some
      sanitization and transformation. To provide extra flexibility built on top of connectors,
      Kafka Connect also supports an SMT framework.
The SMT framework installs a transformation chain on top of connectors that modifies and
      filters the data on a single message basis. An SMT chain consists of transform and predicate
      plugins. Transform plugins are used to modify the data. For example, you can insert, replace,
      mask as well as perform various other modifications on the messages moved by connectors.
      Predicate plugins are used to add additional logic to your chain so that the transformation
      chain is only applied to messages which satisfy specified conditions. 
The SMT framework requires that data is converted to the Kafka Connect internal data format.
      This data format is specific to Kafka Connect and consists of a structure and schema
      descriptor (SchemaAndValue) specific to Connect. 



Supported SMT plugins
Kafka in CDP ships with and supports the following SMT plugins:
All Apache Kafka plugins. For more information, see Transformations in the Apache Kafka documentation.
All Debezium plugins. For more information, see Transformations in the Debezium documentation.
The following Cloudera specific plugins:
ConvertFromBytes
ConvertToBytes
noteThe ConverFromBytes and
                ConvertToBytes transformation plugins transform binary data to and
              from the Kafka Connect internal data format. These plugins are specifically developed
              to enable the use of the SMT framework with connectors that only support binary
              data.
