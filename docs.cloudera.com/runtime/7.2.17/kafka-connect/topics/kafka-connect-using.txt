Using Kafka Connect 
Learn how you can manage, monitor and configure Kafka Connect. 
There are multiple ways that you can manage, monitor and configure Kafka connect in CDP. It
      is important to make a distinction between the Kafka Connect roles and Kafka Connect
      connectors as they are managed through different interfaces.

The Kafka Connect Role
Kafka Connect roles are roles that you can deploy within a Kafka service, they represent
          Kafka Connect workers. Because these roles are deployed with and managed by Cloudera
          Manager, their management and configuration is done through Cloudera Manager. In other
          words the connect workers you deploy will be managed and configured in Cloudera Manager.
          For more information see Configuring Kafka Connect and the Cloudera Manager
          Documentation.


Kafka Connect Connectors
Connectors are not managed by Cloudera Manager, instead multiple other interfaces can be
          used to interact with them. These are the following:
Streams Messaging Manager UIThe Streams Messaging Manager UI is a
                recommended interface in CDP to manage connectors. Comprehensive documentation is
                provided on the usage of the UI in Monitoring Kafka Connect.
The Streams Messaging Manager REST APIThe Streams Messaging Manager REST
                API is a recommended interface in CDP to manage connectors. For more information,
                see the SMM REST API Reference.noteBoth the Streams
                Messaging Manager UI and Streams Messaging Manager REST API support the same
                management actions.
The Kafka Connect REST APIThe Kafka connect REST API can be used to manage
                connectors. However, its usage is not recommended by Cloudera, nor is separate
                documentation provided. For more information, see the upstream Apache Kafka
                documentation.

This can be done on both secure and unsecure clusters by deploying and configuring a new connector   with the SMM UI. Using the AvroConverterThe AvroConverter is a Kafka Connect converter shipped with Cloudera Runtime that   enables Kafka Connect connectors to serialize or deserialize Kafka messages, consisting of key and   value pairs, from or to Avro. Using the Avro format can make your messages more compact compared   to using for example JSON format. AvroConverter is able to convert from Avro format to Kafka   Connect internal data format, and from Kafka Connect internal data to Avro format, and is able to   handle Avro schemas integrated with Schema Registry automatically.Configuring EOS for source connectorsLearn how to enable and configure exactly-once semantics (EOS) for Kafka Connect         source connectors.
