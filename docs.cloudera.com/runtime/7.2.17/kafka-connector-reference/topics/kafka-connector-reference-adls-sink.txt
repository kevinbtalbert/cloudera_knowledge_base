                filename.
${filename.sequence}: Inserts an incrementing sequence value in
                the filename.
In order to generate unique filenames, either ${filename.uuid}
              or ${filename.sequence} must be used in the pattern. Examples:
data_${filename.uuid}.json
records_${filename.timestamp}_${filename.sequence}.avro


Default Value
${filename.uuid}
Accepted Values

Required
false


Output Filename Sequence Initial Value

Description
This property is used to configure the initial value of the
              ${filename.sequence} expression. The value you set in this property
            is not the initial value of the sequence. The sequence starts at the value of this

Default Value
6
Accepted Values

Required
false

Schema Access Strategy

Description
Specifies the strategy used for determining the schema of the Kafka record. The value
            you set here depends on the data format set in Kafka Message Data
              Format. If set to Schema Registry, the schema is read from
            Schema Registry. This setting can be used with both Avro and JSON formats. If set to
              Infer Schema, the schema is inferred based on the input file. This
            setting can only be used if Kafka Message Data Format is
              JSON. If set to Embedded Schema, the schema embedded
            in the input is used. This setting can only be used if Kafka Message Data

            completely removed from the configuration JSON.
Default Value
