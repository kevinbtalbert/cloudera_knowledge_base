HTTP Sink properties reference
Review the following reference for a comprehensive list of the connector properties
    that are specific to the HTTP Sink connector.

The properties listed in this reference must be added to the connector configuration with
        the following
        prefix:parameter.[***CONNECTOR NAME***] Parameters:
In addition to the properties listed here, this connector also accepts certain properties
        of the Kafka Connect framework as well as the properties of the NiFi Stateless Sink
        connector. When creating a new connector using the SMM UI, all valid properties are
        presented in the default configuration template. You can view the configuration template to
        get a full list of valid properties. In addition, for more information regarding the
        accepted properties not listed here, you can review the Apache Kafka documentation and the Stateless NiFi Sink properties reference.
