Grok Expression

Description
Specifies the format of a line in Grok format. This allows the connector to understand
            how to parse each line in the input file. If a line in the file does not match this
            pattern, the line is handled according to what is set in the Grok No Match Behavior

Description
Specifies how to handle lines that do not match the pattern set in the Grok Expression
              property.
If set to append-to-previous-message, non-matching lines are
                appended to the last field of the previous message.
If set to skip-line, non-matching lines are skipped. If set to
                  raw-line, non-matching lines are only added to the
                  _raw field.

If set to output-oneline, each line of the output data becomes
                one JSON object. That is, each JSON object occupies one line in the output.

Schema Access Strategy

Description
Specifies the strategy used for determining the schema of the input message. This
            property only takes effect if the input data format is GROK or if the output data format
            is AVRO. 
If input is GROK and this property is set to Schema Registry,
                schemas are read from Schema Registry.
 If input is GROK and this property is set to Field Names from Grok
                  Expression. The schema is determined using the field names in the Grok
                Expression property.
If output is AVRO and this property is set to Schema Registry, schemas are not
                embedded in the output AVRO file. This behaviour is true even if Schema Registry is
                not used.
If output is AVRO and this property is set to any string other than Schema
                Registry, schemas are embedded in the output AVRO file.
