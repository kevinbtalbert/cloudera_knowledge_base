.Net client examplesYou can produce messages to and consume messages from a Kafka cluster using the command     line. For most cases however, running Kafka producers and consumers using shell scripts and     Kafka’s command line scripts cannot be used in practice. In these cases, built-in Kafka client     development is the generally accepted option.
