Extracting KRaft metadata
Learn how to extract Kafka metadata from the __cluster_metadata
            topic. Metadata extracted from this topic can be used for debugging and
        troubleshooting issues with a Kafka deployment running in KRaft mode.

noteKafka KRaft is available in this version of CDP but is
        not ready for production deployment. Cloudera encourages you to explore this technical
        preview feature in non-production environments and provide feedback on your experiences
        through the Cloudera Community Forums. For more information regarding KRaft limitations and
        unsupported features, see Known Issues in Apache
          Kafka.
When Kafka is running in KRaft mode, metadata describing the state of the Kafka
                cluster is stored in the __cluster_metadata topic. This topic can
                be found in the /var/local/kraft/data directory on each KRaft
                Controller service role host. 
In case you encounter any issues when running your deployment in KRaft mode,
                generally the first step is to print the contents of the
                    __cluster_metadata topic. Reviewing the contents of the topic
                can help in identifying the issues with the cluster.
The contents of the __cluster_metadata topic can be
                printed using the kafka-dump-log command with the
                    --cluster-metadata-decoder option.


Log in to one of your cluster hosts that has a KRaft service role (KRaft
                    Controller) deployed on it.

Run the kafka-dump-log command with the
                        --cluster-metadata-decoder option. For example:

kafka-dump-log --cluster-metadata-decoder --files /var/local/kraft/data/__cluster_metadata-0/00000000000000000000.log
