Learn how you can set up Kafka KRaft in CDP Public Cloud
noteKafka KRaft is available in this version of CDP but is
        not ready for production deployment. Cloudera encourages you to explore this technical
        preview feature in non-production environments and provide feedback on your experiences
        through the Cloudera Community Forums. For more information regarding KRaft limitations and
        unsupported features, see Known Issues in Apache
          Kafka.
Kafka KRaft in CDP is implemented in the form of a Kafka service role. The role is called KRaft
   Controller. In CDP Public Cloud, KRaft Controller roles can be deployed with the Streams
   Messaging Light Duty, Heavy Duty, and High Availability cluster definitions available in the Data
   Hub service. 
Each of the definitions include an optional KRaft Nodes host group. The
   KRaft Controller roles are deployed on the nodes of this host group. If you want to deploy a
   Streams Messaging cluster that uses KRaft for metadata management, you must provision your
   cluster with at least a single KRaft node (three is recommended). KRaft nodes are also scalable
   after the cluster is provisioned. 
For more information regarding the Streams Messaging cluster definitions, scaling, cluster
   deployment with Data Hub, as well as KRaft, see the Related Information.
