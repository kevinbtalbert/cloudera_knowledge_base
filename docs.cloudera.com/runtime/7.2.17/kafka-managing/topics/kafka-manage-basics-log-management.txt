Broker log management
Learn more about the configuration properties related to broker log
    management.
Kafka brokers save their data as log segments in a directory. The logs are rotated depending
      on the size and time settings.
The most common log retention settings to adjust for your cluster are shown below. These are
      accessible in Cloudera Manager via the Kafka > Configuration tab.

log.dirs: The location for the Kafka data (that is, topic directories and
        log segments). 
log.retention.{ms|minutes|hours}: The retention period for the entire
        log. Any older log segments are removed. 
log.retention.bytes: The retention size for the entire log. 

In addition, there are many more configuration properties available for fine-tuning broker
      log management. For more information look for the following properties in theBroker
        Configs section in the upstream Apache Kafka documentation.

log.flush.*
