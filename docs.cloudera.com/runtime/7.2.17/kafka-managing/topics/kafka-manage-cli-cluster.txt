kafka-cluster
Learn about the kafka-cluster CLI tool, which you can use to print the ID of a Kafka
  cluster.
Use the kafka-cluster tool to retrieve the ID of the Kafka cluster. The ID of
   a Kafka cluster is automatically generated by Cloudera Manager when you first start your Kafka
   service. The ID you retrieve is used when carrying out management actions for your Kafka service
   using other CLI
    tools.kafka-cluster cluster-id --bootstrap-server [***HOST***]:[***PORT***] --config [***PROPERTY FILE***] 
Replace [***HOST***]:[***PORT***] with the host and
     port of a broker.
Replace [***PROPERTY FILE***] with the location of a configuration file
     that contains all necessary security properties that are required to establish a connection
     with the Kafka service. This option is only required if your Kafka service is secured. 

Output
