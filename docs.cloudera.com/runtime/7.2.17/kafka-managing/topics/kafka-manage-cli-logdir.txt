Learn how to use the kafka-log-dirs tool.
The kafka-log-dirs tool allows user to query a list of replicas per log
      directory on a broker. The tool provides information that is required for optimizing replica
      assignment across brokers. 
To retrieve replica assignment information, run the following
      command:kafka-log-dirs --describe --bootstrap-server hostname:port --broker-list broker 1, broker 2 --topic-list topic 1, topic 2
importantOn secure clusters the admin client config property
      file has to be specified with the --command-config option. Otherwise, the
      tool fails to execute.
If no topic is specified with the --topic-list option, then all topics are
      queried. If no broker is specified with the --broker-list option, then all
      brokers are queried. If a log directory is offline, the log directory will be marked offline
      in the script output. Error
      example:"error":"org.apache.kafka.common.errors.KafkaStorageException"
On successful execution, the tool prints a list of partitions per log directory for the
      specified topics and brokers. The list contains information on topic partition, size, offset
      lag, and reassignment state. Example
      output:{
    "brokers": [
        {
            "broker": 86,
            "logDirs": [
                {
                    "error": null,
                    "logDir": "/var/local/kafka/data",
                    "partitions": [
                        {
                            "isFuture": false,
                            "offsetLag": 0,
                            "partition": "mytopic1-2",
                            "size": 0
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        },
        ...
    ],
    "version": 1
}

Table 1. Contents of the kafka-log-dirs Output

Property
Description



broker
Displays the ID of the broker.


error
Indicates if there is a problem with the disk that hosts the topic partition. If
              an error is detected,
                org.apache.kafka.common.errors.KafkaStorageException is displayed.
              If no error is detected, the value is null.


logDir
Specifies the location of the log directory. Returns an absolute path.


isfuture
The reassignment state of the partition. This property shows whether there is
              currently replica movement underway between the log directories.


offsetLag
Displays the offset lag of the partition.


partition
Displays the name of the partition.


size
Displays the size of the partition in bytes.
