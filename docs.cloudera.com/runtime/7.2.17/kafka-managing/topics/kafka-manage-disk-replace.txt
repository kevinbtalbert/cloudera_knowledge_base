Disk Replacement
Learn how to replace a disk.
In case of a disk failure, a Kafka administrator can replace the faulty disk with a
      new one.
Stop the broker that has a faulty disk:
In Cloudera Manager, go to the Kafka service, select
                  Instances and select the
              broker.
Go to Actions > Gracefully stop
                  this Kafka Broker.
Replace the disk.Mount the disk.Set up the directory structure on the new disk the same way as it was set up on the
          previous disk. 
noteYou can find the directory paths for the old disk in the Data
              Directories property of the broker.
Start the broker:
In Cloudera Manager go to the Kafka service,
                  selectInstances and select the
              broker.
Go to Actions > Start this Kafka
                  Broker. 

The disk is replaced. The Kafka broker re-creates topic partitions in the same
      directory by replicating data from other brokers.
