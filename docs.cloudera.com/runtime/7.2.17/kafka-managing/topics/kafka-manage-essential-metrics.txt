Essential metrics to monitor
Cloudera Manager collects a high number of performance metrics for the Kafka services
    running on your clusters. Certain metrics should be monitored in any Kafka deployment as they
    can help you to improve the stability and performance of your Kafka deployment.
The following tables collect the Kafka broker metrics that Cloudera recommends you to monitor
      in any Kafka deployment. For more information on metrics, including a full list of Kafka
      metrics, see Cloudera Manager Metrics.
