Settings to avoid data loss
An overview of default configuration properties to avoid data loss.
If for some reason the producer cannot deliver messages that have been consumed and committed
      by the consumer, it is possible for a MirrorMaker process to lose data. The following
      collection of properties are set by default and help with preventing data loss when
      replicating data. In addition, note that MirrorMaker starts correctly if you enter the numeric
      values in the configuration snippet (rather than using "max integer" for
        retries and "max long" for max.block.ms).
