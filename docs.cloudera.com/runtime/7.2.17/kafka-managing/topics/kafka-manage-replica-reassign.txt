Reassigning replicas between log directories 
Learn about replica reassignment between log directories.
Reassigning replicas between log directories can prove useful when you have multiple disks
      available, but one or more of them is nearing capacity. Moving a replica from one disk to
      another ensures that the service will not go down due to disks reaching capacity. To balance
      storage loads, the Kafka administrator has to continuously monitor the system and reassign
      replicas between log directories on the same broker or across different brokers. These actions
      can be carried out with the kafka-reassign-partitions tool.
 For more information on tool usage, see the kafka-reassign-paritions tool
      description.
