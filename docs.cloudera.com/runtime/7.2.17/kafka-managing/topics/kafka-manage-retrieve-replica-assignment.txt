Retrieving log directory replica assignment information
Learn how log directory replica assignment information can be retrieved.
To optimize replica assignment across log directories, the list of partitions per log
      directory and the size of each partition is required. This information can be exposed with the
        kafka-log-dirs tool. 
 For more information on tool usage, see the kafka-log-dirs tool
      description.
