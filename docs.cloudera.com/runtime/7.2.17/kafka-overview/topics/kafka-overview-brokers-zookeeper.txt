Kafka brokers and Zookeeper
Learn about the types of data maintained in Zookeeper by the brokers.
The broker, topic, and partition information are maintained in
     Zookeeper. In particular, the partition information, including
     partition and replica locations, updates fairly frequently. Because of
     frequent metadata refreshes, the connection between the brokers and
     the Zookeeper cluster needs to be reliable. Similarly, if the
     Zookeeper cluster has other intensive processes running on it, that
     can add sufficient latency to the broker/Zookeeper interactions to
     cause issues.

Kafka Controller maintains leadership through Zookeeper (shown in orange)
Kafka Brokers also store other relevant metadata in Zookeeper
       (also in orange)
Kafka Partitions maintain replica information in Zookeeper
       (shown in blue)
