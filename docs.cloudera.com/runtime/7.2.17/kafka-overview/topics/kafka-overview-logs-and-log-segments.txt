Logs and log segments
Learn more about logs and log segments.
Within each topic, each partition in Kafka stores records in a log structured format.
     Conceptually, each record is stored sequentially in this type of
     “log”. 
Figure 1. Partitions in Log Structured Format


noteThese references to “log” should not be confused with where the
     Kafka broker stores their operational logs.
In actuality, each partition does not keep all the records
     sequentially in a single file. Instead, it breaks each log into
     log segments. Log segments can be defined using a size limit (for
     example, 1 GB), as a time limit (for example, 1 day), or both.
     Administration around Kafka records often occurs at the log segment
     level.
Each of the partitions is broken into segments, with Segment N
     containing the most recent records and Segment 1 containing the oldest
     retained records. This is configurable on a per-topic basis.
