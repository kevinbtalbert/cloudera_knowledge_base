Record order and assignment
Learn about how Kafka assigns records to partitions.
By default, Kafka assigns records to a partitions round-robin. There
     is no guarantee that records sent to multiple partitions will
     retain the order in which they were produced.
     Within a single consumer, your program will only have record
     ordering within the records belonging to the same partition.
     This tends to be sufficient for many use cases, but does add some
     complexity to the stream processing logic.
tipKafka guarantees that records in the same partition
     will be in the same order in all replicas of that partition.
If the order of records
     is important, the producer can ensure that records are sent to the
     same partition. The producer can
     include metadata in the record to override the default assignment in
     one of two ways:

The record can indicate a specific partition.
The record can includes an assignment key. The hash of the key
       and the number of partitions in the topic determines which
       partition the record is assigned to. Including the same key in
       multiple records ensures all the records are appended to the same
       partition.
