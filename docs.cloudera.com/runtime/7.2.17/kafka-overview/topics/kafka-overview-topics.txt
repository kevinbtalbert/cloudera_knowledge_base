Learn more about Kafka topics.
In any publish-subscribe system, messages from one publisher, called producers in Kafka, have
      to find their way to the subscribers, called consumers in Kafka. To achieve this, Kafka
      introduces the concept of topics, which allow for easy matching between producers and
      consumers. 
A topic is a queue of messages that share similar characteristics. For example, a topic might
      consist of instant messages from social media or navigation information for users on a web
      site. Topics are written by one or more producers and read by one or more consumers. A topic
      is identified by its name. This name is part of a global namespace of that Kafka cluster. 
As each producer or consumer connects to the publish-subscribe system, it can read from or
      write to a specific topic.
