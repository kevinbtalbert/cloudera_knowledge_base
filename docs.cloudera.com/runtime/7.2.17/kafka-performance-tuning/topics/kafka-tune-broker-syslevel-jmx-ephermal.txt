Configure JMX ephemeral ports
Learn more aboutKafka JMX ephermal ports and how to configure them.
Kafka uses two high-numbered ephemeral ports for JMX. These ports are listed when you view
        netstat -anp information for the Kafka broker process.

You can change the number for the first port by adding a command similar to the following
        to the field Additional Broker Java Options (broker_java_opts) in Cloudera
        Manager.
        -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=port
The JMX_PORT configuration maps to com.sun.management.jmxremote.port by
        default. To access JMX via JConsole, run jconsole
          ${BROKER_HOST}:9393

The second ephemeral port used for JMX communication is implemented for the JRMP protocol
        and cannot be changed.
