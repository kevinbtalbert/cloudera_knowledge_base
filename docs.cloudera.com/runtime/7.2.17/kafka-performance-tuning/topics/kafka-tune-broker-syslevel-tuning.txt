Operating system related kernel parameters affect overall performance of Kafka. These
    parameters can be configured via sysctl at runtime. To make kernel
    configuration changes persistent (that is, use adjusted parameters after a reboot), edit
      /etc/sysctl.conf. The following sections describe some important kernel
    settings. 
File descriptor limitsLearn more about file descriptor requirements.FilesystemsLearn how mount options such as noatime and relatime     affect Kafka performance.Virtual memory handlingLearn about how virtual memory handling affects Kafka performance. Networking parametersAn overview on Linux kernel parameters related to networking to fine tune for better     Kafka performance.Configure JMX ephemeral portsLearn more aboutKafka JMX ephermal ports and how to configure them.
