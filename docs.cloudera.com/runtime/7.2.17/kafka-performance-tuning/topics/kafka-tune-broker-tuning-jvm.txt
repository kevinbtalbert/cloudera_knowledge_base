JVM and garbage collection
Learn more about garbage collection for Kafka.
Garbage collection has a huge impact on performance of JVM based applications. It is
      recommended to use the Garbage-First (G1) garbage collector for Kafka broker. In Cloudera
      Manager specify the following under Additional Broker Java Options in the Kafka service
      configuration: 

-server -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=20
-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=35 -XX:+DisableExplicitGC
-Djava.awt.headless=true -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
          
Cloudera recommends to set 4-8 GB of JVM heap size memory for the brokers depending on your
      use case. As Kafkaâ€™s performance depends heavily on the operating systems page cache, it is
      not recommended to collocate with other memory-hungry applications.

Large messages can cause longer garbage collection (GC) pauses as brokers allocate large
        chunks. Monitor the GC log and the server log. Add this to Broker Java Options:

 -XX:+PrintGC -XX:+PrintGCDetails
 -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps
-Xloggc:</path/to/file.txt>

If long GC pauses cause Kafka to abandon the ZooKeeper session, you may need to configure
        longer timeout values, see Kafka-ZooKeeper performance tuning for details.
