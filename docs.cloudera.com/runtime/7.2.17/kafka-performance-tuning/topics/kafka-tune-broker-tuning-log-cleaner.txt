Log cleaner
 An overview on configuration properties related to log compaction.
 The following cluster-wide configuration settings can be used to fine tune log
      compaction:

log.cleaner.threads controls how many background threads are responsible
        for log compaction. Increasing this value improves performance of log compaction at the cost
        of increased I/O activity.
log.cleaner.io.max.bytes.per.second throttles log cleaner’s I/O activity
        so that the sum of its read and write is less than this value on average.
log.cleaner.dedupe.buffer.size specifies memory used for log compaction
        across all cleaner threads.
log.cleaner.io.buffer.size controls total memory used for log cleaner I/O
        buffers across all cleaner threads.
log.cleaner.min.compaction.lag.ms controls how long messages are left
        uncompacted.
log.cleaner.io.buffer.load.factor controls log cleaner’s load factor for
        the dedupe buffer. Increasing this value allows the system to clean more logs at once but
        increases hash collisions.
log.cleaner.backoff.ms controls how long to wait until the next check if
        there is no log to compact.
