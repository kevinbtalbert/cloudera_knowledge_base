Configure TLS/SSL authentication for Kafka clients
 Kafka supports TLS/SSL authentication (two-way authentication). Client configuration
    is done by setting the relevant security-related properties for the client.

The following steps demonstrate configuration for the console consumer or producer. If you
        are configuring a custom developed client, see Java client security examples  or
          .Net client security examples for code examples.




Generate or acquire a key and truststore for your clients which contain all necessary
            keys and certificates. 
Note down the locations and passwords for the key and truststores. You will need to
            provide these during configuration.
If the Certificate Authority of the client certificates is different from the
            Certificate Authority of the broker certificates, ensure the client Certificate
            Authority certificate is added to the truststore of the Kafka brokers.Otherwise, the
              broker will not trust the certificates used by its clients and a trusted connection
              will not be established.



Create a .properties file.In this example the file is
          named client.properties.Add the mandatory properties to the file.The following configuration
          example contains all mandatory properties:
          security.protocol=SSL
ssl.truststore.location=[***PATH TO CLIENT TRUSTSTORE***]
ssl.truststore.password=[***PASSWORD***]
ssl.keystore.location=[***PATH TO CLIENT KEYSTORE***]
ssl.keystore.password=[***PASSWORD***]
ssl.key.password=[***PASSWORD***](Optional) Add additional properties.Depending on your requirements and
          broker configuration, other configuration properties might also be needed. The following
          are some of the most commonly used optional properties:
ssl.provider

ss.cipher.suites
ssl.enabled.protocols
ssl.truststore.type
ssl.keystore.type
Run the client.

Console Consumer

kafka-console-producer --bootstrap-server [***HOST1:PORT1***] --topic [***TOPIC***] --producer.config client.properties

Console Producer

kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server [***HOST1:PORT1***] --topic [***TOPIC***] --consumer.config client.properties



Kafka clients are configured for TLS/SSL
      authentication.
