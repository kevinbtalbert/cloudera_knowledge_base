 Rotate the master key/secret
Learn how to rotate the delegation token  Master Key/Secret.

The brokers generate and verify delegation tokens using a secret called
          delegation.token.master.key. This secret is generated by Cloudera Manager
        and securely passed to Kafka brokers when authentication with delegation tokens is enabled.
        You can change the secret with the Cloudera Manager API. This should be done if the secret
        becomes compromised, or simply as a precautionary measure. 
importantClients that were already connected to brokers before starting the
        process, will continue to work even after the master key/secret is rotated. However, any new
        connections (authentication requests), as well as renew and expire requests with old tokens
        can fail. 

Expire existing tokens.
kafka-delegation-tokens --bootstrap-server hostname:port --expire --expiry-time-period -1 --command-config client.properties --hmac lAYYSFmLs4bTjf+lTZ1LCHR/ZZFNA==
Generate a new master key
curl -X PUT -u "user" -H "content-type:application/json" -i "https://cloudera manager host:7183/api/v31/clusters/cluster name/services/kafka service name/config" -d '{"items" : [ {"name" : "delegation.token.master.key","value" : "'$(openssl rand -base64 24)'","sensitive" : true}]}'
Perform a Rolling Restart:
In Cloudera Manager go to the Kafka service and select
                  Actions > Rolling
                Restart.
Check the Restart roles with stale configurations
                only checkbox and click Rolling restart.
Click Close when the restart has
            finished.
Reauthenticate with all clients. This generates the new tokens.
        
The Master Key/Secret is rotated.
