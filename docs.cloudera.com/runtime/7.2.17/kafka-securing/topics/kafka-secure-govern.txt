You can monitor and govern Kafka metadata in Atlas. This can be done by importing Kafka
    topics and clients as entities (metadata) into Atlas. 
Kafka entities can be imported into Atlas by running a one-time import using the
        Import Kafka Topics Into Atlas action available in Cloudera Manager
      or by configuring the Atlas hook in Kafka. The Import Kafka Topics Into
        Atlas action imports existing entities only. Setting up the Atlas hook enables
      continuous import of newly created Kafka entities, but does not import existing ones.
