Configure LDAP authentication for Kafka brokers
Learn how to configure LDAP authentication for Kafka brokers.

You can enable Kafka to use LDAP credentials for client to broker authentication.
        Broker configuration is done by configuring the required properties in Cloudera Manager. 


importantKafka Brokers provisioned after July 28, 2022 use LDAP authentication
        by default. Previously PAM was the default. If your cluster was provisioned following this
        date, LDAP is already configured and you do not need to complete the following steps. If you
        are transitioning from PAM to LDAP, you might need to reconfigure your clients and ensure
        that  your clients use short names. Specifying usernames in the client configuration that
        contain the realm/domain are not supported.

In Cloudera Manager, select the Kafka service.Select Configuration.Enable LDAP authentication:
Find the SASL/PLAIN Authentication
            property.
Click the radio button next to LDAP. Do this for all
              required Kafka services. 
Click Save Changes.Restart the Kafka service.
LDAP authentication is configured for the brokers.
Configure clients to use LDAP authentication.
