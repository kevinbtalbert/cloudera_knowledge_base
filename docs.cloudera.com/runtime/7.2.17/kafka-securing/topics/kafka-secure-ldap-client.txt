Configure Kafka LDAP authentication for Kafka clients
Learn how to configure Kafka clients for LDAP authentication.

You can enable Kafka to use LDAP credentials for client to broker authentication.
        Client configuration is done by adding the required properties to the client's
          client.properties file.



Clients connecting to Data Hub provisioned clusters require a CDP user account that
          provides access to the required CDP resources. Verify that a CDP user account with the
          required roles and permissions is available for use. If not, create one. Any type of CDP
          user account can be used. If you are creating a new account to be used by Kafka clients,
          Cloudera recommends that you create a machine user account. For more information, see
            User Management in the Cloudera Management Console
          documentation.
In addition to the CDP user account having access to the required CDP resources, the
          user account also needs to have the correct policies assigned to it in Ranger. Otherwise,
          the client cannot perform tasks on Kafka resources. These policies are specified within
          the Ranger instance that provides authorization to the Kafka service you want to connect
          to. For more information, see the Cloudera Runtime documentation on Apache Ranger
          and the Kafka specific Ranger documentation.
If you are transitioning from PAM to LDAP, ensure that the usernames you specify in the
          client configuration are short names. Usernames that include the realm/domain are not
          supported.


Set the SASL mechanism to PLAIN.Add the following property to the
            client.properties file.
sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
Configure the security protocol.You can either use
            SASL_SSL or SASL_PLAINTEXT. Which security protocol
          you use will depend on whether or not SSL encryption is enabled on the broker. Add one of
          the following properties to the client.properties file.
If encryption is enabled, use
              SASL_SSL:security.protocol=SASL_SSL
If encryption is not enabled, use
              SASL_PLAINTEXT:security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT
noteIn a public network Cloudera recommends that you use SASL_SSL
            as LDAP credentials can become exposed. Configure the JAAS.You have two options when configuring the
          JAAS:
Embed the required properties in the client.properties file
              with the sasl.jaas.config property.
sasl.jaas.config= \ 
org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required \
    username="[***USERNAME***]" \
    password="[***PASSWORD***]";
Replace [***USERNAME***] and
                  [***PASSWORD***] with the credentials of the CDP user you set
                up for the client in Management Console. For the username, ensure that you use short
                names. Specifying usernames that contain the realm/domain are not supported.

Use a separate JAAS config file:

Add a KafkaClient entry with a login module item to your JAAS configuration
                    file.Example
                    configuration:KafkaClient {
     org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required
     username="[***USERNAME***]"
     password="[***PASSWORD***]";
    };Replace [***USERNAME***]
                    and [***PASSWORD***] with the credentials of the CDP user you
                    set up for the client in Management Console. For the username, ensure that you
                    use short names. Specifying usernames that contain the realm/domain are not
                    supported.
Pass the location of your JAAS configuration file as a JVM parameter through a
                  command line
                    interfaceexport KAFKA_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=[***PATH TO JAAS.CONF***]"
Replace
                      [***PATH TO JAAS.CONF***] with the location of the JAAS
                    configuration file you created.



LDAP authentication is configured for the client.
