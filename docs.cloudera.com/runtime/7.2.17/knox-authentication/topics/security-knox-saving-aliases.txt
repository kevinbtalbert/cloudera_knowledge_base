Saving aliases
There is a new command available for the Knox Gateway role which allows end-users to
  save an alias=password pair to an arbitrary number of topologies on each host
  where an instance of the Knox Gateway is installed without the need of running the Knox CLI tool
  manually.
A new password-type input field is added, called
    save_alias_command_input_password. The format of an entry in this input field
   should be:
    topology_name_1[:topology_name_2:...:topology_name_N].alias_name=password
Example:
    cdp-proxy-api:admin:metadata.knoxLdapSystemPassword=guest-password.
After the end-users entered a meaningful and valid value and saved the configuration
   changes they can run the command from Knoxâ€™s action list: Actions/Save
   Alias.
tipIf you need to add a Gateway level alias, please use __gateway
   as topology name. For instance:
   __gateway.knoxLdapSystemPassword=admin-password.
