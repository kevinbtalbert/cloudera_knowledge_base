note
APIs, UIs, and SSO in the Apache Knox project that are not listed above are considered
    Community Features.
Community Features are developed and tested by the Apache Knox community but are not
    officially supported by Cloudera. These features are excluded for a variety of reasons,
    including insufficient reliability or incomplete test case coverage, declaration of
    non-production readiness by the community at large, and feature deviation from Cloudera best
    practices. Do not use these features in your production environments.​
