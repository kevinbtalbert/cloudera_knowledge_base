Manage Knox Gateway tokens
You can enable, disable, or revoke tokens via the Knox homepage.
To access Knox token management, go to
              https://KNOX_GATEWAY_HOST:PORT/GATEWAY_PATH/homepage/home,
          e.g. https://localhost:8443/gateway/homepage/home. Click on
            Token Management.







Active token will be displayed in green; expired tokens are red.If
            Knox Token Integration - Enable Impersonation is set to true, the logged user will see
            two tables:

Tokens of the logged-in user


Tokens the logged-in user has generated for other users
                (impersonation)

The tables also display information about additional metadata





On this page, you will see basic information about your generated token(s) and you can
          execute the following actions:

Enable/Disable: Temporarily
            enable/disable a token. noteDisabled tokens are not allowed to be use for
              authentication purposes.
Revoke: Permanently remove the token from the persistent
            store. cautionThis action cannot be undone; once you revoke a token, Knox
              will delete it from the in-memory cache and the underlying persistent token
              storage.


Click the Refresh icon above the table.
