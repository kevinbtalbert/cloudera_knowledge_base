Overview
Instead of using a basic username/password pair, you can improve security by generating
    Knox Gateway tokens. Tokens are more secure than plaintext username/password because they are
    signed, anonymized from the source data, and have a specified lifetime (by default, one hour). 
About Knox gateway tokens 
Before CDP 7.2.14, Knox on CDP Public Cloud had two default topologies:
          cdp-proxy and cdp-proxy-api. To enable passcode tokens,
        a third Knox topology was added: cdp-proxy-token. While very similar to
          cdp-proxy-api, the authentication provider for
          cdp-proxy-token is configured with the JWTFederation provider, so that
        newly generated tokens can be used.

View Knox token integration
Knox token integration can be accessed via Cloudera Manager or the Knox homepage:
(Recommended) Cloudera Manager: Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Knox > Configuration and search for Knox Token Integration.




Navigate to the Management Console service > Data Lakes > (Your cluster) > Token
            Integration (under the Services tab). This will bring you to the Knox homepage. There
            are two new links on your Knox homepage homepage: Token
              Management and Token Generation.







Knox token integration in CDP works out of the box using the Knox
                Token Generation page. However, the token integration API can be re-used in your
              own custom topology. noteThe only
              restriction of the above approach is that your custom topology must not use the
                HadoopAuth authentication provider because it won't work with the
                KNOXTOKEN service due to a known issue (which will be fixed in future
              releases).
