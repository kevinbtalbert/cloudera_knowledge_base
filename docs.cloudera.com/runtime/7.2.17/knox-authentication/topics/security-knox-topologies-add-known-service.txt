Enable proxy for a known service in Apache Knox
How to enable auto-discovery for a known service in Knox proxy via Cloudera
    Manager.
Known services are officially-supported Knox
        services (like Apache Atlas, Ranger, Solr, etc.) Cloudera Manager provides and manages all
        the required service definition files.For the purposes of this example, we add
        ATLAS and ATLAS UI to cdp-proxy. You can
      add more services; for a comprehensive list of knoxn services that can be enabled, see Knox
        Supported Services Matrix.

From Cloudera Manager > Knox > Configuration, check the Gateway Auto Discovery (cdp-proxy) -
            $Component boxes.
In this example, we enable:
gateway_auto_discovery_cdp_proxy_enabled_atlas

gateway_auto_discovery_cdp_proxy_enabled_atlas_ui







Save your changes.

The ‘Refresh needed’ stale configuration indicator appears; click it and wait until the
          refresh process finishes.






Validate that ATLAS in cdp-proxy was added by going
          to the following URL:
              https://$KNOX_GATEWAY_HOST:$PORT/$GATEWAY_PATH/admin/api/v1/topologies/cdp-proxy.
