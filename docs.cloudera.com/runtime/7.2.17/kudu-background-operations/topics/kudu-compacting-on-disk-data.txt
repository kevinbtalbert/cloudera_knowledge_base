Compacting on-disk data
Kudu constantly performs several compaction tasks in order to maintain consistent read
      and write performance over time.

 A merging compaction, which combines multiple DiskRowSets together into a single DiskRowSet, is run by CompactRowSetsOp. 
 Kudu also runs two types of delta store compaction operations:
               MinorDeltaCompactionOp and MajorDeltaCompactionOp.  For more information on what these compaction operations do, see
               the Kudu Tablet design
                  document. 


 The metrics associated with these tasks have the prefix compact_rs, delta_minor_compact_rs, and delta_major_compact_rs, respectively.
