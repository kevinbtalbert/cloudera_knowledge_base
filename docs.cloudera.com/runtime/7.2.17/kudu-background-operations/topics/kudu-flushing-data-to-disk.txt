Flushing data to disk
Flushing data from memory to disk relieves memory pressure and can improve read
      performance by switching from a write-optimized, row-oriented in-memory format in the MemRowSet, to a read-optimized, column-oriented
      format on disk.
 Background tasks that flush data include FlushMRSOp and FlushDeltaMemStoresOp. The metrics associated
         with these operations have the prefix flush_mrs and flush_dms,
         respectively. 
 With Kudu 1.4, the maintenance manager aggressively schedules flushes
         of in-memory data when memory consumption crosses 60 percent of the configured process-wide
         memory limit. The backpressure mechanism which begins to throttle client writes was also
         adjusted to not begin throttling until memory consumption reaches 80 percent of the
         configured limit. These two changes together result in improved write throughput, more
         consistent latency, and fewer timeouts due to memory exhaustion.
