Changing directory configuration
For higher read parallelism and larger volumes of storage per server, you can
    configure servers to store data in multiple directories on different devices using the
      --fs_data_dirs Gflag configuration.

You can add or remove data directories to an existing master or tablet server by updating
        the --fs_data_dirs Gflag configuration and restarting the server. Data is
        striped across data directories, and when a new data directory is added, new data will be
        striped across the union of the old and new directories. 
note
Removing a data directory from --fs_data_dirs may result in failed
          tablet replicas in cases where there were data blocks in the directory that was removed.
          Use ksck to ensure the cluster can fully recover from the directory
          removal before moving onto another server.
In versions of Kudu below 1.12, Kudu requires that the kudu fs
            update_dirs tool be run before restarting with a different set of data
          directories. Such versions will fail to start if not run.

If on a Kudu version below 1.12, once a server is started, users must go through the below
        steps to change the directory configuration:
note Unless the --force flag is specified, Kudu will not allow for the
        removal of a directory across which tablets are configured to spread data. If
          --force is specified, all tablets configured to use that directory will
        fail upon starting up and be replicated elsewhere. 
note If the metadata directory overlaps with a data directory, as was the default prior to
        Kudu 1.7, or if a non-default metadata directory is configured, the
          --fs_metadata_dir configuration must be specified when running the
          kudu fs update_dirs tool. 
note Only new tablet replicas, i.e. brand new tablets' replicas and replicas that are copied
        to the server for high availability, will use the new directory. Existing tablet replicas on
        the server will not be rebalanced across the new directory. 
note All of the command line steps below should be executed as the Kudu
        UNIX user, typically kudu. 

Use ksck to ensure the cluster is healthy, and establish a maintenance
          window to bring the tablet server offline.

 The tool can only run while the server is offline, so establish a maintenance window
          to update the server. The tool itself runs quickly, so this offline window should be
          brief, and as such, only the server to update needs to be offline.
However, if the server is offline for too long (see the
            follower_unavailable_considered_failed_sec flag), the tablet replicas
          on it may be evicted from their Raft groups. To avoid this, it may be desirable to bring
          the entire cluster offline while performing the update.

 Run the tool with the desired directory configuration flags. For example, if a cluster
          was set up with --fs_wal_dir=/wals, ‑‑fs_metadata_dir=/meta, and ‑‑fs_data_dirs=/data/1,/data/2,/data/3, and /data/3 is to be
          removed (e.g. due to a disk error), run the command:

$ sudo -u kudu kudu fs update_dirs --force --fs_wal_dir=/wals --fs_metadata_dir=/meta --fs_data_dirs=/data/1,/data/2


 Modify the value of the --fs_data_dirs
          flag for the updated sever. If using Cloudera Manager, make sure to only update the
          configurations of the updated server, rather than of the entire Kudu service. 

 Once complete, the server process can be started. When Kudu is installed using system
          packages, service is typically used:

$ sudo service kudu-tserver start


Use ksck to ensure Kudu returns to a healthy state before resuming
          normal operation.
