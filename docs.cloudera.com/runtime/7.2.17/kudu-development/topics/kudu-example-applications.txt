Kudu example applications
Several example applications are provided in the examples
    directory of the Apache Kudu git repository. Each example includes a README
    that shows how to compile and run it. The following list includes some of the examples that are
    available today. Check the repository itself in case this list goes out of date. 

cpp/example.cc:

 A simple C++ application which connects to a Kudu instance,
              creates a table, writes data to it, then drops the table. 

java/java-example:

 A simple Java application which connects to a Kudu instance,
              creates a table, writes data to it, then drops the table. 

 java/insert-loadgen: 

 A small Java application which listens on a TCP socket for time
              series data corresponding to the Collectl wire protocol. The commonly-available
              collectl tool can be used to send example data to the server. 

 python/dstat-kudu:

 A Java application that generates random insert load. 

 python/graphite-kudu:

 An example program that shows how to use the Kudu Python API to
              load data into a new / existing Kudu table generated by an external program, dstat in this case. 

 python/graphite-kudu:

 An example plugin for using graphite-web with Kudu as a backend.
            



        These examples should serve as helpful starting points for your own Kudu applications
        and integrations.
