Spark integration known issues and limitations
Here are the limitations that you should consider while integrating Kudu and
  Spark.




            Spark 2.2 (and higher) requires Java 8 at runtime even though Kudu Spark 2.x
            integration is Java 7 compatible. Spark 2.2 is the default dependency version as of
            Kudu 1.5.0.
          



            Kudu tables with a name containing upper case or non-ASCII characters must be
            assigned an alternate name when registered as a temporary table.
          



            Kudu tables with a column name containing upper case or non-ASCII characters must
            not be used with SparkSQL. Columns can be renamed in Kudu to work around this issue.
          



<> and ORpredicates are not pushed to Kudu,
            and instead will be evaluated by the Spark task. Only LIKE
            predicates with a suffix wildcard are pushed to Kudu. This means LIKE
            "FOO%" will be pushed, but LIKE "FOO%BAR" won't.
          



            Kudu does not support all the types supported by Spark SQL. For example,
            Date and complex types are not supported.
          



            Kudu tables can only be registered as temporary tables in SparkSQL.
          



            Kudu tables cannot be queried using HiveContext.
