Use Spark with a secure Kudu cluster
The Kudu-Spark integration is able to operate on secure Kudu clusters which have
  authentication and encryption enabled, but the submitter of the Spark job must provide the proper
  credentials. For Spark jobs using the default 'client' deploy mode, the submitting user must have
  an active Kerberos ticket granted through kinit.
  For Spark jobs using the 'cluster' deploy mode, a Kerberos principal name and keytab location must
  be provided through the --principal and --keytab arguments to spark2-submit.
