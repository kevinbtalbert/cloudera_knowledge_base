Use CREATE TABLE AS SELECTCloudera Docs
Use CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
You can create a table by querying any other table or tables in Impala, using a
         CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT
      statement.The
         following example imports all rows from an existing table, old_table, into a new Kudu table, new_table. The columns in new_table will have the same names and types as
         the columns in old_table, but you will
         need to additionally specify the primary key and partitioning schema. 
CREATE TABLE new_table
PRIMARY KEY (ts, name)
PARTITION BY HASH(name) PARTITIONS 8
STORED AS KUDU
AS SELECT ts, name, value FROM old_table;

            You can refine the SELECT statement to only match the rows and
            columns you want to be inserted into the new table. You can also rename the columns
            by using syntax like SELECT name as new_col_name.
