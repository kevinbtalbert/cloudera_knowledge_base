Delete data from Kudu using Impala
You can delete Kudu rows in near real time using Impala. 
DELETE FROM my_first_table WHERE id < 3;         
      You can even use more complex joins when deleting rows. For example, Impala uses a comma in
      the FROM sub-clause to specify a join query.
      DELETE c FROM my_second_table c, stock_symbols s WHERE c.name = s.symbol;

important The DELETE statement
      only works in Impala when the underlying data source is Kudu. 
You can delete in bulk using the Inserting in bulk approaches outlined in the
        Inserting topic.
