Impala database containment model
Every Impala table is contained within a namespace called a database. The default
      database is called default, and you can
      create and drop additional databases as desired.
importantThe Impala database containment model is not supported if HMS
         integration is enabled.
 To create the database, use a CREATE
            DATABASE statement. To use the database for further Impala operations such as
            CREATE TABLE, use the USE statement.
For
         example, to create a table in a database called impala_kudu, use the following statements:
         CREATE DATABASE impala_kudu;
USE impala_kudu;
CREATE TABLE my_first_table (
...

 The
            my_first_table table is created within
         the impala_kudu database. 
 The
         prefix impala:: and the
         Impala database name are appended to the underlying Kudu table name: impala::<database>.<table>

 For
         example, to specify the my_first_table
         table in database impala_kudu, as opposed
         to any other table with the same name in another database, refer to the table as impala::impala_kudu.my_first_table. This also
         applies to INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and DROP statements.
