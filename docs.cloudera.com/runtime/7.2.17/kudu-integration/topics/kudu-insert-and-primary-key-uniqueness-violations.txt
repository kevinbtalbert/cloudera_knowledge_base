INSERT and primary key uniqueness violations
In many relational databases, if you try to insert a row that has already been
      inserted, the operation can fail because the primary key gets duplicated. Impala, however,
      does not fail the query. Instead, it generates a warning and continues to run the
      remainder of the insert statement. 
 If you
         want to replace existing rows from the table, use the UPSERT statement instead.
         INSERT INTO my_first_table VALUES (99, "sarah");
UPSERT INTO my_first_table VALUES (99, "zoe");
         The current value of the row is now zoe.
