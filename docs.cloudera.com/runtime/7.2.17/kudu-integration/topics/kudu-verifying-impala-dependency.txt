Verifying the Impala dependency on Kudu
In a Cloudera Manager deployment, once the Kudu service is installed, Impala will
    automatically identify the Kudu Master. However, if your Impala queries don't work as expected,
    use the following steps to make sure that the Impala service is set to be dependent on
    Kudu.
          Go to the Impala service.
        
Click the Configuration tab.

          Search for kudu.
        
          Make sure the Kudu Service property is set to the right Kudu
          service.
        
          Click Save Changes.
