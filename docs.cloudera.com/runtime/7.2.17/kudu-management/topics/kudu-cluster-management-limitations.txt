Cluster management limitations
When managing Kudu clusters, review the following limitations and recommended maximum
      point-to-point latency and bandwidth values.




              Recommended maximum point-to-point latency within a Kudu cluster is 20
              milliseconds.
            



              Recommended minimum point-to-point bandwidth within a Kudu cluster is 10 Gbps.
            



              If you intend to use the location awareness feature to place tablet servers in
              different locations, it is recommended that you measure the bandwidth and latency
              between servers to ensure they fit within the above guidelines.
            



              All masters must be started at the same time when the cluster is started for the
              very first time.
