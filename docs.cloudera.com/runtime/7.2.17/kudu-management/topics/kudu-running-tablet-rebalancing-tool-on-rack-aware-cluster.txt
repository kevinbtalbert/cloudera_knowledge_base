Run a tablet rebalancing tool on a rack-aware cluster
 It is possible to use the kudu cluster rebalance tool to establish
    the placement policy on a cluster. This might be necessary when the rack awareness feature is
    first configured or when re-replication violated the placement policy.
The rebalancing tool breaks its work into three
      phases:
            The rack-aware rebalancer tries to establish the placement policy. Use the
            ‑‑disable_policy_fixer flag to skip this phase.
          
            The rebalancer tries to balance load by location, moving tablet replicas between
            locations in an attempt to spread tablet replicas among locations evenly. The load
            of a location is measured as the total number of replicas in the location divided by
            the number of tablet servers in the location. Use the
            ‑‑disable_cross_location_rebalancing flag to skip this phase.
          
            The rebalancer tries to balance the tablet replica distribution within each
            location, as if the location were a cluster on its own. Use the
            ‑‑disable_intra_location_rebalancing flag to skip this phase.
          
          By using the ‑‑report_only flag, it’s also possible to check if
          all tablets in the cluster conform to the placement policy without attempting any
          replica movement.
