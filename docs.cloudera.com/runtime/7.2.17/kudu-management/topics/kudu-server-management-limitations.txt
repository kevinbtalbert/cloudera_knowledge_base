Server management limitations
Here are some of the server management guidelines that you should consider before
      implementing Kudu.




              Production deployments should configure a least 4 GiB of memory for tablet
              servers, and ideally more than 16 GiB when approaching the data and tablet scale
              limits.
            



              Write ahead logs (WALs) can only be stored on one disk.
            



              Data directories cannot be removed. You must reformat the data directories to
              remove them.
            



              Tablet servers cannot be gracefully decommissioned.
            



              Tablet servers cannot change their address or port.
            



              Kudu has a hard requirement on having an up-to-date NTP. Kudu masters and tablet
              servers will crash when out of sync.
            



              Kudu releases have only been tested with NTP. Other time synchronization providers
              such as Chrony may not work.
