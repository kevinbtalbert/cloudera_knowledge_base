Diagnostics logging
Kudu may be configured to periodically dump all of its metrics to a local log file
    using the --metrics_log_interval_msflag. Set
    this flag to the interval at which metrics should be written to a diagnostics log file.

          The diagnostics log will be written to the same directory as the other Kudu log files,
          with a similar naming format, substituting diagnostics instead of a
          log level like INFO. After any diagnostics log file reaches 64MB
          uncompressed, the log will be rolled and the previous file will be gzip-compressed.
        

          The log file generated has three space-separated fields. The first field is the word
          metrics. The second field is the current timestamp in microseconds
          since the Unix epoch. The third is the current value of all metrics on the server,
          using a compact JSON encoding. The encoding is the same as the metrics fetched via
          HTTP described above.
