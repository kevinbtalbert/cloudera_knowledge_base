Listing available metrics
The full set of available metrics for a Kudu server can be dumped using a special
    command line flag:$ kudu-tserver --dump_metrics_json
$ kudu-master --dump_metrics_json
          This will output a large JSON document. Each metric indicates its name, label,
          description, units, and type. Because the output is JSON-formatted, this information
          can easily be parsed and fed into other tooling which collects metrics from Kudu
          servers.
         For the complete list of metrics
        collected by Cloudera Manager for a Kudu service, look for the Kudu metrics listed under
          Cloudera Manager Metrics.
