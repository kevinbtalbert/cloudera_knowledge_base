Use the Charts Library with the Kudu service
By default, the Status tab for the Kudu service displays a
    dashboard containing a limited set of charts. 

 For details on the terminology used in these charts, and instructions on how to query for
        time-series data, display chart details, and edit charts, see Charting Time-Series
          Data.
 The Kudu service's Charts Library tab also displays a dashboard containing a much larger
        set of charts, organized by categories such as process charts, host charts, CPU charts, and
        so on, depending on the entity (service, role, or host) that you are viewing. You can use
        these charts to keep track of disk space usage, the rate at which data is being
        inserted/modified in Kudu across all tables, or any critical cluster events. You can also
        use them to keep track of individual tables. For example, to find out how much space a Kudu
        table is using on disk: 


 Go to the Kudu service and navigate to the Charts
            Library tab. 

 On the left-hand side menu, click Tables to
          display the list of tables currently stored in Kudu. 

 Click on a table name to view the default dashboard for that table. The Total Tablet Size On Disk
            Across Kudu Replicas chart displays the total size of the table on disk using a
          time-series chart.

 Hovering with your mouse over the line on the chart opens a small pop-up window that
            displays information about that data point. Click the data stream within the chart to
            display a larger pop-up window that includes additional information for the table at the
            point in time where the mouse was clicked.
