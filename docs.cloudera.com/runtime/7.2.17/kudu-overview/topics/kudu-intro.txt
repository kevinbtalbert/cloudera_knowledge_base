Kudu introduction
Apache Kudu is a columnar storage manager developed for the Hadoop platform. Kudu
    shares the common technical properties of Hadoop ecosystem applications: Kudu runs on commodity
    hardware, is horizontally scalable, and supports highly-available operation.

      Apache Kudu is a top-level project in the Apache Software Foundation.
    

      Kudu's benefits include:
    

 Fast processing of OLAP workloads
 Integration with MapReduce, Spark, Flume, and other Hadoop ecosystem
        components
 Tight integration with Apache Impala, making it a good, mutable
        alternative to using HDFS with Apache Parquet 
 Strong but flexible consistency model, allowing you to choose
        consistency requirements on a per-request basis, including the option for strict serialized
        consistenc
 Strong performance for running sequential and random workloads
        simultaneously
 Easy administration and management through Cloudera Manager
 High availability Tablet Servers and Master use the Raft consensus
          algorithm, which ensures availability as long as more replicas are available than
          unavailable. Reads can be serviced by read-only follower tablets, even in the event of a
          leader tablet failure.
 Structured data model


      By combining all of these properties, Kudu targets support applications that are difficult
      or impossible to implement on currently available Hadoop storage technologies.
      Applications for which Kudu is a viable solution include:
      

          Reporting applications where new data must be immediately available for end users
        

          Time-series applications that must support queries across large amounts of historic
          data while simultaneously returning granular queries about an individual entity
        
 Applications that use predictive models to make real-time
          decisions, with periodic refreshes of the predictive model based on historical data
