Adding and Removing Range Partitions
Kudu allows range partitions to be dynamically added and removed from a table at
  runtime, without affecting the availability of other partitions. Removing a partition will delete
  the tablets belonging to the partition, as well as the data contained in them. Subsequent inserts
  into the dropped partition will fail. New partitions can be added, but they must not overlap with
  any existing range partitions. Kudu allows dropping and adding any number of range partitions in a
  single transactional alter table operation.
 Dynamically adding and dropping range partitions is particularly useful for
   time series use cases. As time goes on, range partitions can be added to cover upcoming time
   ranges. For example, a table storing an event log could add a month-wide partition just before
   the start of each month in order to hold the upcoming events. Old range partitions can be dropped
   in order to efficiently remove historical data, as necessary.
