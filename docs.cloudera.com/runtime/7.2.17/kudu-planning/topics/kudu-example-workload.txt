Example workload
The sections below help you perform sample calculations using the following
    parameters:



            200 hot replicas per tablet server
          



            1600 cold replicas per tablet server
          



            8TB of data on disk per tablet server (about 4.5GB/replica)
          



            512MB block cache
          



            40 cores per server
          



            limit of 32000 file descriptors per server
          



            a read workload with 1 frequently-scanned table with 40 columns
          



        This workload resembles a time series use case, where the hot replicas correspond to the
        most recent range partition on time.
