Hash partitioning
Hash partitioning distributes rows by hash value into one of many buckets. In
    single-level hash partitioned tables, each bucket will correspond to exactly one tablet. The
    number of buckets is set during table creation. Typically the primary key columns are used as
    the columns to hash, but as with range partitioning, any subset of the primary key columns can
    be used.

          Hash partitioning is an effective strategy when ordered access to the table is not
          needed. Hash partitioning is effective for spreading writes randomly among tablets,
          which helps mitigate hot-spotting and uneven tablet sizes.
