Known issues and limitations
There are several gaps and corner cases that currently prevent Kudu from being
      strictly-serializable in certain situations. 
WritesSupport for COMMIT_WAIT is       experimental and requires careful tuning of the time-synchronization protocol, such as NTP       (Network Time Protocol). Its use in production environments is discouraged.Reads (scans)On a leader change, READ_AT_SNAPSHOT     scans at a snapshot whose timestamp is beyond the last write, may yield non-repeatable reads     (see KUDU-1188).Parent topic: Kudu transaction semantics
