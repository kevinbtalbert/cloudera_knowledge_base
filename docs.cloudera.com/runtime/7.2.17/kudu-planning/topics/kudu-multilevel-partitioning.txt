Multilevel partitioning
Kudu allows a table to combine multiple levels of partitioning on a single table. Zero
    or more hash partition levels can be combined with an optional range partition level. The only
    additional constraint on multilevel partitioning beyond the constraints of the individual
    partition types, is that multiple levels of hash partitions must not hash the same
    columns.

          When used correctly, multilevel partitioning can retain the benefits of the individual
          partitioning types, while reducing the downsides of each. The total number of tablets
          in a multilevel partitioned table is the product of the number of partitions in each
          level.
