Partition pruning
Kudu scans will automatically skip scanning entire partitions when it can be
      determined that the partition can be entirely filtered by the scan predicates. To prune hash
      partitions, the scan must include equality predicates on every hashed column. To prune range
      partitions, the scan must include equality or range predicates on the range partitioned
      columns. Scans on multilevel partitioned tables can take advantage of partition pruning on any
      of the levels independently.
