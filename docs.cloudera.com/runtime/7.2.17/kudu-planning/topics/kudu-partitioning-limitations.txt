Partitioning limitations
Here are some of the limitations that you must consider before partitionoing
      tables.



            Tables must be manually pre-split into tablets using simple or compound primary
            keys. Automatic splitting is not yet possible. Kudu does not allow you to change how
            a table is partitioned after creation, with the exception of adding or dropping
            range partitions.
          



            Data in existing tables cannot currently be automatically repartitioned. As a
            workaround, create a new table with the new partitioning and insert the contents of
            the old table.
          



            Tablets that lose a majority of replicas (such as 1 left out of 3) require manual
            intervention to be repaired.
