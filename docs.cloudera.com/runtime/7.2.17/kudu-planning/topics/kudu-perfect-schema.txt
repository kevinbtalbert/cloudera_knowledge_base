The perfect schema
The perfect schema would accomplish the following: 



            Data would be distributed such that reads and writes are spread evenly across tablet
            servers. This can be achieved by effective partitioning.
          



            Tablets would grow at an even, predictable rate, and load across tablets would
            remain steady over time. This can be achieved by effective partitioning.
          



            Scans would read the minimum amount of data necessary to fulfill a query. This is
            impacted mostly by primary key design, but partitioning also plays a role via
            partition pruning.
          



        The perfect schema depends on the characteristics of your data, what you need to do with
        it, and the topology of your cluster. Schema design is the single most important thing
        within your control to maximize the performance of your Kudu cluster.
