Primary key index
As with many traditional relational databases, Kuduâ€™s primary key is in a clustered
    index. All rows within a tablet are sorted by its primary key. 
When
      scanning Kudu rows, use equality or range predicates on primary key columns to efficiently
      find the rows. 
note Primary key indexing optimizations apply to scans on individual
         tablets. See the Partitioning pruning topic for details on how scans can use
         predicates to skip entire tablets.
