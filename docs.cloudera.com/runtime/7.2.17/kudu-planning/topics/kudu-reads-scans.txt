Reads (scans)
On a leader change, READ_AT_SNAPSHOT
    scans at a snapshot whose timestamp is beyond the last write, may yield non-repeatable reads
    (see KUDU-1188).
Recommendation
If repeatable snapshot reads are a requirement, use READ_AT_SNAPSHOT with a timestamp that is slightly in the past (between 2-5
      seconds, ideally). This will circumvent the anomaly described above. Even when the anomaly has
      been addressed, back-dating the timestamp will always make scans faster, since they are
      unlikely to block. 
Impala scans are currently performed as READ_LATEST and have no consistency guarantees. 
In AUTO_BACKGROUND_FLUSH
      mode, or when using "async" flushing mechanisms, writes applied to a single client session may
      get reordered due to the concurrency of flushing the data to the server. This is particularly
      noticeable if a single row is quickly updated with different values in succession. This
      phenomenon affects all client API implementations. Workarounds are described in the respective
      API documentation for FlushMode or AsyncKuduSession. See KUDU-1767.
