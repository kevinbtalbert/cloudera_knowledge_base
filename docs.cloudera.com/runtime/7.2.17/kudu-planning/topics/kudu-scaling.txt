Scaling Kudu
This section describes in detail how Kudu scales with respect to various system
      resources, including memory, file descriptors, and threads. See Scaling recommendations
         and limitations  for the maximum recommended parameters of a Kudu cluster. They can
      be used to estimate roughly the number of servers required for a given quantity of
      data.
noteThe recommendations and conclusions here are only approximations.
         Appropriate numbers depend on use case. There is no substitute for measurement and
         monitoring of resources used during a representative workload.

Related informationScaling recommendations and limitationsTermsHere are some of the terms used in this topic.Example workloadThe sections below help you perform sample calculations using the following     parameters:MemoryThe flag --memory_limit_hard_bytes     determines the maximum amount of memory that a Kudu tablet server may use. The amount of memory     used by a tablet server scales with data size, write workload, and read concurrency.File descriptorsProcesses are allotted a maximum number of open file descriptors (also referred to as     fds). If a tablet server attempts to open too many fds, it will typically crash with a message     saying something like "too many open files".ThreadsProcesses are allotted a maximum number of threads by the operating system, and this     limit is typically difficult or impossible to change. Therefore, this section is more     informational than advisory.Scaling recommendations and limitationsHere are some of the recommended vales that you should consider while deciding the     size of the tablet servers, masters, and other storage resources to get optimum     performance.
