Threads
Processes are allotted a maximum number of threads by the operating system, and this
    limit is typically difficult or impossible to change. Therefore, this section is more
    informational than advisory.

        If a Kudu tablet serverâ€™s thread count exceeds the OS limit, it will crash, usually
        with a message in the logs like "pthread_create failed: Resource temporarily
        unavailable". If the system thread count limit is exceeded, other processes on the same
        node may also crash.
      

        Threads and thread pools are used all over Kudu for various purposes, but the number of
        threads found in nearly all of these does not scale with load or data/tablet size;
        instead, the number of threads is either a hard coded constant, a constant defined by a
        configuration parameter, or based on a static dimension (such as the number of CPU
        cores).
      
 The only exception to this is the WAL append thread, one of which
        exists for every "hot" replica. 
Note that all replicas may be considered hot at startup, so tablet
        servers' thread usage will generally peak when started and settle down
        thereafter.
