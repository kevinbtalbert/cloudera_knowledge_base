Backup tools
An additional kudu-backup-tools JAR is available to provide some backup
    exploration and garbage collection capabilities. This jar does not use Spark directly, but
    instead only requires the Hadoop classpath to run.
Commands:
list: Lists the backups in the rootPath
clean: Cleans up old backed up data in the rootPath
noteYou can see the full list of the job options by passing the --help
    flag.
Following is an example execution which prints the command options:
      java -cp $(hadoop classpath):kudu-backup-tools-1.12.0.jar org.apache.kudu.backup.KuduBackupCLI --help
