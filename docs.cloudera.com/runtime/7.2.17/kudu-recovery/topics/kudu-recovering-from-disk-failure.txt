Recover from disk failure
Kudu nodes can only survive failures of disks on which certain Kudu directories are
    mounted. For more information about the different Kudu directory types, see the Directory
      configuration topic.

 The following table summarizes the resilience to disk failure in different releases of
        Apache Kudu. Table 1. Kudu disk failure behavior

 Pre-1.6.0 



 When a disk failure occurs that does not lead to a crash, Kudu will stop using the
        affected directory, shut down tablets with blocks on the affected directories, and
        automatically re-replicate the affected tablets to other tablet servers. The affected server
        will remain alive and print messages to the log indicating the disk failure, for example: 
E1205 19:06:24.163748 27115 data_dirs.cc:1011] Directory /data/8/kudu/data marked as failed
E1205 19:06:30.324795 27064 log_block_manager.cc:1822] Not using report from /data/8/kudu/data: IO error: Could not open container 0a6283cab82d4e75848f49772d2638fe: /data/8/kudu/data/0a6283cab82d4e75848f49772d2638fe.metadata: Read-only file system (error 30)

 While in this state, the affected node will avoid using the failed disk, leading to lower
        storage volume and reduced read parallelism. The administrator can remove the failed
        directory from the --fs_data_dirs gflag to avoid seeing these errors.
 When the disk is repaired, remounted, and ready to be reused by Kudu, take the following
        steps: 

Make sure that the Kudu portion of the disk is completely empty.

Stop the tablet server.

Update the --fs_data_dirs gflag to add /data/3,
          on the server with the disk failure. For example, 

$ sudo -u kudu kudu fs update_dirs --force --fs_wal_dir=/wals --fs_data_dirs=/data/1,/data/2,/data/3


Start the tablet server.

Run ksck to verify cluster health, on any kudu server in the cluster. For
          example:

$ sudo -u kudu kudu cluster ksck master-01.example.com

note Note that existing tablets
        will not stripe to the restored disk, but any new tablets will stripe to the restored disk.
          potentially using the update_dirs tool if on a version of Kudu that is below
        1.12
