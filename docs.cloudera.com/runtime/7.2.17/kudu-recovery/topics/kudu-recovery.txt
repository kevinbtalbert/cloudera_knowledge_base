Kudu recovery
Kudu supports restoring tables from full and incremental backups through a restore job
  implemented using Apache Spark.
Kudu backup and restore jobs use Apache Spark. Therefore, ensure that you install Apache Spark
   in your environment. To download Apache Spark, see the Apache Spark documentation.

For each backed up table, the KuduRestore job restores the full backup   and each associated incremental backup until the full table state is restored.Recover from disk failureKudu nodes can only survive failures of disks on which certain Kudu directories are     mounted. For more information about the different Kudu directory types, see the Directory       configuration topic.Recover from full disksBy default, Kudu reserves a small amount of space, 1% by capacity, in its directories.     Kudu considers a disk full if there is less free space available than the reservation. Kudu     nodes can only tolerate running out of space on disks on which certain Kudu directories are     mounted.Bring a tablet that has lost a majority of replicas back onlineIf a tablet has permanently lost a majority of its replicas, it cannot recover     automatically and operator intervention is required. If the tablet servers hosting a majority of     the replicas are down (i.e. ones reported as "TS unavailable" by ksck), they should be recovered instead if     possible.Rebuild a Kudu filesystem layoutIn the event that critical files are lost, i.e. WALs or tablet-specific metadata, all     Kudu directories on the server must be deleted and rebuilt to ensure correctness. Doing so will     destroy the copy of the data for each tablet replica hosted on the local server. Kudu will     automatically re-replicate tablet replicas removed in this way, provided the replication factor     is at least three and all other servers are online and healthy.
