Configuring a secure Kudu cluster using Cloudera Manager
You can configure a secure Kudu cluster using Cloudera Manager. For that you need enabled Kerberos authentication and RPC encryption, configure coarse-grained authorization, and configure HTTPS encryption. Optionally you can configure custom Kerberos principal, TLS/SSL encryption or fine-grained authorization using Ranger.
Enabling Kerberos authentication and RPC encryptionYou must already have a secure Cloudera Manager cluster with Kerberos authentication         enabled.Configuring custom Kerberos principal for KuduYou can configure a custom Kerberos principal for Kudu using Cloudera         Manager.Configuring coarse-grained authorization with ACLsThe coarse-grained authorization can be configured with the following two ACLs: the             Superuser Access Control List and the User Access Control List. The             Superuser ACL is the list of all the superusers that can access the cluster.         User-level access can be controlled by using the User ACL. By default, all the users         can access the clusters. But when you enable authentication using Kerberos, only the users         who are able to authenticate successfully can access the cluster.Configuring TLS/SSL encryption for Kudu using Cloudera ManagerTLS/SSL encryption is enabled between Kudu servers and clients by default. You can         enable TLS/SSL encryption for Kudu web UIs or configure the encryption using Cloudera         Manager.Enabling Ranger authorizationYou can configure fine-grained authorization using Apache Ranger. This topic provides         the steps to enable Kudu's integration with Ranger from Cloudera Manager.Configuring HTTPS encryptionLastly, you enable TLS/SSL encryption (over HTTPS) for browser-based connections to         both the Kudu master and tablet server web UIs.Configuring data at rest encryptionYou can enable data at rest encryption using Cloudera Manager. However, you can         enable it only for a fresh installation and once Kudu directories exist on the cluster you         cannot disable the encryption.
