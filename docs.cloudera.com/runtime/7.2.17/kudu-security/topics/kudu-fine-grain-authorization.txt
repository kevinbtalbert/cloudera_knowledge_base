Kudu fine-grained authorization
Kudu can be configured to enforce fine-grained authorization across servers. 
Fine-grained authorization ensures that users can see only the data they are
   explicitly authorized to see. Kudu supports this by leveraging policies defined in Apache Ranger.
    noteFine-grained authorization policies are not enforced when accessing
    the web UI. User data may appear on various pages of the web UI (for example, in logs, metrics,
    scans). As such, it is recommended to either limit access to the web UI ports, or redact or
    disable the web UI entirely, as desired.
