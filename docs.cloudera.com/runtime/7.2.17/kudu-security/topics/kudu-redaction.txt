Disabling redactionCloudera Docs
Disabling redaction
Data redaction is used to prevent sensitive data from being included in Kudu server
      logs or in the web UI. Data redaction is enabled by default but you can disable it using the
         –redact or the –webserver_enabled flag. 
Log redaction
To prevent sensitive data from being included in Kudu server logs, all row data is
            redacted. You can turn off log redaction using the --redact flag.

Web UI redaction
To prevent sensitive data from being included in the web UI, all row data is redacted.
            Table metadata, such as table names, column names, and partitioning information is not
            redacted. Alternatively, you can choose to completely disable the web UI by setting the
               --webserver_enabled flag to false on the Kudu servers.
note Disabling the web UI will also disable REST endpoints such as
               /metrics. Monitoring systems rely on
            these endpoints to gather metrics data. 


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Kudu >  Configuration.

Find the Kudu Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                  gflagfile property.

If you want to disable log redaction, add the following configuration:

--redact=false


If you want to Web UI disable redaction, add the following configuration:

--webserver_enabled=false


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Kudu service.
