Kudu security limitations
Here are some limitations related to data encryption and authorization in
    Kudu.

Kudu uses an internal PKI system to issue X.509 certificates to servers in the
        cluster. As a result, you cannot run Kudu with public IPs.

Server certificates generated by Kudu IPKI are incompatible with bouncycastle
          version 1.52 and earlier.

When you are creating a new Kudu service using the Ranger web UI, the Test
          Connection button is displayed. However, the TestConnection tab is not
        implemented in the Kudu Ranger plugin. As a result, if you try to use it with Kudu, it
        fails. But that does not mean that the service is not working.
