Specifying trusted users
You can specify which users can view and modify data stored in Kudu. Additionally, some services that interact with Kudu may authorize requests on behalf of their end users.
 

It may be desirable to allow certain users to view and modify any data stored in
    Kudu. Such users can be specified via the --trusted_user_acl master configuration. Trusted users
    can perform any operation that would otherwise require fine-grained privileges, without Kudu
    consulting the authorization service.
Furthermore, some services that interact with Kudu can authorize requests on behalf
    of their end users. For example, Apache Impala authorizes queries on behalf of its users, and
    sends requests to Kudu as the Impala service user, commonly "impala". Since Impala authorizes
    requests on its own, to avoid extraneous communication between the authorization service and
    Kudu, the Impala service user should be listed as a trusted user.noteWhen accessing Kudu through Impala, Impala enforces its own fine-grained authorization policy.
     This policy is similar to Kudu's and can be found in the Impala authorization documentation.


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Kudu >  Configuration.

Find the Master Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safetz Valve) for
      gflagfile propertz.

Click View as XML and add the following configuration:

--trusted_user_acl=impala,hive,kudu,rangeradmin,[***TRUSTED USER***] 


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Kudu service.
