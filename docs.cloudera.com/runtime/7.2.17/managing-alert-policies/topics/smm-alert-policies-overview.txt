Introduction to alert policies in Streams Messaging Manager
You can configure an alert policy in Streams Messaging Manager (SMM). When an alert
  policy triggeres, SMM creates an alert. You can modify alert policy names, descriptions, and can
  enable or disable alert policies. You can also delete alert policies.
An alert policy sends notifications through a notifier based on the conditions that you
   configure in the alert policy.
An alert consists of details of the policy including the alert message and the conditions that
   fire the alert. You can use these alerts to monitor the health of different Kafka entity types,
   latency, and Kafka cluster replications in your system, and to identify and troubleshoot
   problems. 
When you navigate to the Alerts window, the Alerts
        Overview page appears as shown in the following image:


You can check the list of alerts that occurred in the system till date on the
    HISTORY page. You can check the title, timestamp details, component name,
   type, state, and payload information of an alert. You can click show more
   to check complete payload details for an alert. Click ACTIONS > Mark All As Read to mark all the alerts as read. You can also click the
    Dismiss icon for each alert to mark the alert as read.
