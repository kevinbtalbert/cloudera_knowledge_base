Deletion
When you request for HBase to delete data, either explicitly using a Delete method or
  implicitly using a threshold such as the maximum number of versions or the TTL, HBase does not
  delete the data immediately
Instead, it writes a deletion marker, called a tombstone, to the HFile, which is the physical
   file where a given RegionServer stores its region of a column family. The tombstone markers are
   processed during major compaction operations, when HFiles are rewritten without the deleted data
   included.
Even after major compactions, "deleted" data may not actually be deleted. You can specify the
    KEEP_DELETED_CELLS option for a given column family, and the
   tombstones will be preserved in the HFile even after major compaction. One scenario where this
   approach might be useful is for data retention policies.
Another reason deleted data may not actually be deleted is if the data would be required to
   restore a table from a snapshot which has not been deleted. In this case, the data is moved to an
   archive during a major compaction, and only deleted when the snapshot is deleted. This is a good
   reason to monitor the number of snapshots saved in HBase.
