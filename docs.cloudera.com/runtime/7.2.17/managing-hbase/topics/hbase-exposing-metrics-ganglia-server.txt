Expose HBase metrics to a Ganglia server
You can expose HBase metrics to Ganglia instance so that Ganglia, an open-source
        monitoring framework, can detect potential problems with your HBase cluster.

In Cloudera Manager, select the HBase service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select the HBase Master or RegionServer role.
Configure each role to monitor both:
Search for metrics2.

Find the Hadoop Metrics2 Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                        Valve) property.

Add the following snippet to the property, substituting the server information
                    with your own:

hbase.sink.ganglia.class=org.apache.hadoop.metrics2.sink.ganglia.GangliaSink31
hbase.sink.ganglia.servers=<Ganglia server>:<port>
hbase.sink.ganglia.period=10


To apply this configuration property to other role groups as needed, edit the value for the appropriate role group.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the role.

Restart the HBase service.
