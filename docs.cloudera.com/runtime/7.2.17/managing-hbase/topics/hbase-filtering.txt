HBase filtering
When reading data from HBase using Get or Scan
  operations, you can use custom filters to return a subset of results to the client.
While this does not reduce server-side IO, it does reduce network bandwidth and reduces the
   amount of data the client needs to process. Filters are generally used using the Java API, but
   can be used from HBase Shell for testing and debugging purposes.
HBase filters take zero or more arguments, in parentheses. Where the argument is a string, it
   is surrounded by single quotes ('string').
