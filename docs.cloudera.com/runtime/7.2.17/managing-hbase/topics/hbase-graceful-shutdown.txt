Graceful HBase shutdown
Graceful Shutdown causes the regions to be redistributed to other RegionServers,
        increasing availability during the RegionServer outage.

A graceful shutdown of an HBase RegionServer allows the regions hosted by that
                RegionServer to be moved to other RegionServers before stopping the RegionServer.
                You can perform a graceful shutdown of either an HBase RegionServer or the entire
                service. 
Cloudera Manager waits for an interval determined by the Graceful Shutdown timeout
                interval, which defaults to three minutes. If the graceful stop does not succeed
                within this interval, the RegionServer is stopped with a
                    SIGKILL (kill -9)
                signal. Recovery will be initiated on affected regions.
To increase the speed of a rolling restart of the HBase service, set the
                    Region Mover Threads property to a higher value. This
                increases the number of regions that can be moved in parallel, but places additional
                strain on the HMaster. In most cases, Region Mover Threads
                should be set to 5 or lower.
