Gracefully shut down an HBase RegionServer
You can gracefully shut down an HBase RegionServer using Cloudera
        Manager.

In Cloudera Manager, select the HBase service.

Click the Instance tab.

From the list of Role Instances, select the RegionServer or RegionServers you
                    want to shut down gracefully.

Click Actions for Selected.

Select Decommission (Graceful Stop).
If you cancel the graceful shutdown before the Graceful Shutdown
                        Timeout expires, you can still manually stop a RegionServer by
                    selecting Actions for Selected >  Stop, which sends a SIGTERM (kill -15) signal.
