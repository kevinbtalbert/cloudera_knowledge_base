HBase online merge
Cloudera Runtime supports online merging of regions.
HBase splits big regions automatically but does not support merging small regions
   automatically. To complete an online merge of two regions of a table, use the HBase shell to
   issue the online merge command. By default, both regions to be merged should be neighbors; that
   is, one end key of a region should be the start key of the other region. Although you can "force
   merge" any two regions of the same table, this can create overlaps and is not recommended.
The Master and RegionServer both participate in online merges. When the request to merge is
   sent to the Master, the Master moves the regions to be merged to the same RegionServer,
   usually the one where the region with the higher load resides. The Master then requests the
   RegionServer to merge the two regions. The RegionServer processes this request locally. Once
   the two regions are merged, the new region will be online and available for server requests,
   and the old regions are taken offline.
For merging two consecutive regions use the following command:
hbase> merge_region 'ENCODED_REGIONNAME', 'ENCODED_REGIONNAME'
For merging regions that are not adjacent, passing true as the third
   parameter forces the merge.
hbase> merge_region 'ENCODED_REGIONNAME', 'ENCODED_REGIONNAME', true
note

This command is slightly different from other region operations. You must pass the encoded
     region name (ENCODED_REGIONNAME), not the full region name . The encoded
     region name is the hash suffix on region names. For example, if the region name is
      TestTable,0094429456,1289497600452.527db22f95c8a9e0116f0cc13c680396, the
     encoded region name portion is 527db22f95c8a9e0116f0cc13c680396.
Cloudera recommends that you do not perform region merge operations on the Phoenix slated
     tables. This might affect the region boundaries and produce incorrect query results.
