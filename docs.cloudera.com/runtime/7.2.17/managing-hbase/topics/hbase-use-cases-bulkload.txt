Use cases for BulkLoad
There are three typical use cases when using BulkLoad can be advantageous.


Loading your original dataset into HBase for the first time - Your initial
     dataset might be quite large, and bypassing the HBase write path can speed up the
     process considerably.
Incremental Load - To load new data periodically, use BulkLoad to import it
     in batches at your preferred intervals. This alleviates latency problems and helps you
     to achieve service-level agreements (SLAs). However, one trigger for compaction is the
     number of HFiles on a RegionServer. Therefore, importing a large number of HFiles at
     frequent intervals can cause major compactions to happen more often than they
     otherwise would, negatively impacting performance. You can mitigate this by tuning the
     compaction settings such that the maximum number of HFiles that can be present without
     triggering a compaction is very high, and relying on other factors, such as the size
     of the Memstore, to trigger compactions.
Data needs to originate elsewhere - If an existing system is capturing the
     data you want to have in HBase and needs to remain active for business reasons, you
     can periodically BulkLoad data from the system into HBase so that you can perform
     operations on it without impacting the system.
