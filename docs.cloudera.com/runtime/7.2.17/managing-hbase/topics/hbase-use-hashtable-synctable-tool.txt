Use HashTable and SyncTable Tool
HashTable/SyncTable is a two steps tool for synchronizing table data without copying all cells in a specified row key/time period range.
The HashTable/SyncTable tool can be used for partial or entire table data synchronization,
   under the same or remote cluster. Both the HashTable and the SyncTable step are implemented as a
   MapReduce job.
The first step, HashTable, creates hashed indexes for batch of cells on the source table and
   output those as results. The source table is the table whose state is copied to its
   counterpart.
The second step, SyncTable, scans the target table and calculates hash indexes for table cells.
   Then these hashes are compared to the HashTable step outputs. So, SyncTable scans and compares
   cells for diverging hashes and updating only the mismatching cells.
This results in less network traffic or data transfers than other methods, for example
   CopyTable, which can impact performance when large tables are synchronized on remote
   clusters.
Remote clusters are often deployed on different Kerberos Realms. SyncTable support cross realm
   authentication, allowing a SyncTable process running on the target cluster to connect to the
   source cluster and read both the HashTable output files and the given HBase table when performing
   the required comparisons.
