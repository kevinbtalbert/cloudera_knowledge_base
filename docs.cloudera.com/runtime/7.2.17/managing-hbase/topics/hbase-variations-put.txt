Variations on Put
There are several different ways to write data into HBase.


A Put operation writes data into HBase.
A Delete operation deletes data from HBase. What actually happens during a
     Delete depends upon several factors.
A CheckAndPut operation performs a Scan before attempting the
      Put, and only does the Put if a value matches what is
     expected, and provides row-level atomicity.
A CheckAndDelete operation performs a Scan before attempting the
      Delete, and only does the Delete if a value matches what is
     expected.
An Increment operation increments values of one or more columns within a
     single row, and provides row-level atomicity.


Refer to the API documentation for a full list of methods provided for
   writing data to HBase.Different methods require different access levels
   and have other differences.
