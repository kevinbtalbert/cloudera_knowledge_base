Configuring compaction using table properties
You see how to configure compaction using table properties and learn about the advantage
  of using this method of configuration. 
You can configure compaction using table properties. Using table properties, you can
   group all table and partition compactions into a specific queue to match your use case. You can
   also size the compactor job based on the tables parameters like size and compression.
  

Set table properties to adjust the compaction initiator properties. 
ALTER TABLE mydb.mytable 
SET TBLPROPERTIES (
'compactorthreshold.hive.compactor.delta.pct.threshold'='0.2f',
'compactorthreshold.hive.compactor.delta.num.threshold'='20');   
These properties change thresholds, as the names imply: the deltas/base size percentage
     override threshold and the number of deltas threshold.
