Configuring partitions for transactionsCloudera Docs
Configuring partitions for
    transactions
You set a couple of parameters, to prevent or permit dynamic partitioning, that
    inserts, updates, or deletes data into partitions implicitly created on the table. 
 Configuring partitioning involves changing the following parameters to meet your needs:
hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions
hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions.pernode

You set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode to strict to prevent dynamic
        partitioning or to  nonstrict (the default) to include INSERT, UPDATE, and
        DELETE statements in your transaction applications. 

In Cloudera Manager > Clusters select the Hive service. Click Configuration, and
          search for hive-site.xml.

In HiveServer2 Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hive-site.xml, click + and add the hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode property. 

Set the value to nonstrict.

Save the changes and restart the Hive service.
