Disabling automatic compaction
You can disable automatic compaction of a particular Hive ACID table by setting a Hive
      table property. By default, compaction is enabled, so you must enter an ALTER TABLE command to
      disable it.
 Compaction of a full ACID table is skipped under the following conditions: 
Another compaction is either running or already initiated for the target. 
The compaction target table is already dropped. 
Table is explicitly configured to be skipped by the auto-compaction 
 Compaction of an insert-only, ACID table is skipped if
         hive.compactor.compact.insert.only is set to false (turned off). The default is true.
         Although you can disable automatic compaction, tables still can be compacted if you
         explicitly request compaction.Disabling automatic compaction does not prevent you from
         performing manual compaction. The compaction auto-initiator can be disabled on service
            instance level (disabled by default). You can independently enable or disable compaction
            workers on service instance level. Compaction merges only the bucket files with the same
            index and keeps the same number of bucket files in base. Compaction does not rebalance
            the rows between the buckets.

At the Hive JDBC client prompt, in the database of the target table, alter the
               TBLPROPERTIES.

ALTER TABLE my_t SET TBLPROPERTIES ('NO_AUTO_COMPACTION'='true');
