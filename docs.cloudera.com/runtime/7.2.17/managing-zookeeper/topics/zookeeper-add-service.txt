Add a ZooKeeper service
If the Add Service wizard does not finish successfully, you can add the ZooKeeper
        service manually.

In a production environment, you should deploy ZooKeeper as an ensemble with an odd
                number of servers. As long as a majority of the servers in the ensemble are
                available, the ZooKeeper service will be available. The minimum recommended ensemble
                size is three ZooKeeper servers, and Cloudera recommends that each server run on a
                separate machine. In addition, the ZooKeeper server process should have its own
                dedicated disk storage if possible.
When adding the ZooKeeper service, the Add Service wizard automatically
                initializes the data directories.
When you add Zookeeper servers to an existing ensemble, a rolling restart of all
                zookeeper is required in order to allow all zookeeper servers to have the same
                configurations. 
If you quit the Add Service wizard or it does not finish successfully, you can
                initialize the directories outside the wizard by following these steps:


In Cloudera Manager, select the ZooKeeper service.

Click Action.

Select Initialize.

Click Initialize again to confirm.
If the data directories are not initialized, the ZooKeeper servers cannot be
                    started.
