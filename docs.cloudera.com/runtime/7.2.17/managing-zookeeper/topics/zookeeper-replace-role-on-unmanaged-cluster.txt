Add a new ZooKeeper role on the new server.

Identify the dataDir locatiom from the
                        zoo.cfg file.
This default to /var/lib/zookeeper.

Identify the ID number for the ZooKeeper Server from the myid

                        cat/var/lib/zookeeper/myid.

                    server ID references the new server hostname.

Restart the ZooKeeper hosts.

Confirm the ZooKeeper Quorum elected a leader and the other hosts are
