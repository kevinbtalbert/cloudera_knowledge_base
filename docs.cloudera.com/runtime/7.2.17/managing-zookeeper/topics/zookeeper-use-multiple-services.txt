Use multiple ZooKeeper services
Only services that are not dependent can use different ZooKeeper services.
Cloudera Manager requires dependent services within Cloudera Runtime to use the same ZooKeeper
   service. If you configure dependent Cloudera Runtime services to use different ZooKeeper
   services, Cloudera Manager reports the following
   error:com.cloudera.cmf.command.CmdExecException:java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Assumption violated:
getAllDependencies returned multiple distinct services of the same type
at SeqFlowCmd.java line 120
in com.cloudera.cmf.command.flow.SeqFlowCmd run()
Because of a known limitation in Cloudera Manager, Cloudera Runtime services that are
      depending on each other can not use different ZooKeeper services. For example, Kafka does not
      depend on any services other than ZooKeeper, so Kafka can use one ZooKeeper cluster and the
      rest of the Cloudera Runtime services can use another one. At the same time, since Ranger also
      depends on ZooKeeper, if Kafka gets configured to use Ranger, then both Kafka and Ranger must
      use the same ZooKeeper cluster.
