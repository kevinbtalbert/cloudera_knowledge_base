Configuring SMM for monitoring Kafka cluster replications
To use Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) to monitor Kafka cluster replications, you
        must configure SMM to communicate with Streams Replication Manager (SRM).
For information on how to install and configure SRM, see
                Creating your first Streams Messaging cluster.
In order for SMM to be able to monitor SRM replications
            correctly, you must configure the SRM driver to target all clusters that are taking part
            in the replication. For more information, see Configuring the driver role target
                clusters.

In Cloudera Manager, select Streams Messaging Manager
                    from the available Clusters.

Click Configuration.

Enable the STREAMS_REPLICATION_MANAGER Service
                    property.

Click Save Changes (CTRL+S).

Restart SMM.

You can see the Cluster Replications option in the SMM UI as
            shown in the following image:
