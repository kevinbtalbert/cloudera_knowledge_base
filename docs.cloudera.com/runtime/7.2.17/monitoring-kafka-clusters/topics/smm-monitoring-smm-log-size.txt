Monitoring log size information
The SMM UI shows log size related information about brokers, topics, and partitions.
    Furthermore, warning messages appear when log directory related errors happen.
The feature uses a cache mechanism. The following cache attributes are set by default. You can
      modify these attributes in the SMM configuration page of the Cloudera Manager UI:
Kafka Logdir Cache Expiration msSets cache expiration time.
Kafka Logdir Cache Maximum SizeSets maximum cache size.
Kafka Logdir Call Timeout msSets timeout of the Kafka query.

The following image shows the properties in Cloudera Manager:


Log size details for topics


On the Overview page of the SMM UI, the
              Topics tab contains a sortable column called Current
              Log Size which shows the data with the  measure unit. This log size is
            calculated by the leader partitions; so, the follower partitions are not included. The
            column contains a tooltip which is a question-mark symbol. The topic related log-size
            improvements or information are also available on the Topics
              page.


The Topics tab on the Overview page represents
            topics and you can select one of them. In this case the topic’s leader partitions are
            viewable and here you can find the leader partition log-size. If you click a partition,
            a pop-up window appears, where log-size information is displayed.


If you click Profile for a topic, log-size of replica-leaders
            appears, hosted by the broker.





Log size details for brokers
On the Overview page, the Brokers tab contains
        two sortable columns called Log Size and Remaining
          Storage. The log-size is calculated for all the partitions including the
        follower partitions. The remaining storage column contains the available capacity in all of
        the configured log directories. The broker related log-size improvements or information are
        also available on the Brokers page.


If you click the arrow icon for a broker, the details of that broker are displayed. The
          Leader Partition Log-Size shows the sum of leader partitions’
        log-size. The All Partitions Log-Size field’s value is equal to the
        sortable column’s value called Log Size (naming is different to make
        the sortable column names as short as possible). The Remaining
          Storage sortable column and field is the same (value and name).


If you click a specific partition, a pop-up window appears where log-size information is
          displayed.


If you click Profile of a broker, then the metrics details for that
        broker are displayed. The log-size information per partition is available. Furthermore, the
        sum of leader partitions’ log-size, remaining storage size, and all partitions log-size
        details are also available. The Metrics tab on the
          Brokers page contains the available storage size per log
          directory.noteThere is no advantage of creating more log
          directories on the same disk, so this should be avoided.


If there is any issue with the query on the log directory information, then a warning message
        appears. There can be multiple warnings if more than one broker is related. But no new
        warning message from a specific broker appears until the previous message disappears.



Cloudera Manager chart builder
For historical information, you can use the chart builder provided in Cloudera Manager. The
        following command and screenshot show Kafka log-size data from the past where the broker ID
        and topic name with the topic partition are
        specified.SELECT counter_sum(kafka_bytes_received_by_partition_rate) WHERE serviceName=KafkaServiceName AND kafkaBrokerId = KafkaBrokerId AND kafkaTopicName = KafkaTopicName AND kafkaPartitionId = kafkapartitionId
