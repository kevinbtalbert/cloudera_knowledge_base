Associating tables of a schema to a namespace

importantYou must use this feature only in a CDP Private Cloud Base  deployment. This
            feature is configured automatically in a CDP Public Cloud deployment.
After you enable namespace mapping on a Phoenix schema that already has tables, you can
            migrate the tables to an HBase namespace. The namespace directory that contains the
            migrated tables inherits the schema name. 
For example, if the schema name is store1, then the full path to the
            namespace is $hbase.rootdir/data/store1. System tables are migrated to
            the namespace automatically during the first connection after enabling namespace
            properties.
