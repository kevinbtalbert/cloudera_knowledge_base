Configure Phoenix-Hive connector using Cloudera Manager
You must configure Phoenix-Hive connector before you can access Phoenix data from
        Hive.
Ensure that you have the phoenix-hive-version.jar. You can find this JAR file in the
                    /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/phoenix_connectors/ path on
                the Apache Phoenix node, or you can download it from the Cloudera respository. If
                you use Hive-Tez, you must configure both the Hive and Hive-Tez services.

To configure the Phoenix-Hive connector using Cloudera
            Manager:
Go to the Hive service.

Click the Configuration tab.
Select Scope > Hive Cluster (Service-Wide).Select Category > Advanced.
Locate the Hive Auxiliary JARs Directory property or search
                    for it by typing its name in the Search box.

Add the following auxiliary path directory:
                            /usr/local/phoenix-hive

important You must manually create the
                                /usr/local/phoenix-hive
                        directory, and copy the
                                /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/phoenix_connectors/phoenix5-hive-[***VERSION***]-shaded.jar
                        on every node in the cluster that runs Hive-on-Tez Server or Hive
                        Metastore.
Ensur that you have the required permissions the access and write to the
                            phoenix-hive directory and the JAR file that you copy
                        into it must be accessible by hive:hive user.
noteYou can use any directory instead of
                                /usr/local/phoenix-hive that
                        Hive can read or place the JAR file in the existing Hive Auxiliary Directory
                        if one already exists.

Enter a Reason for change, and then click Save
                    Changes to commit the changes.Restart the role and service when Cloudera Manager prompts you to restart.

If you have installed Hive-Tez, repeat the configuration steps for Hive-Tez as
                well.
