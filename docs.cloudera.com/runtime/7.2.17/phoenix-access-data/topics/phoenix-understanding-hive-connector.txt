Using Apache Phoenix-Hive connector
This connector enables you to access the Phoenix data from Hive without any data
        transfer. So the Business Intelligence (BI) logic in Hive can access the operational data
        available in Phoenix. 
Using this connector, you can run a certain type of queries in Phoenix more
            efficiently than using Hive or other applications, however, this is not a universal tool
            that can run all types of queries. In some cases, Phoenix can run queries faster than
            the Phoenix Hive integration and vice versa. In others, you can run this tool to perform
            operations like many to many joins and aggregations which Phoenix would otherwise
            struggle to effectively run on its own. This integration is better suited for performing
            online analytical query processing (OLAP) operations than Phoenix.
Another use case for this connector is transferring the data between these two
            systems. You can use this connector to simplify the data movement between Hive and
            Phoenix, since an intermediate form of the data (for example, a .CSV file) is not
            required. The automatic movement of structured data between these two systems is the
            major advantage of using this tool. You should be aware that for moving a large amount
            of data from Hive to Phoenix CSV bulk load is preferable due to performance reasons.
