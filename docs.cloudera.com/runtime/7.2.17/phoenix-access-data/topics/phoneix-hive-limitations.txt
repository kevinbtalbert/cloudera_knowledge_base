Limitations of Phoenix-Hive connector
Following are some of the limitations of Phoenix-Hive connector: 
Only 4K character specification is allowed to specify a full table. If the volume of
                the data is huge, then there is a possibility to lose the metadata information.
There is a difference in the way timestamp is saved in Phoenix and Hive. Phoenix
                uses binary format, whereas Hive uses a text format to store data.
Hive LLAP is not supported.
