Phoenix is FIPS compliant
Phoenix is now Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant.
FIPS are publicly announced standards developed by the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology for use in computer systems by non-military American government agencies and
   government contractors. Phoenix Query Server (PQS) is compatible with a FIPS-enabled
   environment..
PQS can run on an OS with FIPS turned on and can use FIPS-compliant crypto libraries.
For more information, see Installing and Configuring CDP with FIPS.
