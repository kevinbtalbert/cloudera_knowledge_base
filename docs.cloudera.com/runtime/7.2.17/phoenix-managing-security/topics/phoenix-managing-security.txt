Managing Apache Phoenix security
Apache Ranger manages authorization and access control through a user interface that
        ensures consistent policy administration for both Apache Phoenix and Apache
        HBase.
Apache Phoenix namespaces, tables, column family, and columns use the same access control
            parameters set in Apache HBase. You must first enable Apache Phoenix ACLs support using
            Cloudera Manager before you can define permissions for your Apache HBase tables if you
            are using Apache HBase ACLs.
Shared Data Experience (SDX) Data Lake helps you configure and manage authorization and
            access control through the Apache Ranger user interface that ensures consistent policy
            administration for Apache HBase. Apache Phoenix security derives policies applied to the
            underlying Apache HBase tables in Ranger. You can grant read or write permissions to an
            Apache HBase table for a specific user using the Apache Ranger user interface. 
Auto-TLS is enabled by default in CDP. But you can also manually configure TLS for
            Phoenix Query Server. See the related inforamtion section to learn more about security
            in CDP.
