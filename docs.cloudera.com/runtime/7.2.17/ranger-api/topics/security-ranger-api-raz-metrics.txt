Ranger RAZ Metrics APICloudera Docs
Ranger RAZ Metrics API

One Ranger RAZ API returns a response in JSON format. The other Ranger RAZ API returns a
      response in prometheus compatible format. Neither API that fetches Ranger RAZ metrics requires
      authentication as it does not provide any sensitive information. Both APIs return the same
      value.  You can reduce (or
      increase) the metrics collection interval using the
        hadoop-metrics2.properties file.
You can access two APIs that fetch Ranger RAZ metrics.
JSON compatible API:
accessible at a url with format:
http(s)://<RAZ_HOST>:<RAZ_PORT>/service/metrics/json

https://kg-rzmtr-1.kg-rzmtr.root.hwx.site:6082/api/metrics/json
Prometheus compatible API:
accessible at a url with format:
http(s)://<RAZ_HOST>:<RAZ_PORT>/service/metrics/prometheus

https://kg-rzmtr-1.kg-rzmtr.root.hwx.site:6082/api/metrics/prometheus
Response
The response is grouped into raz & Ranger JVM categories. Since both APIs return the
        same value, only json responses are discussed in this document.
Raz:

This group of metrics gives all metrics related to RAZ application.
Sample json response follows:

  "Raz": {
       "RequestPoolCount": 1600,
        "RequestPoolCountBUSY": 882,
       "SpoolDirSizeSOLR": 0,
       "SpoolDirSizeHDFS": 67123185,
       "AuthzTime": 109873,
       "AuthzCount": 190,
       "AuthzALLOWED": 100,
       "AuthzDENIED": 80,
       "AuthzNOTDETERMINED": 10,

Ranger JVM:

This metrics group represents the JVM metrics needed to get internal state of
                admin.
Sample json response follows:

"RangerJvm": {
        "GcTimeTotal": 5315,
        "SystemLoadAvg": 3.91,
        "ThreadsBusy": 2250,
        "GcCountTotal": 472,
        "MemoryMax": 1066401792,
        "MemoryCurrent": 179763416,
        "ThreadsWaiting": 2248,
        "ProcessorsAvailable": 4,
        "GcTimeMax": 5002,
        "ThreadsBlocked": 25,
        "ThreadsRemaining": 4
    }
}
