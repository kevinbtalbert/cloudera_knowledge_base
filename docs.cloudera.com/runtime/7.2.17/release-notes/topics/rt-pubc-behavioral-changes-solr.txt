Behavioral Changes in Apache Solr
Learn about the change in certain functionality of Solr that has resulted in a change in
  behavior from the previously released version to this version of Cloudera Runtime.


Summary:
The default value of the
      hbaseindexer.httpserver.disabled environment parameter changed from
      false to true.
Previous behavior:
You needed to change the value of the
      hbaseindexer.httpserver.disabled environment parameter to
      true to switch off the REST interface. This was necessary to prevent  use of
     the --http argument when using the hbase-indexer command line tool. Using the
      --http argument for the hbase-indexer command line tool to invoke Lily
     indexer through REST API allowed adding/listing/removing indexers with any user without the
     need for authentication.
New behavior:
The HBase Lily indexer REST API is switched off by default.
