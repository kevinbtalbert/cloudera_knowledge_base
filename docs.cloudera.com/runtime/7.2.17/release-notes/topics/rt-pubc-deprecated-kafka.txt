MirrorMaker (MM1)
MirrorMaker is deprecated. Cloudera recommends that you use Streams Replication
              Manager (SRM) instead.


--zookeeper 
The --zookeeper option is only supported for the
              kafka-configs tool and should be only used when updating SCRAM
              Credential configurations. The --zookeeper option is either
              deprecated in or removed from other Kafka command line tools. Cloudera recommends that
              you use the --bootstrap-server option instead.
