Upgrade Spring-security to 5.7.5 due to CVE-2022-31692, CVE-2022-31690


CDPD-45097: Atlas - Prevent re-indexing of deleted relationship edges to improve entity-update execution process 
Implementing this fix along with fix in CDPD-36992 together would ensure that deleted relationship edges are not reattempted for deletion and re-indexing is not done for such edges. As a result, execution time for messages piling on the Atlas hook (Kafka lag) would be reduced drastically leading to significant performance improvement.


CDPD-44811: [PbC] Atlas - Replace log4j 1.x with log4j2
Merge to CDH 7.2.17 (7.2.17.x), pre-cdpd-master (7.2.17) branch, 


CDPD-44104: Every hive insert generates an Atlas audit event
As per the current architecture, Atlas maintains audit data for all DML events also. By introducing "DML audit filter" feature, Atlas can skip all the DML event processing which improves performance by reducing unnecessary processing efforts from Atlas. Eventually, there will not be a need to store any such audit events which will reduce use of storage.  The DML audit filter will be enabled by default with the below explained configuration. If the user wants to have audit data for DML events, it can be configured using the same configuration. Filtering DML events will be handled by Atlas hook, DML audit filter configuration should be enabled at Hive hook. Note that DML Audit filter is enabled by default, set to false to disable it Hive configuration Property : Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for atlas-application.properties Configuration value : atlas.hook.hive.skip.dml.messages=true

CDPD-35438: When classification is created with multiple super types having same attributes , Atlas doesn't throw an exception
This patch restricts classification typedef creation when a child type attribute conflicts with parent type attribute of same name.


CDPD-31728: Audits : For db create , there are 2 update audits instead of 1 create 1 update
This patch will check for the Shell entities created and then assign the Entity status to the Audit entry.


CDPD-29307: Kafka producer entity stays in incomplete state in Atlas
The Kafka-Atlas plugin now fully creates Producer and Consumer entities and won't generate incomplete ones.
