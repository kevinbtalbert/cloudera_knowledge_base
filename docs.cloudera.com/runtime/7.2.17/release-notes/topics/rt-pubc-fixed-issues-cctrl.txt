OPSAPS-66403: Cruise Control auth users lists are getting generated
     wrongly
Cruise Control handles the different authentication levels for the
     users correctly. When users are added to higher authentication levels, the lower level
     permissions are also assigned. For example, an ADMIN level user automatically has USER and
     VIEWER permissions as well.
