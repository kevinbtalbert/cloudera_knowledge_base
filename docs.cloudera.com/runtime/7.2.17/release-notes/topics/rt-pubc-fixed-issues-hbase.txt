 Review the list of HBase issues that are resolved in Cloudera Runtime
    7.2.17.


CDPD-50683: HBase: Add idempotency support for fs.rename while
          using ABFS
HBaseAzureSemantics now supports resilient rename for files
          between source and destination on Azure Blob storage. However, HBase does not support any
          directory renaming and the behavior is same as ABFS.
Resilient rename is a workaround for RenamePathFile
            500/OAuthServerTimeoutError and RenamePathFile
            404/OAuthClientOtherError (Source File does not exist after a successfully
          rename) handled by the file system HBaseAzureSemantics. With this
          workaround, the region server must not crash during the commit stage of the flush
          operation for HFile.


CDPD-48344: Make the initial corePoolSize configurable for ChoreService
Add hbase.choreservice.initial.pool.size
          configuration property to set the initial number of threads for the ChoreService.


CDPD-48185: Hbase_mcc - Upgrade Scala to 2.12.5+/2.13.9+ due to CVE-2017-15288
The Scala version depends on the spark-scala version.


CDPD-46164: HBASE Tarball does not contain JWT related JARS
JWT related JARS added to the HBASE Tarball.


CDPD-46065: Job to sync schema differences between the HA clusters
A new tool SyncTableDescriptorsTool which
          synchronizes the table descriptors between two peers that uses the HBase multiple cluster
          client after one of the primary or the failover cluster disconnected from the two-way peer
          replication, especially, if the operator finds any table attributes that are different on
          the clusters.
To use this tool:
Get the classpath including hbase-mcc.jar, HBase's jars, and
                hbase-site.xml from the source cluster.
Use the following command:java -cp
                  "hbase-mcc-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:/path/to/clusters/:/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/jars/*:`hbase
                  classpath`" com.cloudera.hbase.mcc.SyncTableDescriptorsTool -t
<table that needs to sync for table descriptor>
