Review the list of Hive issues that are resolved in Cloudera Runtime 7.2.17.


OPSAPS-67031: Increase the hive split threads to 64 for AWS and
          GCP
This fix addresses a performance issue for Ranger Raz with
          specific cloud providers. As part of this fix, the default value for Hive split processing
          threads (hive.compute.splits.num.threads) is increased to 64. This change
          affects only Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) deployments.


CDPD-39232: Performance impact caused by RANGER-3593 when running
          SHOW TABLES query
During authorization checks, the Ranger plugin looks for ownership
          information for database objects (database, tables, or views) through HMS API calls if the
          ownership information is not provided by Hive. For databases having a large amount of
          tables, this can result in slow performance for statements like SHOW TABLES because the
          Ranger plugin has to generate an API call for each object.
This fix ensures that ownership information is provided by Hive
          for the above statements so that the Ranger authorization plugin does not have to issue
          HMS API calls.


CDPD-40779: Hive - Upgrade netty to 4.1.77 due to
          CVE-2022-24823
Upgraded netty to 4.1.77 to fix CVEs.


CDPD-43490: Hive Security - Upgrade jackson-databind to 2.12.7.1
          due to critical CVEs
Upgraded jackson-databind to 2.12.7.1 to fix CVEs.


CDPD-43509: Hive Security - Upgrade dom4j: flexible XML framework
          for Java to safe version due to critical CVEs
Removed dom4j to fix CVEs.


CDPD-46097: Null Pointer Exception with mask udf
This fix addresses the issue where the 'SHA512' masked value is
          not being propagated to Tez executors.


CDPD-46360: Authorize DataConnectors in Hive until CDPD-26882 is
          implemented
Data connectors in HIVE are temporarily authorized using RWSTORAGE
          privileges until CDPD-26882 is resolved.


CDPD-46568: Hive - Upgrade Apache Ivy to 2.5.1 due to
          CVE-2022-37865, CVE-2022-37866
Upgraded apache ivy to 2.5.1 to fix CVEs.


CDPD-46664: Hive - Upgrade commons-codec to 1.13 or higher
Upgraded commons-codec to 1.15 to fix CVEs.


CDPD-47132: Pushdown Date data type to metastore via direct SQL/
          JDO
Fix partition filtering when querying partition metadata from Hive
          Metastore and the partition key column data type is 'date'.


CDPD-47464: ALTER VIEW command is allowed even when user has a
          deny policy on the underlying table
The ALTER VIEW statement was not authorized correctly. This fix
          addresses the security concern related to the authorization of ALTER VIEW AS queries.


CDPD-48022: Hive - Upgrade postgresql to 42.5.1 due to
          CVE-2022-41946
Upgraded PostgreSQL to 42.5.1 to fix CVEs


CDPD-48801: Pushdown Timestamp data type to metastore via direct
          SQL / JDO
Support partition filtering when querying partition metadata from
          Hive Metastore and partition key column data type is 'timestamp'.


CDPD-49145: Oozie and Spark tests are failing in multi-comp-pre
          with ZooKeeper-based or direct JDBC URL to Hive
HiveServer (HS2) uses the
            InetAddress.getHostName() API to get its host name and register itself
          with ZooKeeper. The API behaviour is changed on JDK 11 with specific operating systems and
          returns only the host name without the domain suffix. Therefore, HiveServer is not
          accessible to clients when the server information is obtained from Zookeeper. 
To address this issue, the
            InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName() API is used to get the host name
          along with the fully qualified domain name.


CDPD-49507: {OWNER} policy not working with HIVE UDFs in
          RangerHiveAuthorizer
The UDFs used in Hive will now honor {Owner} polices in ranger
          with this fix.


CDPD-50450: Inconsistency between session Hive and thread-local
          Hive may cause HS2 deadlock
Two HS2 sessions can go into a deadlock state and can indefinitely
          wait for each other (related to RANGER-3593). This fix resolves the deadlock
          condition.


CDPD-55168: HiveConnection: HTTP Response code: 404 Failed to
          connect to master node on YCloud
This issue has been fixed based on the support provided in
          Cloudera Manager for Knox Custom Topology management.


CDPD-55914: SELECT query on table with remote database returns
          NULL values with postgreSQL and Redshift data connectors
This fix addresses the issue where some datatypes are not mapped
          from postgreSQL or Redshift to Hive data types in the connector, which results in
          displaying null values for the columns of these data types.


CDPD-56133: Compaction entry dequeue order
This fix addresses the issue where compaction requests are
          dequeued in a random order. With this fix, the compaction requests are now dequeued in a
          First In First Out (FIFO) order.
