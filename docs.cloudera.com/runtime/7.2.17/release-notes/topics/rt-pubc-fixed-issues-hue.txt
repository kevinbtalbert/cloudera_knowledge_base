Fixed Issues in HueCloudera DocsFixed Issues in Hue
Review the list of
    Hue issues that are resolved in Cloudera Runtime 7.2.17.


CDPD-48893: Hue logs get overwritten
In previous implementations, multiple file handlers would write to a single log file, causing the Hue logs to be overwritten. Hue now uses a socket handler, which solves this problem.


CDPD-48787: Hue does not load after setting the
          download_bytes_limit
Earlier, when you set the value of the
            download_bytes_limit property in the [beeswax] section in the Hue
          Advanced Configuration Snippet, the Hue web interface did not load with the following
          error: Processing exception: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and
            'int. This issue has been fixed.


CDPD-48281: Add limit request field configs to hue
New configs have been added to control the request header limits
          used by Gunicorn server.


CDPD-48250: Import table data to external location fails when % is
          included in the filename
Earlier, when you tried to upload a file containing the %
          symbol using the Hue File Browser, the % symbol was encoded incorrectly. You would
          see an unexpected symbol in the filename. This issue has been resolved by fixing the
          encoding issue in the Hue importer.


CDPD-47077: Issues while exporting or importing documents in
          Hue
Earlier, you would have faced issues while exporting and importing
          workflows and documents in Hue. This was due to a bug in Django 1.11, which has been fixed
          in all Django versions higher than 2.2. In the CDP 7.2.17 release, Hue uses Django 3.2,
          which has automatically resolved this issue.


CDPD-46957: Export feature is not available from search bar in
          Hue
This issue has been fixed. You now see an option to download
          document results in the top search bar and left assist pane in Hue.
