CDPD-26975: Using the ABFS / S3A connectors in an Oozie
                    workflow where the operations are "secured" may trigger an
                    IllegalArgumentException with the error message java.net.URISyntaxException:
                    Relative path in absolute URI.

CDPD-48847: Oozie "root" rewrite rule's pattern is too open
The "root" rewrite rule for Oozie is too open and causes the following
                    issue:
When you use Apache Hue as the UI for Oozie and define a workflow property
                    for a file path like hdfs://mnameservice1/oozie/test,
                    then on Hue's workflow details page, you will see an url for that property
                    like:
                    http://oozie-host.examole.com:11000/oozie/test
The issue is now fixed.
