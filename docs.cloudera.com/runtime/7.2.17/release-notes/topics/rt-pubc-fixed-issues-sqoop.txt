CDPD-44431: Disable the Sqoop direct mode feature with ability to
          enable it again temporarily

          default. However, you can still enable it by either setting the
            sqoop.enable.deprecated.direct property globally in Cloudera Manager
          for Sqoop or by specifying it in the command-line through
            -Dsqoop.enable.deprecated.direct=true.

          Parquet files:
Int, Float, Double to the same RDBMS types
Long to BigDecimal, Date, Time, TimeStamp

                source date is based on the Julian calendar.

          Parquet
