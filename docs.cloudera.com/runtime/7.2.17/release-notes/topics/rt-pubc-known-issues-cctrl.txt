Rebalancing with Cruise Control does not work due to the metric
     reporter failing to report the CPU usage metric
On the Kafka broker, the Cruise control metric reporter plugin may
     fail to report the CPU usage metric.If the CPU usage metric is not reported, the
      numValidWindows in Cruise Control will be 0 and proposal generation as well as partition
      rebalancing will not work. If this issue is present, the following message will be included in
      the Kafka
      logs:WARN com.linkedin.kafka.cruisecontrol.metricsreporter.CruiseControlMetricsReporter:
          [CruiseControlMetricsReporterRunner]: Failed reporting CPU util.java.io.IOException: Java Virtual Machine recent CPU usage is not
        available.This
      issue is only known to affect Kafka broker hosts that have the following specifications:
CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2699 v4 @ 2.20GHz
OS: Linux 4.18.5-1.el7.elrepo.x86_64 #1 SMP Fri Aug 24 11:35:05 EDT 2018 x86_64
Java version: 8-18

Move the broker to a different machine where the CPU is
     different. This can be done by performing a manual repair on the affected nodes. For more
     information, see the Data Hub documentation. noteCluster nodes affected by
      this issue are not displayed as unhealthy.


CDPD-47616: Unable to initiate rebalance, number of valid windows
          (NumValidWindows) is zero
If a Cruise Control rebalance is initiated with the
            rebalance_disk parameter and Cruise Control is configured to fetch
          metrics from Cloudera Manager (Metric Reporter is set to
            CM metrics reporter), Cruise Control stops collecting metrics
          from the partitions that are moved. This is because Cloudera Manager does not collect
          metrics from moved partitions due to an issue in Kafka (KAFKA-10320).If the metrics are
            not available, the partition is considered invalid by Cruise Control. This results in
            Cruise Control blocking rebalance operations and proposal generation.
Configure Cruise Control to use to use the Cruise Control
          metrics reporter (default). This issue is not present if this metric reporter is used.
In Cloudera Manager, select the Cruise Control service.
Go to Configuration.
Find the Metric Reporter property.
Select the Cruise Control metrics reporter option.
Restart the Cruise Control service.



OPSAPS-68148: Cruise Control rack aware goal upgrade handler
The goal sets in Cruise Control, which include the default,
          supported, hard, self-healing and anomaly detection goals, might be overridden to their
          default value after a cluster upgrade if the goals have been customized.
Create a copy from the values of the goal lists before
          upgrading your cluster, and add the copied values to the goal lists after upgrading the
          cluster. Furthermore, you must rename any mentioning of
            com.linkedin.kafka.cruisecontrol.analyzer.goals.RackAwareGoal to
            com.linkedin.kafka.cruisecontrol.analyzer.goals.RackAwareDistributionGoal
          as Cruise Control will not be able to start otherwise.
