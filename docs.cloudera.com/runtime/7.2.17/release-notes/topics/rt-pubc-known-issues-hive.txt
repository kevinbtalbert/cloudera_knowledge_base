CDPD-54988: Disallow creation of Temporary Hive Iceberg
          tables
Atlas by default skips ingesting temporary tables created in Hive.
          But when searched for the newly created temporary Hive tables, it displays them in the
          search results.


CDPD-15518: ACID tables you write using the Hive Warehouse Connector cannot be read from an Impala virtual warehouse.
Read the tables from a Hive virtual warehouse or using Impala queries in Data Hub.


CDPD-13636: Hive job fails with OutOfMemory exception in the Azure DE cluster
Set the parameter
            hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition.threshold=0. Add this
          parameter in Cloudera Manager (Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
          for hive-site.xml)




ENGESC-2214: Hiveserver2 and HMS service logs are not deleted
Update Hive log4j configurations. Hive -> Configuration -> HiveServer2 Logging Advanced
          Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) Hive Metastore -> Configuration -> Hive Metastore
          Server Logging Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) Add the following to the
          configurations: appender.DRFA.strategy.action.type=DELETE
appender.DRFA.strategy.action.basepath=${log.dir}
appender.DRFA.strategy.action.maxdepth=1
appender.DRFA.strategy.action.PathConditions.glob=${log.file}.*
appender.DRFA.strategy.action.PathConditions.type=IfFileName
appender.DRFA.strategy.action.PathConditions.nestedConditions.type=IfAccumulatedFileCount
appender.DRFA.strategy.action.PathConditions.nestedConditions.exceeds=same value
            as appender.DRFA.strategy.max




CDPD-10848: HiveServer Web UI displays incorrect data
If you enabled auto-TLS for TLS encryption, the HiveServer2 Web UI
          does not display the correct data in the following tables: Active Sessions, Open Queries,
          Last Max n Closed Queries 




CDPD-11890: Hive on Tez cannot run certain queries on tables stored in encryption zones
This problem occurs when the Hadoop Key Management Server (KMS) connection is
          SSL-encrypted and a self signed certificate is used. SSLHandshakeException might appear in
          Hive logs.

          Use one of the workarounds: 
Install a self signed SSL certificate into cacerts file on all hosts.
Copy ssl-client.xml to a directory that is available in all hosts. In Cloudera
              Manager, in Clusters > Hive on Tez > Configuration. In Hive Service Advanced Configuration Snippet for
                hive-site.xml, click +, and add the name
              tez.aux.uris and
              valuepath-to-ssl-client.xml.
