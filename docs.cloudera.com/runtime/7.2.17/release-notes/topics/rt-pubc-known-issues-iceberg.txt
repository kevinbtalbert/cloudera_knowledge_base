CDPD-57551: Performance issue can occur on reads after writes of
          Iceberg tables

          Hive might generate too many small files, which causes performance degradation.
        
Maintain a relatively small number of data files under the
          iceberg table/partition directory to have efficient reads. To alleviate poor performance
          caused by too many small files, run the following queries:
          TRUNCATE TABLE target;
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE target select * from target FOR SYSTEM_VERSION AS OF <preTruncateSnapshotId>;





CDPD-55243: Spark can read stale data under certain conditions 

Using inconsistent cases for database and table names of Iceberg tables in queries can
            lead to Spark reading stale data. In particular, after any write to the table (append,
            update, delete) in the same session, an old snapshot may still be read, unless all
            queries use consistent casing for database and table names.

Use consistent casing for database and table names in all
          queries.
