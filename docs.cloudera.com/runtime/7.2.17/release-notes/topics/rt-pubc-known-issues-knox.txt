CDPD-3125: Logging out of Atlas does not manage the external authentication 
At this time, Atlas does not communicate a log-out event with the external
          authentication management, Apache Knox. When you log out of Atlas, you can still open the
          instance of Atlas from the same web browser without re-authentication. 
To prevent additional access to Atlas, close all browser windows and
          exit the browser.
