CDPD-41274: HWC + Oozie issue: Could not open client transport with JDBC Uri

Currently only Spark cluster mode is supported in the Oozie Spark Action with Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC).

Use Spark action in cluster mode.
                    Use Spark action in cluster mode.
                        <spark xmlns="uri:oozie:spark-action:1.0">
                        ...
                        <mode>cluster</mode>
                        ...
                        </spark>




Oozie jobs fail (gracefully) on secure YARN clusters when JobHistory server is
                    down

If the JobHistory server is down on a YARN (MRv2) cluster, Oozie attempts to
                        submit a job, by default, three times. If the job fails, Oozie automatically
                        puts the workflow in a SUSPEND state.

When the JobHistory server is running again, use the
                        resume command to inform Oozie to continue the workflow
                    from the point at which it left off.




Unsupported Feature

The following Oozie features are currently not supported in Cloudera Data
                            Platform:
Non-support for Pig action (CDPD-1070)
Conditional coordinator input logic

Cloudera does not support using Derby database with Oozie. You can use it for
                        testing or debugging purposes, but Cloudera does not recommend using it in
                        production environments. This could cause failures while upgrading from CDH
                        to CDP.
