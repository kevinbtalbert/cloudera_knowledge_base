    functionality, and the workaround.


CDPD-39313: Some numbers are not rendered properly in SMM UI
Very large numbers can be imprecisely represented on the UI. For example, bytes larger
          than 8 petabytes would lose precision.
None.


CDPD-45183: Kafka Connect active topics might be visible to
              unauthorised users
The Kafka Connect active topics endpoint
              (/connectors/[***CONNECTOR NAME***]/topics) and
              the Connect Cluster page on the SMM UI disregard the user permissions configured for the
              Kafka service in Ranger. As a result, all active topics of connectors might become visible
              to users who do not have permissions to view them. Note that user permission configured
              for Kafka Connect in Ranger are not affected by this issue and are correctly applied.
None.


OPSAPS-59553: SMM's bootstrap server config should be updated
          based on Kafka's listeners
SMM does not show any metrics for Kafka or Kafka Connect when
          multiple listeners are set in Kafka.
SMM cannot identify multiple listeners and still points to
          bootstrap server using the default broker port (9093 for SASL_SSL). You would have to
          override bootstrap server URL (hostname:port as set in the listeners for broker). Add the
          bootstrap server details in SMM safety valve in the following path:
Cloudera Manager >  SMM >  Configuration >  Streams Messaging Manager Rest Admin Server Advanced Configuration Snippet
              (Safety Valve) for streams-messaging-manager.yaml >  Add the following value for bootstrap servers >  Save Changes >  Restart SMM.
streams.messaging.manager.kafka.bootstrap.servers=<comma-separated list of brokers>



OPSAPS-59597: SMM UI logs are not supported by Cloudera
          Manager
Cloudera Manager does not support the log type used by SMM
          UI.
View the SMM UI logs on the host.


Limitations


CDPD-36422: 1MB flow.snapshot freezes Safari
While importing large connector configurations, flow.snapshots
            reduces the usability of the Streams Messaging Manager when using Safari browser. 
Use a different browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge).
