Known Issues for Apache Sqoop
Learn about the known issues in Sqoop, the impact or changes to the functionality, and
    the workaround.


Using direct mode causes problems
Using direct mode has
          several drawbacks:
Imports can cause intermittent an overlapping input split.
Imports can generate duplicate data. 
Many problems, such as intermittent failures, can occur.
Additional configuration is required.

Stop using direct mode. Do not use the
            --direct option in Sqoop import or export commands.
Sqoop's direct mode is no longer supported and is disabled by
          default. However, if you still want to use it, enable it by either setting the
            sqoop.enable.deprecated.direct property globally in Cloudera Manager
          for Sqoop or by specifying it in the command-line through
            -Dsqoop.enable.deprecated.direct=true.




CDPD-3089: Avro, S3, and HCat do not work together properly
Importing an Avro file into S3 with HCat fails with Delegation Token not
          available.




Parquet columns inadvertently renamed
Column names that start with a number are renamed when you use the --as-parquetfile option to import data.
Prepend column names in Parquet tables with one or more letters or underscore characters.




Importing Parquet files might cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors
Importing multiple megabytes per row before initial-page-run check (ColumnWriter) can cause OOM. Also, rows that vary significantly by size so that the next-page-size check is based on small rows, and is set very high, followed by many large rows can also cause OOM.
