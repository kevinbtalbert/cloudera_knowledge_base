Known Issues


CDPD-22089: SRM does not sync re-created source topics until the
            offsets have caught up with target topic
Messages written to topics that were deleted and re-created are
            not replicated until the source topic reaches the same offset as the target topic. For
            example, if at the time of deletion and re-creation there are a 100 messages on the
            source and target clusters, new messages will only get replicated once the re-created
            source topic has 100 messages. This leads to messages being lost.
None


CDPD-11079: Blacklisted topics appear in the list of replicated
            topics
If a topic was originally replicated but was later disallowed
            (blacklisted), it will still appear as a replicated topic under the
              /remote-topics REST API endpoint. As a result, if a call is made to
            this endpoint, the disallowed topic will be included in the response. Additionally, the
            disallowed topic will also be visible in the SMM UI. However, it's Partitions and
            Consumer Groups will be 0, its Throughput, Replication Latency and Checkpoint Latency
            will show N/A.
None


CDPD-30275: SRM may automatically re-create deleted topics on
            target clusters
If auto.create.topics.enable is enabled,
            deleted topics might get automatically re-created on target clusters. This is a timing
            issue. It only occurs if remote topics are deleted while the replication of the topic is
            still ongoing.


Remove the topic from the topic allowlist with srm-control. For
                example:srm-control topics --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --target [TARGET_CLUSTER] --remove [TOPIC1]
Wait until SRM is no longer replicating the topic.
Delete the remote topic in the target cluster.




OPSAPS-67772: SRM Service metrics processing fails when the
            noexec option is enabled for /tmp
The SRM Service role uses /tmp to extract
            RocksDB .so files, which are required for metrics processing to
            function. If the noexec option is enabled for the
              /tmp directory, the SRM Service role is not able load the
            required RocksDB files. This results in metrics processing failing.


In Cloudera Manager, select the SRM service and go to
                  Configuration.
Add the following to SRM Service Environment Advanced Configuration
                  Snippet (Safety Valve). Do this for all SRM Service role
                  instances.ROCKSDB_SHAREDLIB_DIR=[***PATH***]Replace
                    [***PATH***] with a directory that is not
                    /tmp.




OPSAPS-67738: SRM Service role's Remote Querying feature does
            not work when the noexec option is enabled for /tmp

The SRM Service role puts the Netty native libraries into the
                /tmp directory. As a result, If the noexec
              option is enabled for the /tmp directory, the Remote Querying
              feature will fail to function.



In Cloudera Manager, select the SRM service and go to
                  Configuration.
Add the following to
                SRM_JVM_PERF_OPTS.-Dio.netty.native.workdir=[***PATH***]Replace
                  [***PATH***] with a directory that is not
                  /tmp.




OPSAPS-67742: The SRM Service role fails to start if properties
            are added to Additional Configs For Streams Application Running Inside SRM Service 
Configuring the SRM Service role's internal Kafka Streams
            application is not possible. If you add any properties to Using the
              Additional Configs For Streams Application Running Inside SRM Service, the
            SRM Service role fails to start. If you are affected by this issue, an exception similar
            to the following will be present in the SRM Service role's
              stderr.log:o.dropwizard.configuration.ConfigurationParsingException: /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/132-streams_replication_manager-STREAMS_REPLICATION_MANAGER_SERVICE/srm-service.yaml has an error: * Malformed YAML at line: 66, column: 49; mapping values are not allowed here in 'reader', line 65, column 48:

None


CDPD-60426: Configuration changes are lost following a rolling
            restart of the service
In certain cases, SRM might fail to apply configuration
            updates if the service is restarted with a rolling restart. In a case like this,
            configuration changes are ignored without any warning or indication. This issue also
            affects rolling upgrades.
When restarting the service, use Actions >  > Restart instead of Actions >  > Rolling Restart after making configuration changes. When upgrading a cluster, ensure that
            SRM is not restarted with a rolling restart. 



Limitations



SRM cannot replicate Ranger authorization policies to or from
              Kafka clusters
Due to a limitation in the Kafka-Ranger plugin, SRM cannot
              replicate Ranger policies to or from clusters that are configured to use Ranger for
              authorization. If you are using SRM to replicate data to or from a cluster that uses
              Ranger, disable authorization policy synchronization in SRM. This can be achieved by
              clearing the Sync Topic Acls Enabled
                (sync.topic.acls.enabled) checkbox.
