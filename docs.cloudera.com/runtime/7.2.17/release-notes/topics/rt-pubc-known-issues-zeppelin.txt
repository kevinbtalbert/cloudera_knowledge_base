CDPD-3090: Due to a typo in the configuration, functionality
          involving notebook repositories does not work
Due to a missing closing brace, access to the notebook repositories
          API is blocked by default.


From the Cloudera Data Platform Management Console, go to
                Cloudera Manager for the cluster running
                Zeppelin.
 On the Zeppelin configuration page (Zeppelin service > Configuration), enter shiro urls in the
                Search field, and then add the missing closing brace to the
                notebook-repositories URL, as
              follows:/api/notebook-repositories/** = authc, roles[{{zeppelin_admin_group}}]
Click Save Changes.
Restart the Zeppelin service.






CDPD-2406: Logout button does not work
Clicking the Logout button in the Zeppelin UI
          logs you out, but then immediately logs you back in using SSO.
Close the browser.
