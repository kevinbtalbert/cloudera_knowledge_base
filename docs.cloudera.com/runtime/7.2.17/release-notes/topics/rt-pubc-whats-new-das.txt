  about what is new in Data Analytics Studio (DAS) in Cloudera Runtime 7.2.17.
DAS has been deprecated
DAS has been deprecated in Cloudera Data Hub (Cloudera Runtime 7.2.17 release) and will be
    removed from the CDP stack in future releases. Cloudera encourages you to use Hue to run Hive
    LLAP workloads. You can submit queries from DAS, but cannot view query history without enabling
    the DAS Event Processor. For more information, see Enabling the DAS Event Processor.
