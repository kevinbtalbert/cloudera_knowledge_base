Hive Metastore dynamic leader election
You can enable dynamic leader election for Hive Metastore (HMS) to avoid running the same
        tasks across all Hive Metastore (HMS) instances. HMS performs housekeeping tasks, such as
        execution of compaction tasks, auto-discovering partitions for external tables, generation
        of compaction tasks, and so on. When there are multiple HMS instances, it is essential to
        have a single leader HMS elected to avoid running the same tasks across all the instances.
        The elected leader then performs the housekeeping tasks.
This feature uses Hive locks to dynamically elect a leader. When a HMS instance owns a
        lock, it is elected as the leader and performs the housekeeping tasks. For more information,
        see Hive Metastore leader election.
