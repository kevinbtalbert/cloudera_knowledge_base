What's New in Hue
Learn about the new features of Hue in Cloudera Runtime 7.2.17.
Performance and security enhancements in Hue
Python 2 has reached the end of life and is no longer supported. Hue now uses Python 3
        which makes use of critical bug fixes and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) fixes
        for many third-party software dependencies. The following changes have been made in the Hue
        codebase in this release of CDP Public Cloud
Python libraries such as django-auth-ldap, django-axes, djangorestframework-simplejwt,
            Mako, Markdown, pyth on-ldap, django-babel, django-mako, django-cors-headers,
            djangorestframework, eventlet, sqlparse, and so on have been upgraded from Python 2.7 to
            Python 3.8.
The Django server has been upgraded from version 1.11.29 to 3.2.16.
Hue now uses Gunicorn as a front-end server. Previously, Hue used the CherryPy
            server.

These upgrades bring significant performance improvement and stability in query
        execution, uploading, and importing files to S3 or ABFS. Operating System, Python version,
        and Python module upgrades have resulted in a stable environment and fixed more than 800
        security vulnerabilities.

Ability to set the permitted file size for upload using Hue File Browser
You can set the permitted size of a file that your users can upload using the Hue File
        Browser by setting the following parameter in the Hue Advanced Configuration in Cloudera
        Manager:[filebrowser]
max_file_size_upload_limit=[***FILE-SIZE-IN-BYTES***] \\default is -1 (no limit)

Ability to access S3 buckets from Hue with RAZ is GA
Granting fine-grained access to the per-user home directories in Amazon S3 and accessing
        them from the S3 File Browser in Hue using RAZ is GA. See Enabling S3 File Browser for Hue with RAZ in
        DataHub.

Ability to access ADLS Gen2 containers from Hue with RAZ is GA
Granting fine-grained access to the per-user home directories on ADLS Gen2 containers and
        accessing them from the ABFS File Browser in Hue using RAZ is GA. See Enabling ABFS File Browser in Hue with RAZ in
          DataHub.

Increased the download limit on the Solr dashboard
Earlier, you could download only 1000 records from the Solr Search dashboard. Hue now
        supports downloading up to 15000 records. You can configure the download limit using the
        following Advanced Configuration Snippet: [search]
download_limit=[***DOWNLOAD-LIMIT***]
