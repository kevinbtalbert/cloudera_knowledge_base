Phoenix is FIPS compliant
Phoenix is now Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant. For more
                information, see Phoenix is FIPS compliant.

Phoenix thin client supports multiple URLs in JDBC connection parameters
When a Phoenix thin client connects to a PQS, you can now specify a list of servers
                in the JDBC connection string. Client connects to one of those URLs and if the
                connection is unsuccessful, client attempts failover (connects to a different
                URL).
