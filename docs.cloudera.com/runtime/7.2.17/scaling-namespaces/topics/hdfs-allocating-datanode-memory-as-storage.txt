Allocating DataNode memory
            as storage
HDFS supports efficient writes of large data sets to durable storage, and also
            provides reliable access to the data. This works well for batch jobs that write large
            amounts of persistent data. Emerging classes of applications are driving use cases for
            writing smaller amounts of temporary data. Using DataNode memory as storage addresses
            the use case of applications that want to write relatively small amounts of intermediate
            data sets with low latency.
Writing block data to memory
                  reduces durability, as data can be lost due to process restart before it is saved
                  to disk. HDFS attempts to save replica data to disk in a timely manner to reduce
                  the window of possible data loss.
DataNode memory is referenced using the RAM_DISK storage type and the LAZY_PERSIST
            storage policy.

HDFS storage typesThe storage type associated with HDFS identifies the underlying storage media. LAZY_PERSIST memory storage policyUse the LAZY_PERSIST storage policy to store data blocks on the configured DataNode       memory.Configure DataNode memory as storageConfiguring memory on a DataNode as storage requires you to shut down the particular         DataNode, set RAM_DISK as the storage type, set the LAZY_PERSIST storage policy to store         data, and then start the DataNode.Parent topic: Optimizing performance
