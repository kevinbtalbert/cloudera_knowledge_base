Balancer commands
You can use various command line options with the hdfs balancer
      command to work with the HDFS Balancer.
Balancing policy, threshold, and blockpools

[-policy <policy>]

Specifies which policy to use to determine if a cluster is balanced.
The two supported policies are blockpool and
                        datanode. Setting the policy to blockpool
                     means that the cluster is balanced if each pool in each node is balanced while
                        datanode means that a cluster is balanced if each DataNode
                     is balanced.
The default policy is datanode.

[-threshold <threshold>]

Specifies a number in [1.0, 100.0] representing the acceptable threshold of the
                     percentage of storage capacity so that storage utilization outside the average
                     +/- the threshold is considered as over/under utilized.
The default threshold is 10.0.

[-blockpools <comma-separated list of blockpool ids>] 

Specifies a list of block pools on which the HDFS Balancer runs. If the list is
                     empty, the HDFS Balancer runs on all existing block pools.
The default value is an empty list.



Include and exclude lists

[-include [-f <hosts-file> | <comma-separated list of hosts>]]

When the include list is non-empty, only the DataNodes specified in the list
                     are balanced by the HDFS Balancer. An empty include list means including all
                     the DataNodes in the cluster. The default value is an empty list.

[-exclude [-f <hosts-file> | <comma-separated list of hosts>]]

The DataNodes specified in the exclude list are excluded so that the HDFS
                     Balancer does not balance those DataNodes. An empty exclude list means that no
                     DataNodes are excluded. When a DataNode is specified in both in the include
                     list and the exclude list, the DataNode is excluded. The default value is an
                     empty list.



Idle-iterations and run during upgrade

[-idleiterations <idleiterations>]

Specifies the number of consecutive iterations in which no blocks have been
                     moved before the HDFS Balancer terminates with the NO_MOVE_PROGRESS exit
                     status.
Specify -1 for infinite iterations. The default is
                        5.

[-runDuringUpgrade]

If specified, the HDFS Balancer runs even if there is an ongoing HDFS upgrade.
                     If not specified, the HDFS Balancer terminates with the
                        UNFINALIZED_UPGRADE exit status.
When there is no ongoing upgrade, this option has no effect. It is usually not
                     desirable to run HDFS Balancer during upgrade. To support rollback, blocks
                     being deleted from HDFS are moved to the internal trash directory in DataNodes
                     and not actually deleted. Running the HDFS Balancer during upgrading cannot
                     reduce the usage of any DataNode storage.



Source DataNodes

[-source [-f <hosts-file> | <comma-separated list of hosts>]]

Specifies the source DataNode list. The HDFS Balancer selects blocks to move
                     from only the specified DataNodes. When the list is empty, all the DataNodes
                     are chosen as a source. The option can be used to free up the space of some
                     particular DataNodes in the cluster. Without the -source option, the HDFS
                     Balancer can be inefficient in some cases.
The default value is an empty list.
The following table shows an example, where the average utilization is 25% so
                     that D2 is within the 10% threshold. It is unnecessary to move any blocks from
                     or to D2. Without specifying the source nodes, HDFS Balancer first moves blocks
                     from D2 to D3, D4 and D5, since they are under the same rack, and then moves
                     blocks from D1 to D2, D3, D4 and D5. By specifying D1 as the source node, HDFS
                     Balancer directly moves blocks from D1 to D3, D4 and D5.
