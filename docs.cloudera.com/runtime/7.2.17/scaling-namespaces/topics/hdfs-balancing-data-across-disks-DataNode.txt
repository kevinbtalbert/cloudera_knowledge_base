Balancing data across disks
      of a DataNode
The HDFS Disk Balancer is a command-line tool that evenly distributes data across all
      the disks of a DataNode to ensure that the disks are effectively utilized. Unlike the HDFS
      Balancer that balances data across DataNodes of a cluster, the Disk Balancer balances data at
      the level of individual DataNodes.
Disks on a DataNode can have an uneven spread of data because of reasons such as large
         amount of writes and deletes or disk replacement. To ensure uniformity in the distribution
         of data across disks of a specified DataNode, the Disk Balancer operates against the
         DataNode and moves data blocks from one disk to another.
For a specified DataNode, the Disk Balancer determines the ideal amount of data to store
         per disk based on its total capacity and used space, and computes the amount of data to
         redistribute between disks. The Disk Balancer captures this information about data movement
         across the disks of a DataNode in a plan. On executing the plan, the Disk Balancer moves
         the data as specified.

Plan the data movement across disksA Disk Balancer plan identifies the amount of data that should move between the disks       of a specified DataNode. The plan contains move steps, where each move step specifies the       source and destination disks for data movement and the number of bytes to move.Run the Disk Balancer planFor a DataNode, the HDFS Disk Balancer moves data according to the details specified         in the JSON document generated as the Disk Balancer plan.Disk Balancer commandsIn addition to planning for data movement across disks and executing the plan, you         can use hdfs diskbalancer sub-commands to query the status of the plan,         cancel the plan, identify at a cluster level the DataNodes that require balancing, or         generate a detailed report on a specific DataNode that can benefit from running the Disk         Balancer.Parent topic: Optimizing data storage
