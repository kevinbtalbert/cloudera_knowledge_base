Configure the NFS Gateway
You must ensure that the proxy user for the NFS Gateway can proxy all the users
        accessing the NFS mounts. In addition, you must configure settings specific to the
        Gateway.

Ensure that the proxy user for the NFS Gateway can proxy all the users
                    accessing the NFS mounts.
In non-secure mode, the user running the Gateway is the proxy user, while in
                    secure mode the user in Kerberos keytab is the proxy user.
If a user nfsserver is running the Gateway and there are
                    users belonging to groups nfs-users1 and
                        nfs-users2, then set the following values in
                        core-site.xml on the NameNode.note
Replace nfsserver with the user account that starts the
                            Gateway in your cluster.
set the following properties in
NFS Gateway Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hdfs-site.xml:
Name: hadoop.proxyuser.nfsserver.groups
Value: nfs-users1,nfs-users2
Description: 
    The 'nfsserver' user is allowed to proxy all members of the
    'nfs-users1' and 'nfs-users2' groups. Set this to '*' to allow
    nfsserver user to proxy any group.

Name: hadoop.proxyuser.nfsserver.hosts
Value: nfs-client-host1.com
Description:
    This is the host where the nfs gateway is running. Set this to
    '*' to allow requests from any hosts to be proxied.
For a Kerberized cluster, set the following properties in
                        hdfs-site.xml:For a Kerberized cluster, set the following properties in 
NFS Gateway Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hdfs-site.xml
Name: nfs.keytab.file
Value: {{CMF_CONF_DIR}}/nfsserver.keytab

Name: nfs.kerberos.principal
Value: nfsserver/_HOST@YOUR-REALM.COM

Configure settings for the NFS Gateway. 
The NFS Gateway uses the same settings that are used by the NameNode and
                    DataNode. Configure various properties based on your application's requirements: 


Edit the hdfs-site.xml file on your NFS Gateway
                            machine. 

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.accesstime.precision</name>
  <value>3600000</value>
  <description>
    The access time for HDFS file is precise up to this value. 
    The default value is 1 hour. Setting a value of 0 disables
    access times for HDFS.
  </description>
</property>
noteIf the export is mounted with access time update allowed, ensure
                                that this property is not disabled in the configuration file. Only
                                the NameNode needs to restart after this property is changed. If you
                                have disabled access time update by mounting with
                                    noatime, you do NOT have to change this
                                property nor restart your NameNode.



Add the value of the dfs.nfs3.dump.dir property in
                                hdfs-site.xml.

HDFS -> NFS Gateway -> Configuration -> search for "Temporary Dump Directory" and set the value as /tmp/.hdfs-nfs
noteThe NFS client often reorders writes. Sequential writes can arrive
                                at the NFS Gateway in a random order. This directory is used to
                                temporarily save out-of-order writes before writing to HDFS. Ensure
                                that the directory has enough space. For example, if the application
                                uploads 10 files with each having 100MB, it is recommended for this
                                directory to have 1GB space in case a write reorder happens to every
                                file.



Update the value of the dfs.nfs.exports.allowed.hosts
                            property in hdfs-site.xml as specified.

HDFS -> NFS Gateway -> Configuration -> search for "Allowed Hosts and Privileges" and set the value as 
* rw
noteBy default, the export can be mounted by any client. You must
                                update this property to control access. The value string contains
                                the machine name and access privilege, separated by whitespace
                                characters. The machine name can be in single host, wildcard, or
                                IPv4 network format. The access privilege uses rw
                                or ro to specify readwrite or
                                    readonly access to exports. If you do not
                                specify an access privilege, the default machine access to exports
                                is readonly. Separate machine entries by
                                    ;. For example, 192.168.0.0/22 rw ;
                                    host*.example.com ; host1.test.org ro;.



Restart the NFS Gateway.

Optional: 
Customize log settings by modifying the log4j.property
                            file.
To change the trace level, go to HDFS > NFS Gateway > Configuration >
                            search for "NFS Gateway Logging Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                            Valve)" and add the
                                    following:log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.nfs=DEBUG
To view more information about ONCRPC requests, add the
                                    following:log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.oncrpc=DEBUG



Specify JVM heap space (HADOOP_NFS3_OPTS) for the NFS
                    Gateway. 
You can increase the JVM heap allocation for the NFS Gateway using this
                    option. To set this option, go to HDFS > NFS Gateway > Configuration > search
                    for "Java Heap Size of NFS Gateway in Bytes" and enter the value.
                            :export
                        HADOOP_NFS3_OPTS=<memory-setting(s)>
The following example specifies a 2GB process heap (2GB starting size and
                    2GB
                    maximum):export HADOOP_NFS3_OPTS="-Xms2048m -Xmx2048m"

To improve the performance of large file transfers, you can increase the values
                    of the dfs.nfs.rtmax and dfs.nfs.wtmax
                    properties.
These properties are configuration settings on the NFS Gateway server that
                    change the maximum read and write request size supported by the Gateway. The
                    default value for both settings is 1MB.
