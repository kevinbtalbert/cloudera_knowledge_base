Configure mountable HDFS
CDP includes a FUSE (Filesystem in UserSpace) interface into HDFS. The
            hadoop-hdfs-fuse command enables you to use your HDFS cluster as if it
        were a traditional filesystem on Linux. 
You must have a working HDFS cluster and know the hostname
            and port that your NameNode exposes.

Set up and test your mount point depending on whether you have an HA or a
                    non-HA configuration.


To set up and test your mount point in a non-HA
                                installation:$ mkdir -p <mount_point>
$ hadoop-fuse-dfs dfs://<name_node_hostname>:<namenode_port> <mount_point>where
                                        namenode_port is the
                                NameNode's RPC port,
                                    dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address.
To set up and test your mount point in an HA
                            installation:mkdir -p <mount_point>
hadoop-fuse-dfs dfs://<nameservice_id> <mount_point>

where nameservice_id is the value
                                of fs.defaultFS. In this case the port defined for
                                    dfs.namenode.rpc-address.[nameservice ID].[name node
                                    ID] is used automatically.



You can now run operations as if they are on your mount point.note
To find its configuration directory, hadoop-fuse-dfs
                            uses the HADOOP_CONF_DIR configured at the time the
                                mount command is invoked.


Clean up your test mount by using the umount command.

umount <mount_point>


You can now add a permanent HDFS mount which persists
            through reboots.

Add HDFS system mountAfter installing hadoop-hdfs-fuse and configuring the test mount,         you can add a persistent HDFS system mount.Optimize mountable HDFSYou can consider certain recommendations to optimize the mountable HDFS.Parent topic: Optimizing performance
