Configure HDFS RPC protection
Set the hadoop.rpc.protection property to
            authentication in both the clusters between which you want to run
            distcp. You can modify the property either in
            hdfs-site.xml, or using Cloudera Manager.
This procedure explains how you can configure the
                hadoop.rpc.protection property using Cloudera Manager. You must
            perform the procedure on both the clusters.

Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.

Go to the HDFS service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select Scope > HDFS-1
                        (Service-Wide).

Select Category > Security.

Locate the Hadoop RPC Protection property and select
                        authentication.

Enter a Reason for Change and then click Save
                        Changes.
