Configure acceptable Kerberos principal patterns
If the source and destination realms are not configured to trust each
            other or do not have the same principal pattern, then you must set
        the dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal.pattern property to *
        and allow distcp irrespective of the principal patterns of the source and
        destination clusters.
You can modify the dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal.pattern
            property either in hdfs-site.xml, or using Cloudera Manager. This
            procedure explains the configuration using Cloudera Manager. You must perform the
            procedure on both the clusters.

Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.

Go to the HDFS service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select Scope > Gateway.

Select Category > Advanced.

Edit the HDFS Client Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                        for hdfs-site.xml property as specified.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal.pattern</name>
  <value>*</value>
</property>
