Kerberos setup guidelines for Distcp between secure clusters
There are specific guidelines to consider while setting up Kerberos on secure CDP
        clusters for successfully performing distcp between them.
The guidelines mentioned here are only applicable for the following example
                deployment:
You have two clusters, each in a different Kerberos realm
                        (SOURCE and DESTINATION in this
                    example)
You have data that needs to be copied from SOURCE to
                        DESTINATION

A Kerberos realm trust exists, either between SOURCE and
                        DESTINATION (in either direction), or between both
                        SOURCE and DESTINATION and a common third
                    realm (such as an Active Directory domain). 

If your environment matches the one described above, use the following table to configure
            Kerberos delegation tokens on your cluster so that you can successfully
                distcp across two secure clusters. Based on the direction of the
            trust between the SOURCE and DESTINATION clusters, you
            can use the mapreduce.job.hdfs-servers.token-renewal.exclude property
            to instruct ResourceManagers on either cluster to skip or perform delegation token
            renewal for NameNode hosts.
noteYou must use the mapreduce.job.hdfs-servers.token-renewal.exclude
            parameter if both clusters use the HDFS Transparent Encryption feature.

Kerberos Delegation Token Setting



SOURCE trusts
                                DESTINATION
Distcp job runs on the DESTINATION cluster
You do not need to set the
                                mapreduce.job.hdfs-servers.token-renewal.exclude
                            property. 


Distcp job runs on the SOURCE cluster
Set the
                                mapreduce.job.hdfs-servers.token-renewal.exclude
                            property to a comma-separated list of the hostnames of the NameNodes of
                            the DESTINATION cluster. 


DESTINATION trusts
                                SOURCE
Distcp job runs on the DESTINATION cluster
Set the
                                mapreduce.job.hdfs-servers.token-renewal.exclude
                            property to a comma-separated list of the hostnames of the NameNodes of
                            the SOURCE cluster.


Distcp job runs on the SOURCE cluster
You do not need to set the
                                mapreduce.job.hdfs-servers.token-renewal.exclude
                            property.


Both SOURCE and DESTINATION trust
                            each other
Set the
                                mapreduce.job.hdfs-servers.token-renewal.exclude
                            property to a comma-separated list of the hostnames of the NameNodes of
                            the DESTINATION cluster.


Neither SOURCE nor DESTINATION
                            trusts the other
If a common realm is usable (such as
                            Active Directory), set the
                                mapreduce.job.hdfs-servers.token-renewal.exclude
                            property to a comma-separated list of hostnames of the NameNodes of the
                            cluster that is not running the distcp job. For example, if you
                            are running the job on the DESTINATION cluster:
kinit on any DESTINATION YARN
                                    Gateway host using an AD account that can be used on both
                                        SOURCE and DESTINATION. 
Run the distcp job as the hadoop
                                        user:$ hadoop distcp -Ddfs.namenode.kerberos.principal.pattern=*  \
-Dmapreduce.job.hdfs-servers.token-renewal.exclude=SOURCE-nn-host1,SOURCE-nn-host2   \
hdfs://source-nn-nameservice/source/path    \
/destination/pathBy
                                        default, the YARN ResourceManager renews tokens for
                                        applications. The
                                            mapreduce.job.hdfs-servers.token-renewal.exclude
                                        property instructs ResourceManagers on either cluster to
                                        skip delegation token renewal for NameNode hosts.
