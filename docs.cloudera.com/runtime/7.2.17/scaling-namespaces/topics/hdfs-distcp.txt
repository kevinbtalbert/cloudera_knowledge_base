Using DistCpCloudera DocsUsing DistCp
The distributed copy command, distcp, is a general utility for copying large data
        sets between distributed filesystems within and across clusters. You can also use
            distcp to copy data to and from an Amazon S3 bucket. The
            distcp command submits a regular MapReduce job that performs a
        file-by-file copy.
To see the distcp command options, run the built-in help:
            hadoop distcp
important

Do not run distcp as the hdfs user which is
                    disallowed for MapReduce jobs by default.
Do not use Hadoop shell commands (such as
                        cp, copyfromlocal, put,
                        get) for large copying jobs or you may experience I/O
                    bottlenecks.
