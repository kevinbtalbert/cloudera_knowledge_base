Using ISA-L for Erasure Coding
Intel Intelligent Storage Acceleration Library (ISA-L) is an open-source collection of
    optimized low-level functions used for storage applications. The library can improve Erasure
    Coding performance when the Reed-Solomon (RS) codecs are used.

noteISA-L is not bundled with CDP. Therefore, the HDFS
        erasure coding falls back to the Java implementation which is much slower than the native
        implementation. To use ISA-L, you must manually install it on your cluster.

Run the commands as specified to install the isa-l library.


            $ yum install gcc make autoconf automake libtool yasm git nasm
            $ git clone https://github.com/01org/isa-l/
            $ cd isa-l/
            $ ./autogen.sh
            $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64
            $ make
            $ sudo make install


Verify NASM version and ISA-L 


Ensure NASM version is 2.11 or higher by running the command nasm -v.
Verify ISA-L is working by running the command hadoop checknative.
