Erasure coding CLI
      command
Use the hdfs ec command to set erasure coding policies on
      directories.

hdfs ec [generic options]
     [-setPolicy -path <path> [-policy <policyName>] [-replicate]]
     [-getPolicy -path <path>]
     [-unsetPolicy -path <path>]
     [-listPolicies]
     [-addPolicies -policyFile <file>]
     [-listCodecs]
     [-removePolicy -policy <policyName>]
     [-enablePolicy -policy <policyName>]
     [-disablePolicy -policy <policyName>]
     [-help [cmd ...]]
Options:

[-setPolicy [-p <policyName>] <path>]: Sets an EC policy
               on a directory at the specified path. The following EC policies are supported:
                  RS-3-2-1024k (Reed-Solomon with 3 data blocks, 2 parity blocks
               and 1024 KB cell size), RS-6-3-1024k,
                  RS-LEGACY-6-3-1024k, and
                     XOR-2-1-1024k.<path>: A directory in
                  HDFS. This is a mandatory parameter. Setting a policy only affects newly created
                  files, and does not affect existing
                     files.<policyName>: The EC policy to be used for
                  files under the specified directory. This is an optional parameter, specified
                  using the -p flag. If no policy is specified, the system default
                  Erasure Coding policy is used. The default policy is
                  RS-6-3-1024k.
-replicate: Forces a directory to use the default 3x replication
               scheme. noteYou cannot specify -replicate and -policy
                     <policyName> at the same time. Both the arguments are
                  optional.
-getPolicy -path <path>: Gets details of the EC policy of a file or
               directory for the specified path.
[-unsetPolicy -path <path>]: Removes an EC policy already set by
               a setPolicy on a directory. This option does not work on a directory
               that inherits the EC policy from a parent directory. If you run this option on a
               directory that does not have an explicit policy set, no error is returned.
[-addPolicies -policyFile <file>]: Adds a list of EC policies.
               HDFS allows you to add 64 policies in total, with the policy ID in the range of 64 to
               127. Adding policies fails if there are already 64 policies.
[-listCodecs]: Lists all the supported EC erasure coding codecs and
               coders in the system. 
[-removePolicy -policy <policyName>]: Removes an EC policy.
[-enablePolicy -policy <policyName>]: Enables an EC policy.
[-disablePolicy -policy <policyName>]: Disables an EC
               policy.
[-help]: Displays help for a given command, or for all commands if
               none is specified.

Erasure coding background recovery work on the DataNodes can be tuned using the
                following configuration parameters in hdfs-site.xml.



dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruction.stripedread.timeout.millis:
                  Timeout for striped reads. Default value is 5000 ms.



dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruction.threads: Number of threads used by
                  the DataNode for the background recovery task. The default value is 8 threads.



dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruction.stripedread.buffer.size: Buffer
                  size for reader service. Default value is 64 KB.


dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruction.xmits.weight: The relative weight
                  of xmits used by the EC background recovery task when compared to replicated block
                  recovery. The default value is 0.5.
If the parameter is set to 0, the EC task always has one xmit. The xmits of an
                  erasure coding recovery task are calculated as the maximum value between the
                  number of read streams and the number of write streams. For example, if an EC
                  recovery task needs to read from six nodes and write to two nodes, the xmit value
                  is max(6, 2) * 0.5 = 3.
