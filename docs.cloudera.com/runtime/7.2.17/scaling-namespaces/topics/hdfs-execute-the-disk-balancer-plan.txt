Run the Disk Balancer plan
For a DataNode, the HDFS Disk Balancer moves data according to the details specified
        in the JSON document generated as the Disk Balancer plan.
You must have generated the data movement plan for the
            DataNode.

Run the hdfs diskbalancer -execute command by specifying the
                    path to the JSON plan document.
hdfs diskbalancer -execute
                        /system/diskbalancer/<Creation_Timestamp>/nodename.plan.json
The command reads the DataNode's address from the JSON file and executes the
                        plan.
