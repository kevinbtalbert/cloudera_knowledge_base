Improving performance with
      short-circuit local reads
In HDFS, reads normally go through the DataNode. Thus, when a client asks the DataNode
      to read a file, the DataNode reads that file off of the disk and sends the data to the client
      over a TCP socket. "Short-circuit" reads bypass the DataNode, allowing the client to read the
      file directly. This is only possible in cases where the client is co-located with the data.
      Short-circuit reads provide a substantial performance boost to many applications.
Prerequisites for configuring short-ciruit local readsTo configure short-circuit local reads, you must enable         libhadoop.so.Properties for configuring short-circuit local reads on HDFSTo configure short-circuit local reads, you must add various properties to the          hdfs-site.xml file. Short-circuit local reads must be configured on both       the DataNode and the client.Parent topic: Optimizing performance
