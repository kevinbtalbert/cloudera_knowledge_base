Using Load Balancer with HttpFS
Configure the HttpFS Service to work with the load balancer that you configured for
        the service.

In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, navigate to Cluster > <HDFS service>.
On the Configuration tab, search for the following property:
                HttpFS Load Balancer

Enter the hostname and port for the load balancer in the following
                format:<hostname>:<port>
Save the changes.

noteWhen you set this property, Cloudera Manager regenerates the keytabs for HttpFS roles.
            The principal in these keytabs contains the load balancer hostname. If there is a Hue
            service that depends on this HDFS service, the Hue service has the option to use the
            load balancer as its HDFS Web Interface Role.
