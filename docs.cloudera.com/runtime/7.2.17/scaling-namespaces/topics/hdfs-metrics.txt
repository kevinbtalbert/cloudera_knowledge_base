HDFS MetricsCloudera Docs
HDFS Metrics
Many aggregate metrics are available in addition to base metrics. If an entity type has
    parents defined, you can formulate all possible aggregate metrics using the formula
        base_metric_across_parents.In addition, metrics for aggregate totals can be formed by adding the prefix
total_ to the front of the metric name.
Use the type-ahead feature in the Cloudera Manager chart browser to find the exact aggregate metric name,
in case the plural form does not end in "s".
For example, the following metric names may be valid for HDFS:

alerts_rate_across_clusters


total_alerts_rate_across_clusters

Some metrics, such as alerts_rate, apply to nearly every metric context. Others only apply to a
certain service or role.
