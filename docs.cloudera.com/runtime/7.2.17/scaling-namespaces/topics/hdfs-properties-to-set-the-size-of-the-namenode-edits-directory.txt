Properties to set the size
      of the NameNode edits directory
You can configure the dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained and
         dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained properties to control the size of
      the directory that holds the NameNode edits directory.




dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained: The number of image
                  checkpoint files that are retained in storage directories. All edit logs necessary
                  to recover an up-to-date namespace from the oldest retained checkpoint are also
                  retained.



dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained: The number of extra
                  transactions that should be retained beyond what is minimally necessary for a
                  NameNode restart. This can be useful for audit purposes, or for an HA setup where
                  a remote Standby Node may have been offline for some time and require a longer
                  backlog of retained edits in order to start again.
