Recommended settings for
      G1GC
The recommended settings for configuring Garbage First Garbage Collector (G1GC)
      include allocating more Java heap space when compared to the Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) GC,
      and setting specific values for properties such as MaxGCPauseMillis and
         ParallelGCThreads.
The following NameNode
         settings are recommended for G1GC in a large cluster:


Approximately 10% more Java heap space (-XX:Xms and
                  -XX:Xmx) should be allocated to the NameNode, as compared to CMS
                  setup.noteDo not configure G1GC if the NameNode heap size is greater than 64
                  GB.


For large clusters (>50M files), MaxGCPauseMillis should be set
               to 4000.


You should set ParallelGCThreads to 20 (default for a 32-core
               machine), as opposed to 8 for CMS.


Other G1GC parameters should be left set to their default values.
