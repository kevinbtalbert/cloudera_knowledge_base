Set up SSD storage using Cloudera Manager
You can use Cloudera Manager to set up SSD storage for your data
        directories.

Set up your cluster normally, but customize your DataNodes with the [ssd]
                    prefix for data directories.
Adding [ssd] can also be done after initial setup (which requires an extra
                    HDFS restart).

Stop HBase.

Using the HDFS client, move /hbase to
                        /hbase_backup.

Re-create /hbase using the Cloudera Manager command in the
                    HBase service (this ensures that proper permissions are used).

Using the HDFS client, set the storage policy for /hbase to be
                    SSD only.

Use the DistCp to copy /hbase_backup to
                        /hbase.

hadoop distcp /hbase_backup /hbase


Start HBase.
