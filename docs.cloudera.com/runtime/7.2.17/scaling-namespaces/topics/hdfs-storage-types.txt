HDFS storage types
The storage type associated with HDFS identifies the underlying storage media. 
HDFS supports the following storage types:
ARCHIVE - Archival storage is for very dense storage and is useful for rarely
                  accessed data. This storage type is typically cheaper per TB than normal hard
                  disks.
DISK - Hard disk drives are relatively inexpensive and provide sequential I/O
                  performance. This is the default storage type.
SSD - Solid state drives are useful for storing hot data and I/O-intensive
                  applications.
RAM_DISK - This special in-memory storage type is used to accelerate
                  low-durability, single-replica writes.
When you add the DataNode Data Directory, you can specify which type of storage it
            uses, by prefixing the path with the storage type, in brackets. If you do not specify a
            storage type, it is assumed to be DISK.
