LAZY_PERSIST memory storage
      policy
Use the LAZY_PERSIST storage policy to store data blocks on the configured DataNode
      memory.
For LAZY_PERSIST, the first replica is stored on RAM_DISK (DataNode memory), and
                the remaining replicas are stored on DISK. The fallback storage for both creation
                and replication is DISK.
The following table summarizes these replication policies:
