Verify validity of the NFS services
After starting the NFS services on the Gateway, you must verify whether all the
        services are running. Additionally, you must ensure that the HDFS namespace is exported and
        can be mounted.

Run the rpcinfo command to verify whether all the NFS
                    services are running.
rpcinfo -p $nfs_server_ipThe command returns an output
                        similar to the following:
                        
    program vers proto   port
    100005    1   tcp   4242  mountd
    100005    2   udp   4242  mountd
    100005    2   tcp   4242  mountd
    100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
    100005    3   udp   4242  mountd
    100005    1   udp   4242  mountd
    100003    3   tcp   2049  nfs
    100005    3   tcp   4242  mountd

Verify that the HDFS namespace is exported and can be mounted.
showmount -e $nfs_server_ipThe command returns an exports
                        list similar to the following:Exports list on
                        $nfs_server_ip : / (everyone)
