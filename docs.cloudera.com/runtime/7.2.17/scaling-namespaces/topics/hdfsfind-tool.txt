Using HdfsFindTool to find files
HDFSFindTool is essentially the HDFS version of the Linux filesystem
            find command. You can use the tool to search one or more HDFS directory
        trees, find all HDFS files that match the specified expression, and apply selected actions
        to them.

noteHDFSFindtool is not available for download with CDP. If you have the
                required paywall credentials to access the CDH archives, you can download the JAR
                file for HDFSFindtool and use it.


Downloading Hdfsfindtool from the CDH archivesIf you have access to CDH credentials and want to use HDFSFindtool with your CDP         deployment, then you can download the tool from the archives.
