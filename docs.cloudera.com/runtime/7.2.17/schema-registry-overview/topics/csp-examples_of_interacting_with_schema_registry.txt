Examples of interacting
      with Schema Registry
Learn about different ways of  interacting with Schema Registry.
Schema Registry UI
You can use the Schema Registry UI to create schema groups, schema metadata, and add
            schema versions. 



Schema Registry API
You can access the Schema Registry API swagger directly from the UI.
To do this, you need to append your URL with /swagger/. For example:
               https://localhost:7790/swagger/.
For example, you can create a schema by using Swagger, as shown in the following
            steps:


Navigate to the Swagger UI:
                     http:<sr-host>:<sr-port>/swagger/
Go to the Schema section and open POST
                     /api/v1/schemaregistry/schemas.
Click Try it out.
Enter the input for your schema in the body field.There
                     is already an example input in the body. You can also edit it.
Click Execute.After the successful execution of the
                     command, you see the newly created schema in you Schema Registry UI


For more information about the tasks you can perform through Swagger, see Cloudera Schema Registry REST API
            Reference.

Java client
You can review the following GitHub repositories for examples of how to interact with
            the Schema Registry Java client:

https://github.com/hortonworks/registry/blob/0.9.0/examples/schema-registry/avro/src/main/java/com/hortonworks/registries/schemaregistry/examples/avro/SampleSchemaRegistryClientApp.java




Java and Scala
See the following examples of using schema related API:
https://github.com/hortonworks/registry/blob/HDF-3.4.1.0-5-tag/examples/schema-registry/avro/src/main/java/com/hortonworks/registries/schemaregistry/examples/avro/SampleSchemaRegistryClientApp.java
https://github.com/hortonworks/registry/blob/HDF-2.1.0.0/schema-registry/README.md

Kafka SerDes
See the following example of using the Schema Registry Kafka SerDes:
https://github.com/hortonworks/registry/blob/0.9.0/examples/schema-registry/avro/src/main/java/com/hortonworks/registries/schemaregistry/examples/avro/KafkaAvroSerDesApp.java

Schema Registry also supports serializing objects as JSON. To enable JSON
            serialization or deserialization, set the following properties:
value.serializer=com.hortonworks.registries.schemaregistry.serdes.json.kafka.KafkaJsonSerial
value.deserializer=com.hortonworks.registries.schemaregistry.serdes.json.kafka.KafkaJsonDeserializer

Jackson 2 is used for serialization, so any Java object which can be processed with this
            library is also going to be processed by Schema Registry.

.NET client
