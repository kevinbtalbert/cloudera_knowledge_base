Schema Registry
    overview
Learn about the basic features of Schema Registry and how it integrates into Cloudera
    Streams Processing.
Schema Registry provides a shared repository of schemas that allows applications to flexibly
      interact with each other.
As displayed in the following diagram, Schema Registry is part of the enterprise services
      that power streams processing.


Applications built often need a way to share metadata across three dimensions:

Data format
Schema
Semantics or meaning of the data

The Schema Registry design principle is to provide a way to tackle the challenges of managing
      and sharing schemas between components. The schemas are designed to support evolution such
      that a consumer and producer can understand different versions of those schemas but still read
      all information shared between both versions and safely ignore the rest.
Hence, the value that Schema Registry provides and the applications that integrate with it
      are the following:

Centralized registry
Provide reusable schema to avoid attaching schema to every piece of data


Version management
Define relationship between schema versions so that consumers and producers can evolve
            at different rates


Schema validation
Enable generic format conversion, generic routing and data quality
