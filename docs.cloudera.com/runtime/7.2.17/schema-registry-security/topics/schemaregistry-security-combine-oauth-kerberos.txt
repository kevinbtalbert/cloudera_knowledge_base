Authentication using OAuth2 with Kerberos
It is possible to have both Kerberos and OAuth2 enabled at the same time for Schema
  Registry.
OAuth2 is added as yet another authentication layer to Schema Registry. It is
   possible to have both Kerberos and OAuth2 enabled at the same time. In this scenario, if either
   one of them succeeds in authenticating the client, the client is given a pass.
This setup can be useful for cases when you have different services communicating
   with Schema Registry and some of them use Kerberos while others rely on OAuth2.
