Schema Registry authorization through Ranger access policies
User and group access to various Schema Registry functions is controlled through Apache
  Ranger. 
Predefined
   access policies for Schema Registry allow the administrator to quickly add a user or user group
   to specify: 
Who can add or evolve schemas to a schema metadata.
Who can view and edit schemas within a schema metadata.
Who can upload the SerDes JAR files.

If a higher level of granularity is necessary, the administrator can create an access
   policy and add the user or user group to this custom policy.
