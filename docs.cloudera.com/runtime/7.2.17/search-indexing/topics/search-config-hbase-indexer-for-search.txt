Lily HBase near real time indexing using Morphlines
You can use the Lily HBase Indexer for near real time (NRT) indexing updates to HBase
      tables.
The Lily HBase NRT Indexer service is a flexible, scalable, fault-tolerant, transactional,
         NRT system for processing a continuous stream of HBase cell updates into live search
         indexes. Typically it takes seconds for data ingested into HBase to appear in search
         results; this duration is tunable. The Lily HBase Indexer uses SolrCloud to index data
         stored in HBase. As HBase applies inserts, updates, and deletes to HBase table cells, the
         indexer keeps Solr consistent with the HBase table contents, using standard HBase
         replication. The indexer supports flexible custom application-specific rules to extract,
         transform, and load HBase data into Solr. Solr search results can contain
            columnFamily:qualifier links back to the data stored in HBase. This
         way, applications can use the Search result set to directly access matching raw HBase
         cells. Indexing and searching do not affect operational stability or write throughput of
         HBase because the indexing and searching processes are separate and asynchronous to
         HBase.
To accommodate the HBase ingest load, you can run as many Lily HBase Indexer services on
      different hosts as required. Because the indexing work is shared by all indexers, you can
      scale the service by adding more indexers. The recommended number of indexer is 1 for each
      HBase RegionServer but in a High Availability environment five worker nodes is the minimum for
      acceptable performance and reliability. You can co-locate Lily HBase Indexer services with
      Solr servers on the same set of hosts. RegionServers can also be co-locate with Lily HBase
      Indexer on the same host to improve performance.
noteSpecific workloads and usage patterns might require additional fine-tuning beyond these
         general recommendations.
The Lily HBase NRT Indexer service must be deployed in an environment
      with a running HBase cluster, a running SolrCloud cluster (the
        Solr service in Cloudera Manager), and at least
      one ZooKeeper quorum.

Enable cluster-wide HBase replicationThe Lily HBase Indexer is implemented using HBase replication, presenting indexers as       RegionServers of the worker cluster. This requires HBase replication on the HBase cluster, as       well as the individual tables to be indexed. Adding the Lily HBase indexer serviceIn Cloudera Manager, the Lily HBase Indexer service is called Key-Value          Store Indexer, and the service role is called Lily HBase          Indexer.Starting the Lily HBase NRT indexer serviceUse Cloudera Manager to start the Lily HBase indexer service.Using the Lily HBase NRT indexer serviceConfiguring Lily HBase Indexer Security
