Enable cluster-wide HBase replication
The Lily HBase Indexer is implemented using HBase replication, presenting indexers as
      RegionServers of the worker cluster. This requires HBase replication on the HBase cluster, as
      well as the individual tables to be indexed. 

To enable replication:
Go to HBase
              service > Configuration > Category > Backup
Select the Enable Replication checkbox.Set Replication Source Ratio to
            1.Set Replication Batch Size to
            1000.Click Save Changes.Restart the HBase service (HBase
              service > Actions > Restart).
