Enable replication on HBase column families


Ensure that cluster-wide HBase replication is enabled, as described in Lily HBase near real time indexing using Morphlines. Use the HBase
        shell to define column-family replication settings.


For every existing table, set the REPLICATION_SCOPE on every column
          family that you want to index:

hbase shell
hbase shell> disable 'sample_table'
hbase shell> alter 'sample_table', {NAME => 'columnfamily1', REPLICATION_SCOPE => 1}
hbase shell> enable 'sample_table'


For every new table, set the REPLICATION_SCOPE on every column family
          that you want to index using a command such as the following:

hbase shell
hbase shell> create 'test_table', {NAME => 'testcolumnfamily', REPLICATION_SCOPE => 1}
