Indexing data using Morphlines

There are generally two approaches to indexing data using Cloudera
      Search:

Near real time (NRT) indexing
Batch indexing

Near real time indexing is generally used when new data needs to be
      returned in query results in time frames measured in seconds, whereas
      batch indexing is useful for situations where large amounts of data is
      indexed at regular intervals, or for indexing a new dataset for the first
      time.
Near real time indexing generally uses a framework such as Apache Kafka to continuously
      ingest and index data. The Lily HBase Indexer can also be used for NRT indexing on Apache
      HBase tables.
Batch indexing usually relies on MapReduce/YARN jobs to periodically
      index large datasets. The Lily HBase Indexer can also be used for batch
      indexing HBase tables.
