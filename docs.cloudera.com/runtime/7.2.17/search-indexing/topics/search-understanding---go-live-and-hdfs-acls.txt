Understanding --go-live and HDFS ACLs

When run with a reduce phase, as opposed to as a mapper-only job, the
      indexer creates an offline index on HDFS in the output directory specified
      by the --output-dir parameter. If the
        --go-live parameter is specified, Solr merges the
      resulting offline index into the live running service. Thus, the Solr
      service must have read access to the contents of the output directory in
      order to complete the --go-live step. If
        --overwrite-output-dir is specified, the indexer
      deletes and recreates any existing output directory; in an environment
      with restrictive permissions, such as one with an HDFS umask of 077, the
      Solr user may not be able to read the contents of the newly created
      directory. To address this issue, the indexer automatically applies the
      HDFS ACLs to enable Solr to read the output directory contents. These ACLs
      are only applied if HDFS ACLs are enabled on the HDFS NameNode.
The indexer only makes ACL updates to the output directory and its
        contents. If the output directory's parent directories do not include
        the execute permission, the Solr service cannot access
        the output directory. Solr must have execute
        permissions from standard permissions or ACLs on the parent directories
        of the output directory.
