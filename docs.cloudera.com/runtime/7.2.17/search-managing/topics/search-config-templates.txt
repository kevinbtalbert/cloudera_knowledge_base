Cloudera Search config templates
Config templates are immutable configuration templates that you can use as a starting
      point when creating configs for Solr collections. Cloudera Search contains templates by
      default and you can define new ones based on existing configs.
Configs can be declared as immutable, which means they
        cannot be deleted or have their Schema updated by the Schema API.
        Immutable configs are uneditable config templates that are the basis for
        additional configs. After a config is made immutable, you cannot change
        it back without accessing ZooKeeper directly as the
          solr (or solr@EXAMPLE.COM principal,
        if you are using Kerberos) super user.
Solr provides a set of immutable config templates. These templates are
        only available after Solr initialization, so templates are not available
        in upgrades until after Solr is initialized or re-initialized. Templates
        include:

managedTemplate

schemalessTemplate
Yes 
Yes 


note
schemalessTemplate is the same as the template
        generated by the solrctl instancedir --generate
        command.
Config templates are managed using the solrctl config
        command. For example:

To create a new config based on the managedTemplate
            template:solrctl config --create [***NEW CONFIG***] managedTemplate -p immutable=falseReplace
                  [***NEW CONFIG***] with the name of the config
            you want to create.
To create a new template (immutable config) from an existing
            config:solrctl config --create [***NEW TEMPLATE***] [***EXISTING CONFIG***] -p immutable=true
            Replace [***NEW TEMPLATE***] with a name for the new
            template you want to create and [***EXISTING
               CONFIG***] with the name of the existing config that you want to
            base [***NEW TEMPLATE***] on.
