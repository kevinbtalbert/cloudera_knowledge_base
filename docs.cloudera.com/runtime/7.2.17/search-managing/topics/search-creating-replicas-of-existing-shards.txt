Creating a replica of an existing shard
You can create additional replicas of existing shards using the
      solrctl utility. Replicating shards boosts query throughput and prevents data
    loss.

To create additional replicas of existing shards, use the following command:

solrctl core --create [***NEW CORE***] -p collection=[***COLLECTION NAME***] \
-p shard=[***SHARD TO REPLICATE***]


For example, to create a new replica of the collection named
              collection1 that is comprised of shard1, use the
            following command:
solrctl core --create collection1_shard1_replica2 \
-p collection=collection1 -p shard=shard1
