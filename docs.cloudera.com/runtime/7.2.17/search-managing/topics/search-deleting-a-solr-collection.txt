Deleting a collection
Deleting a Solr collection deletes the collection and its index, but does not delete
    its configuration files.
If you have enabled Ranger for authorization, you must have
        Solr Admin permission to be able to delete collections.
If you are using Kerberos, kinit as a user with permission to delete the
          collection:  

kinit solradmin@[***EXAMPLE.COM***]
Replace [***EXAMPLE.COM***] with your Kerberos
                        realm name.
On a host running Solr Server, make sure that the SOLR_ZK_ENSEMBLE environment
          variable is set in /etc/solr/conf/solr-env.sh. For example:  

$ cat /etc/solr/conf/solr-env.sh
export SOLR_ZK_ENSEMBLE=zk01.example.com:2181,zk02.example.com:2181,zk03.example.com:2181/solr
If you are using Cloudera Manager, this is automatically set on hosts with a
              Solr Server or Gateway role.
Delete the collection: 
solrctl collection --delete [***COLLECTION NAME***]Replace
              [***COLLECTION NAME***] with the name of the
          collection you want to delete.
