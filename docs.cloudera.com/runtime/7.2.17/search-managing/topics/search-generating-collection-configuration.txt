Generating Solr collection configuration using instance directories
You must create a collection configuration prior to creating a Solr collection. The
    configuration files for a Solr collection are stored in a directory called instance directories.
    Learn how to create the directory and make it available to Solr by uploading the contents to
    Zookeeper. 

note
If you want to control access to configuration sets, you must enable ZooKeeper ACLs and
          use configs instead.

importantAlthough you can create a collection directly in
          /var/lib/solr, Cloudera recommends using the solrctl
        utility instead.

In this case, configuration files for a collection are contained in a directory called
      an instance directory. An instance directory is a named set of
      configuration files. You can generate an instance directory template locally, edit the
      configuration, and then upload the directory to ZooKeeper as a named configuration set. You
      can then reference this named configuration set when creating a collection.

If you are using Kerberos, kinit as a user with permission to create
          the collection configuration: 

kinit solradmin@[***EXAMPLE.COM***]
Replace [***EXAMPLE.COM***] with your Kerberos
            realm name.


To generate a template instance directory, run the following command:

solrctl instancedir --generate $HOME/solr_configs


Customize the collection by directly editing the solrconfig.xml and
            schema.xml files created in
          $HOME/solr_configs/conf.

After completing the configuration, make it available to Solr by running the following
          command, which uploads the contents of the instance directory to ZooKeeper: 

solrctl config --upload [***COLLECTION_NAME***] $HOME/solr_configs

For
          example:solrctl config --upload weblogs $HOME/solr_configs

Use the solrctl utility to verify that your instance directory
          uploaded successfully and is available to ZooKeeper. List the uploaded instance
          directories as follows:

solrctl instancedir --list


If you used the --create command to create a collection named
              weblogs, the --list command returns
              weblogs.
