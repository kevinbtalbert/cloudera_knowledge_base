Managing collections in Search
A collection in Cloudera Search refers to a repository for indexing and querying
      documents. Collections typically contain the same types of documents with similar
      schemas.
To start using Solr and indexing data, you must configure a collection to hold the
         index.
 A collection requires the following configuration files:

solrconfig.xml


schema.xml

Any additional files referenced in the xml files
The solrconfig.xml file contains all of the Solr settings for a given
         collection, and the schema.xml file specifies the schema that Solr uses
         when indexing documents. For more details on how to configure a collection, see
            SchemaXml.
A typical deployment workflow with solrctl consists of: 
Establishing a configuration.
If using configs, creating a config object from a template.
If using instance directories, generating an instance directory and uploading
                     it to ZooKeeper. 

Creating a collection associated with the name of the config or instance
               directory.

Collections are managed using the solrctl commandline utility.
