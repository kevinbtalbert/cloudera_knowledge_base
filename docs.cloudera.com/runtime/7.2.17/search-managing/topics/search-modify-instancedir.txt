Modifying a collection configuration generated using an instance directory
The configuration files for a Solr collection are stored in a directory called
        instance directories. Learn how to modify the directory and make it available to Solr by
        uploading the contents to ZooKeeper. 
In this case, configuration files for a collection are
            contained in a directory called an instance directory. An
            instance directory is a named set of configuration files. You can download and edit the
            configuration locally and then upload the directory to ZooKeeper as a named
            configuration set. If your instance directory is already referenced by a collection,
            make sure to reload it for configuration changes to take effect.

If you are using Kerberos, kinit as a user with permission to
                    create the collection configuration: 

kinit solradmin@[***EXAMPLE.COM***]
Replace [***EXAMPLE.COM***] with your
                        Kerberos realm name.


To download a template instance directory, run the following command:

solrctl instancedir --get $HOME/solr_configs


Customize the collection by directly editing the
                        solrconfig.xml and schema.xml files.

After completing the configuration, make it available to Solr by running the
                    following command, which uploads the contents of the instance directory to
                    ZooKeeper: 

solrctl config --upload [***COLLECTION_NAME***] $HOME/solr_configs

For
                    example:solrctl config --upload weblogs $HOME/solr_configs

Use the solrctl utility to verify that your instance directory
                    uploaded successfully and is available to ZooKeeper. List the uploaded instance
                    directories as follows:

solrctl instancedir --list


If you used the --create command to create a collection
                        named weblogs, the --list command returns
                            weblogs.


After uploading the updated collection configuration. you need to reload every
                    collection referencing that instancce directory for the updates to take
                    effect.

solrctl collection --reload [***COLLECTION_NAME***]
