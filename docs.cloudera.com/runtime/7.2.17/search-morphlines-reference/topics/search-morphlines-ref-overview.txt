Morphline commands overview
Morphlines provides a set of frequently-used high-level transformation and I/O commands
    that can be combined in application specific ways. This is a short description of each available
    command and a link to the complete documentation.

split

Divides a string into substrings, by recognizing a separator (a.k.a.
