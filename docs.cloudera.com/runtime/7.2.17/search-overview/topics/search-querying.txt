Querying
After data is available as an index, you can run queries against it.
The query API provided by the Search service allows direct queries to be completed or to be
         facilitated through a command-line tool or graphical interface. Hue includes a simple
         GUI-based Search application, or you can create a custom application based on the standard
         Solr API. Any application that works with Solr is compatible and runs as a search-serving
         application for Cloudera Search because Solr is at its core.
