Enable LDAP authentication in Solr
You can configure LDAP-based authentication using Cloudera Manager at the Solr
        service level.

noteDepending on how your environment is set up, you may have
                issues with DNS resolution. You can avoid it by using IP addresses instead of
                hostnames. 


 Solr supports LDAP authentication for external Solr clients including:
Command-line tools
curl
Web browsers
Solr Java clients

In some cases, Solr does not support LDAP authentication. Use Kerberos authentication
                instead in these cases. Solr does not support LDAP authentication with:
Search indexing components including the MapReduce indexer and Lily HBase
                        indexer.
Solr internal requests such as those for replication or querying.
Hadoop delegation token management requests such as
                            GETDELEGATIONTOKEN or
                            RENEWDELEGATIONTOKEN.




Configuring LDAP authentication requires that Kerberos authentication is already
                    configured and enabled in Solr.
For secure LDAP connections, it is a prerequisite that TLS/SSL has been
                    configured and enabled in  Solr.



In Cloudera Manager select the Solr service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Select Scope > Solr.

Select Category > Security.

Select Enable LDAP Authentication.

Enter the LDAP URL in the LDAP URL property.
To configure a TLS encrypted LDAP connection, select one of the following
                        options:
ldaps://<ldap_server>:<port>The
                                default port is 636.
OR

ldap://<ldap_server>:<port>

The default port is 389.
Select Enable LDAP TLS. This is not required
                                when using an LDAP URL with prefix
                                    ldaps://, because that already specifies
                                TLS.


To configure LDAP with unencrypted transmission of usernames and passwords,
                    set  ldap://<ldap_server>:<port>, without setting
                        Enable LDAP TLS.

Configure only one of following mutually exclusive parameters:

LDAP BaseDN: Replaces the username with a
                        "distinguished name" (DN) of the form:
                            uid=userid,ldap_baseDN. Typically used for OpenLDAP
                        server installation.
Active Directory Domain: Replaces the username
                        with a string username@ldap_domain. Typically used for
                        Active Directory server installation.


Launch the Stale Configuration wizard to restart the
                    Solr service and any dependent services.
