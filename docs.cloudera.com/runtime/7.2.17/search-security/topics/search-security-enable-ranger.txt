Manage Ranger authorization in Solr
Using Cloudera Manager, you can turn on and off Ranger authorization for your Solr
        service.

Ranger restrictions are consistently applied regardless of the way users attempt to
                complete actions. For example, restricting access to data in a collection
                consistently restricts that access, whether queries come from the command line, from
                a browser, or through the admin console.


In Cloudera Manager select the Solr service.

Select Configuration and find the RANGER
                        Service property.

To turn on Ranger authorization, select the Ranger service that you want the
                    Solr service to depend on. To turn off Ranger authorization, unselect the Ranger
                    service.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Solr service.


Ranger authorization for Solr is enabled. The Solr service depends on the selected
                Ranger service for authorization.
