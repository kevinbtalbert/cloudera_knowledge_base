Index sample data
Cloudera Search includes sample data for testing and validation. Run the relevant
    command to index this data for searching. Replace search01.example.com in the example below with the name of any
      host running the Solr Server process.noteThe default static
                port 8985 in the examples is only valid when you access the host
                from within the Data Hub cluster. When you want to access the Solr server from
                outside the cluster, you need address it via the cdp-proxy-api endpoint. To find out
                the URL of the Solr server, navigate to the Data Hub Clusters
                service, or to Management Console > Data Hub Clusters, and click on the tile representing your cluster. This brings you to
                the cluster details page where the URLs to cluster UIs and endpoints are listed.
                Select the Endpoints tab to find the service endpoint
                    URLs.For more information, see Accessing Cloudera Manager, cluster UIs, and
                        endpoints.

SSH to a Solr host.

Run the following command:
cd /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/share/doc/solr-doc*/example/exampledocs
                     find *.xml -exec curl -i -k --negotiate -u: https://search01.example.com:8985/solr/test_collection/update -H "Content-Type: text/xml" --data-binary @{} \;
