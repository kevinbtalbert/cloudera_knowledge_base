Query sample data
Run a query to verify that the sample data is successfully indexed and that you are
    able to search it.

noteThe default static
                port 8985 in the examples is only valid when you access the host
                from within the Data Hub cluster. When you want to access the Solr server from
                outside the cluster, you need address it via the cdp-proxy-api endpoint. To find out
                the URL of the Solr server, navigate to the Data Hub Clusters
                service, or to Management Console > Data Hub Clusters, and click on the tile representing your cluster. This brings you to
                the cluster details page where the URLs to cluster UIs and endpoints are listed.
                Select the Endpoints tab to find the service endpoint
                    URLs.For more information, see Accessing Cloudera Manager, cluster UIs, and
                        endpoints.

SSH into a cluster node.

Open the Solr admin web interface in a browser.
https://search01.example.com:8985/solr
Replace search01.example.com with the name of any host running the
          Solr Server process. If you have security enabled on your cluster, enter the credentials
          for the Kerberos principal when prompted.
