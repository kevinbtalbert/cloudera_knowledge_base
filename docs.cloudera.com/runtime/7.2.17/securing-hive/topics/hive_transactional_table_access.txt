Transactional table access
As administrator, you must enable the Apache Ranger service to authorize users who want
  to work with transactional tables. These types of tables are the default, ACID-compliant tables in
  Hive 3 and later.
ACID tables reside by default in /warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive. Only
   the Hive service can own and interact with files in this directory. Ranger is the only available
   authorization mechanism that Cloudera recommends for ACID tables.
