Assigning superuser status to an LDAP user
The Hue User Admin application provides two levels of privileges: users and superusers.
    The superusers have administrative privileges.

Users can change their name, email address, and password. They can log in to Hue
        and run Hue applications according to their group permissions.
Superusers can perform administrative functions such as:
Add and delete users and groups
Import and sync users and groups from an LDAP server
Assign group permissions
Promote users to superusers and vice versa.

Hue superusers have no special privileges to the underlying CDP cluster services.
        Ranger is used to add those privileges. 
importantOn a non-secure cluster, the first user to log in to Hue without LDAP
        authentication becomes the first superuser. 


In a secure cluster with LDAP deployed, there are three ways to assign
                  superuser status to a user:


With desktop.auth.backend.AllowAllBackend set for the
                Authentication Backend property in Cloudera Manager
              temporarily enabled, assign superuser status and synchronize one user to the LDAP
                server.
With desktop.auth.backend.LdapBackend set for the
                    Authentication Backend property in
                    Cloudera Manager, run a Hue shell command to apply superuser status.
Enable multiple backends so that the first user to log on still works when
                    integrated with LDAP.
