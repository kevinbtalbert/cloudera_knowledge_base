Authenticating Hue users with LDAPCloudera Docs
Authenticating Hue users with LDAP
Configuring Hue for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) enables you to
    import users and groups from a directory service,
    synchronize group membership manually or automatically at login,
    and authenticate with an LDAP server.
Hue supports Microsoft Active Directory (AD) and open standard LDAP such as OpenLDAP and
      Forgerock OpenDJ Directory Services.
Integrating Hue with LDAP
When Hue is integrated with LDAP, users can use their existing credentials to authenticate
        and inherit their existing groups transparently. There is no need to save or duplicate any
        employee password in Hue.
When authenticating using LDAP, Hue validates login credentials against an LDAP directory
        service if Hue is  configured with the LDAP authentication backend
          (desktop.auth.backend.LdapBackend) in Cloudera Manager.
The LDAP authentication backend automatically creates users that do not exist in Hue by
        default. Hue needs to import users to properly perform the authentication. Passwords are
        never imported when importing users. You can disable automatic import of users by setting
        the create_users_on_login property in the Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Hue service > Configuration >  Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
            hue_safety_valve.ini  field to
        false.[desktop] 
[[ldap]] 
create_users_on_login=false
The purpose of disabling the automatic import is to allow only a predefined list of
        manually imported users to login.

Preserving the case of the usernames
If you are using mixed case, upper case, or Camel case for usernames in your LDAP
        directory, then you must add the following configurations in Hue's Advanced Configuration
        Snippet ( Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
          hue_safety_valve.ini ), so that the user names are not over written in lower
        case in the Hue's database. Set the values of these properties to true or false depending on
        your requirement:[desktop]
[[auth]]
ignore_username_case=true
force_username_uppercase=true/false
force_username_lowercase=true/false
[[ldap]]
ignore_username_case=true
force_username_uppercase=true/false
force_username_lowercase=true/false

Binding Hue with LDAP
There are two ways to bind Hue with an LDAP directory service:

Search Bind
The search bind mechanism for authenticating will perform an ldapsearch against the
            directory service and bind using the found distinguished name (DN) and password
            provided. This is the default method of authentication used by Hue with LDAP.
You can restrict the search process by configuring the following two properties under
            the  Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
              hue_safety_valve.ini  [desktop] > [[ldap]] > [[[users]]] section.

Property
Description



user_filter
General LDAP filter to restrict the search. Default:
                        "objectclass=*"


user_name_attr
The attribute that will be considered the username to be searched
                      against. Typical attributes to search for include: uid, sAMAccountName.
                      Default: sAMAccountName


With the above configuration, the LDAP search filter takes the following
              form:(&(objectClass=*)(sAMAccountName=[***USERNAME-ENTERED-BY-USER***]))noteSetting
                search_bind_authentication=true tells Hue to perform an LDAP search
              using the bind credentials specified for the bind_dn and
                bind_password configuration properties. Hue will start searching
              the subtree starting from the base DN specified for the base_dn property. It will then
              search the base DN for an entry whose attribute, specified in
                user_name_attr, has the same value as the short name provided on
              login. The search filter, defined in user_filter will also be used to
              limit the search. 
Direct Bind
The direct bind mechanism for authenticating binds to the LDAP server using the
            username and password provided at login.
Hue authenticates (without searching) in one of two ways:
NT Domain (nt_domain): (Only for use with Microsoft Active
                Directory) Hue binds to the AD with username@domain using the User Principal Names
                (UPN) to bind to the LDAP service. This AD-specific property allows Hue to
                authenticate with AD without having to follow LDAP references to other partitions.
                This typically maps to the email address of the user or the user's ID in conjunction
                with the domain. Default: mycompany.com.
Username Pattern (ldap_username_pattern): Bind to open standard
                LDAP with full path of directory information tree (DIT). It provides a template for
                the DN that is ultimately sent to the directory service when authenticating. The
                  [***USERNAME***] parameter is replaced with the username provided
                at login.Default:
                  "uid=[***USERNAME***],ou=People,dc=mycompany,dc=com"
noteSetting search_bind_authentication=false tells Hue to
              perform a direct bind to LDAP using the credentials provided (not
                bind_dn and bind_password specified in the
              Advanced Configuration Snippet). There are two ways direct bind works depending on
              whether the nt_domain property is specified in the  Hue
                Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini
                :
nt_domain is specified: This is used to connect to an Active Directory service.
                  In this case, the UPN is used to perform a direct bind. Hue forms the UPN by
                  concatenating the short name provided at login with the
                  nt_domain. For example,
                    [***SHORT-NAME***]@[***NT-DOMAIN***]. The
                    ldap_username_pattern property is ignored.
nt_domain is not specified: This is used to connect to all other directory
                  services (can handle AD, but nt_domain is the preferred way for AD). In this case,
                    ldap_username_pattern is used and takes the following form:
                  cn=[***USERNAME-PROVIDED-AT-LOGIN***],dc=example,dc=com



noteUsername pattern does not work with AD because AD inserts spaces into the UID which Hue
        cannot process. 

Encryption
To prevent credentials from transmitting in the clear, encrypt with LDAP over SSL, using
        the LDAPS protocol on the LDAPS port, which uses port 636 by default. An alternative, is to
        encrypt with the StartTLS operation using the standard LDAP protocol, which uses port 389 by
        default. Cloudera recommends LDAPS. You must have a CA Certificate in either case.

Prerequisites
To authenticate Hue users with LDAP, you must have:
LDAP server
Bind account (or support for anonymous binds)
Cloudera Manager access with Full Administrator permissions
[optional] LDAP server with LDAPS or StartTLS encryption.

importantTo authenticate securely, configure your LDAP server with either LDAP
        over SSL (LDAPS) or StartTLS encryption. Both methods require a Certificate Authority (CA)
        chain in a .pem file.


Configuring authentication with LDAP and Search BindSearch Bind authentication executes ldapsearch against one or more     directory services and binds with the distinguished name (DN) and password. Hue searches the     subtree from the base distinguished name. If the LDAP Username Attribute is set, Hue looks for     an entry whose attribute has the same value as the short name given at login.Configuring authentication with LDAP and Direct BindTo authenticate with Direct Binding, Hue needs either the User Principal Name (UPN) for     Active Directory, or the full path to the LDAP user in the Directory Information Tree (DIT) for     open standard LDAP.Configuring Hue for authentication against multiple LDAP/Active Directory serversSome organizations have more than one LDAP or Active Directory (AD), and users in one         LDAP/AD may not be present in the other. Hue supports the ability to authenticate users         against multiple LDAP/AD servers.Testing the LDAP configurationYou can test your Hue LDAP configuration without restarting the Hue service. Add the       values and save your changes.Configuring group permissionsYou can configure permissions for members of groups on the       Groups tab of the Hue User Admin application.Enabling LDAP authentication with HiveServer2 and ImpalaLDAP authentication with HiveServer2 and Impala can be enabled by setting the     auth_username and auth_password properties under the [beeswax] section for Hive     and the [impala] section for Impala in a Cloudera Manager safety valve     configuration property.LDAP propertiesThese are the properties you can use to configure LDAP for Hue in Cloudera Manager or     in the hue.ini file for unmanaged clusters.Configuring LDAP on unmanaged clustersIf your clusters are not managed with Cloudera Manager, you must     manually set the LDAP configuration properties in the hue.ini file.Parent topic: User authentication in Hue
