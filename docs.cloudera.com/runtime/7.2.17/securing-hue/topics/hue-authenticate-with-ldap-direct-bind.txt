Configuring authentication with LDAP and Direct BindCloudera Docs
Configuring authentication with LDAP and Direct Bind
To authenticate with Direct Binding, Hue needs either the User Principal Name (UPN) for
    Active Directory, or the full path to the LDAP user in the Directory Information Tree (DIT) for
    open standard LDAP.

importantDirect binding only works with one
            domain. For multiple directories, use search bind.

To directly bind to an Active Directory/LDAP server with NT
            domain:


Log in to Cloudera Manager and click Hue.

Click the Configuration tab and filter by
              scope=Service-wide and
              category=Security.

Set the following LDAP properties:



Authentication
                        Backend
desktop.auth.backend.LdapBackend


LDAP URL


ldaps://<ldap_server>:636 if using Secure LDAP
ldap://<ldap_server>:389 if not using encryption

Note: If ldaps:// is specified in the LDAP URL, then do not set LDAP
                      TLS.



Enable LDAP TLS


TRUE if not using Secure LDAP (LDAPS) but want to
                        establish a secure connection using TLS
FALSE if using LDAPS or not encrypting




LDAP Server CA
                        Certificate
/path_to_certificate/cert.pem


LDAP Search Base
DC=mycompany,DC=com


LDAP Bind User Distinguished
                        Name
<username>
Only the username is required for Direct Bind. There is no need to
                      specify the domain.


LDAP Bind Password
bind_user_password


Active Directory Domain
<your NT domain>


Use Search Bind
                        Authentication
FALSE


Create LDAP users on
                        login
TRUE




Click Save Changes

Test your LDAP configuration, and when successful, click Restart
                Hue.

To directly bind to an open standard LDAP server with a username
                pattern:
Remove the value for the Active Directory Domain.
Set both LDAP Username Pattern and
                    LDAP Bind User Distinguished Name to a DN
                    string that represents the full path of the directory information
                    tree, from UID to top level domain. 

noteWhen using Direct Bind, set the LDAP Search Base
            property. This is not for authentication because you can log in to Hue without it, but
            to synchronize Hue with the LDAP server.
