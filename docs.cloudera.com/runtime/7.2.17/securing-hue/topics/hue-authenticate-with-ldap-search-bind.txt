Configuring authentication with LDAP and Search BindCloudera Docs
Configuring authentication with LDAP and Search Bind
Search Bind authentication executes ldapsearch against one or more
    directory services and binds with the distinguished name (DN) and password. Hue searches the
    subtree from the base distinguished name. If the LDAP Username Attribute is set, Hue looks for
    an entry whose attribute has the same value as the short name given at login.

importantSearch Binding works with all directory service types. It is also the only
          method that allows synchronizing groups at login (set with
            sync_groups_on_login in a safety-valve).

Log on to Cloudera Manager and click Hue.

Click the Configuration tab and filter by
              scope=Service-wide and
              category=Security.

Set the following required properties:



Authentication
                        Backend
desktop.auth.backend.LdapBackend


LDAP URL


ldaps://<ldap_server>:636 if using Secure LDAP
ldap://<ldap_server>:389 if not using encryption

Note: If ldaps:// is specified in the LDAP URL, then do not set LDAP
                      TLS.



Enable LDAP TLS


TRUE if not using Secure LDAP (LDAPS) but want to
                        establish a secure connection using TLS
FALSE if using LDAPS or not encrypting




LDAP Server CA
                        Certificate
/path_to_certificate/cert.pem


LDAP Search Base
DC=mycompany,DC=com


LDAP Bind User Distinguished
                        Name
username@domain


LDAP Bind Password
bind_user_password


Use Search Bind
                        Authentication
TRUE


Create LDAP users on
                        login
TRUE


noteTo encrypt with TLS, set LDAP
                URL to
                ldap://<ldap_server>:389 and check
                Enable LDAP TLS. For a proof of concept
                without encryption, use
                ldap://<ldap_server>:389, remove the value
                for LDAP Server CA Certificate, and uncheck Enable LDAP
                TLS.


You can optionally improve search performance with attributes
              and filters:



LDAP User Filter
objectclass=user (default = *)


LDAP Username
                        Attribute
sAMAccountName (AD default), uid (LDAP
                        default)


LDAP Group Filter
objectclass=group (default = *)


LDAP Group Name
                        Attribute
cn (default)


LDAP Group Membership
                        Attribute
member (default)


noteWith the user settings in the table above, the LDAP
                search filter has the form:
                (&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=<user
                  entered username>)).


Add any valid user and/or valid group to quickly test your LDAP
              configuration:



LDAP Username for Test LDAP
                        Configuration
Any valid user


LDAP Group Name for Test LDAP
                        Configuration
Any valid group




Click Save Changes.

Test your LDAP configuration, and when successful click Restart
              Hue.

noteThe syntax of Bind Distinguished Name differs per bind
                method:
Search Bind: username@domain
Direct Bind with NT Domain: username
Direct Bind with Username Pattern: DN string (full DIT
                    path)

Do not use if anonymous binding is supported. 

                You can test ldapsearch at the command line as follows:
                LDAPTLS_CACERT=/<path_to_cert>/<ca_certificate> ldapsearch -H ldaps://<ldap_server>:636 \
-D "<bind_dn>" -w <bind_password> -b <base_dn> "samaccountname=<user>"


noteTo run ldapsearch with a CA certificate, you
                  may need to install ldap_utils on Debian/Ubuntu and
                  openldap-clients on RHEL/CentOS.
