Configuring file and directory permissions for Hue
Per user home directories are created on HDFS when you create a new user in Hue,
        which the user can use to store and retrieve files using the Hue File Browser. You must
        either configure Hue to use the same permissions of the HDFS umask or use different
        permissions when a user creates files and directories from the Hue File Browser. It is
        recommended to define the home directory permissions before creating users in
        Hue.

When you set up CDP, you may have set a umask for all files and directories that
                would be created on HDFS using the fs.permissions.umask-mode
                parameter. The default HDFS umask is 0022. At this point, you can
                allow Hue to use the permisions as defined by HDFS umask or you can configure Hue to
                use a different set of permissions. This is controlled by the following two
                parameters in Hue: home_dir_permissions and
                        use_home_dir_permissions. The
                        use_home_dir_permissions parameter is set to true by
                default.
To allow Hue to create files and directories with permissions different than the HDFS
                umask, set the following in the Hue Service Advanced Configuration
                    Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini field in Cloudera
                Manager:[useradmin]
home_dir_permissions=[***HUE-FILE-DIR-PERMISSIONS***]
use_home_dir_permissions=true For
                example:[useradmin]
home_dir_permissions=0700
use_home_dir_permissions=true
To allow Hue to use the same file and directory permissions as the HDFS umask, set
                the following in the Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                    Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini field in Cloudera
                Manager:[useradmin]
use_home_dir_permissions=false
If you have not defined the home directory permissions in Hue by setting the value of
                the home_dir_permissions property in the Hue Advanced Configuration
                before creating users in Hue, then you can change the permissions for those users
                later to prevent unauthorized access.


SSH in to the Hue server host as an Administrator.

Run the following command to change the permission for a user:

hdfs dfs -chmod 700 /user/[***USERNAME***]
