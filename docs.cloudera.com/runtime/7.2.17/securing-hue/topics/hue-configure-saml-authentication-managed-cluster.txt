Configuring SAML authentication on managed clusters
To configure Hue for SAML authentication on managed clusters, you must add the
      SAML authentication properties to the Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet
        (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini in Cloudera Manager.

These instructions assume that you have an Identity
            Provider set up and running. You can use any identity provider of your choice. For
            example, Okta, Ping Identity, and OpenAM.


Log on to Cloudera Manager and go to
                Hue > Configuration.

In the search text box, enter hue_safety_valve.ini to
              locate the Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet
              (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini.

Enter the SAML parameters into the Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet
              (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini text box. For example:

## Example Settings using Open AM:
[desktop]
redirect_whitelist="^\/.*$,^https:\/\/idp.example.com:8080\/.*$"
[[auth]]
backend=libsaml.backend.SAML2Backend
[libsaml]
want_response_signed=True
want_assertions_signed=True
xmlsec_binary=/usr/bin/xmlsec1
metadata_file=/opt/cloudera/security/saml/idp-metadata.xml
key_file=/opt/cloudera/security/saml/host.key
cert_file=/opt/cloudera/security/saml/host.pem
key_file_password=Config(
  key="key_file_password",
  help=_t("key_file_password password of the private key"),
  default=None) ## If using encrypted private key
username_source=nameid
name_id_format="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified"
entity_id=[***HOST-BASE-NAME***]
logout_enabled=false

If you are using an encrypted private key file, then you must specify the password in
          the key_file_password property. Or you can use an unencrypted private key
            file.To create an unencrypted private key file from an encrypted key:
SSH into a terminal as a root user.
Change to the directory where you have stored the ssl certificate key.
Run the following
                command:openssl rsa -in ssl_certificate.key -out ssl_certificate-nocrypt.key
When prompted, enter the password that you use to access the
                  ssl_certificate.key file.The output file
                    (ssl_certificate-nocrypt.key) is an unencrypted PEM-formatted
                  key.


noteFor SLES distributions, the xmlsec binary may be located in
              /usr/local/bin/. If so:
Set xmlsec_binary=/usr/local/bin/xmlsec1 in the Hue
                  Service Advanced Configuration Snippet. 
Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/ in the
                  Hue Service Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet.
              



Go to Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
            hue_safety_valve.ini) and comment or remove any Knox-SSO configurations, if
          present.

cautionKnox-SSO and SAML are incompatible and mutually exclusive. Hue
            authetication may fail with a redirection loop if you have the Knox-SSO and SAML
            configurations present in the Hue Advanced Configuration Snippet at the same time, as it
            confuses the authentication redirect to the IdP and back to Hue.


Click Save Changes, then select,
              Actions > Restart
                Hue.
