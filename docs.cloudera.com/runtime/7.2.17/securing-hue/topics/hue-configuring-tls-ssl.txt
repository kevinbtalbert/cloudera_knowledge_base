Configuring TLS/SSL for HueCloudera Docs
Configuring TLS/SSL for Hue
You can independently enable TLS/SSL for Hue.
Cloudera recommends that your cluster and the Hue service use Kerberos for authentication. If
   you enable TLS/SSL for a cluster that has not been configured to use Kerberos, a warning is
   displayed. You should integrate the cluster with your Kerberos deployment before proceeding.

Creating a truststore file in PEM formatYou must create the Hue Truststore by consolidating certificates of all SSL-enabled     servers (or a single CA Certificate chain) that Hue communicates with into one file. This     generally includes certificates of all the Oozie, HDFS, MapReduce, and YARN daemons, and any     other SSL-enabled services. Configuring Hue as a TLS/SSL clientHue acts as a TLS/SSL client when communicating with other services, such as core    Hadoop, HBase, Oozie, and cloud providers like Amazon S3 or Azure.Enabling Hue as a TLS/SSL clientAfter you create a Hue truststore file in PEM format, you can configure Hue as a       TLS/SSL client by using Cloudera Manager.     Configuring Hue as a TLS/SSL serverHue and other Python-based services expect certificates and keys to be stored in PEM     (Privacy Enhanced Mail) format.Enabling Hue as a TLS/SSL server using Cloudera ManagerYou can use Cloudera Manager to enable TLS/SSL for the Hue server.     Enabling TLS/SSL for Hue Load BalancerTo configure the Hue Load Balancer to use HTTPS or operate as a TLS/SSL server, you         need a self-signed SSL certificate and a private key file. If the private key file is         password protected, then you must configure the Hue Load Balancer to use the corresponding         key password.Enabling TLS/SSL communication with HiveServer2For Hue to communicate with HiveServer2 using TLS/SSL, Hue needs the Hive certificate     and certificate chain.Enabling TLS/SSL communication with ImpalaFor Hue to communicate with Impala using TLS/SSL, Hue needs the Impala certificate and     certificate chain.Securing database connections with TLS/SSLHue uses different clients to communicate with each database internally. Client-specific     options, such as secure connectivity can be configured using Cloudera Manager.Disabling CA Certificate validation from HueBy default, Hue validates CA Certificates for Oozie, HTTPFS, Resource Manager, and         Job History Server when SSL is enabled for any of these services. If you have not enabled         TLS/SSL on your cluster, then you can disable Hue from validating the CA Certificates for         other services on your CDP cluster.
