Creating a group in Hue
By creating groups, you can club certain permissions that you want to assign to
        specific users in your organization.

Sign in to the Hue UI as a superuser.

Go to the Groups tab.
The Groups page displays the list of existing groups, if
                    any.

Click Add group.
