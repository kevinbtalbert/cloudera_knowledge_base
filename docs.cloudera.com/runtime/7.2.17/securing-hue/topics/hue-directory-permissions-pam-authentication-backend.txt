Directory permissions when using PAM authentication backend
If you are using Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) for authenticating
  Hue
  users, then ensure that the Hue users have access to the /etc/shadow directory.
  Use an approach suitable to your organization's security policies.
Making Hue application user a member of the shadow group
This approach involves creating a shadow group and adding
    Hue
    to this group. Then you must
    provide
    the shadow
    group,
    read access permission
    to the /etc/shadow directory.

Using Access Contol Lists (Recommended) 
You can use Linux's ACLs to permit
    Hue
    user a
    read
    access
    permission to the /etc/shadow directory by using the
     setfacl command. Cloudera recommends this approach.
