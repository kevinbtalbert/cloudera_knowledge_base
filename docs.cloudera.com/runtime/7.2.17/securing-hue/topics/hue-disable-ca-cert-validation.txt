Disabling CA Certificate validation from HueCloudera Docs
Disabling CA Certificate validation from Hue
By default, Hue validates CA Certificates for Oozie, HTTPFS, Resource Manager, and
        Job History Server when SSL is enabled for any of these services. If you have not enabled
        TLS/SSL on your cluster, then you can disable Hue from validating the CA Certificates for
        other services on your CDP cluster.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue > Configuration and add the following lines in the Hue Service
                        Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        hue_safety_valve.ini field:

[hadoop]
[[hdfs_clusters]]
[[[default]]]
ssl_cert_ca_verify = False #HTTPFS service
[[yarn_clusters]]
[[[default]]]
ssl_cert_ca_verify = False #Resource Manager/Job History Server
[[[ha]]]
ssl_cert_ca_verify = False #Resource Manager HA
[liboozie]
ssl_cert_ca_verify = False


Click Save Changes.

Restart the hue service.
