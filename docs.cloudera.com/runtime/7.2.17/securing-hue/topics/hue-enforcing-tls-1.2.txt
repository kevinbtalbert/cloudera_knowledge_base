Enforcing TLS version 1.2 for HueCloudera Docs
Enforcing TLS version 1.2 for Hue
CDP Data Hub cluster components and services such as the Cloudera Manager web UI, the
        Hue web UI, and the Impala web UI communicate with each other using TLS 1.2 as the default
        TLS protocol, and TLS 1.1 or 1.0 if a client requests it. You can enforce these services to
        only use TLS 1.2 by specifying the SSL protocol in Cloudera
        Manager.

noteThe TLS version that is auto-applied depends on the Python version. If your
                installed Python version is higher than 2.7.9, then both the client and the server
                use the latest TLS. But if your installed Python version is lower than 2.7.9, then
                TLS 1.0 is used.
noteThe following steps do not apply to the connections between Hue and its backend
                database or external identity services such as LDAP and Active Directory.


Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Load Balancers > Advanced and add the following line in the SSL
                        Protocol field:

-all +TLSv1.2


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.

Verify that TLS version 1.2 is used for encryption and all the ciphers used are
                    “strong” by using a security scanner such as Nmap.


Open a CLI console on a machine in your cluster.


Run the following command:

nmap -sV --script +ssl-enum-ciphers -p 8889 [***HOSTNAME***] -f

Replace [***HOSTNAME***] with the actual name of the host.
The following is a sample output.
                            It
                            shows that only TLS 1.2 is available for the handshake and that all the
                            ciphers are
                            “strong”:Starting Nmap 7.80 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2020-30-10 11:16 PDT

Set the SSL_CIPHER_LIST property for the Hue Server in
                    Cloudera Manager.


Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.


Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Server and specify the following in the Hue Server
                                Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                                hue_safety_valve_server.ini field:

[desktop]
ssl_cipher_list=DEFAULT:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXPORT:!SSLv2:!SSLv3:!TLSv1

The SSL_CIPHER_LIST property is a list of one or more
                            cipher suite strings separated by colons. This restricts the use of the
                            default cipher suite before establishing an encrypted SSL
                            connection.
