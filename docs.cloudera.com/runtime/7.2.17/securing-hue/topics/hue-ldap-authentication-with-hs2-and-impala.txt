Enabling LDAP authentication with HiveServer2 and Impala
LDAP authentication with HiveServer2 and Impala can be enabled by setting the
    auth_username and auth_password properties under the [beeswax] section for Hive
    and the [impala] section for Impala in a Cloudera Manager safety valve
    configuration property.
importantSet these properties in the Cloudera Manager Hue Service
        Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini
      property.


auth_username
LDAP username of the Hue user to be authenticated to the server.


auth_password
LDAP password of the Hue user to be authenticated to the server.


For example:
[beeswax]
   auth_username=<hiveserver2_ldap_user_name>
   auth_password=<hiveserver2_ldap_password>
[impala]
   auth_username=<impala_ldap_user_name>
   auth_password=<impala_ldap_password>
These login details are only used by Impala and Hive to authenticate to the LDAP server. The
     Impala and Hive services trust Hue to have already validated the user being impersonated
     instead of passing on the credentials.
