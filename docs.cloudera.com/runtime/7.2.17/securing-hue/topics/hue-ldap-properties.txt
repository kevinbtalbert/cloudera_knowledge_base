LDAP properties
These are the properties you can use to configure LDAP for Hue in Cloudera Manager or
    in the hue.ini file for unmanaged clusters.


Property Name
Description and Syntax



General Hue LDAP
                Properties


Authentication Backend
                backend

Authentication Mode. Select
                  desktop.auth.backend.LdapBackend.
Multiple backends are allowed. Create a list and add it to
                  the Hue safety-valve.



LDAP URL ldap_url

URL for the LDAP server.
Syntax: ldaps://<ldap_server>:<636>
                  or ldap://<ldap_server>:<389>
Important: To prevent usernames and passwords from
                  transmitting in the clear, use ldaps:// or
                  ldap:// + "Enable LDAP TLS". 



Create LDAP users on
                logincreate_users_on_login

Flag to create new LDAP users at Hue login.
If true, any user who logs into Hue is automatically
                  created. If false, only users that exist in
                  useradmin can log in.



Direct Bind
                Properties


Active Directory
                Domainnt_domain
For direct binding with Microsoft Active Directory only. Typically maps to
                the user email address or ID in conjunction with the domain. Allows Hue to
                authenticate without having to follow LDAP references to other partitions. Hue binds
                with User-Principal-Name (UPN) if provided.Example:
                  ad.<mycompany>.comImportant:  Do not use
                nt_domain with LDAP Username Pattern or Search Bind. 


LDAP Username
                Patternldap_username_pattern

For direct binding with LDAP (non-Active Directory) only
                  (because AD uses UPNs which have a space in them).
Username Pattern finds the user attempting to login into
                  LDAP by adding the username to a predefined DN string. Use
                  <username> to reference the user logging in. An
                  example is
                  "uid=<username>,ou=people,dc=mycompany,dc=com".



Search Bind
                Properties


Use Search Bind
                Authenticationsearch_bind_authentication
Flag to enable/disable Search Bind.


LDAP Search Basebase_dn

Distinguished name to use as a search base for finding
                  users and groups. 
Syntax: dc=ad, dc=sec,
                  dc=mycompany,dc=com



Encryption
                Properties


LDAP Server CA
                Certificateldap_cert

Full path to .pem file with Certificate Authority (CA)
                  chain used to sign the LDAP server certificate.
If left blank, all certificates are trusted and otherwise
                  encrypted usernames and passwords are vulnerable to attack.
                



Enable LDAP
                TLSuse_start_tls
Flag to enable/disable encryption with the StartTLS operation.


Import / Sync
                Properties


LDAP Bind User Distinguished
                Namebind_dn

Bind user. Only use if LDAP/AD does not support anonymous
                  binds. (Typically, LDAP supports anonymous binds and AD does
                  not.) Bind User differs per auth type:


Search Bind: username@domain
Direct Bind with NT Domain: username
Direct Bind with Username Pattern: DN string (and same
                      as LDAP Username Pattern)





LDAP Bind
                Passwordbind_password
Bind user password.


Filter Properties


LDAP User
                Filteruser_filter
General LDAP text search filter to
                restrict search of valid users. Only used by Search Bind
                authentication and LDAP Sync.The default is
                  objectclass=* but can differ. For
                  example, some LDAP environments support Posix objects for
                  *nix authentication and the user filter
                  might need to be
                  objectclass=posixAccount.


LDAP Username
                Attributeuser_name_attr
Username to search against (the attribute in LDAP that
                contains the username).Typical attributes include
                  sAMAccountName (default for AD/LDAP) and
                  uid (LDAP default).Maintain case
                    sensitivity when setting attributes for AD/LDAP.


LDAP Group
                Filtergroup_filter
General LDAP text search filter to
                restrict search of valid groups. Only used by LDAP Sync (not
                authentication). If left blank, no filtering is used and all
                groups in LDAP are synced.The default is
                  objectclass=* but can differ. For
                  example, some LDAP environments support Posix objects for
                  *nix authentication and the user filter
                  might need to be
                  objectclass=posixGroup.


LDAP Group Name
                Attributegroup_name_attr

Group name to search against (the attribute in LDAP that
                  contains the groupname).
If left blank, the default is "cn" (common name), that
                  typically works with AD/LDAP.
Maintain case sensitivity when setting attributes for
                  AD/LDAP.



LDAP Group Membership
                Attributegroup_member_attr

Attribute in the group that contains DNs of all the
                  members.(Optional) - 
If left blank, the default is "memberOf" or "member", that
                  typically works with Active Directory/LDAP.

                LDAP configuration.
