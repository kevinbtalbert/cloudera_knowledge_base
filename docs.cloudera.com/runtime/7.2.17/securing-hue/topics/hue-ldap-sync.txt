Importing and synchronizing users and groups with an LDAP server in Hue
You can import and synchronize one user at a time, synchronize all user memberships in
    all groups, import and synchronize all users in one group, or enable synchronization of group
    memberships automatically when users in those groups log in to Hue.
To synchronize your Hue users and groups with your LDAP
        server:
Hue must be configured to authenticate with LDAP.
The logged in user must have Hue superuser permissions.


importantHue does not support importing all groups at once.


Log in to Hue as a superuser.

Go to User Admin > Users.
The User Admin page is displayed.

To import and synchronize one LDAP user in Hue:


Click Add/Sync LDAP user.


Add a username, check Create home directory, and click
                Add/Sync user.



To synchronize group memberships for LDAP users who have already been imported to
          Hue:


Click Sync LDAP users/groups.


Select the Create home directories option and click
                Sync.



noteThis synchronizes group memberships with the LDAP server.


To import and synchronize one LDAP group containing its users:


Click Add/Sync LDAP group.


Check Create home directories, and click
                Sync.



To configure Hue to automatically synchronize LDAP groups and their users when they log
          in to Hue:


Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.


Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration and enter the following lines in the Hue Service Advanced
                Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini
              field:

[desktop]
[[ldap]]
  sync_groups_on_login=true



Click Save Changes.


Restart the Hue service.



noteLDAP sync_groups_on_login only works with search bind
            authentication. This process can be burdensome if you have a large number of users
            logging in and authenticating simultaneously or new users getting added to the LDAP
            group, as multiple synchronization requests are triggered which could cause collisions
            on database writes.


To synchronize LDAP groups having the newly added users that need to be added to Hue,
          run the following command separately for each LDAP group:

$HUE_HOME/build/env/bin/hue import_ldap_group --import-members [***LDAP-GROUP-NAME***] --cm-managed

You can script and automate this process using a cron job.
