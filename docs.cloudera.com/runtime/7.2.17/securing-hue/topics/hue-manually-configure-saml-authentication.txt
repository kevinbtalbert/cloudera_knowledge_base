Manually configuring SAML authenticationCloudera Docs
Manually configuring SAML authentication
To manually configure Hue for SAML authentication on unmanaged clusters, you must add
    GCC Python libraries and install xmlsec1 tools on all the hosts in your
    cluster.
    

These instructions assume that you have an Identity
            Provider set up and running. You can use any identity provider of your choice. For
            example, Okta, Ping Identity, and OpenAM.
importantYou may need to disable cipher algorithms before manually configuring Hue
            for SAML authentication.


Install the following libraries on all hosts in your
                cluster:

## RHEL/CentOS
yum install git gcc python-devel swig openssl## Ubuntu/Debian
apt-get install git gcc python-dev swig openssl## SLES
zypper install git gcc python-devel swig openssl make libxslt-devel libltdl-devel


Install xmlsec1 and xmlsec1-openssl
              on all hosts in the cluster:

importantEnsure
                that the xmlsec1 package is executable by the
                user, hue.
              ## RHEL/CentOS 
yum install xmlsec1 xmlsec1-opensslnoteIf
  xmlsec libraries are not available, use the appropriate epel
    repository:
  ## For RHEL/CentOS 7
wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-6.noarch.rpm
rpm -ivh epel-release-7-6.noarch.rpm## Ubuntu/Debian
apt-get install xmlsec1 libxmlsec1-openssl## SLES (get latest version)
wget http://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/download/xmlsec1-1.2.24.tar.gz
tar -xvzf xmlsec1-1.2.24.tar.gz
cd xmlsec1-1.2.24
./configure && make
make install


Copy metadata from your identity provider's SAML server and save it as an XML
              file on every host with a Hue server. For example, if your identity provider is
                  Shibboleth, visit
                  https://<idp_host>:8443/idp/shibboleth,
              copy the metadata content, and paste it into an XML file. Read the
              documentation of your identity provider for details on how to
              copy the XML of the SAML server metadata.

noteYou may have to edit the copied metadata; for example,
                the identity provider's port number (8443)
                might be missing from its URL.
mkdir -pm 755 /opt/cloudera/security/saml/
cd /opt/cloudera/security/saml/vim idp-<your idp provider>-metadata.xml
# Paste IdP SAML here and save


Add the files that the key_file and cert_file SAML
          properties point to for encrypted assertions and make sure you add this properties to the
          hue.ini configuration file.


The key_file parameter points to the location of the private key that
            is used to encrypt metadata. Its file format must be
              <file_name>.PEM.
The cert_file parameter points to the location of the X.509
            certificate that is sent with encrypted metadata. Its file format must be
            <file_name>.PEM.

warningAdd the key and cert files even if you are not encrypting
              assertions. Hue checks for the existence and validity of these files even if they are
              not needed. They cannot be empty files. This is a known issue. If necessary, create a
              valid self-signed certificate:openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -days 3560 -nodes -keyout host.key -out host.pem -subj '/CN=Hue SAML'
