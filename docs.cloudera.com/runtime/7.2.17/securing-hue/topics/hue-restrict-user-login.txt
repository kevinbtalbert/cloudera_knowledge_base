Controlling user access to Hue
Administrators can control users who can access Hue by creating different LDAP login
        groups, adding users needing access to these login groups, and then specifying the login
        groups in the Advanced Configuration Snippet in Cloudera Manager.
Ensure that you have added users needing access to Hue to a
            login group.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration and enter the following lines in the Hue Service
                        Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                        hue_safety_valve.ini field:

[desktop]
[[ldap]]
login_groups=[***LDAP-GRP1***], [***LDAP-GRP2***], [***LDAP-GRP3***]

Where, [***LDAP-GRP1***],
                        [***LDAP-GRP2***], [***LDAP-GRP3***]
                    are the login groups containing users needing access to Hue.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
