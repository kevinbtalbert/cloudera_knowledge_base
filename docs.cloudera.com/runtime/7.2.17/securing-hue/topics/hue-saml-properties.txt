SAML properties
You can set SAML properties in the hue.ini file
      for unmanaged clusters. A subset of them can be set in the Hue Service Advanced
        Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini for managed
      clusters.
Table 1. Table of SAML parameters

SAML parameter
Description



authn_requests_signed
Boolean, that when True, signs Hue-initiated
              authentication requests with X.509 certificate.


backend
Hard-coded value set to SAML backend library packaged
              with Hue
              (libsaml.backend.SAML2Backend).


base_url
URL that SAML Identity Provider uses for responses.
              Typically used in Load balanced Hue environments.


cert_file
Path to X.509 certificate sent with encrypted metadata.
              File format must be .PEM.


create_users_on_login
Boolean, that when True, creates users from OpenId, upon
              successful login. 


entity_id
Service provider ID. Can also accept pattern where
              '<base_url>' is replaced with server URL base.


key_file
Path to private key used to encrypt metadata. File format
              must be .PEM.


key_file_password
Password used to decrypt the X.509 certificate in
              memory.


logout_enabled
Boolean, that when True, enables single logout.


logout_requests_signed
Boolean, that when True, signs Hue-initiated logout
              requests with an X.509 certificate.


metadata_file
Path to readable metadata XML file copied from Identity
              Provider.


name_id_format
Format of NameID that Hue requests from SAML
              server.


optional_attributes
Comma-separated list of optional attributes that Hue
              requests from Identity Provider.


required_attributes
Comma-separated list of required attributes that Hue
              requests from Identity Provider. For example,
              uid and email.


redirect_whitelist
Fully qualified domain name of SAML server:
              "^\/.*$,^https:\/\/<SAML_server_FQDN>\/.*$".


user_attribute_mapping
Map of Identity Provider attributes to Hue django user
              attributes. For example, {'uid':'username',
              'email':'email'}.


username_source
Declares source of username as nameid or
              attributes.


want_response_signed
A boolean parameter, when set to True, requires SAML response
              wrapper returned by an IdP to be digitally signed by the IdP. The default value is
                False.


want_assertions_signed
A boolean parameter, when set to True, requires SAML assertions
              returned by an IdP to be digitally signed by the IdP. The default value is
                False.


xmlsec_binary
Path to xmlsec_binary that signs,
              verifies, encrypts/decrypts SAML requests and assertions. Must
              be executable by user, hue.


SAML properties that can be set for managed clusters

redirect_whitelist
[desktop]Set to the fully qualified domain name of the SAML server so
            that Hue can redirect to the SAML server for authentication.
              [desktop]
redirect_whitelist=^\/.$,^https:\/\/<SAML_server_fully_qualified_domain_name>\/.$ noteHue
              uses redirect_whitelist to protect itself from redirecting to
              unapproved URLs.
backend
[desktop]>[[auth]]Point to the SAML backend that is packaged with
            Hue:backend=libsaml.backend.SAML2Backend
xmlsec_binary [libsaml]Point to the xmlsec1 library path:
              xmlsec_binary=/usr/bin/xmlsec1noteTo find the path, run:
                which xmlsec1
metadata_file
[libsaml]Point to the path of the XML file you created from the
            identity provider's metadata:
            metadata_file=/path/to/<your_idp_metadata_file>.xml
key_file and cert_file
[libsaml]To encrypt communication between Hue and the Identity
            Provider (IdP), you need a private key and certificate. The private key signs requests
            sent to the IdP, and decrypts messages from the IdP. The certificate is used to encrypt
            messages to Hue from the IdP, and must be provided to the IdP. Typically, the
              cert_file is shared by providing Hue's Service Provider metadata XML
            to the IdP admins, but you may also share a copy of the cert_file
            itself.The SAML certificate and private key must be the same on all Hue Server
            hosts, and can be self-signed, obtained from a commercial CA vendor, or from your
            internal PKI administrators. Both key_file and
              cert_file must be in PEM format.Users with
              password-protected certificates can set the property,
              key_file_password in the hue.ini file. Hue uses the
            password to decrypt the SAML certificate in memory and passes it to
              xmlsec1 through a named pipe. The decrypted certificate never touches
            the disk. This only works for POSIX-compatible platforms.
