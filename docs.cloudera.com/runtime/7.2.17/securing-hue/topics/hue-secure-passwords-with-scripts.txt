Securing Hue passwords with scripts
You can secure passwords in Hue by using one consolidated script, or multiple
    individual scripts. Hue runs each password script at startup and extracts
    passwords from stdout.

Store scripts in a directory that only Hue can read, write, and execute. You can choose
        password script names but you cannot change hue.ini property names to which
        you assign those scripts. Add the suffix _script to any password property
            and set it equal to the script name.


At the command line, create one or more password scripts. For
                example, create a consolidated script named
                my_passwords_script.sh:

#!/bin/bash

SERVICE=$1

if [[ ${SERVICE} == "ldap_password" ]]
then
 echo "<your_ldap_password>"
fi

if [[ ${SERVICE} == "ssl_password" ]]
then
 echo "<your_ssl_password>"
fi

if [[ ${SERVICE} == "bind_password" ]]
then
 echo "<your_bind_password>"
fi

if [[ ${SERVICE} == "db_password" ]]
then
 echo "<your_database_password>"
fi


Log on to Cloudera Manager and go to
              Hue > Configuration.

Search on â€‹Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet
              (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini.

Add script properties. In the following example, the required _script
          is added to the password property:

[desktop]
ldap_username=hueservice
ldap_password_script="/var/lib/hue/password_script.sh ldap_password"
ssl_password_script="/var/lib/hue/password_script.sh ssl_password"

[[ldap]]
bind_password_script="/var/lib/hue/password_script.sh bind_password"

[[database]]
db_password_script="/var/lib/hue/password_script.sh db_password"


Click Save Changes and Restart
              Hue.
