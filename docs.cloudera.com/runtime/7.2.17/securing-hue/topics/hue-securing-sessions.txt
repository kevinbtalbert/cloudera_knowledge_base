Securing sessions
When a Hue session expires, the screen blurs and the user is automatically logged out of
    the Hue web interface. Logging back on returns the user to the same location in the
    application.
Session timeout
User sessions are controlled with the ttl (time-to-live)
        property, which is set in the Cloudera Manager Hue Service Advanced Configuration
          Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini property as follows:
[desktop]
     [[session]]
     ttl=[***NUMBER-OF-SECONDS***]
The default setting for ttl is 1,209,600 seconds, which equals two weeks.
       The ttl property determines the length of time that the cookie with the
       user's session ID lives before expiring. After the ttl setting is reached,
       the user's session expires whether it is active or not.

Idle session timeout
Idle sessions are controlled with the
          idle_session_timeout property, which is set in the Cloudera Manager
          Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
          hue_safety_valve.ini property as follows:
[desktop]
     [[auth]]
     idle_session_timeout=[***NUMBER-OF-SECONDS***]
Sessions expire that are idle for the number of seconds set for this property. For example,
       if you set idle_session_timeout=900, sessions expire after being idle for 15
       minutes. You can disable the property by setting it to a negative value, like
       idle-session_timeout=-1.

Secure session login
Session login properties are set under the [desktop]
          [[auth]] section in the Cloudera Manager Hue Service Advanced
          Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini property as
        follows:
[desktop]
     [[auth]]
     [***SET-SESSION-LOGIN-PARAMETERS-HERE***]
noteThese configuration settings are based on django-axes
     1.5.0.
Use the following properties to configure session login behavior:


change_default_password

Valid values: true | false
If this property is set to true, users must change their passwords on first login
                 attempt.
Example:
[desktop]
     [[auth]]
     change_default_password=true
To use this property, you must enable the
                 AllowFirstUserDjangoBackend in Hue. For example:
[desktop]
     [[auth]]
     backend=desktop.auth.backend.AllowFirstUserDjangoBackend



expires_after

Use this property to configure the number of seconds after logout that user accounts are
                 disabled. For example, user accounts are disabled 900 seconds or 15 minutes after
                 logout with the following configuration:
               [desktop]
     [[auth]]
     expires_after=900
If you set this property to a negative value, user sessions never expire. For
                 example, expires_after=-1.


expire_superusers
Use to expire superuser accounts after the specified number of seconds after
               logout. For example, expire_superusers=900
               causes superuser accounts to expire 15 minutes after logging out.


login_cooloff_time
Sets the number of seconds after which failed logins are forgotten. For example,
             if you set login_cooloff_time=900, a failed login attempt is forgotten
             after 15 minutes.


login_failure_limit
Sets the number of login attempts allowed before a failed login record is
               created. For example, if you set login_failure_limit=3, a failed
               login record is created after 3 login attempts.


login_lock_out_at_failure

Valid values: true | false
If set to true:
                 
The IP address that is attempting to log in
                     is locked out after exceeding the limit set for
                     login_failure_limit.
If login_lock_out_by_combination_user_and_ip is also set to
                     true, both the IP address and the user are locked out
                     after exceeding the limit set for login_failure_limit.
If login_lock_out_use_user_agent is also set to
                     true, both the IP address and the agent application
                     (such as a browser) are locked out after exceeding the limit set for
                     login_failure_limit.





login_lock_out_by_combination_user_and_ip

Valid values: true | false
If set to true, both the IP address and the user are locked
                 out after exceeding the limit set for login_failure_limit.



login_lock_out_use_user_agent

Valid values: true | false
If set to true, the agent application (such as a browser)
                  is locked out after exceeding the limit set for
                    login_failure_limit.




Secure session cookies
Session cookie properties are set under the [desktop]
          [[session]] section in the Cloudera Manager Hue Service Advanced
          Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini property as
        follows:
[desktop]
     [[session]]
     [***SET-SESSION-COOKIE-PROPERTIES-HERE***]
Use the following properties to configure session cookie behavior:


secure

Valid values: true | false
If this property is set to true, the user session ID is secured.
importantTo use this property, HTTPS must be enabled.
Example:
[desktop]
     [[session]]
     secure=true
By default this property is set to false.



http_only

Valid values: true | false
If this property is set to true, the cookie with the user
                 session ID uses the HTTP only flag.
Example:
[desktop]
     [[session]]
     http_only=true
importantIf the HttpOnly flag is included in the HTTP
                 response header, the cookie cannot be accessed through a client side script.
By default this property is set to true.


expire_at_browser_close

Valid values: true | false
If this property is set to true, only session-length
                 cookies are used. Users are automatically logged out when the browser window is
                 closed.
Example:
[desktop]
     [[session]]
     expire_at_browser_close=true
By default this property is set to false.
