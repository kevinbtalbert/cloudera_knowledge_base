Enabling Hue as a TLS/SSL client
After you create a Hue truststore file in PEM format, you can configure Hue as a
      TLS/SSL client by using Cloudera Manager.
    

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue TLS/SSL Server CA Certificate (PEM Format) ssl_cacerts and add the path to the
            hue_truststore.pem file on the host that is running
          the Hue web server.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
