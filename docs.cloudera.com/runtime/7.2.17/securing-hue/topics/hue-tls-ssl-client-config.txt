Configuring Hue as a TLS/SSL client
Hue acts as a TLS/SSL client when communicating with other services, such as core
   Hadoop, HBase, Oozie, and cloud providers like Amazon S3 or Azure.
To act as a TLS/SSL client, Hue must authenticate HDFS, MapReduce, YARN daemons, the HBase
      Thrift server, and so on. To do this, Hue needs to have the certificate chains of these
      components' hosts in the Hue trust store.
The Hue truststore is a single PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) file that contains the certificate authority (CA) root
     certificate and all intermediate certificates to authenticate the certificate installed on each
   TLS/SSL-enabled server. These servers host the services with which Hue communicates.
noteA certificate is specific to a host. It is signed by a CA and tells the
     requesting client, which is Hue in this case, that the host is the same one as is represented
     by the host public key. Hue uses a chain of signing authority in its truststore to validate the
     CA that signed the host certificate.
