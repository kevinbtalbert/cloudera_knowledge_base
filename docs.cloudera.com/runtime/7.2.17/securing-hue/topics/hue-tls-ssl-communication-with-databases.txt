Securing database connections with TLS/SSL
Hue uses different clients to communicate with each database internally. Client-specific
    options, such as secure connectivity can be configured using Cloudera Manager.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration and add the following section in the Hue Service Advanced
            Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.ini field: 

[desktop] 
  [[database]] 
    … 
    options={"ssl":{"ca":"/tmp/ca-cert.pem"}}

This identifies the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the backend database.
          You can also identify public and private keys as
          follows:options='{"ssl": {"ca": "/tmp/newcerts2/ca.pem", "key": "/tmp/newcerts2/client-key.pem", "cert": “/tmp/newcerts2/client-cert.pem"}}'

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
