Troubleshooting SAML authentication
Before troubleshooting your SAML authentication configuration in Hue, enable DEBUG for
    the Hue Django logs that are located in /var/log/hue. In the Hue Web UI, go to the Home page, select
    Server Logs, and check Force Debug Level. For
    managed clusters, you can use Cloudera Manager to enable DEBUG by navigating to the
    Hue service, selecting the Configuration tab,
    check Enable Django Debug mode, click Save
      Changes, and then Restart.
SAML SSL error
OpenSSL might fail with this message:
SSLError: [Errno bad handshake] [('SSL routines', 'SSL3_CHECK_CERT_AND_ALGORITHM', 'dh key too small')]
To resolve, append the following code to the file,
        /usr/java/<your_jdk_version>-cloudera/jre/lib/security/java.security:
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=MD5, RC4, DH

SAML decrypt error
The following error is an indication that you are using a slightly
        different SAML protocol from what Hue
        expects:Error: ('failed to decrypt', -1)To
        resolve: 
Download and rename the fix-xmlsec1.txt Python script.
            wget https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/other/shared/fix-xmlsec1.txt -O fix-xmlsec1.py
Change permissions as appropriate, for
            example:chmod 755 fix-xmlsec1.py
In hue.ini, set
            xmlsec_binary=<path_to_script>/fix-xmlsec1.py.
Run fix-xmlsec1.py.

This script repairs the known issue whereby xmlsec1 is not compiled
        with RetrievalMethod and cannot find the location of
        the encrypted key. SAML2 responses would sometimes place
        EncryptedKey outside of the
        EncryptedData tree. This script moves
        EncryptedKey under
        EncryptedData.
