User authentication in Hue
CDP services do not authenticate each user that logs in to Hue. The
      CDP services authenticate Hue and trust that Hue has authenticated its users. In a most
      typical configuration, Hue users can be authenticated with an LDAP server and the CDP users
      can be authenticated with Kerberos. You can also use SAML for Single Sign-on (SSO)
      authentication.
After Hue is authenticated by a service such as Hive, Hue impersonates the user requesting the
   use of that service, for example, to create a Hive table. In this case, the Hive service uses
   Apache Ranger to ensure that the group to which the user belonged is authorized for that action
   (to create a Hive table).
noteBy default, the Hue session uses a secure cookie protocol. 

Authenticating Hue users with KerberosFor Hue to work properly with a CDP cluster that uses Kerberos for authentication,       the Kerberos Ticket Renewer role must be added to the Hue service.     Authenticating Hue users with LDAPConfiguring Hue for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) enables you to     import users and groups from a directory service,     synchronize group membership manually or automatically at login,     and authenticate with an LDAP server.Authenticating Hue users with SAMLHue supports SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for Single Sign-on     (SSO) authentication.Authenticating Hue users with Knox SSOYou can use the Apache Knox Gateway to interact with Hue REST APIs and the Hue user         interface, along with other CDP components and services. To set up Knox Single Sign-on (SSO)         to authenticate users, you must configure the KnoxSpnegoDjangoBackend property using         Cloudera Manager.
