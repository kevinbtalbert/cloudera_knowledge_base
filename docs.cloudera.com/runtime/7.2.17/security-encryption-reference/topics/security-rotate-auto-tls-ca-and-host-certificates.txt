Rotate Auto-TLS Certificate Authority and Host Certificates
Your cluster security requirements may require that you rotate the auto-TLS CA and
        certificates.
Using an internal CA (Use case 1)

Navigate to Administration > Security. Click Rotate Auto-TLS Certificates to launch the
                    wizard.
Complete the wizard.


Using a custom CA (Use case 3)

Use the /cm/commands/addCustomCerts API command to replace the old
                    certificates with new certificates in CMCA directory for each host. You must run this
                    command for each host separately. An example of a curl command to upload the
                    certificates to Cloudera Manager :
                    curl -u admin:admin -X POST --header 'Content-Type:
                        application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{
                        "location": "/opt/cloudera/AutoTLS",
                        "interpretAsFilenames": true,
                        "hostCerts": [ {
                        "hostname": "ccycloud-10.vcdp71.root.hwx.site",
                        "certificate":
                        "/tmp/auto-tls/certs/ccycloud-10.vcdp71.root.hwx.site.pem",
                        "key":
                        "/tmp/auto-tls/certs/ccycloud-10.vcdp71.root.hwx.site.pem"
                        } ]
                        }' 'https://ccycloud-7.vcdp71.root.hwx.site:7183/api/v41/cm/commands/addCustomCerts'
                    In the example above, the "location" should be omitted if Auto-TLS was enabled or
                    rotated after 7.1, and the file paths should point to files on the CM server host. 

Use CM API /hosts/{hostId}/commands/generateHostCerts to deploy the new certificates
                        to each host. You must run this command for each host separately. An example curl
                        command :
                        curl -u admin:admin -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 
                            'Accept: application/json' -d '{ "sshPort" : 22, "userName" : "root", "password" : "cloudera" }' 
                            'https://ccycloud-7.vcdp71.root.hwx.site:7183/api/v41/hosts/250e1bb7-8987-419c-a53f-c852c275d299/commands/generateHostCerts' 
                        where '250e1bb7-8987-419c-a53f-c852c275d299' in the command above is the hostID.
