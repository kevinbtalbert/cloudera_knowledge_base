Excluding audits for specific users, groups, and roles
You can exclude specific users, groups, and roles from auditing in each
        service.

Ranger default log functionality creates audit log records for access and
                authorization requests, specifically around service accounts such as hbase, atlas
                and solr. Writing so much data to solr can limit the availability of Solr for
                further usage. This topic describes how to exclude specific users, groups, and roles
                from Ranger audits in a service. Excluding specific users, groups or roles is also
                known as creating a blacklist for Ranger audits.


In the Ranger Admin Web UI > Service Manager, click Add New Service or
                    Edit  (existing service).

On Create/Edit Service, scroll down to Config Properties > Add New Configurations.

Remove all audit filters from the existing service.

Click +, then type one of the following property
                    names:


ranger.plugin.audit.exclude.users
ranger.plugin.audit.exclude.groups
ranger.plugin.audit.exclude.rolesfollowed by one or more values.
noteYou can include multiple values for each
                                exclude property using a comma-separated list.




Figure 1. Adding an exclude users property to the HadoopSQL service




After adding the above configuration; if testuser2
                        user performs any actions for HadoopSQL service, Audit > Access logs will not be created.
Similarly, you can exclude (or blacklist) users belonging to a particular
                        group or role by adding a user-specific or role-specific configuration.
