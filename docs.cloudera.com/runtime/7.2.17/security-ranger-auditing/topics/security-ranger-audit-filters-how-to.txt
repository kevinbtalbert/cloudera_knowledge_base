How to set audit filters in Ranger Admin Web
        UI
You can set specific audit filter conditions for each service,
        using Create/Edit Service


 Creating audit filters for a service using the Ranger Admin Web UI will prevent
                audit log records from appearing in the Audit Access tab of the Ranger Admibn Web
                UI. Audit filters do not prevent audit log collection and storage in Solr.


In the Ranger Admin Web UI > Service Manager, click Add New Service or
                Edit (existing service).

On Create/Edit Service, scroll down to Audit
                Filters.


Verify that Audit Filter is checked.
Optionally, define any of the following to include in the filter
                        definition:
Is Audited
Defines whether to audit or not
Access Results

Denied, Allowed, or Not Determined 


select to filter access=denied, access=allowed or all by
                                        selecting access=Not determined.

Resource
use Resource Details to include or exclude specific
                                    resources such as databases, tables, or columns.
Operations
select specific operations to filter
Permissions
select specific permissions
Users, Groups, Roles

Click Save.

Test your filters to verify that defined audit filters perform as
                expected.


Defining specific filtering properties prevents audit logs from service users from
                appearing on Ranger Admin Web UI > Audit > Access, but does not prevent access logs for service users from being
                generated in Solr.
