Ranger UI authentication
Reference information on Ranger UI authentication, when configuring Ranger AD
        integration.


This is an extra AD level filter option on top of Kerberos authentication that
                    maps to:



For AD there are two options for defining who can access the Ranger UI: LDAP or
                    ACTIVE_DIRECTORY. There is not a huge amount of difference between them, but
                    they are separate sets of properties.



ACTIVE_DIRECTORYIn Cloudera Manager, select
                    Ranger, then click the Configuration tab.To display the authentication settings,
                    type "authentication" in the Search box. You may need to scroll down to see the
                    AD settings. 


The ranger.ldap.ad.base.dn property determines the base of
                    any search, so users not on this OU tree path can not be
                    authenticated.The ranger.ldap.ad.user.searchfilter
                    poperty is a dynamic filter that maps the user name in the Ranger web UI login
                    screen to sAMAccountName. For example, the AD sAMAccountName
                    property has example values like k.reshi and
                        d.alora so make sure to enter a matching value for
                    ‘Username’ in the logon dialogue.




LDAP

The LDAP properties allow for more fine tuning. 
In Cloudera Manager, select Ranger, then click the Configuration tab.To display
                    the authentication settings, type "authentication" in the Search box. You may
                    need to scroll down to see all of the LDAP settings. 



There is one catch: the ranger.ldap.user.dnpattern is evaluated
                    first. Consider the following example value:  

CN={0},OU=London,OU=Company,OU=User
                        Accounts,OU=CorpUsers,DC=field,DC=hortonworks,DC=com 

This would work, but has two side effects:


Users would have to log on with their ‘long username’ (like
                                ‘Kvothe Reshi / Denna
                                Alora'), which would also mean that policies would have
                            to be updated using that long name instead of the
                                k.reshi short name variant.
Traversing AD by DN patterns does not allow for applying group filters
                            at all. In the syntax above, only users directly in OU=London would be
                            able to log on.


This adverse behavior can be avoided by intentionally putting a DN pattern
                    (DC=intentionally,DC=wrong) in the ranger.ldap.user.dnpattern
                    property, AND a valid filter in User Search Filter:

(&(objectclass=user)(memberOf=CN=Hdp_admins,OU=Company,OU=User
                        Accounts,OU=CorpUsers,DC=field,DC=hortonworks,DC=com)(sAMAccountName={0}))

This works because the filter is only applied after the DN pattern query on AD
                    does not return anything. If it does, the User Search
                        Filter is not applied.
Ranger has a very simple approach to the internal user list that is kept in a
                    relational schema. This list contains all users that were synced with AD ever,
                    and all those users can potentially log in to the Ranger UI. But only Admin
                    users can really do any policy-related things in the Ranger UI (see next
                    section).
Be aware that all of this is only about authentication to Ranger. Someone from
                    the ‘Hdp_admins’ group would still not have a Ranger admin role.
