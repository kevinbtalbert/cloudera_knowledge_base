Configure Ranger authentication for UNIX
How to configure Ranger to use UNIX for user authentication.

noteIn CDP Public Cloud, identity management is provided by FreeIPA, and configured using
            the Management Console. Therefore for CDP Public Cloud you should leave the Admin
            Authentication Method set to the UNIX authentication settings. For more information on
            FreeIPA, see Managing FreeIPA in the Identify Management documentation. 


In Cloudera Manager, select Ranger, then click the Configuration tab.

To display the UNIX authentication settings, type "authentication unix" in the
               Search box.






Configure the following settings for UNIX authentication, then click Save
                  Changes.
