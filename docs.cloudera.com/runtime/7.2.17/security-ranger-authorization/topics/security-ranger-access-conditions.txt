Ranger access conditions
The Apache Ranger access policy model consists of two major components: specification
      of the resources a policy is applied to, such as HDFS files and directories, Hive databases.
      tables. and columns, HBase tables, column-families, and columns, and so on; and the
      specification of access conditions for specific users and groups
Allow Deny and Exclude Conditions
Apache Ranger supports the following access conditions:


Allow


Exclude from Allow


Deny


Exclude from Deny


These access conditions enable you to set up fine-grained access control
                policies.
For example, you can allow access to a "finance" database to all users in the
                "finance" group, but deny access to all users in the "interns" group. Let's say that
                one of the members of the "interns" group, "scott", needs to work on an assignment
                that requires access to the "finance" database. In that case, you can add an Exclude
                from Deny condition that will allow user "scott" to access the "finance" database.
                The following image shows how this policy would be set up in Apache Ranger:






Policy Evaluation of Access Conditions
Apache Ranger policies are evaluated in a specific order to ensure predictable
                results (if there is no access policy that allows access, the authorization request
                will typically be denied). The following diagram shows the policy evaluation
                work-flow:
