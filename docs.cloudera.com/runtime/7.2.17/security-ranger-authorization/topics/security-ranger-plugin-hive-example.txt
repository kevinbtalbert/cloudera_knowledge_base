Ranger Hive Plugin
Describes how the Ranger Hive plugin enforces authorization.
Ranger Hive Plugin is enabled in HiveServer2 which helps in storage-based authorization and
   SQL-standard authorization. In storage-based authorization when a new table is created by running
   CREATE TABLE statement in Beeline, which will submit query to HiveServer2 for processing, and
   before HiveServer2 is able to run the query, it will check the policy cache file and make sure
   the user who submits the query has the appropriate permission to perform the task. Once the
   authorization passes, a query is submitted and a table created.
Upon successful creation of the new table, two things will be triggered by Ranger’s Hive
    plugin:
Sends audit event to Solr and/or HDFS 
Sends Kafka event to topic “ATLAS_HOOK”, to record that a new entity has been created, so
     effectively Ranger’s Hive Plugin is the producer for “ATLAS_HOOK” topic in Kafka 

SQL standard authorization provides grant/revoke functionality at database, table level. When a
   grant command is executed in beeline it updates/creates a policy for that user and when revoke is
   executed the user is added in the deny condition of the policy. 
Ranger Hive Plugin Enforcement Example
Prerequisite
Create a database, table, column in hive service and also insert some data into it with
     hive user.

create database vehicle; 
create table vehicle.cars(car_id int, car_name string, car_color string, car_price
         int);" 
insert into vehicle.cars(car_id, car_name, car_color, car_price) VALUES
         (1,'car1','color1',100000), (2,'car2','color2',200000), (3,'car3','color3',300000),
         (4,'car4','color4',400000); 
select * from vehicle.cars; 



Create external user 'externaluser1'

Access Enforcement steps


Let's try to access the vehicle.cars table using 'externaluser1'.
'externaluser1' will be denied access, because 'externaluser1' lacks permission to access
      the vehicle.cars table.


Lets create a policy in ranger-hive for the user:


Resource : [database=vehicle, table=cars, column=*]
allow policy item : [user='externaluser1', permission=select]




Let's try to access the vehicle.cars table using 'externaluser1'.
'externaluser1' will be allowed access, because 'externaluser1' now has permission to access
      the vehicle.cars table.

You can check the logs related to these actions, using Ranger Admin Web UI > Access >   Audit  tab.

Masking Enforcement steps
Suppose you don't want to show the car_price to 'externaluser1’ user so we can mask the data
    of that column for that user.


Lets create a masking policy in ranger-hive for the user:
Resource : [database=vehicle, table=cars, column=car_price]
allow policy item : [user='externaluser1', permission=select, Select Masking
        Option=Partial mask: show last 4]



Now let's try to access the vehicle.cars table using 'externaluser1'
'externaluser1' will see the car_price - only last 4 digits - because 'externaluser1' has
      masked access to vehicle.cars table.


Row Enforcement steps
Suppose you don't want to show the only one row to 'externaluser1’ user so we can do it using
    the row filter policy.


Lets create a masking policy in ranger-hive for the user:

Resource : [database=vehicle, table=cars]
allow policy item : [user='externaluser1', permission=select, Row Level Filter=car_color =
       'color4']



Now let's try to access the vehicle.cars table using 'externaluser1'.
 'externaluser1' will see only the row whose car_color is 'color4'.


Table 1. Hive Commands to Ranger Permission Mapping

Permission
Action



SELECT
Gives read access to an object.


CREATE
Hive Create Table statement is used to create table.


UPDATE
Gives the ability to run update queries on an object (table).


ALTER

You can rename the table and column of existing Hive tables.
You can add a new column to the table.
Rename Hive table column.
Add or drop table partition.
Add Hadoop archive option to Hive table.



DROP
DROP TABLE command in the hive is used to drop a table inside the hive.


INDEX
An Index is nothing but a pointer on a particular column of a table. Creating an index
        means creating a pointer on a particular column of a table.


LOCK
Is used to lock the table.


Read
Read data from HDFS using hdfs or other cloud locations.


Write
Export Data to a location in hdfs or other cloud locations.


ReplAdmin
ReplAdmin privilege is related to REPL DUMP and REPL LOAD commands.


Service Admin
Enable hive ranger plugin to isolate various admin operations, in this case "Kill
        Query". "Service Admin" won't be able to do DATABASE / TABLE / COLUMN operations as this
        will all be taken care by the existing DATABASE/TABLE/COLUMN level permission model.


Temporary UDF Admin
Temporary UDF Admin is needed for creating UDFs.


Refresh
Refresh is used by only impala.


ALL
This is for all the permission mentioned above.
