Prerequisite
Create external user 'externaluser3'

Access Enforcement steps


Let's try to create a topic and send some data using ‘externaluser3’, he will be denied as
      he doesn't have permission to create it.


Lets create a policy in ranger-hive for the user


Resource : [Topic=topictest01] 
allow policy item : [user='externaluser3', permission=publish, consume, describe, create] 




Let's try to create a topic and send some data using ‘externaluser3’, he will be allowed as
      he gets permission to access it.

You can check the logs related to these actions, using Ranger Admin Web UI > Access >  Audit  tab.
