Ranger plugin overview
Ranger enforces authorization using a plugin model.
Ranger at the core has a centralized web application, which consists of the policy
   administration. These policies are enforced within the Hadoop ecosystem using lightweight Ranger
   Java plugins. These plugins run as part of the same process as the namenode (HDFS),
   HiveServer2(Hive), HiveMetaStore, HBase server (Hbase), Kafka, Solr, NiFi, Raz, RazS3, ADLS, Yarn
   and Knox server (Knox). Plugins are enabled by default for each of these components except (Solr)
   and can be disabled individually, using Cloudera Manager.
Ranger plugins exist in the path of the user request. Each plugin decides whether to allow or
   deny user requests for accessing. Each plugin also collects and stores the access request details
   as access audit log records.
Ranger plugins enforce the policies defined in the policy database. Ranger Admin users can
   create a policy for a specific set of resources and assign a specific set of permissions to a
   specific set of users, groups and roles. Ranger admin users manage policies using the Ranger
   Admin Web UI.
Ranger policies are independent from native permissions (os permission). Ranger uses native
   permissions to authorize user access in the case that an applicable Ranger policy does not exist
   in the policy database.
