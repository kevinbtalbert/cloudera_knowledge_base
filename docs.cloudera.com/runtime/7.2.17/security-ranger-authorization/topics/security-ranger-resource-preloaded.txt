Preloaded resource-based services and policies
Apache Ranger includes preloaded resource-based services and policies. 


The preloaded resource-based services appear on the Service Manager page for
                  resource-based policies, and are prefixed with "cm_", with the exception of Hadoop
                  SQL, which applies to multiple SQL stack components (Hive, Impala, and Hue).







 To view the policies for each preloaded service, click the service name. To view
                  policy details, click the applicable edit icon or policy ID number.
