Ranger Security Zones
Ranger security zones let you organize service resources into multiple security
		zones.
Security Zones allow carving/bucketing of resources in a service into multiple zones for
			better administration of security policies. Defining Security Zones can enable multiple
			administrators to setup security policies for a service â€“ based on the zones to which
			they have been granted administration rights.
