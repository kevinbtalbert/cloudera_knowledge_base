Tag-based Services and Policies
Ranger enables you to create tag-based services and add access policies to those
        services.
Adding a tag-based serviceHow to add a tag-based service to Ranger.Adding tag-based policiesTag-based policies enable you to control access to resources across multiple Hadoop       components without creating separate services and policies in each component. You can also use       Ranger TagSync to synchronize the Ranger tag store with an external metadata service such as       Apache Atlas.Importing and exporting tag-based policiesYou can export and import policies from the Ranger Admin UI for cluster resiliency       (backups), during recovery operations, or when moving policies from test clusters to       production clusters. You can import or export a specific subset of policies (such as those       that pertain to specific resources or user/groups) or clone the entire repository (or multiple       repositories) via the Ranger Admin UI.
