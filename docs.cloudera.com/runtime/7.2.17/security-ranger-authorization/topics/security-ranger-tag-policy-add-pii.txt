Adding a tag-based PII policy
Example of how to add a PII tag-based policy. In this example we create a tag-based
      policy for objects tagged "PII" in Atlas. Access to objects tagged "PII" is allowed for
      members of the "audit" group. All other users (the "public" group) are denied
      access.
Select Access Manager > Tag Based Policies, then select a tag-based
               service.

On the List of Policies page, click Add New Policy.





The Create Policy page appears: 



Enter the following information on the Create Policy page:

In this example we used Allow Conditions to grant access to the "audit" group, and
                  then used Deny Conditions to deny access to the "public" group. Because the
                  "public" group includes all users, we then used Exclude from Deny Conditions to
                  exclude the "audit" group, in effect reinstating the "audit" group's original
                  Allow access condition.

Click Add to add the new policy.
