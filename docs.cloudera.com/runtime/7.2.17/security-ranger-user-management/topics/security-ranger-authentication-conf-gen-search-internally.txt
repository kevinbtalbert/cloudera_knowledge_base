Enabling Ranger Usersync search to generate internally
You can configure Ranger Usersync to generate a search filter internally when Search
        includes a list of group names or group names with a wildcard character.

When you want to filter users who are members of “cdp_prod”, “cdp_testing”, or
                “dev_ops” groups, you can add a configuration,
                    ranger.usersync.ldap.groupnames, that accepts each group
                name, as a domain name, a short name, or as a group name that contains a wildcard
                character. Usersync only reads ranger.usersync.ldap.groupnames
                when the sync source is AD/LDAP and
                    ranger.usersync.ldap.user.searchfilter is empty. This also
                requires that ranger.usersync.group.searchbase is not empty and
                the configured value for ranger.usersync.group.searchbase must
                be part of the group searchbase in AD/LDAP. When
                    ranger.usersync.ldap.user.searchfilter is not empty,
                Usersync ignores the value of ranger.usersync.ldap.groupnames.
                Values can be either DN of the groups, short name of the groups, or the group names
                with wildcard character. For example:
Domain names of the groups
memberof=CN=dev_ops,ou=Hadoop Groups,dc=cloudera,dc=com
memberof=CN=cdp_prod,ou=Hadoop Groups,dc=cloudera,dc=com
memberof=CN=cdp_testing,ou=Hadoop Groups,dc=cloudera,dc=com

Short names of the groups
CN=dev_ops
CN=cdp_prod
CN=cdp_testing

Group names with wildcard character
CN=cdp*
CN=dev_ops


To enable Usersync search to generate an internal search filter for multiple groups
                names that include wildcard characters:


In Cloudera Manager > Ranger > Configuration > Search, type
                    ranger.usersync.ldap.usergroups.

In Ranger Usersync Default Group, click
                        +1.

Type <group_name>.

Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each group name.

Click Save Changes.

In Actions, choose Restart
                        Usersync.

The search filter now includes all group names that you saved. 
To confirm, log in to Ranger Admin Web UI. In Settings > Users/Group/Roles > Groups, in Groups List, select Group
                Name. You should see group names that you configured available as search
            filter values.
