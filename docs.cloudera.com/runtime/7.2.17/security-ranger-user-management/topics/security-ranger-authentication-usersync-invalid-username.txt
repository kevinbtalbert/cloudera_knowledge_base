Configuring Ranger Usersync for invalid usernames
 How to configure Ranger Usersync to manage usernames containing invalid
        characters.

Ranger Usersync pulls in users/groups from your external user repository, such as
                LDAP/AD, and populates the Ranger database with these users/groups. 
An invalid username contains at least one invalid character. Ranger fails to create a
                set of users if an invalid username exists within that set of users.  Usersync
                perpetually tries to recreate this user set without creating Ranger or Cloudera
                Manager alerts. This error appears in both Usersync and admin logs, but the log
                output lacks necessary details such as the invalid username. By adding the following
                configuration, you cause Usersync to recognize invalid characters in a user/group
                name and then skip synchronization for any names that contain invalid
                characters.


In Cloudera Manager > Ranger > Configuration, type Ranger Usersync Advanced Configuration Snippet
                        (Safety Valve) in Search.

In the Ranger Usersync Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                        for conf/ranger-ugsync-site.xml configuration, select  to include the following property: 


In Name, type:
                                ranger.usersync.name.validation.enabled

In Value, type: true




Click Save Changes. 

Restart Ranger.

noteThis configuration property is set to false by
                        default.


 Ranger Usersync now successfully synchronizes all valid usernames from the external
            user repository and skips any usernames containing invalid characters.
