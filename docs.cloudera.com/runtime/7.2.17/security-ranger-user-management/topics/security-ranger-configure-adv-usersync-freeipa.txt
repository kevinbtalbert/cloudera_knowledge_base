Configuring Usersync to sync with LDAP/AD (FreeIPA)
Ranger Usersync can be manually configured to sync users and groups from multiple
        sync sources, using FreeIPA deployed in public cloud. 

By default, Ranger Usersync uses sssd to sync users and groups from a Unix source.
                This can affect performance and limit scale. This runtime release
                supports LDAP/AD as a default sync source. Additionally, Ranger Usersync can be
                manually configured to:
update users and groups from multiple (LDAP/AD, Unix and file) sync
                        sources
map cloud ID settings from multiple (LDAP/AD, Unix and file) sync
                        sources
customize the default sync interval
sync directly from FreeIPA deployed in public cloud

Cloud ids for these users and groups are synced to ranger
                        admin.noteThis will be populated by default. The above can also be
                        manually overridden.
