Setting credentials for Ranger Usersync custom keystore
How to set the custom keystore file location and password for a Ranger Usersync
        custom keystore.

Ranger Usersync role creates a default keystore file,
                    ranger.usersync.keystore.file during restart. UNIX
                authentication in Ranger Admin requires this keystore file. The keystore file takes
                a password from the ranger.usersync.keystore.password
                configuration, exposed in Cloudera Manager supporting CDP 7.1.6 and higher. 
Setting custom keystore credentials for Ranger Usersync overrides the default
                    credentials.note Setting custom keystore credentials
                    addresses the issue of using the default, self-signed certificate created for
                    usersync for port 5151. After performing this procedure, you can use your
                    custom, CA-signed certificate. 
To set Ranger Usersync custom keystore credentials:


In Cloudera Manager > Ranger > Configuration, type Ranger Usersync Advanced Configuration
                        Snippet in the search field.

In Ranger Usersync Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                    conf/ranger-ugsync-site.xml , enter the following: 


In Name, type: ranger.usersync.keystore.file 


In Value, type:
                                <keystore_file_path>




In Cloudera Manager > Ranger > Configuration, type Usersync Keystore Password in the
                    search field.

In ranger.usersync.keystore.password, type a new
                    password. 

Click Save Changes. 

Restart Ranger Usersync.

 Ranger uses the custom keystore file location and password values instead of the
            default values.
