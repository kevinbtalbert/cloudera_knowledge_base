Deleting a group
How to delete a group in Ranger.
Only users with the "admin" role can delete a group. 
In the Ranger Admin Web UI, select Settings > Users/Groups/Roles > Groups. 
The Groups page appears. 



Select the check box of the group you want to delete, then click Delete.






Click OK on the confirmation pop-up.
Users in a deleted group will be reassigned to no group. You can edit these users and reassign
            them to other groups.
