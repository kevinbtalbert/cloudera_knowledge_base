Replicating data between Data Hub clusters with SRM deployed in a Data Hub cluster.Cloudera Docs
Replicating data between Data Hub clusters with SRM deployed in a Data Hub
    cluster.
You can set up and configure an instance of SRM in a Data Hub cluster to replicate
    data between Data Hub clusters. In addition, you can use SMM to monitor the replication process.
    Review the following example to learn how this can be set up.

Consider the following replication scenario:

In this scenario, data is replicated between two Data Hub clusters that are provisioned in
        different CDP environments. More specifically, data in Data Hub East is replicated to Data
        Hub West by an instance of SRM running in Data Hub West.
Both Data Hub clusters are provisioned with the default Streams Messaging cluster
        definitions.
SRM and SMM are available in both clusters, but the instances in Data Hub East are not
        utilized in this scenario.


This example scenario does not go into detail on how to
          set up the clusters and assumes the following:


Two Data Hub clusters provisioned with the Streams Messaging Light Duty or Heavy Duty
            cluster definition are available. 
For more information, see
              
              Setting up your Streams Messaging cluster
              in the CDF for Data Hub library. Alternatively, you can also review the cloud provider
              specific cluster creation instructions available in the Cloudera Data Hub library.

Network connectivity and DNS resolution are
            established between the clusters.

importantIn the following scenario, a new
          CDP machine user is created and set up specifically for SRM. Alternatively, it is also
          possible to use an existing machine user and skip steps 1 through 3, but this can only be
          done if the following requirements are met:
The existing machine user has access to your CDP environment.
The existing machine user has the correct Ranger permissions assigned to it.
You have access to the existing machine user's credentials.


Create a machine user for SRM in Management Console:A machine user is
          required so that SRM has credentials that it can use to connect to the Kafka service in
          the Data Hub cluster. This step is only required in the environment where SRM is not
          running. In the case of this example, this is the CDP Public Cloud East
          environment.

Navigate to Management Console  >  User Management.


Click Actions  >  Create Machine User.


Enter a unique name for the user and click Create.
For example: srm
After the user is created, you are presented with a page that displays the
                user details. note
The Workload User Name (srv_srm), is
                    different from the actual machine user name (srm). The
                      Workload User Name is the identifier you use to
                    configure SRM.



Click Set Workload Password.


Type a password in the Password and Confirm
                  Password fields. Leave the Environment field
                blank.


Click Set Workload Password.
A message appears on successful password creation.

Grant the machine user access to your environment:You must to grant the
          machine user access in your environments, otherwise SRM will not be able to connect to the
          Kafka service with this user. This step is only required in the environments where SRM is
          not running. In the case of this example this is the CDP Public Cloud East
          environment.

Navigate to Management Console  >  Environments, and select the environment where your Kafka cluster is
                located.


Click Actions  >  Manage Access.
Use the search box to find and select the machine user you want to use.
A list of Resource Roles appears.


Select the EnvironmentUser role and click
                  Update Roles.


Go back to the Environment Details page and click Actions  >  Synchronize Users to FreeIPA.


On the Synchronize Users page, click  Synchronize
                  Users.
Synchronizing users ensures that the role assignment is in effect for the
                environment. importantWait until this process is completed. Otherwise,
                  you will not be able to continue with the next step.


Add Ranger permissions for the user you created for SRM.

This step is only required in the environment where SRM is not running. In the case of
            this example the environment is the CDP Public Cloud East .



Navigate to Management Console  >  Environments, and select the environment where your Kafka cluster is
                located.


Click the Ranger link on the Environment Details page.


Select the resource-based service corresponding to the Kafka resource in the Data
                Hub cluster.


Add the Workload User Name of the user you created for SRM
                to the following Ranger policies:


All - consumergroup
All - topic
All - transactionalid
All - cluster
All - delegationtoken




Establish trust between the clusters:A truststore is needed so that the
          SRM instance running in Data Hub West can trust Data Hub East. To do this, you extract the
          FreeIPA certificate from Environment East, create a truststore that includes the
          certificate, and copy the truststore to all hosts on Data Hub West. 
Navigate to Management Console
                   >  Environments, and select
              Environment East. 

Go to the FreeIPA tab.


Click Get FreeIPA Certificate.
The FreeIPA certificate file, [***ENVIRONMENT
                    NAME***].crt, is downloaded to your computer.

Run the following command to create the truststore:
keytool \
  -importcert \
  -storetype JKS \
  -noprompt \
  -keystore truststore-east.jks \
  -storepass [***PASSWORD***] \
  -alias freeipa-east-ca \
  -file [***PATH TO FREEIPA CERTIFICATE***]

Copy the truststore-east.jks file to a common location on
              all the hosts in your Data Hub West cluster.Cloudera recommends that you
              use the following location:
                /opt/cloudera/security/truststore-east.jks.
Set the correct file permissions.Use 751 for the directory and
              444 for the truststore file.
Access the Cloudera Manager instance of the Data Hub West cluster. Define the external Kafka cluster (Data Hub East): 
Go to Administration > External
                  Accounts.
Go to the Kafka Credentials tab.On this
              tab you will create a credential for each external cluster taking part in the
              replication process. 
Click Add Kafka credentials
Configure the Kafka credentials:In the case of this example, you
              must create a single credential representing the Data Hub East cluster. For
              example:Name=dheast
Bootstrap servers=[***MY-DATAHUB-EAST-CLUSTER-HOST-1.COM:9093***],[***MY-DATAHUB-EAST-CLUSTER-HOST-2:9093***]
Security Protocol=SASL_SSL
JAAS Secret 1=[***WORKLOAD USER NAME***]
JAAS Secret 2=[***MACHINE USER PASSWORD***]
JAAS Template=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="##JAAS_SECRET_1##" password="##JAAS_SECRET_2##"; 
SASL Mechanism=PLAIN
Truststore Password=[***PASSWORD***] 
Truststore Path=/opt/cloudera/security/truststore-east.jks
Truststore type=JKS


Click Add.If credential creation is
              successful, a new entry corresponding to the Kafka credential you specified appears on
              the page.
Define the co-located Kafka cluster (Data Hub West):
noteSome of the following properties might already be
          configured by automation.

In Cloudera Manager, go to Clusters and select the
              Streams Replication Manager service.
Go to Configuration.
Find and enable the Kafka Service
            property.
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Co-located
                Kafka Cluster Alias property.The alias you configure
              represents the co-located cluster. Enter an alias that is unique and easily
              identifiable. For example:dhwest
Enable relevant security feature toggles.Because the Data Hub
              cluster is both TLS/SSL and Kerberos enabled, you must enable all feature toggles for
              both the Driver and Service roles. The feature toggles are the following:
Enable TLS/SSL for SRM Driver
Enable TLS/SSL for SRM Service
Enable Kerberos Authentication

Add both clusters to SRM's configuration:
Find and configure the External Kafka Accounts
              property.Add the name of all Kafka credentials you created to
              this property. This can be done by clicking the add button to add a new line to the
              property and then entering the name of the Kafka credential. For
              example:dheast
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Cluster
                alias property.Add all cluster aliases to this property.
              This includes the aliases present in both the External Kafka
                Accounts and Streams Replication Manager Co-located Kafka
                Cluster Alias properties. Delimit the aliases with commas. For
              example:dheast,dhwest
Configure replications:
In this example data is replicated unidirectionally. As a result, only a single
            replication must be configured.

Find the Streams Replication
                Manager's Replication Configs property.
Click the add button and add new lines
              for each unique replication you want to add and enable.
Add and enable your replications. For example:
dheast->dhwest.enabled=true

Configure Driver and Service role targets:
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Service Target
                Cluster property. Add the co-located cluster's alias to the
              property. For example:dhwest
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Driver Target
                Cluster property. For
                example:dheast,dhwestimportantIf you have
                another SRM instance configured with the same clusters and is targeting Data Hub
                East, the dheast alias should not be configured as a target for
                this instance of SRM.noteThis property must either contain all aliases or
          left blank. Leaving the property blank has the same effect as adding all aliases.
Configure the srm-control tool:
Click Gateway in the Filters
              pane.
Find and configure the following properties:noteSome of the following properties might already be
                configured by automation.
SRM Client's Secure Storage Password:
                    [***PASSWORD***]
Environment Variable Holding SRM Client's Secure Storage
                    Password: SECURESTOREPASS
Gateway TLS/SSL Trust Store File:
                    /opt/cloudera/security/truststore-west.jks
Gateway TLS/SSL Truststore Password:
                    [***PASSWORD***]
SRM Client's Kerberos Principal Name: [***MY
                    KERBEROS PRINCIPAL****]
SRM Client's Kerberos Keytab Location: [***PATH
                    TO KEYTAB FILE***]
Take note of the password you configure in SRM Client's Secure Storage
                Password and the name you configure in Environment Variable
                Holding SRM Client's Secure Storage Password. You will need to provide
              both of these in your CLI session before running the tool.
Click Save Changes.
Restart the SRM service.
Deploy client configuration for SRM.
Start the replication process using the srm-control tool:
SSH as an administrator to any of the SRM hosts in the Data Hub West
              cluster.
ssh [***USER***]@[***DATA-HUB-WEST-CLUSTER-HOST-1.COM***]

Set the secure storage password as an environment variable.
export [***SECURE STORAGE ENV VAR***]=”[***SECURE STORAGE PASSWORD***]”
Replace [***SECURE STORAGE ENV VAR***] with the name of the
                environment variable you specified in Environment Variable Holding SRM
                  Client's Secure Storage Password. Replace [***SRM SECURE
                  STORAGE PASSWORD***] with the password you specified in SRM
                  Client's Secure Storage Password. For example:
                export SECURESTOREPASS=”mypassword"

Use the srm-control tool with the topics subcommand to add
              topics to the allow list.
srm-control topics --source dheast --target dhwest --add [***TOPIC NAME***]

Use the srm-control tool with the groups subcommand to add
              groups to the allow list.
srm-control groups --source dheast --target dhwest --add ".*"



Monitor the replication process.
Access the SMM UI in the Data Hub West cluster and go to the Cluster
            Replications page. The replications you set up will be visible on this
            page.noteIf the topics or groups you added for replication
          are newly created, they might not be immediately visible. This is due to how frequently
          SRM checks for newly created topics and consumer groups. By default, this is set to 10
          minutes, but can be configured with the Refresh Topics Interval
            Seconds and Refresh Groups Interval Seconds SRM
          properties. If at first your topics do not appear, wait a few minutes and refresh the
          page.
