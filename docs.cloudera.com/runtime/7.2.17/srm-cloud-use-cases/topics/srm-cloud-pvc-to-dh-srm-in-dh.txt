Replicating data from CDP PvC Base cluster to  Data Hub cluster with SRM deployed in
    Data Hub cluster 
You can set up and configure an instance of SRM running in a Data Hub cluster to
    replicate data between the Data Hub cluster and a CDP PvC Base cluster. In addition, you can use
    SMM to monitor the replication process. Review the following example to learn how this can be
    set up.

Consider the following replication scenario:

In this scenario, data is replicated from a CDP PvC Base cluster to a Data Hub cluster by
        an SRM instance that is deployed in the Data Hub cluster. 
The CDP PvC Base cluster has Kafka deployed on it. It is a secure cluster that has TLS/SSL
        encryption enabled and uses PLAIN authentication. In addition, it uses Ranger for
        authorization.
The Data Hub cluster is provisioned with the one of the default Streams Messaging cluster
        definitions. 


This example scenario does not go into detail on how to
          set up the clusters and assumes the following:

A Data Hub cluster provisioned with the
            Streams Messaging Light Duty or Heavy Duty cluster definition is available. For more information, see
              
              Setting up your Streams Messaging cluster
              in the CDF for Data Hub library. Alternatively, you can also review the cloud provider
              specific cluster creation instructions available in the Cloudera Data Hub library.

A CDP PvC Base cluster with Kafka is available. This cluster has TLS/SSL encryption
            enabled, uses PLAIN authentication, and has Ranger for authorization. For more
            information, see the CDP Private Cloud Base Installation Guide.

Network connectivity and DNS resolution are
            established between the clusters.



Obtain PLAIN credentials for SRM.
The credentials of a PLAIN user that can access the CDP PvC Base cluster are required.
          These credentials are supplied to SRM in a later step. In this example [***PLAIN
            USER***] and [***PLAIN USER PASSWORD***] is used to refer
          to these credentials.noteTypically, Kerberos cannot be easily configured to span across
            an on-premise and a public cloud environment. Therefore, these instructions assume that
            these environments use authentication methods that are easy to interoperate in such
            hybrid environments like LDAP or PAM authentication. For more information on how you can
            configure your Kafka service to use LDAP or PAM, see Kafka
            Authentication.
Add Ranger permissions for the PLAIN user in the CDP PvC cluster:
You must ensure that the PLAIN user you obtained has correct permissions assigned to it
            in Ranger. Otherwise, SRM will not be able to access Kafka resources on the CDP PvC Base
            cluster.


Access the Cloudera Manager instance of your CDP
                PvC Base cluster.


Go to Ranger >  Ranger Admin Web UI.


Log in to the Ranger Console (Ranger Admin Web UI).

Add the [***PLAIN USER***] to the following
              policies:

All - consumergroup
All - topic
All - transactionalid
All - cluster
All - delegationtoken


Acquire the CDP PvC Base cluster truststore and add it to the Data Hub
          cluster:The actions you need to take differ depending on how TLS is set up in
          the CDP PvC Base cluster:Auto TLSManual TLS
Obtain the certificate of the Cloudera Manager root Certificate Authority and its
                  password.The Certificate Authority certificate and its password can be obtained
                  using the Cloudera Manager API. The following steps describe how you can retrieve
                  the certificate and password using the Cloudera Manager API
                    Explorer. Alternatively, you can also retrieve the certificate and
                  password by calling the appropriate endpoints in your browser window or using
                    curl.
Access the Cloudera Manager instance of your CDP PvC Base cluster.
Go to Support > API
                        Explorer.
Find CertManagerResource.
Select the /certs/truststore GET operation and click
                      Try it out.
Enter the truststore type.
Click Execute.
Click Download file under
                      Responses.The downloaded file is your
                      certificate.
Select the /certs/truststorePassword GET operation and
                    click Try it out.
Click Execute.The password is displayed under
                        Responses.

Run the following command to create the
                  truststore:keytool \
  -importcert \
  -storetype JKS \
  -noprompt \
  -keystore cdppvc-truststore.jks \
  -storepass ***PASSWORD*** \
  -alias cdppvc-cm-ca \
  -file ***PATH TO CM CA CERTIFICATE***
Note
                  down the password, it is needed in a later step.
Copy the cdpdc-truststore.jks file to a common location on all
                the hosts in your CDP Data Hub cluster. Cloudera recommends that you use the
                  following location:
                  /opt/cloudera/security/cdppvc-truststore.jks.
Set the correct file permissions.Use 751 for the directory and 444 for the
                  truststore file.

Note down the CDP PvC Base cluster's truststore location and password, these
                should be known to you.
Copy the truststore file to a common location on all the hosts in your CDP Data
                Hub cluster.  Cloudera recommends that you use the following location:
                    /opt/cloudera/security/truststore.jks.
Set the correct file permissions.Use 751 for the directory and 444 for the
                  truststore file.
Access the Cloudera Manager instance of your Data Hub Cluster.Define the external Kafka cluster (CDP PvC Base).
Go to Administration > External
                  Accounts.
Go to the Kafka Credentials tab.On this
              tab you will create a credential for each external cluster taking part in the
              replication process. 
Click Add Kafka credentials
Configure the Kafka credentials:In the case of this example, you
              must create a single credential representing the CDP PvC Base cluster. For
                example:Name=cdppvc
Bootstrap servers=[***MY-CDP-PVC-CLUSTER-HOST-1.COM:9093***],[***MY-CDP-PVC-CLUSTER-HOST-2:9093***]
Security Protocol=SASL_SSL
JAAS Secret 1=[***PLAIN USER***]
JAAS Secret 2=[***PLAIN USER PASSWORD***]
JAAS Template=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="##JAAS_SECRET_1##" password="##JAAS_SECRET_2##"; 
SASL Mechanism=PLAIN
Truststore Password=[***PASSWORD***] 
Truststore Path=/opt/cloudera/security/cdppvc-truststore.jks
Truststore type=JKS
noteThe
                properties you specify for the  Kafka credential depend on the security
                configuration of the CDP PvC Base cluster. This specific example is for a cluster
                that has TLS/SSL encryption and PLAIN authentication enabled. You must change these
                configurations based on the setup of your CDP PvC Base
            cluster.
Click Add.If credential creation is
              successful, a new entry corresponding to the Kafka credential you specified appears on
              the page.
Define the co-located Kafka cluster (Datahub):
noteSome of the following properties might already be
          configured by automation.

In Cloudera Manager, go to Clusters and select the
              Streams Replication Manager service.
Go to Configuration.
Find and enable the Kafka Service
            property.
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Co-located
                Kafka Cluster Alias property.The alias you configure
              represents the co-located cluster. Enter an alias that is unique and easily
              identifiable. For example:datahub
Enable relevant security feature toggles.Because the Data Hub
              cluster is both TLS/SSL and Kerberos enabled, you must enable all feature toggles for
              both the Driver and Service roles. The feature toggles are the following:
Enable TLS/SSL for SRM Driver
Enable TLS/SSL for SRM Service
Enable Kerberos Authentication

Add both clusters to SRM's configuration:
Find and configure the External Kafka Accounts
              property.Add the name of all Kafka credentials you created to
              this property. This can be done by clicking the add button to add a new line to the
              property and then entering the name of the Kafka credential. For
              example:cdppvc
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Cluster
                alias property.Add all cluster aliases to this property.
              This includes the aliases present in both the External Kafka
                Accounts and Streams Replication Manager Co-located Kafka
                Cluster Alias properties. Delimit the aliases with commas. For
              example:datahub,cdppvc
Configure replications:
In this example data is replicated unidirectionally. As a result, only a single
            replication must be configured.

Find the Streams Replication
                Manager's Replication Configs property.
Click the add button and add new lines
              for each unique replication you want to add and enable.
Add and enable your replications. For example:
cdppvc->datahub.enabled=true

Configure Driver and Service role targets:
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Service Target
                Cluster property. Add the co-located cluster's alias to the
              property. For example:datahub
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Driver Target
                Cluster property. For
                example:datahub,cdppvcimportantIf you have
                another SRM instance configured with the same clusters and is targeting the CDP PvC
                Base cluster, the cdppvc alias should not be configured as a target
                for this instance of SRM.noteThis property must either contain all aliases or
          left blank. Leaving the property blank has the same effect as adding all aliases.
Configure the srm-control tool:
Click Gateway in the Filters
              pane.
Find and configure the following properties:
SRM Client's Secure Storage Password:
                    [***PASSWORD***]
Environment Variable Holding SRM Client's Secure Storage
                    Password: SECURESTOREPASS
Gateway TLS/SSL Trust Store File:
                    /opt/cloudera/security/datahub-truststore.jks
Gateway TLS/SSL Truststore Password:
                    [***PASSWORD***]
SRM Client's Kerberos Principal Name: [***MY
                    KERBEROS PRINCIPAL****]
SRM Client's Kerberos Keytab Location: [***PATH
                    TO KEYTAB FILE***]
Take note of the password you configure in SRM Client's Secure Storage
                Password and the name you configure in Environment Variable
                Holding SRM Client's Secure Storage Password. You will need to provide
              both of these in your CLI session before running the tool.
Click Save Changes.
Restart the SRM service.
Deploy client configuration for SRM.
Start the replication process using the srm-control tool:
SSH as an administrator to any of the SRM hosts in the Data Hub
              cluster.
ssh [***USER***]@[***MY-DATAHUB-CLUSTER.COM***]

Set the secure storage password as an environment variable.
export [***SECURE STORAGE ENV VAR***]=”[***SECURE STORAGE PASSWORD***]”
Replace [***SECURE STORAGE ENV VAR***] with the name of the
                environment variable you specified in Environment Variable Holding SRM
                  Client's Secure Storage Password. Replace [***SRM SECURE
                  STORAGE PASSWORD***] with the password you specified in SRM
                  Client's Secure Storage Password. For example:
                export SECURESTOREPASS=”mypassword"

Use the srm-control tool with the topics subcommand to add
              topics to the allow list.
srm-control topics --source cdppvc --target datahub --add [***TOPIC NAME***]

Use the srm-control tool with the groups subcommand to add
              groups to the allow list.
srm-control groups --source cdppvc --target datahub --add ".*"



Monitor the replication process.
Access the SMM UI in the Data Hub cluster and go to the Cluster
            Replications page. The replications you set up will be visible on this
            page.noteIf the topics or groups you added for replication
          are newly created, they might not be immediately visible. This is due to how frequently
          SRM checks for newly created topics and consumer groups. By default, this is set to 10
          minutes, but can be configured with the Refresh Topics Interval
            Seconds and Refresh Groups Interval Seconds SRM
          properties. If at first your topics do not appear, wait a few minutes and refresh the
          page.
