Replicating data from  CDP PvC Base cluster to Data Hub cluster with SRM running in  CDP
    PvC Base cluster
You can set up and configure an instance of SRM running in a CDP PvC Base cluster to
    replicate data between the CDP PvC Base cluster and a Data Hub cluster. In addition, you can use
    SMM to monitor the replication process. Review the following example to learn how this can be
    set up.

Consider the following replication scenario:

In this scenario, data is replicated from a CDP PvC Base cluster that has Kafka, SRM, and
        SMM deployed on it. This is a secure cluster that has TLS/SSL encryption and Kerberos
        authentication enabled. In addition, it uses Ranger for authorization.
Data is being replicated from this cluster by SRM deployed in this cluster to a Data Hub
        cluster.
The Data Hub cluster is provisioned with one of the default Streams Messaging cluster
        definitions. 


This example scenario does not go into detail on how to
          set up the clusters and assumes the following:

A Data Hub cluster provisioned with the
            Streams Messaging Light Duty or Heavy Duty cluster definition is available. For more information, see
              
              Setting up your Streams Messaging cluster
              in the CDF for Data Hub library. Alternatively, you can also review the cloud provider
              specific cluster creation instructions available in the Cloudera Data Hub library.
A CDP PvC Base cluster with Kafka, SRM, and SMM is available. This cluster is TLS/SSL
          and Kerberos enabled. In addition, it uses Ranger for authorization. For more
            information, see the CDP Private Cloud Base Installation
          Guide.
Network connectivity and DNS resolution are
            established between the clusters.

This example scenario demonstrates the configuration required to enable replication
        monitoring of the Data Hub cluster with Streams Messaging Manager. This can be done by
        configuring the SRM Service role to target (monitor) the Data Hub cluster. This is done as
        the last step in the following list of steps and is marked optional. This is because
        enabling replication monitoring of the Data Hub cluster results in a number of caveats,
        which are the following:

The SRM Service role will generate additional cloud traffic.Any extra traffic you
            might have in your cloud deployment can lead to additional cloud costs.
The replications tab in SMM will display all replications targeting the Data Hub
          cluster. Although this is expected, you must understand that all other pages in SMM
            will display information regarding the CDP PvC cluster. A setup like this might lead to
            confusion or mislead users on what this specific instance of SMM is monitoring.
You will lose the ability to monitor the replications targeting the CDP PvC cluster.
            This is only critical if you have any existing replications that are targeting the
            CDP PvC cluster and you are monitoring these replications with the SMM instance running
            in the CDP PvC cluster.

importantIn the following scenario, a new
          CDP machine user is created and set up specifically for SRM. Alternatively, it is also
          possible to use an existing machine user and skip steps 1 through 3, but this can only be
          done if the following requirements are met:
The existing machine user has access to your CDP environment.
The existing machine user has the correct Ranger permissions assigned to it.
You have access to the existing machine user's credentials.



Create a machine user for SRM in Management Console:
A machine user is required so that SRM has credentials that it can use to connect to
          the Kafka service in the Data Hub cluster.


Navigate to Management Console  >  User Management.


Click Actions  >  Create Machine User.


Enter a unique name for the user and click Create.
For example: srm
After the user is created, you are presented with a page that displays the
                user details. note
The Workload User Name (srv_srm), is
                    different from the actual machine user name (srm). The
                      Workload User Name is the identifier you use to
                    configure SRM.



Click Set Workload Password.


Type a password in the Password and Confirm
                  Password fields. Leave the Environment field
                blank.


Click Set Workload Password.
A message appears on successful password creation.


Grant the machine user access to your environment:You must grant the
          machine user access to your environment  for SRM to connect to the Kafka service with this
          user.

Navigate to Management Console  >  Environments, and select the environment where your Kafka cluster is
                located.


Click Actions  >  Manage Access.
Use the search box to find and select the machine user you want to use.
A list of Resource Roles appears.


Select the EnvironmentUser role and click
                  Update Roles.


Go back to the Environment Details page and click Actions  >  Synchronize Users to FreeIPA.


On the Synchronize Users page, click  Synchronize
                  Users.
Synchronizing users ensures that the role assignment is in effect for the
                environment. importantWait until this process is completed. Otherwise,
                  you will not be able to continue with the next step.


Add Ranger permissions for the user you created for SRM in the Data Hub cluster:
You must to grant the necessary privileges to the user so that the user can access
          Kafka resources. This is configured through Ranger policies.


Navigate to Management Console  >  Environments, and select the environment where your Kafka cluster is
                located.


Click the Ranger link on the Environment Details page.


Select the resource-based service corresponding to the Kafka resource in the Data
                Hub cluster.


Add the Workload User Name of the user you created for SRM
                to the following Ranger policies:


All - consumergroup
All - topic
All - transactionalid
All - cluster
All - delegationtoken




Ensure that Ranger permissions exist for the streamsrepmgr user in
          the CDP PvC Base cluster:

Access the Cloudera Manager instance of your CDP
                PvC Base cluster.


Go to Ranger >  Ranger Admin Web UI.


Log in to the Ranger Console (Ranger Admin Web UI).

Ensure that the streamsrepmgr user is added to all required
              policies. If the user is missing, add it. The required policies are as
                follows:
All - consumergroup
All - topic
All - transactionalid
All - cluster
All - delegationtoken

Create a truststore on the CDP PvC Base cluster:A truststore is
          required so that the SRM instance running in the CDP PvC Base cluster can trust the secure
          Data Hub cluster. To do this, you extract the FreeIPA certificate from the CDP
          environment, create a truststore that includes the certificate, and copy the truststore to
          all hosts on the CDP PvC Base cluster. 

Navigate to Management Console  >  Environments, and select the environment where your Kafka cluster is
                located.


Go to the FreeIPA tab.


Click Get FreeIPA Certificate.
The FreeIPA certificate file, [***ENVIRONMENT
                    NAME***].crt, is downloaded to your computer.

Run the following command to create the truststore:
keytool \
  -importcert \
  -storetype JKS \
  -noprompt \
  -keystore datahub-truststore.jks \
  -storepass [***PASSWORD***] \
  -alias freeipa-ca \
  -file [***PATH TO FREEIPA CERTIFICATE***]

Copy the datahub-truststore.jks file to a common location
              on all the hosts in your CDP PvC Base cluster.Cloudera recommends that you
              use the following location:
                /opt/cloudera/security/datahub-truststore.jks.
Set the correct file permissions.Use 751 for the directory and
              444 for the truststore file.
Access the Cloudera Manager instance of your CDP
                PvC Base cluster.Define the external Kafka cluster (Data Hub): 
Go to Administration > External
                  Accounts.
Go to the Kafka Credentials tab.On this
              tab you will create a credential for each external cluster taking part in the
              replication process. 
Click Add Kafka credentials.
Configure the Kafka credentials:In the case of this example, you
              must create a single credential representing the Data Hub cluster. For
              example:Name=datahub
Bootstrap servers=[**MY-DATAHUB-CLUSTER-HOST-1.COM:9093***],[***MY-DATAHUB-CLUSTER-HOST-1.COM:9093***]
Security Protocol=SASL_SSL
JAAS Secret 1=[***WORKLOAD USER NAME***]
JAAS Secret 2=[***MACHINE USER PASSWORD***]
JAAS Template=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="##JAAS_SECRET_1##" password="##JAAS_SECRET_2##"; 
SASL Mechanism=PLAIN
Truststore Password=[***PASSWORD***] 
Truststore Path=/opt/cloudera/security/datahub-truststore.jks
Truststore type=JKS


Click Add.If credential creation is
              successful, a new entry corresponding to the Kafka credential you specified appears on
              the page.
Define the co-located Kafka cluster (PvC Base):
In Cloudera Manager, go to Clusters and select the
              Streams Replication Manager service.
Go to Configuration.
Find and enable the Kafka Service
            property.
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Co-located
                Kafka Cluster Alias property.The alias you configure
              represents the co-located cluster. Enter an alias that is unique and easily
              identifiable. For example:cdppvc
Enable relevant security feature toggles.Because CDP PvC Base is
              both TLS/SSL and Kerberos enabled, you must enable all feature toggles for both the
              Driver and Service roles. The feature toggles are the following:
Enable TLS/SSL for SRM Driver
Enable TLS/SSL for SRM Service
Enable Kerberos Authentication

Add both clusters to SRM's configuration:
Find and configure the External Kafka Accounts
              property.Add the name of all Kafka credentials you created to
              this property. This can be done by clicking the add button to add a new line to the
              property and then entering the name of the Kafka credential. For
              example:datahub
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Cluster
                alias property.Add all cluster aliases to this property.
              This includes the aliases present in both the External Kafka
                Accounts and Streams Replication Manager Co-located Kafka
                Cluster Alias properties. Delimit the aliases with commas. For
              example:datahub,cdppvc
Configure replications:
In this example data is replicated unidirectionally. As a result, only a single
            replication must be configured.

Find the Streams Replication
                Manager's Replication Configs property.
Click the add button and add new lines
              for each unique replication you want to add and enable.
Add and enable your replications. For example:
cdppvc->datahub.enabled=true

Configure Driver and Service role targets:
Find and  configure the Streams Replication Manager Service
                Target Cluster property. Add the co-located cluster's alias
              to the property. For example:cdppvcSetting this property to
                  cdppvc does not enable you to monitor the replications targeting
                the Data Hub cluster. It is possible to add the Data Hub cluster alias to this
                property and as a result monitor the Data Hub cluster. However, this can lead to
                unwanted behaviour. See the Before you begin section for more
                information.
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Driver Target
                Cluster property. For example:datahub,cdppvcnoteThis property must either contain all aliases or
          left blank. Leaving the property blank has the same effect as adding all aliases.
Configure the srm-control tool:
Click Gateway in the Filters
              pane.
Find and configure the following properties:
SRM Client's Secure Storage Password:
                    [***PASSWORD***]
Environment Variable Holding SRM Client's Secure Storage
                    Password: SECURESTOREPASS
Gateway TLS/SSL Trust Store File: [***CDP PVC
                    BASE GLOBAL TRUSTSTORE LOCATION***]
Gateway TLS/SSL Truststore Password: [***CDP PVC
                    BASE GLOBAL TRUSTSTORE PASSWORD***]
SRM Client's Kerberos Principal Name: [***MY
                    KERBEROS PRINCIPAL****]
SRM Client's Kerberos Keytab Location: [***PATH
                    TO KEYTAB FILE***]
Take note of the password you configure in SRM Client's Secure Storage
                Password and the name you configure in Environment Variable
                Holding SRM Client's Secure Storage Password. You will need to provide
              both of these in your CLI session before running the tool.
Click Save Changes.
Restart the SRM service.
Deploy client configuration for SRM.
Start the replication process using the srm-control tool:
SSH as an administrator to any of the SRM hosts in the CDP PvC
              cluster.
ssh [***USER***]@[***MY-CDP-PVC-CLUSTER.COM***]

Set the secure storage password as an environment variable.
export [***SECURE STORAGE ENV VAR***]=”[***SECURE STORAGE PASSWORD***]”
Replace [***SECURE STORAGE ENV VAR***] with the name of the
                environment variable you specified in Environment Variable Holding SRM
                  Client's Secure Storage Password. Replace [***SRM SECURE
                  STORAGE PASSWORD***] with the password you specified in SRM
                  Client's Secure Storage Password. For example:
                export SECURESTOREPASS=”mypassword"

Use the srm-control tool with the topics subcommand to add
              topics to the allow list.
srm-control topics --source cdppvc --target datahub --add [***TOPIC NAME***]

Use the srm-control tool with the groups subcommand to add
              groups to the allow list.
srm-control groups --source cdppvc --target datahub --add ".*"


Optional: Configure replication monitoring of the Data Hub
          cluster:
Access the Cloudera Manager instance of your CDP PvC Base
            cluster.
In Cloudera Manager, go to Clusters and select the
              Streams Replication Manager service.
Go to Configuration.
Find and configure the Streams Replication Manager Service Target
                Cluster property. Replace the alias set in the property with
              the Data Hub cluster's alias. For
            example:datahub
Click Save Changes.
Restart the SRM service. 
Access the SMM UI in the CDP PvC Base cluster and go to the
                Cluster Replications page.The replications you
              set up will be visible on this page.noteIf the topics or groups you added for replication
          are newly created, they might not be immediately visible. This is due to how frequently
          SRM checks for newly created topics and consumer groups. By default, this is set to 10
          minutes, but can be configured with the Refresh Topics Interval
            Seconds and Refresh Groups Interval Seconds SRM
          properties. If at first your topics do not appear, wait a few minutes and refresh the
          page.
