Configuring SRM Driver retry behaviour
If a target Kafka cluster is not available at startup, the replications targeting
    that cluster are not set up. In a case like this, the Streams Replication Manager (SRM) Driver
    sets up the replications for available clusters and retries replication setup for the
    unavailable clusters. Retry behaviour can be configured in Cloudera Manager. 

By default the SRM Driver is configured to retry indefinitely with a retry interval of
        10000 ms (10 seconds). Both the retry count and retry interval can be configured in Cloudera
        Manager using the Retry Count for SRM Driver and Retry
          Delay for SRM Driver properties. 

Retry Count for SRM Driver 
Configures the maximum number of retries. The default value of -1 means that retries
            are carried out indefinitely. If the configured retry count is reached, the SRM Driver
            will stop. Additionally, setting the property to 0 is the same as setting it to 1.


Retry Delay for SRM Driver 
Configures the interval at which retries happen, this is the delay (in ms) between
            each retry. 

noteWhen retries are happening, at least one of the configured replications is not running
        as expected. As a result, the DISTRIBUTED_HERDER_STATUS health test returns
        that replication status is bad. Based on the health test result, Cloudera Manager will
        display that the SRM Driver is in bad (red) health. 

In Cloudera Manager, select the Kafka service. Go to Configuration.Find and configure the following properties:

Retry Count for SRM Driver
Retry Delay for SRM Driver

Click Save Changes.Restart the Streams Replication Manager service.
Retry behaviour is configured for the SRM Driver. The SRM Driver uses the configured
      values if a Kafka cluster is unavailable at startup.
