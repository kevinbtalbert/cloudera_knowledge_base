Configuring replication specific Kafka Connect REST servers
The SRM Driver role starts a dedicated Kafka Connect REST server for each replication
    that you set up and configure. These REST servers make communication possible between the
    different instances of the SRM driver. Communication between the driver instances in turn
    ensures that replication does not fail when there are multiple driver instances present in a
    single cluster.

If required, you can configure each replication’s dedicated REST server that is set up by
        the driver. 
REST server properties can be configured through the Streams Replication Manager's
          Replication Configs property by using two specific prefixes. These prefixes are the
        following:

***ALIAS***->***ALIAS***.worker.
This prefix can be used to set any Kafka Connect REST server property for a
            replication’s dedicated REST server. The first element of the prefix determines which
            replication’s REST server is being configured. For example, the
              primary->secondary.worker. prefix can be used to configure the
              primary->secondary replication’s REST server. While configuration of
            all REST server properties is supported, the main use case for this prefix is to set the
            ports of the REST servers. The reason for this is that by default the REST servers will
            bind to port 0, that is, any available port. This behaviour may not be suitable for your
            deployment. importantThe rest.host.name and
                rest.port properties should not be used with this prefix. Use
                the listeners property instead if you want to configure
              ports.
listeners.https.
This prefix can be used to configure SSL related properties. You can use this prefix
            to override the SSL settings that the REST server inherits from the service
            configuration. For example, if the REST server needs to use a different keystore
            location than the one provided in the service configuration, you can use the following
            property:listeners.https.ssl.keystore.location=***CUSTOM KEYSTORE LOCATION***


In Cloudera Manager, select the Streams Replication Manager service.Go to Configuration.Find the Streams Replication Manager's Replication Configs
          property.Click the add button and add new lines for each additional property you want to
          configure.Add configuration properties. For example:
primary->secondary.worker.listeners=HTTPS://myhost:8084
listeners.https.ssl.keystore.location=***CUSTOM KEYSTORE LOCATION***
Enter a Reason for change, and then click  Save Changes to
          commit the changes.Restart Streams Replication Manager.
Custom configuration of the Kafka Connect REST server is complete.
