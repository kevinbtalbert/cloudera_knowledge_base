Active / Stand-by Architecture
 Active / Stand-by architecture example for SRM.In an Active / Stand-by scenario, you set up two Kafka clusters and configure SRM to
      replicate topics bidirectionally between both clusters. A VIP or load balancer directs your
      producers to ingest messages into the active cluster from which consumer groups are reading
      from.Figure 1. Active / Stand-by Architecture Standard Operation
In case
      of a disaster, the VIP or load balancer directs the producers to the stand-by cluster. You can
      easily migrate your consumer groups to start reading from the stand-by cluster or simply wait
      until the primary cluster is restored if the resulting consumer lag is acceptable for your use
      case. While the primary cluster is down, your producers are still able to ingest. Once
      the primary cluster is restored, SRM automatically takes care of synchronizing both clusters
      making failback seamless. Figure 2. Active / Stand-by Architecture
        Cluster FailureImplementing an Active/Stand-by architecture is the
      logical choice when an existing disaster recovery site with established policies is already
      available, and your goals include not losing ingest capabilities during a disaster and having
      a backup in your disaster recovery site.
