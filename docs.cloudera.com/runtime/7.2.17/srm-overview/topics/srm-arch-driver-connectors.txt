Connectors
 Learn about the different Connector implementations created by the Connect workers of
    the Streams Replication Manager Driver.
The Streams Replication Manager Driver role (SRM Driver) employs multiple Connect workers to
      execute replication, one per each replication. Inside the Connect workers, three separate
      Connector implementations are utilized. These are the following:
MirrorSourceConnector
MirrorHeartbeatConnector
MirrorCheckpointConnector


MirrorSourceConnector

The MirrorSourceConnector is responsible for replicating topics between the source and
            the target cluster. The topics to be replicated are defined by allow and deny lists,
            which can be manipulated using the srm-control tool.
In addition to replicating data, the MirrorSourceConnector also manages the offset sync
            topic in the source cluster. When production into the target cluster is successful, the
            mapping between the source offset and the target offset is written into an offset sync
            topic in the source cluster. The offset sync topic is used by the
            MirrorCheckpointConnector.




MirrorHeartbeatConnector

The MirrorHeartbeatConnector is responsible for creating the heartbeats topic in the
            target cluster. It also periodically produces heartbeats into the heartbeats topic. The
            purpose of the heartbeats topic is twofold:
It ensures that a topic is available at all times on the source clusters. This
                way, a replication always has at least a single topic that it can pick up. This
                functions as a reliable smoke test for the replication.
It is used by the SRM Service to discover configured replications.



MirrorCheckpointConnector

The MirrorCheckpointConnector is responsible for replicating the committed group
            offsets between the source and target clusters. The offsets are calculated based on the
            offset sync topic managed by the MirrorSourceConnector. The offsets of the groups and
            the topic partitions that are replicated are defined by allow and deny lists, which can
            be manipulated using the srm-control tool.
The offsets are written into the checkpoint topic in the target cluster. The contents
            of the checkpoint topic can be exported with srm-control. Exported
            offsets can then be applied to the consumer groups in the target cluster with the
              kafka-consumer-groups Kafka tool.
In addition to writing the mapped offsets into the checkpoint topic, the connector is
            also capable of periodically applying the offsets to the consumer groups in the target
            cluster. This is done using the Kafka Admin API.
