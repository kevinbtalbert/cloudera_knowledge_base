Streams Replication Manager Driver
The Streams Replication Manager Driver is responsible for executing the configured
    replication work between Kafka clusters. This includes data replication, consumer group offset
    replication, and heartbeating.
The Streams Replication Manager Driver role (SRM Driver) is built on top of the Kafka Connect
      framework and utilizes a group of connectors to execute replication. While Kafka Connect is
      bound to a single Kafka cluster by design, the SRM Driver must connect to multiple Kafka
      clusters. The SRM Driver achieves this by wrapping multiple Connect workers in a single driver
      process. Specifically, for each possible replication between the configured clusters, the SRM
      Driver spins up a separate Connect worker. The Connect workers join a Connect group which is
      dedicated to a single replication in the target Kafka cluster. Afterwards, each Connect group
      creates a single MirrorSourceConnector, a single MirrorCheckpointConnector and a single
      MirrorHeartbeatConnector. These Connectors and the task instances they generate are
      responsible for different aspects of the replication work.
When SRM Driver High Availability is in use, the Connect workers
      that are tied to a specific replication, but are running in different SRM Driver processes,
      coordinate through the Connect group protocol and balance the load.
noteThe following diagram is a visual representation of the Driver's architecture and
      showcases the different components of the Driver. In a running Driver, a single Connect worker
      can have a single, multiple, or even no Connectors or tasks assigned to it. As a result of
      this, the Connector and task distribution shown in this diagram does not fully reflect how
      Connectors and tasks are distributed in a running Driver. For more information on how
      Connectors and tasks are distributed, see Task architecture and load-balancing.
