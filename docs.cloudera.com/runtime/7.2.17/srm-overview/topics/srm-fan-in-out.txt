Fan-in and Fan-out Replication Flows
Learn about fan-in and fan-out replication flows.
You can construct fan-in replication flows, where records from multiple source clusters are
      aggregated in a single target cluster.

Similarly, you can construct fan-out replication flows as well, where a single cluster is
      replicated to multiple target clusters.
