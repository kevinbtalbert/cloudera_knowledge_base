Highly Available Kafka Architectures
A highly available Kafka deployment must be able to survive a full single cluster outage
    while continuing to process events without data loss. With SRM, you can implement highly
    available Apache Kafka deployments which either follow an Active / Stand-by or an Active /
    Active model.
