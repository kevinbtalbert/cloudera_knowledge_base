Streams Replication Manager requirements
When planning and designing your Streams Replication Manager (SRM) deployment that has
    multiple installation of SRM, there are a number of practices that you must follow. Otherwise,
    you might encounter issues when you are replicating data with SRM.

Kafka cluster aliases must be uniform across clusters
When you have multiple SRM installations, the cluster aliases must be defined the same
          way in each installationâ€™s configuration. SRM utilizes the cluster alias to detect
          replication cycles and as a result avoid infinite replication loops.


The heartbeats topic must be present on all source clusters
To be able to properly monitor and discover replications, the heartbeats topic must be
          present on all source clusters. The heartbeats topic is created by the SRM Driver when a
          target cluster is set with the Streams Replication Manager Driver Target
            Cluster property and when heartbeating is enabled for the replication. This
          means that to ensure that the heartbeats topic is created, and has data written into it
          periodically, at least a single SRM Driver cluster must target each source cluster.


Driver targets must be managed correctly
The Streams Replication Manager Cluster alias and the
            Streams Replication Manager Driver Target Cluster properties must
          be managed correctly when you have multiple SRM installations. If a target is specified
          for the replication in the Streams Replication Manager Driver Target
            Cluster property, a Connect worker is created for each possible cluster pair
          based on the aliases present in Streams Replication Manager Cluster
            alias. As a result of this, it is possible for different SRM Driver clusters
          to merge through their Connect workers. To avoid this, ensure that different SRM Driver
          installations target different clusters.


Service targets must be managed correctly
The Streams Replication Manager Cluster alias and the
            Streams Replication Manager Service Target Cluster properties
          must be managed correctly when you have multiple SRM installations. If a target is
          specified for monitoring in the Streams Replication Manager Service Target
            Cluster property, a Kafka Streams application instance is created for each
          cluster present in the Streams Replication Manager Service Target
            Cluster property. As a result of this, it is possible for different SRM
          Service clusters to merge through their Kafka Streams application instances. To avoid
          this, ensure that different SRM Service installations target different clusters.
