Configuring Basic Authentication for the SRM Service 
The REST API of the Streams Replication Manager (SRM) Service can be secured using Basic
    Authentication (BA). Once enabled, all clients and services will be required to present valid
    credentials. Configuration is done in Cloudera Manager using SRM configuration properties and
    external accounts. 


Enabling Basic Authentication for the SRM ServiceBasic Authentication (BA) can be enabled for the Streams Replication Manager (SRM)     Service in Cloudera Manager. After BA is enabled, the REST API of the SRM Service becomes     secured. Any clients or services accessing the REST API will need to present valid credentials     for access. Configuring Basic Authentication for SRM Services that have Remote Querying enabledIf a Streams Replication Manager (SRM) Service has Remote Querying enabled, it will     connect to other, remote SRM Services to fetch the remote cluster replication metrics. If the     remote SRM Service has Basic Authentication (BA) enabled, the SRM Service that has Remote     Querying enabled must be provided with valid credentials that it can use to connect to the     remote SRM Service.
