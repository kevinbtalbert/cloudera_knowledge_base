Enabling Kerberos for the SRM service
Kerberos can be enabled and configured for the Streams Replication Manager (SRM)
    service with the Enable Kerberos Authentication Cloudera Manager property.

Kerberos authentication can be enabled for the SRM service (Driver and Service roles)
        with the Enable Kerberos Authentication property. Enabling this
        property generates a JAAS configuration that is used by default for all SASL connections
        made by the SRM service. That is, SRM will connect to the co-located Kafka cluster using
        this JAAS configuration. Additionally, SRM will fall back to using this JAAS configuration
        for all other SASL connections where a connection (cluster) specific configuration is not
        configured.
important Configuring the Enable Kerberos Authentication
        on its own does not enable SRM to connect to or replicate a Kerberos enabled external Kafka
        cluster. Additionally, configuring the property does not have an effect on the
          srm-control toolâ€™s security configuration.
Configuring this property is part of the process of defining and adding clusters described
        in Defining and adding clusters for replication. Depending on how you set up
        your co-located cluster, the property might already be enabled.

In Cloudera Manager, go to Clusters and select the Streams
          Replication Manager service.Go to Configuration.Find and enable the Enable Kerberos Authentication property
        Click Save Changes.Restart the SRM service.
