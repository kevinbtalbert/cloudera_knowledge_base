Setting the secure storage password as an environment variable
If any of the clusters that Streams Replication Manager (SRM) connects to are
    secured, and you have set up and configured the SRM client’s secure storage, you must set the
    secure storage password as an environment variable in your CLI session before running the
    srm-control tool.

The SRM Client’s secure storage is password protected. In order for the
          srm-control tool to access the secure storage, it must know the password
        protecting the secure storage. This password is specified by the user in Cloudera Manager,
        however it cannot be automatically passed to the tool. This is because the tool is not an
        entity that is managed by Cloudera Manager. As a result, if any of the Kafka clusters in
        your replication scenario are secured, and you have set up and configured the SRM client’s
        secure storage, you must configure this password for the srm-control tool.
        This is done by setting the secure storage password as an environment variable in your CLI
        session before you run the tool.





Ensure that you have reviewed the information available
          in Configuring srm-control and understand that the
          following step list is only one part of the full configuration workflow. Depending on your
          scenario, completing other configuration tasks might be required.


Ensure that setup and configuration of the SRM service
          is complete:

The Kafka clusters that SRM connects to are defined and are added to the SRM
                service’s configuration. This includes both external and co-located clusters.


Replications are configured.






SSH into one of the SRM hosts in your cluster.Set the secure storage password as an environment variable.
export [***SECURE STORAGE ENV VAR***]=”[***SECURE STORAGE PASSWORD***]”
Replace [***SECURE STORAGE ENV VAR***] with the name of the
            environment variable you specified in Environment Variable Holding SRM
              Client's Secure Storage Password. Replace [***SRM SECURE STORAGE
              PASSWORD***] with the password you specified in SRM Client's
              Secure Storage Password. For example:
            export SECURESTOREPASS=”mypassword


Run the srm-control tool. How you run the tool depends on how it was configured:
If you did not create a copy of the default configuration file you can run the tool
            without the --config option. For
              example:srm-control topics --source [***SOURCE_CLUSTER***] --target [***TARGET_CLUSTER***] --add [***TOPIC1***],[***TOPIC2***]
If a custom configuration file was created, you must run the tool using the
              --config option. For
              example:srm-control topics --config [***PATH TO CUSTOM CONFIGURATION FILE***] --source [***SOURCE_CLUSTER***] --target [***TARGET_CLUSTER***] --add [***TOPIC1***],[***TOPIC2***]
