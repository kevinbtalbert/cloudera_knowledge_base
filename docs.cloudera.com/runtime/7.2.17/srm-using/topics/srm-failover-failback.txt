How to Set up Failover and Failback
Learn how to prepare for failover and failback scenarios with Streams Replication
    Manager (SRM).
If a primary Kafka cluster is temporarily unavailable, you can migrate mission-critical
      workloads to a backup Kafka cluster (failover). When the primary cluster is restored, you can
      migrate back (failback). To prepare for this scenario, ensure SRM is configured with
      bidirectional replication of mission-critical consumer groups and topics. Then in the case of
      a disaster scenario you can migrate consumer groups between clusters.
