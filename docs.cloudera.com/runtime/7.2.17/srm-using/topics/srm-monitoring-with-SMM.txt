Monitoring Replication with Streams Messaging Manager
Learn about monitoring SRM replication with Streams Messaging Manager.
Users have the ability to connect SRM with Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) and monitor
      replications through the SMM UI.This is achieved with the Kafka Streams application and the
      REST API that come bundled with SRM. The Kafka Streams application calculates and aggregates
      replication metrics, the REST API exposes these metrics. SMM uses the REST API to display
      aggregated metrics to the end users, enabling monitoring as a result. Monitoring replication
      flows in SMM is available starting with version 2.0.0. 
For more information regarding the requirements and setup of SRM with SMM, see Monitoring
      Kafka Cluster Replication using SMM in the SMM guide.
