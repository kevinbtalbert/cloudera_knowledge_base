Replicating Data 
A step by step guide on how to start replicating data between Kafka clusters with
    SRM.
Installing and starting SRM on your cluster does not
      automatically start data replication. In order to start the replication process, you need to
      update the allowlists with the srm-control tool. 

In Cloudera Manager, verify that the SRM driver role is started and is in good health.
Verify that SRM is configured correctly. Make sure that connection information for
        each Kafka cluster is added as well as at least one source->target
        replication is specified and enabled.


Update the topics allowlist to start data replication.

srm-control topics --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --target [TARGET_CLUSTER] --add [TOPIC1],[TOPIC2]

note If required, instead of listing the topics that you want to add, you can also use
            regular expressions to add multiple topics with one command. 


Verify that the topics have been added to the allowlist. 

srm-control topics --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --target [TARGET_CLUSTER] --list



The topics you specify with the --add option are added to the topic
        allowlist and are replicated to the specified target cluster.
