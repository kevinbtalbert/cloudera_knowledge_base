Starting Hive on an insecure cluster in Data Hub
    
If you want to use Apache Hive for a quick test, you can do so using default Hive
        default authorization mode, assuming you are on an insecure cluster (no Kerberos or Ranger
        policies). In default authorization mode, only user hive can access Hive.
        Steps to start the Hive shell, not to be mistaken with the Hive CLI that CDP does not
        support, include how to log into a cluster.
 From the cluster command line, you type hive on the command line
            of your cluster to start the Hive shell. In the background, Beeline launches the Hive
            shell.  

In Cloudera Manager, click Hosts > All Hosts.






Make a note of the IP address or host name of a node in your cluster, for
                    example myhost-vpc.cloudera.com.

Use ssh to log into the cluster.
For example:ssh myhost-vpc.cloudera.com

Type hive to start Hive from the command line.

Enter Hive queries.
