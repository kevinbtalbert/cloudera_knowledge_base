Starting Hive using in Data Hub a password
You start the Hive shell using a Beeline command to query Hive as an end user
        authorized by Apache Ranger. As administrator, you set up the end user in the operating
        system and in Ranger.

Before starting Hive for the first time, check that you are covered
                by Ranger policies required for basic operations as shown in the following steps. All users need
                to use the default database, perform operations such as listing
                database names, and query the information schema. The preloaded default database
                    tables columns and information_schema database Ranger policies cover group public
                (all users). If these policies are disabled, you cannot use the default database,
                perform basic operations such as listing database names, or query the information
                schema. For example, if the default database tables columns policy is disabled, the
                following error appears if you try to use the default database:
hive> USE default;
Error: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: HiveAccessControlException 
Permission denied: user [hive] does not have [USE] privilege on [default]

Access the Ranger Console: click the Ranger Admin web UI link, enter your user name and password, then click Sign In.
         
On the far right, click Ranger > Hadoop SQL , and in Allow Conditions, edit all - database, table,
                        column. 






Add your user or group name to Hive policies to grant full access to
                    Hive.
For example, add the admins group name to the list of groups that can
                    access Hive.



Check that the preloaded default database tables columns and
                        information_schema database policies are enabled for group
                    public.






 In Environments > your environment > your cluster, click the CM-URL. 

In Cloudera Manager, click Hosts > All Hosts.






Make a note of the IP address or host name of a node in your cluster, for
                    example myhost-vpc.cloudera.com.

Use ssh to log into the cluster.
For example:ssh myhost-vpc.cloudera.com
You can get help about starting the Hive shell. On the command line, type hive -h
               Output
                    is:Connect using simple authentication to HiveServer2 on localhost:10000

Using the fully qualified domain name or IP address a node in your cluster from Cloudera Manager > Hosts > Role(s) and looking through the list of roles to find HS2 (Hive
                        on Tez HiveServer2). For example:





This node has the HiveServer role, so you can use the name or IP address in
                    Beeline.

Start the Hive shell.

Use your user name if your cluster security is set up.
Use the user name hive and no password.

Substitute the name or IP address of your HiveServer host for
                    10.65.13.98.
Simple
                    authentiation:beeline -u jdbc:hive2://10.65.13.98:10000 -n <your user name> -pKerberos:beeline -u "jdbc:hive2://10.65.13.98:10000/default;principal=hive/_HOST@CLOUDERA.SITE"

Enter Hive queries.
