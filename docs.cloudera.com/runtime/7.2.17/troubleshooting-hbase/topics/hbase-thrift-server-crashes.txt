Thrift Server crashes after receiving invalid data
The Thrift server may crash if it receives a large amount of invalid data, due
        to a buffer overrun.
Why this happens
The Thrift server allocates memory to check the validity of data it receives. If
        it receives a large amount of invalid data, it may need to allocate more
        memory than is available. This is due to a limitation in the Thrift
        library itself.
What to do
To prevent the possibility of crashes due to buffer overruns, use the framed and
        compact transport protocols. These protocols are disabled by default,
        because they may require changes to your client code. The two options to
        add to your hbase-site.xml are
        hbase.regionserver.thrift.framed and
        hbase.regionserver.thrift.compact. Set each of these to
        true, as in the XML below. You can also specify the
        maximum frame size, using the
        hbase.regionserver.thrift.framed.max_frame_size_in_mb
        option.<property> 
  <name>hbase.regionserver.thrift.framed</name> 
  <value>true</value> 
</property> 
<property> 
  <name>hbase.regionserver.thrift.framed.max_frame_size_in_mb</name> 
  <value>2</value> 
</property> 
<property> 
  <name>hbase.regionserver.thrift.compact</name> 
  <value>true</value> 
</property>
