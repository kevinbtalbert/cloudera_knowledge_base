Fixing issues
You can fix issues using the HBCK2 tool.You must keep these in mind when fixing issues using HBCK2. Ensure that:
A region is not in the CLOSING state during “assign”, and in the OPENING state
                during “unassign”. You can change the state using the setRegionState command. See
                the HBCK2 tool Command Reference section for more information. 
You fix only one table at a time.

            commands.Fix assign and unassign issues
You can fix assign and unassign issues by monitoring the current list of outstanding
                locks. An assign against a locked region will wait till the lock is released. An
                assignment gets an exclusive lock on the region.
Fix master startup cannot progress error 
If you see a master startup cannot progress holding-pattern until region
                    online error in the Master log, it means that the Master is unable to
                start because there is no procedure to assign hbase:meta. You will see an error
                message similar to this:
                2020-04-01 22:07:42,792 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.HMaster:
 hbase:meta,,1.1588230740 is NOT online; state={1588230740 state=CLOSING, 
ts=1538456302300, server=ve1017.example.org,22101,1234567891012}; 
ServerCrashProcedures=true. Master startup cannot progress in holding-pattern until region onlined.

To fix this issue, run the following
                command:$ hbase hbck -j $HOME/hbase-operator-tools-<version>/hbase-hbck2/hbase-hbck2-<version>.jar 
assigns 1588230740
The same issue can occur with a hbase:namespace system table. To fix this issue, run
                the following command:
                $ hbase hbck -j $HOME/hbase-operator-tools-<version>/hbase-hbck2/hbase-hbck2-<version>.jar 
assigns <hbase:namespace encoded region id>

You can find the namespace encoded region id using this command:
                $ echo "scan 'hbase:meta',{COLUMNS=>'info:regioninfo', 
FILTER=>\"PrefixFilter('hbase:namespace')\"}" | hbase shell
The namespace encoded region id is the value under the "ENCODED" field in
                the results.
Fix missing regions in hbase:meta region/table
If you encounter an issue where table regions have been removed from the hbase:meta
                table, you can use the addFsRegionsMissingInMeta to resolve this issue. Ensure that
                the Master is online. This command is not as disruptive as the hbase:meta rebuild
                command.
To fix this issue, run this command:
                $ hbase hbck -j $HOME/hbase-operator-tools-<version>/hbase-hbck2/hbase-hbck2-<version>.jar 
addFsRegionsMissingInMeta <NAMESPACE|NAMESPACE:TABLENAME>

The command returns an HBCK2 “assigns” command with all the listed re-inserted
                regions.You must restart the Master, and then run the HBCK2 'assigns' command
                returned by the addFsRegionsMissingInMeta command to complete your fix.
Example
                output:Regions re-added into Meta: 2
WARNING:
2 regions were added to META, but these are not yet on Masters cache.
You need to restart Masters, then run hbck2 'assigns' command below:
assigns 7be03127c5e0e2acfc7cae7ddfa9e29e e50b8c1adc38c942e226a8b2976f0c8c

Fix extra regions in hbase:meta region/table
If there are extra regions in hbase:meta, it may be because of problems in splitting,
                deleting/moving the region directory manually, or in rare cases because of the loss
                of metadata. 
To fix this issue, run this
                command:$ hbase hbck -j $HOME/hbase-operator-tools-<version>/hbase-hbck2/hbase-hbck2-<version>.jar 
extraRegionsInMeta --fix  <NAMESPACE|NAMESPACE:TABLENAME>...

importantUse the --fix option only when the extra regions are overlapping
                the existing valid regions. Otherwise, use the assigns command to recreate the
                regions. 
Rebuild hbase:meta 
If hbase:meta is offline because it is corrupted, you can bring it back online if the
                corruption is not too critical. If the namespace region is among the mission
                regions, scan hbase:meta during initialization to check if hbase:meta is online. 
To check if hbase:meta is online, run this command in the Apache HBase
                shell:$ echo "scan 'hbase:meta', {COLUMN=>'info:regioninfo'}" | hbase shell
If this scan does not throw any errors, then you can run the following command to
                validate that the tables are
                present:$ hbase hbck -j $HOME/hbase-operator-tools-<version>/hbase-hbck2/hbase-hbck2-<version>.jar 
addFsRegionsMissingInMeta <NAMESPACE|NAMESPACE:TABLENAME>

The addFsRegionsMissingInMeta command adds regions back to the
                hbase:meta table if the regioninfo file is present in the storage but the regions
                were deleted because of an issue.
Fix dropped references and corrupted HFiles
To fix hanging references and corrupt HFiles, run the following command:
                $ hbase hbck -j $HOME/hbase-operator-tools-<version>/hbase-hbck2/hbase-hbck2-<version>.jar 
filesystem --fix [<TABLENAME>...]
