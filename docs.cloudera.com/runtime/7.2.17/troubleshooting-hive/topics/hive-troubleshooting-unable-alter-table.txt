Unable to alter S3-backed tables

Condition
In CDP Public Cloud on AWS or wherever S3-backed tables are used, an ALTER
                    TABLE <table-name> RENAME TO <new-table-name> operation might
                result in an error stating that the new table location already exists.


Cause
A rename operation on an S3-backed table is not instant. It has to move each file
                    in the table to a new location one at a time. Depending on how many files are in
                    the table directory, this could take more than 5 minutes, which is the default
                    timeout specified.
If the time specified for the connection elapses before the rename completes,
                    Hive tries again and fails because the new directory already exists (from the
                    previous attempt).
Because of this retry behavior, an end-user job or query can result in a
                    misleading
                    error:Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 
from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.ddl.DDLTask. Unable to alter table. New location for this table 
hive.<dbname>.<tablename> already exists : s3a://<bucket>/warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive/<dbname>.db/<tablename>


Solution
Check the Hive Metastore logs for the time period close to the
                        failed rename and look for the following timeout
                            message:ERROR org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.RetryingHMSHandler: [pool-7-thread-31549]: Error happens in method alter_table_req: 
MetaException(message:Timeout when executing method: alter_table_req; 694779ms exceeds 600000ms)If
                            there is a timeout message, perform the following steps to increase the
                            value of the timeout property for both Hive clients and Hive
                            Metastore:
Log in to Cloudera Manager as an administrator.
