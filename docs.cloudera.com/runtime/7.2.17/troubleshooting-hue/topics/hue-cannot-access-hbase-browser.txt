Enabling access to HBase browser from Hue
If HBase impersonation is not allowed in HDFS, then you may get an API error while
        trying to access the HBase browser from Hue. To resolve this issue, you must allow proxy
        users on the Thrift gateway, and also allow all groups form all hosts in HDFS to impersonate
        the hbase user.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > HBase service > Configuration and search for the
                        hbase.thrift.support.proxyuser property.

Enable the Enable HBase Thrift Proxy Users option.

Click Save Changes.

Go to Clusters > HDFS service > Configuration.

Enter the following lines in the Cluster-wide Advanced Configuration
                        Snippet (Safety Valve) for core-site.xml field:

<property>
<name>hadoop.proxyuser.hbase.hosts</name>
<value>*</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>hadoop.proxyuser.hbase.groups</name>
<value>*</value>
</property>


Click Save Changes.

Restart the HBase and HDFS services.
