Unable to authenticate users in Hue using SAML
If you have configured SAML to authenticate users, but your users are unable to log into
  Hue using Single Sign On (SSO), then it is possible that the RSA key format is not supported. To
  resolve this issue, you can use an unprotected private key and then specify the private key
  filename in the safety valve.

Convert the .key file to an unprotected private key file by using the
     following command:

openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/<file name>.key -out /opt/cloudera/security/<file name_unprotected>.key


openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/hadoop-cpi-prod.key -out /opt/cloudera/security/hadoop-cpi-prod_unprotected.key


Update the advanced configuration snippet as shown in the following example:

[libsaml]
xmlsec_binary=/usr/bin/xmlsec1
metadata_file=/opt/cloudera/security/saml/idp-openam-metadata.xml
key_file=/opt/cloudera/security/hadoop-cpi-prod_unprotected.key
cert_file=/opt/cloudera/security/hadoop-cpi-prod.pem
