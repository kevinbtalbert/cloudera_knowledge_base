Fixing authentication issues between HBase and Hue
An HBase feature improvement to the Thrift Server (HBASE-19852) may cause
        authentication issues between HBase and Hue, and you may see the following error while
        accessing the HBase tables from Hue: “Failed to authenticate to HBase Thrift Server,
            check authentication configurations.”
You may also see the following error in the Hue logs:
                “RestException: Unable to authenticate <Response [401]>”. To fix
            this issue, update the HBase configurations using Cloudera Manager.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > HBase service > Instances and note the hostname of the host on which the HBase Thrift
                    Server is running.
If multiple Thrift Servers are configured, then find the one that Hue is
                    configured to use.

Go to Configuration > HBase Thrift Server Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)
                            for hbase-site.xml and add the following properties:



Field

hbase.thrift.spnego.principal

                                                @REALM with the actual Kerberos
                                            realm.

Optional: 
If you have not enabled SSL on your cluster, but if you have Kerberized your
                    cluster, then add the following HBase configurations, without which you may
                    encounter a NullPointerException error while starting the HBase
                    Thrift Server:


Add the following properties in the HBase Client Advanced
                                Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hbase-site.xml
