Activating Hive query editor on Hue UI
You may not see the Hive query editor on the Hue user interface if you have not
        installed and selected the HIVE_ON_TEZ service on your cluster. The HIVE_ON_TEZ service is
        needed to configure and use Hive with Hue.

note
In CDH 6 and earlier, the Hive service included the Hive Metastore and
                    HiveServer2. In Cloudera Runtime 7.0 and later, this service includes only Hive
                    Metastore. HiveServer2 and other components of the Hive execution engines are
                    part of the HIVE_ON_TEZ service.


To enable the Hive query editor on the Hue web UI:

Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Check whether the HIVE_ON_TEZ service is installed on your cluster.
If it is not installed already, add it as a service.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration.
The list of Hue configurations is displyed.

Search for the HiveServer2 Service field and select the
                        HIVE_ON_TEZ service.

Save the changes and restart Hue.

The Hive query editor should now be available on the Hue
            user interface.
