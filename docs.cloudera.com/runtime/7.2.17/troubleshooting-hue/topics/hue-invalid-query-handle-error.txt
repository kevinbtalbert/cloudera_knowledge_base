Impala query fails with invalid query handle error
You encounter an  "Invalid query handle" error when running Impala queries from the
        Hue web interface because the connection between Impala Thrift server and the Hue Load
        Balancer times out. This is governed by the server_conn_timeout
        property.
The default value of the
                server_conn_timeout property is 30 minutes. You can increase the
            timeout limit by updating the Hue configuration using Cloudera Manager.

Log into Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                            hue_safety_valve.ini.

Increase the value of the server_conn_timeout property in the
                    Impala section as follows:

[impala]
   server_host=[***SERVER-HOST***]
   server_port=[***PORT***]
   server_conn_timeout=[***TIMEOUT-IN-SECONDS***]

You can increase the value of the server_conn_timeout
                    property to 2 hours (7200 seconds).

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.

You should be able to run Impala queries from the Hue web
            interface successfully.
