Fixing a warning related to accessing non-optimized Hue
If you are using a third-party load balancer for Hue, then you may see a warning such
        as "You are accessing a non-optimized Hue, please switch to one of the available addresses:
        https://[***LB-HOST-FQDN***]:[***LB-PORT***]". To fix this issue, you must add the URL of
        the Hue instance for which you are seeing the warning to the list of hue load balancers in
        the Advanced Configuration Snippet.

Log in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                            hue_safety_valve.ini and add the following line under the [desktop] section:

[desktop]
hue_load_balancer=https://[***LB-HOST-FQDN***]:[***LB-PORT***]

You can specify a comma-separated list of URLs for which you see the warning
                    in the hue_load_balancer property.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
