'Type' error while accessing Hue from Knox Gateway

Condition
If you are using KnoxSpenego as an authentication mechanism, and if Knox is set up
                with Kerberos (HadoopAuth), then you may see the "type" error on the Hue web
                interface when you try to open Hue from the Knox Gateway UI


Cause
This is because of KNOX-2865.

Solution

Open a Knox support case with Cloudera to request for a hotfix.
