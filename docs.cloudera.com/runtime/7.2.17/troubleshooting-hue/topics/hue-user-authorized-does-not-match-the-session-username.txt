Resolving "The user authorized on the connection does not match the session username"
        error

Condition
In CDP, if you try to open two Hue sessions on different ports on the same browser
                window, then you may see the The user authorized on the connection does not match
                    the session username error on the Hue web interface and in the Hue logs.


Cause
On CDH, if you opened Hue web URL on port 8889 on one tab and on port 8888 on
                    another tab, you would be logged out of Hue on the port 8889, and you would be
                    forced to refresh the page. In CDP, Hue depends on the ZooKeeper quorum for how
                    it connects to Impala or Hive and how the Hue load balancer distributes the
                    connections to the Hue server nodes and controls switching between the different
                    sesions.

Solution

After migrating/upgrading from CDH to CDP, note this change in behaviour and
                        always open Hue web UI using the Hue Load Balanced -
                            recommended option from Cloudera Manager.
