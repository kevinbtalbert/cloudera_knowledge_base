Heap sampling
For advanced debugging of memory usage, administrators may enable heap sampling on
    Kudu daemons. This allows Kudu developers to associate memory usage with the specific lines of
    code and data structures responsible. When reporting a bug related to memory usage or an
    apparent memory leak, heap profiling can give quantitative data to pinpoint the
    issue.
caution
          Heap sampling is an advanced troubleshooting technique and may cause performance
          degradation or instability of the Kudu service. Currently it is not recommended to
          enable this in a production environment unless specifically requested by the Kudu
          development team.
        

          To enable heap sampling on a Kudu daemon, pass the flag
          --heap-sample-every-n-bytes=524588. If heap sampling is enabled, the
          current sampled heap occupancy can be retrieved over HTTP by visiting
          http://tablet-server.example.com:8050/pprof/heap or
          http://master.example.com:8051/pprof/heap. The output is a
          machine-readable dump of the stack traces with their associated heap usage.
        

          Rather than visiting the heap profile page directly in a web browser, it is typically
          more useful to use the pprof tool that is distributed as part of the
          gperftools open source project. For example, a developer with a local
          build tree can use the following command to collect the sampled heap usage and output
          an SVG diagram:
        
thirdparty/installed/uninstrumented/bin/pprof -svg  'http://localhost:8051/pprof/heap' > /tmp/heap.svg

          The resulting SVG may be visualized in a web browser or sent to the Kudu community to
          help troubleshoot memory occupancy issues.
        
tip
          Heap samples contain only summary information about allocations and do not contain any
          data from the heap. It is safe to share heap samples in public without fear of
          exposing confidential or sensitive data.
