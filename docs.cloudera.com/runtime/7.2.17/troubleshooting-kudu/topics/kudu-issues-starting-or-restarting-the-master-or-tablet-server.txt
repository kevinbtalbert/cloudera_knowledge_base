Issues starting or restarting the master or the tablet server
You may face issues while starting or restarting the master or the tablet server in
      case there are errors in the hole punching tests, or if the FS layout already exists, or if
      the master and tablet server's clocks are not synchronized using NTP.
Errors during hole punching testKudu requires hole punching capabilities in order to be efficient. Hole punching     support depends upon your operation system kernel version and local filesystem     implementation.Already present: FS layout already existsWhen Kudu starts, it checks each configured data directory, expecting either for all       to be initialized or for all to be empty. If a server fails to start with a log message such       as the following, then this precondition check has failed.Troubleshooting NTP stability problemsAs of Kudu 1.6.0, Kudu daemons can continue to operate during a brief loss of clock     synchronization. If clock synchronization is lost for several hours, the Kudu daemons may crash.     If a daemon crashes due to clock synchronization issues, consult the ERROR log     for a dump of related information which may help to diagnose the issue.
