Recover from a dead Kudu master in a multi-master deployment
 Kudu multi-master deployments function normally in the event of a master loss.
    However, it is important to replace the dead master. Otherwise a second failure may lead to a
    loss of availability, depending on the number of available masters. This workflow describes how
    to replace the dead master. 
 Due to
        KUDU-1620, it is not possible to perform this workflow without
      also restarting the live masters. As such, the workflow requires a maintenance window, albeit
      a potentially brief one if the cluster was set up with DNS aliases.

 Replacing a master created without DNS aliases requires an
            unavailability window when tablet servers are restarted to pick up the replacement
            master at different hostname. See the multi-master migration workflow in Migrating
              to multiple Kudu masters for more details on deploying with DNS aliases. 


 The workflow presupposes at least basic familiarity with Kudu
            configuration management. If using Cloudera Manager, the workflow also presupposes
            familiarity with it. 


 All of the command line steps below should be executed as the Kudu
            UNIX user, typically kudu. 




Prepare for the recoveryIt is crucial to make sure that the master node is truly dead and does not     accidentally restart while you are preparing for the recovery.Perform the recoveryAfter you have identified a reference master, you need to copy the master data to the     replacement master node. You need to bring the Kudu clusters down. Therefore, identify at least     a one-hour maintenance window for this task.
