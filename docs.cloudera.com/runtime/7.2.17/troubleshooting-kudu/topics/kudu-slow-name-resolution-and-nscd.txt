Slow name resolution and nscd
For better scalability on nodes hosting many replicas, we recommend that you use
      nscd (name service cache daemon) to cache
    both DNS name resolution and static name resolution (via /etc/hosts). 

          When DNS lookups are slow, you will see a log message similar to the following:
        
W0926 11:19:01.339553 27231 net_util.cc:193] Time spent resolve address for kudu-tserver.example.com: real 4.647s user 0.000s sys 0.000s

nscd can alleviate slow name resolution by providing a cache for the
          most common name service requests, such as for passwords, groups, and hosts.
        

          Refer to your operating system documentation for how to install and enable
          nscd.
