Troubleshooting NTP stability problems
As of Kudu 1.6.0, Kudu daemons can continue to operate during a brief loss of clock
    synchronization. If clock synchronization is lost for several hours, the Kudu daemons may crash.
    If a daemon crashes due to clock synchronization issues, consult the ERROR log
    for a dump of related information which may help to diagnose the issue.note If using other than link-local
        NTP server, it may take some time for ntpd to synchronize with one of its
        reference servers in case of network connectivity issues. In case of a spotty network
        between the machine and the reference NTP servers, ntpd may become
        unsynchronized with its reference NTP servers. If that happens, consider finding other set
        of reference NTP servers: the best bet is to use NTP servers in the local network or
          *.pool.ntp.org servers.
