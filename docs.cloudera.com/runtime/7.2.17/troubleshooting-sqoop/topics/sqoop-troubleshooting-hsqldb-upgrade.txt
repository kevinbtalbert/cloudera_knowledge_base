Unable to read Sqoop metastore created by an older HSQLDB version
After upgrading to certain Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) versions, you may encounter
  issues in reading the Sqoop metastore that was created using an older version of HyperSQL Database
  (HSQLDB). Learn how to upgrade the Sqoop metastore to resolve this issue.
Cloudera upgraded the HSQLDB dependency in the following versions to the newest HSQLDB 2.7.1
    version:
CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.7 SP2
CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.8 Cumulative hotfix 4
CDP Public Cloud 7.2.16

The version upgrade causes incompatibility issues in Sqoop jobs that are stored in HSQLDB.
   Therefore, the Sqoop metastore should be upgraded after you upgrade to the above-mentioned CDP
   versions or higher.
noteSqoop stores its metastore files in the current user's
   home directory. If the Sqoop metastore is on-demand, then its location is
    ~/.sqoop/metastore.db.If the Sqoop metastore is a service, then its location is
    ~/.sqoop/shared-metastore.db.
Choose one of the following procedures based on how the Sqoop metastore is created:
Sqoop metastore created using SqoopSqoop metastore created in a separate HSQLDB instance
Perform the following steps if the Sqoop metastore is created using Sqoop:

If the Sqoop metastore is started as a service then stop the service by running this
      command on the host where the service is
      running:/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/sqoop/stop-metastore.sh -p <path to Sqoop metastore pid file>
Download HSQLDB 2.3.6 and SqlTool JAR files to the host by running the following
      commands:wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hsqldb/sqltool/2.3.6/sqltool-2.3.6.jar
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hsqldb/hsqldb/2.3.6/hsqldb-2.3.6.jar
Run the following command to upgrade and convert the Sqoop metastore database files using
       SqlTool:For on-demand Sqoop metastore:
$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -cp "sqltool-2.3.6.jar:hsqldb-2.3.6.jar" org.hsqldb.cmdline.SqlTool --driver org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver  --inlineRc="url=jdbc:hsqldb:file:~/.sqoop/metastore.db;shutdown=true;user=SA,password=" --sql="SELECT * FROM SQOOP_ROOT;"For
       Sqoop metastore as a
       service:$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -cp "sqltool-2.3.6.jar:hsqldb-2.3.6.jar" org.hsqldb.cmdline.SqlTool --driver org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver  --inlineRc="url=jdbc:hsqldb:file:~/.sqoop/shared-metastore.db;shutdown=true;user=SA,password=" --sql="SELECT * FROM SQOOP_ROOT;"The
       Sqoop metastore is upgraded and the database files are converted to a format that can easily
       be read by HSQLDB 2.7.1.noteAs part of the CDP upgrade, Apache
       Sqoop installation has the dependent HSQLDB 2.7.1 version by default.
If the Sqoop metastore service was stopped earlier, restart the
      service:/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/sqoop/start-metastore.sh -p <path to Sqoop metastore pid file> -l <path to Sqoop metastore logs dir>
You can choose to remove the downloaded HSQLDB JAR files from the host.


Perform the following steps if the Sqoop metastore is created in a separate HSQLDB
     instance:

Login to the HSQLDB service host and stop the service. For more information, see the HSQLDB
      documentation.
Work with your IT team to determine the HSQLDB store file that is created to store the
      Sqoop metastore information.
Download HSQLDB 2.3.6 and SqlTool JAR files to the host by running the following
      commands:wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hsqldb/sqltool/2.3.6/sqltool-2.3.6.jar
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hsqldb/hsqldb/2.3.6/hsqldb-2.3.6.jar
Run the following command to upgrade and convert the Sqoop metastore database files using
      SqlTool:$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -cp "sqltool-2.3.6.jar:hsqldb-2.3.6.jar" org.hsqldb.cmdline.SqlTool --driver org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver  --inlineRc="url=jdbc:hsqldb:file:<PATH OF SQOOP METASTORE FILE>;shutdown=true;user=SA,password=" --sql="SELECT * FROM SQOOP_ROOT;"
If the HSQLDB service hosts multiple databases then each of the store files must be
      upgraded as described in the previous step.The Sqoop metastore is upgraded and the database
       files are converted to a format that can easily be read by HSQLDB 2.7.1.noteAs part of the CDP upgrade, Apache Sqoop installation has the dependent
       HSQLDB 2.7.1 version by default.
Restart the HSQLDB service. For more information, see the HSQLDB documentation.
You can choose to remove the downloaded HSQLDB JAR files from the host.
