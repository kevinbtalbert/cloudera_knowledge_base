Configuring the Hue Query Processor scan frequency
You can configure the frequency at which the Hue Query Processor fetches the data
        from a Hadoop Compatible File System by setting the time in milliseconds (ms) in the
        “hue.query-processor.event-pipeline.folder-scan-delay-millis” property in the Query
        Processor configurations.
By default, the value of the
                hue.query-processor.event-pipeline.folder-scan-delay-millis
            property is 5 * 60 * 1000 ms (5 minutes). For a faster data refresh rate, you can set
            this value to less than 5 * 60 * 1000 ms (5 minutes). But this can result in higher
            storage read costs. However, if you want stronger performance, and a faster refresh rate
            is not a priority, then you can set it to a higher value to reduce storage read
            costs.

Log in to the CDP web interface as an Administrator.

Go to Data Hub Clusters and select your cluster.

Click CM URL or CM-UI to open
                    Cloudera Manager.

Go to Clusters > Query Processor service > Configuration and add the following line in the Query Processor
                        Extra Configurations field:

"hue.query-processor.event-pipeline.folder-scan-delay-millis" : [***TIME-IN-MS***]


"hue.query-processor.event-pipeline.folder-scan-delay-millis" : 2000


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Query Processor service.
