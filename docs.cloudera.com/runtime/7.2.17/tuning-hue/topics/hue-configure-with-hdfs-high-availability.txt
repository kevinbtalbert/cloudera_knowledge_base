Configuring for HDFS high availability
You can use Cloudera Manager to configure Hue to use HDFS high availability
    NameNodes.

Add the HttpFS role.

After the command has completed, go to the Hue service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Locate the HDFS Web Interface Role property
              or search for it by typing its name in the Search box.

Select the HttpFS role you just created instead of the
              NameNode role, and save your changes.

Restart the Hue service.
