Tuning Apache Spark Applications

 This topic describes various aspects in tuning the performance and
      scalability of Apache Spark applications. For general Spark tuning advice,
      consult the upstream Spark documentation. This topic focuses on
      performance aspects that are especially relevant when using Spark in the
      context of CDP clusters. 

      During tuning, monitor application behavior to determine the effect of tuning actions. You
      might see improvements that are directly relevant to the performance of your job, such as
      reduction in CPU usage, or reductions in resource usage that improve overall scalability
      within a multi-tenant cluster.

      Applications."
