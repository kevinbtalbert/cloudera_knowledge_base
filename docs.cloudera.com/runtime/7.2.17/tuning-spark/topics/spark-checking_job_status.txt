Check Job Status

If a job takes longer than expected or does not finish successfully, check the following
            to understand more about where the job stalled or failed:


To list running applications by ID from the command line, use yarn
                     application â€“list.




To see a description of a resilient distributed dataset (RDD) and its recursive
                  dependencies (useful for understanding how jobs are executed) use
                     toDebugString() on the RDD.


To check the query plan when using the DataFrame API, use
                     DataFrame#explain().
