Compare queries
You can compare two queries to know how each query is performing in terms of speed
        and cost effectiveness. DAS compares various aspects of the two queries, based on which you
        can identify what changed between the executions of those two queries, and you can debug
        performance-related issues between different runs of the same query.
The query comparison report provides you a detailed side-by-side comparison of your
            queries, including recommendations for each query, metadata about the queries, visual
            explain for each query, query configuration, time taken at each stage of the query
            execution, and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) information and DAG counters.To compare
                two queries:

Sign in to DAS and click Queries.

Under ACTIONS, click the Compare
                    button to select a query.
The selected query is displayed on the comparison toolbar.

Next, select the query that you want to compare by clicking the
                        Compare button.
The selected query is displayed on the comparison tool bar next to the query
                    that you initially selected.

Click COMPARE.
The comparison report is displayed.

To remove any query from the comparison toolbar, click
                    x. 

To change the order of the queries that are being compared, click the
                        Swap queries button on the comparison toolbar.
