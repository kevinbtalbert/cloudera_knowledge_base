Enabling the DAS Event Processor
Data Analytics Studio (DAS) is installed when you create a Data Hub cluster with the
        Data Engineering template. In 7.2.16, you can run queries using DAS, but you cannot see the
        query history because the Event Processor has been disabled by default. You can enable the
        DAS Event Processor by setting the das.event-pipeline.enabled property to true in Cloudera
        Manager.

Log in to CDP Management Console as an Administrator.

Go to Data Hub > Environment > Cloudera Manager > Clusters > Data Analytics Studio > Configuration and add the following configuration in the Data
                        Analytics Studio Eventprocessor Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                        Valve) for conf/props/eventprocessor_extra.properties
                    field:
Key:
                    das.event-pipeline.enabled
Value: true

Click Save Changes.

Restart the DAS service.
