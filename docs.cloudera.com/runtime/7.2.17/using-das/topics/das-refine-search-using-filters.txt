Refining query search using filters
You can further refine your query search results using various filters.

Click + in the Refine tab.
Select the filters from the list by clicking each filter.Click Apply.

noteThe total number of items in every facet, such as User, Queue, Tables Read, etc. is
            displayed in parentheses next to the facet title in the Refine section. For optimum
            resource utilization, DAS does not refresh the result set every time you filter items.
            For example, if there are three users: hive, admin, and admin1, and you select only
            admin and click Apply, DAS does not show User (1). It still
            displays User (3).
