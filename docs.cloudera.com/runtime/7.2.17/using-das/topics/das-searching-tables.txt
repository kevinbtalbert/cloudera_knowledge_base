Searching tables
After selecting a database, the tables tab is refreshed to list all the tables in the database.
To search for a table, start by entering the name of the table in the Search box. The list
      gets refreshed as you enter your search string to narrow the list down to your desired
      table.
Click the Refresh icon to refresh the list of tables.
