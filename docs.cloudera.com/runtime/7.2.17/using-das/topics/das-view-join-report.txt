Viewing the Join report
The Join report provides you the details of joins between all the tables in a
    database.
To view the join report, click Reports > Join Report. You can change the database from the dropdown list to view the join diagram
      for that database.
You can switch between the databases using the Database dropdown menu.
To refine your search based on time, select the time period from the dropdown.
      After you select the time period, the corresponding “to” and “from” dates representing the
      selection are displayed along with the time zone. The time zone that is displayed is that of
      the DAS server.
You can further refine your join diagram using the following join algorithms:

Join
Hash Join
Merge Join
Lateral View Join
Sorted Merge

The diagram gets refreshed based on your selection.
If you hover over a particular column, then all the joins with the selected column are
      highlighted. If you hover over a particular connection line, then the number of times the two
      columns were joined (also known as the join count) is displayed. The join count that is
      displayed is for the time period that you select.
For every table present on the Join report, DAS displays the database in which that table
      belongs. If you select a particular database from the dropdown menu, then the Join report
      predominantly displays all the joins originating from the tables within the selected database
      to the tables belonging to other databases.
