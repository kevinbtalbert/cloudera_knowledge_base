View query details
For a given query, you can view the optimization recommendations, query details, the
  visual representation of the explain plan, Hive configurations, the time taken to compile, build
  and run the query, and the DAG information.
To view the query details, you can either click on a particular query or the
    i icon under the Actions column on the
    Queries page.

Viewing the query recommendationsThe Recommendations tab provides information about how you can   improve the performance of the query and optimize its cost. Viewing the query detailsThe Query Details tab provides information such as, the Hive query     ID of the query, the user who executed the query, the start time, the end time, the total time     taken to run the query, the tables that were read and written, the application ID, the DAG     ID(s), the session ID, the thread ID, and the queue against which the query was run.Viewing the visual explain for a queryThe Visual Explain tab provides a graphical representation of the   query execution plan. The explain plan can be read from right to left. It provides details about   every stage of the query operation.Viewing the Hive configurations for a queryThe Configs tab provides the Hive configuration details for the   query. You can search for a particular configuration by entering the configuration name in the   search field.Viewing the query timelineThe Timeline tab shows the time taken by every stage of the query   execution.Viewing the task-level DAG informationThe DAG Info tab shows the Directed Acyclic Graph of the vertices   against time. Each mapping and reducing task is a vertex.Viewing the DAG flowThe DAG Flow tab displays the Directed Acyclic Graph that is   created by the Hive engine in the form of a flowchart.Viewing the DAG countersThe DAG counters provide a way to measure the progress or the number of operations that   occur within a generated DAG. Counters are used to gather statistics for quality control purposes   or problem diagnosis.Viewing the Tez configurations for a queryThe DAG Configurations tab in the DAG Info   section on the Query Details page provides the Tez configuration details for   the query that has a DAG associated with it. You can search for a particular configuration by   entering the configuration name in the search field.
