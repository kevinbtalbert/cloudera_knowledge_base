Viewing the DAG counters
The DAG counters provide a way to measure the progress or the number of operations that
  occur within a generated DAG. Counters are used to gather statistics for quality control purposes
  or problem diagnosis.
 The DAG counters provide details, such as:
Number of bytes read and written
Number of tasks that initiated and ran successfully
Amount of CPU and memory consumed
