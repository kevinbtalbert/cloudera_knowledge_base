Merging data in
    tables
A sample statement shows how you can conditionally insert existing data in Hive tables
    using the ACID MERGE statement.  Additional merge operations are mentioned.
 The MERGE statement is based on ANSI-standard
        SQL.

Construct a query to update the customers' names and states in
            customer target table to match the names and states of customers having
          the same IDs in the new_customer_stage source table.

Enhance the query to insert data from new_customer_stage table into
          the customer table if none already exists.
Update or delete data using MERGE in a similar manner.

MERGE INTO customer USING (SELECT * FROM new_customer_stage) AS sub ON sub.id = customer.id 
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET name = sub.name, state = sub.state 
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (sub.id, sub.name, sub.state);
noteYou can map specific columns in the INSERT clause of the query
            instead of passing values (including null) for columns in the target table that do not
            have any data to insert. The unspecified columns in the INSERT clause are either mapped
            to null or use default constraints, if any. For example, you can construct the INSERT
              clause as WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (customer.id=sub.id,
                customer.name=sub.name, customer.state=sub.state) instead of  WHEN
                NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (sub.id, sub.name, 'null',
            sub.state).
