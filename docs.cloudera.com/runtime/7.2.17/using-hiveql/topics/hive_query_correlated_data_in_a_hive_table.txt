Querying correlated
      data
You can query one table relative to the data in another table.
A correlated query contains a query predicate with the
        equals (=) operator. One side of the operator must reference at least one column from the
        parent query and the other side must reference at least one column from the subquery. An uncorrelated 
        query does not reference any columns in the parent query.      
     

Select all state and net_payments values from the transfer_payments table for years
               during which the value of the state column in the transfer_payments table matches the
               value of the state column in the us_census table.

SELECT state, net_payments
FROM transfer_payments
WHERE EXISTS 
   (SELECT year 
   FROM us_census 
   WHERE transfer_payments.state = us_census.state); 

This query is correlated because one side of the equals predicate operator in the
               subquery references the state column in the transfer_payments table in the parent
               query and the other side of the operator references the state column in the us_census
               table.
This statement includes a conjunct in the WHERE clause. A conjunct is
                  equivalent to the AND condition, while a disjunct is the equivalent of the OR
                  condition The following subquery contains a conjunct:
... WHERE transfer_payments.year = "2018" AND us_census.state =
                  "california"
The following subquery contains a disjunct:
... WHERE transfer_payments.year = "2018" OR us_census.state =
                  "california"
