Using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 with Hue
Hue can read to and write to an Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2.
note
You can use the ABFS file browser to store and retrieve data from ADLS Gen2 into
    Hue and vice versa. If your CDP cluster is secured using Knox, then the Hue users will be able
    to access the ADLS as per the access rules set on the individual components. The access
    permissions are governed by IDBroker.
Only Hue superusers can view and access the ABFS file browser.

In CDP, you can enable the ABFS File Browser in Hue in the following three
    ways:
With IDBroker
Without IDBroker
With Ranger Authorization Service


Enabling ABFS file browser for Hue configured with IDBrokerYou can directly access the Azure file storage from Hue to upload files and tables to         Azure file storage and import CSV files as tables directly in Hue by enabling the ABFS file         browser on the Hue user interface.Enabling ABFS file browser for Hue configured without IDBrokerYou can directly access the Azure file storage from Hue to upload files and tables to         Azure file storage and import CSV files as tables directly in Hue by enabling the ABFS file         browser on the Hue user interface. You must specify the Azure client ID and the client         secret ID information along with the tenant ID in the Hue Server Advanced Configuration         Snippet if you have not set up authentication using Knox IDBroker.Enabling ABFS File Browser in Hue with RAZ in DataHubHue offers you the capability to browse Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 file         system, upload files to ABFS, and create tables by importing files from ABFS containers.         With RAZ, you can grant fine-grained access to per-user home directories and other         directories within the ADLS containers using Ranger policies.Parent topic: About using Hue
