Comparing Hive and Impala queries in Hue
You can compare two queries to know how each query is performing in terms of speed
        and cost-effectiveness. Hue compares various aspects of the two queries, based on which you
        can identify what changed between the executions of those two queries, and you can debug
        performance-related issues between different runs of the same query.

The query comparison report provides you a detailed side-by-side comparison of your
                queries.
For Hive queries, it includes recommendations for optimizing each query, metadata
                about the queries, visual explain for each query, query timeline, query
                configuration, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) information, DAG flows, DAG swimlanes,
                DAG counters, and DAG configurations.
For Impala queries, the query comparison report includes query details, execution
                plan details, and the aggregated metrics for both the queries and provides a
                variance between the two.
