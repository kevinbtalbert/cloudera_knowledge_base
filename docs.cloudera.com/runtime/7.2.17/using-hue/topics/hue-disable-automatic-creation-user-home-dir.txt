Disabling the automatic creation of user home directories
If you have enabled fine-grained authorization to access S3, then Hue is configured
        to automatically create user home directories, by default. You can disable the automatic
        creation of user home directories by setting the autocreate_user_dir flag to false in the
        Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet.

Log in to the CDP web interface as an Administrator.

Go to Data Hub Clusters and select your cluster.

Click on the CM URL to open Cloudera Manager.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                            hue_safety_valve.ini and add the following lines:

[desktop]
[[raz]]
autocreate_user_dir=false


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
