Enabling ABFS File Browser in Hue with RAZ in DataHub
Hue offers you the capability to browse Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 file
        system, upload files to ABFS, and create tables by importing files from ABFS containers.
        With RAZ, you can grant fine-grained access to per-user home directories and other
        directories within the ADLS containers using Ranger policies.

Hue administrators can create home directories for users by selecting the
                    Create home directory option on the user's profile in
                Hue. If fine-grained authorization is enabled to access ADLS containers, then user
                home directories are automatically created when a user logs into Hue. You can
                disable automatic creation of user directories.
noteIf you have enabled RAZ while registering your Azure
                environment with CDP, then Hue uses RAZ as the default mechanism for enabling the
                ABFS File Browser

You must enable RAZ while registering your environment with
            CDP. See Introduction to RAZ on Azure environments” to get started with RAZ and complete
            the following steps:
Register an Azure environment with the Enable Ranger authorization
                        for ADLS Gen2 option enabled. You can use the CDP web interface
                    or the CDP CLI to complete this task.
Create a Data Hub cluster with Data Engineering or Data Mart cluster
                    template.
Create the following Ranger policies:
Hadoop SQL policy (all - database, table, column, all - url).noteYou must grant permissions to individual users
                                or groups in these Ranger policies. To grant permissions to all
                                users, you can specify {USER} in the Permission section.
ABFS (cm_ADLS) policy (Default: User Home)You must specify the
                                storage account name in the Storage Account
                                field and the directory path of the container and its
                                sub-directories in the Storage Account
                                    Container field of the cm_ADLS Ranger
                            policy.

Grant appropriate permissions to the users in CDP User Management Service (UMS).
                    For example, EnvironmentUser.


Log in to the CDP web interface as an Administrator.

Go to Management Console > Environments, select your environment and go to the Data
                        Lake tab.

Click on the CM URL to open Cloudera Manager.

Go to Clusters > Ranger RAZ service > Instances > RAZ server > Processes and note the value of the
                        fs.azure.ext.raz.rest.host.url property from the
                        core-site.xml file. You need this to specify the value of
                    the api_url property in the Hue configuration.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                            hue_safety_valve.ini and add the following lines:

[desktop]
app_blacklist=spark,zookeeper,hbase,impala,search,sqoop,security,pig
[[raz]]
is_enabled=true
api_url=[***fs.azure.ext.raz.rest.host.url***]

[azure]
[[abfs_clusters]]
[[[default]]]
fs_defaultfs=abfs://[***CONTAINER-FOR-DATA-ACCESS***]@[***STORAGE-ACCOUNT***].dfs.core.windows.net
# For example, fs_defaultfs=abfs://storage-fs@mystorage.dfs.core.windows.net
webhdfs_url=https://[***STORAGE-ACCOUNT***].dfs.core.windows.net
# For example, webhdfs_url=https://mystorage.dfs.core.windows.net

[filebrowser]
remote_storage_home=abfs://[***CONTAINER-FOR-DATA-ACCESS***]/user
# For example, remote_storage_home=abfs://storage-fs/user
noteRAZ HA is not supported. You cannot specify a
                        comma-separated list of URLs in the api_url
                        property.


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.

ABFS File Browser icon is added to the left assist pane on the Hue web interface.
            When you click on the ABFS File Browser icon, you are redirected to your user home
            directory.
