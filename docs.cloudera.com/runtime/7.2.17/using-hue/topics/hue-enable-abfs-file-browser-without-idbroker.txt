Enabling ABFS file browser for Hue configured without IDBroker
You can directly access the Azure file storage from Hue to upload files and tables to
        Azure file storage and import CSV files as tables directly in Hue by enabling the ABFS file
        browser on the Hue user interface. You must specify the Azure client ID and the client
        secret ID information along with the tenant ID in the Hue Server Advanced Configuration
        Snippet if you have not set up authentication using Knox IDBroker.

Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an Admin user.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration.

Specify the following in the Hue Server Advanced Configuration
                        Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve_server.ini
                    field:

[desktop]
# Remove the file browser from the blacklisted apps.
# Tweak the app_blacklist property to suit your app configuration.
app_blacklist=spark,zookeeper,hive,hbase,search,oozie,jobsub,pig,sqoop,security
[azure]
  [[azure_accounts]]
    [[[default]]]
      client_id=<client_id>
      client_secret=<client_secret_id>
      tenant_id=<tenant_id>

    [[abfs_clusters]]
      [[[default]]]   
		fs_defaultfs=abfs://<container_name>@<storage_name>.dfs.core.windows.net
		webhdfs_url=https://<storage_name>.dfs.core.windows.net/

The custom configuration is stored in the
                        hue_safety_valve_server.ini file.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
The ABFS file browser icon appears on the left Assist panel as well as on the
                    left navigation bar on the Hue web interface.

You must manually grant the following application
            permission to non-admin users and groups for them to be able to view and access S3 File
