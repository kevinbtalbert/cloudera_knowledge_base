Enabling S3 File Browser for Hue with RAZ in DataHub
Hue offers you the capability to browse S3 buckets, upload files to S3, and create
        tables by importing files from S3. With RAZ, you can grant fine-grained access to per-user
        home directories and other directories within the S3 bucket using Ranger
        policies.

Hue administrators can create home directories for users by selecting the
                    Create home directory option on the user's profile in
                Hue. If fine-grained authorization is enabled to access S3 buckets, then user home
                directories are automatically created when a user logs into Hue. You can disable
                automatic creation of user directories.




Register an AWS environment with the Enable Ranger authorization
                            for AWS S3 option enabled. You can use the CDP web interface
                        or the CDP CLI to complete this task.
Create a Data Hub cluster with Data Engineering or Data Mart cluster
                        template.
Create the following Ranger policies:
Hadoop SQL policy (all - database, table, column, all - url).noteYou must grant permissions to individual
                                    users or groups in these Ranger policies. To grant permissions
                                    to all users, you can specify {USER} in the Permission
                                    section.
S3 (cm_S3) policy (Default: User Home).You must specify the
                                    bucket name in the S3 Bucket field and
                                    the directory path in the Path field of
                                    the cm_S3 Ranger policy.

Grant appropriate permissions to the users in CDP User Management Service
                        (UMS). For example, EnvironmentUser.




Log in to the CDP web interface as an Administrator.

Go to Management Console > Environments, select your environment and go to the Data
                        Lake tab.

Click on the CM URL to open Cloudera Manager.

Go to Clusters > Ranger RAZ service > Instances > RAZ server > Processes and note the value of the
                        fs.s3a.ext.raz.rest.host.url property from the
                        core-site.xml file. You need this to specify the value of
                    the api_url property in the Hue configuration.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration > Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for
                            hue_safety_valve.ini and add the following lines:

[desktop]
app_blacklist=spark,zookeeper,hbase,impala,search,sqoop,security,pig
[[raz]]
is_enabled=true
api_url=[***fs.s3a.ext.raz.rest.host.url***]
[aws]
has_iam_detection=false

[[aws_accounts]]
[[[default]]]
region=[***AWS-REGION***]
host=s3.[***AWS-REGION***].amazonaws.com
allow_environment_credentials=false

[filebrowser]
remote_storage_home=s3a://[***S3-BUCKET-NAME***]/user
noteRAZ HA is not supported. You cannot specify a
                        comma-separated list of URLs in the api_url
                        property.


Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.

S3 File Browser icon is added to the left assist pane on the
            Hue web interface. When you click on the S3 File Browser icon, you are redirected to
            your user home directory.
