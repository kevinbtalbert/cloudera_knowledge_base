Enabling the SQL editor autocompleter
Autocompleter provides finely tuned SQL suggestions for Hive and Impala
    dialects while you enter queries into the editor window. See Brand new Autocompleter for Hive and
      Impala in the Hue blog.

Autocompleter is enabled by default. To manually enable or disable it, open the editor
            configuration panel and edit settings as follows:


Log in to Hue and go to either the Hive or Impala editor.

Place your cursor in the editor window and then use one of the following keyboard
                shortcuts to open the editor configuration panel:



On a Mac system, use the Command key followed by a hyphen and then a comma:
Command-,


On a Windows system, use the Ctrl key followed by a hyphen and then a comma:
Ctrl-,


tipType a question mark (?) anywhere but in the active editor window to open
                  a menu of editor keyboard shortcuts.


To enable autocompletion, check the box adjacent to Enable
              Autocompleter. When you check Enable Autocompleter,
              Enable Live Autocompletion is automatically enabled as well. Place
              your cursor in the editor window to close the configuration panel.






To disable autocompletion:


Uncheck Enable Live Autocompletion but leave
                  Enable Autocompleter checked, and then place your cursor in the
                  editor window to close the configuration panel. This disables live autocompletion, but
                  if you want to use autocompletion while building your queries in the editor, enter the
                  following key stroke sequence to activate autocompletion: Ctrl + Space Key
Uncheck both Enable Autocompleter and Enable Live
                  Autocompletion, and then click in the editor to close the configuration
                  panel. This disables all autocompletion functionality.
