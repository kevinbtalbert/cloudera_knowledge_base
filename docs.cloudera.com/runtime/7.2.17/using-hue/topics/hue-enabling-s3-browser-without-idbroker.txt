Enabling S3 browser for Hue configured without IDBroker
You can access the S3 buckets from Hue to upload files and tables to S3 and import
        CSV files as tables directly in Hue by enabling the S3 browser. You must specify the AWS
        access key and secret access key information along with the AWS region in the Hue Server
        Advanced Configuration Snippet if you have not set up authentication using Knox IDBroker. 

Sign in to Cloudera Manager as an Administrator.

Go to Clusters > Hue service > Configuration.

Enter the following in the Hue Server Advanced Configuration Snippet
                        (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve_server.ini field:

[desktop]
# Remove the file browser from the blacklisted apps.
# Tweak the app_blacklist property to suit your app configuration.
app_blacklist=spark,zookeeper,hive,hbase,search,oozie,jobsub,pig,sqoop,security
[aws]
[[aws_accounts]]
[[[default]]]
access_key_id=[***AWS-ACCESS-KEY***]
secret_access_key=[***SECRET-ACCESS-KEY***]
region=[***AWS-REGION***]

# Set a particular S3 bucket as the default
[filebrowser]
remote_storage_home=s3a://[***S3-BUCKET-NAME***]

The custom configuration is stored in the
                        hue_safety_valve_server.ini file.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the Hue service.
The S3 file browser icon appears on the left Assist panel as well as on the
                    left navigation bar on the Hue web interface.

You must manually grant the following application
            permission to non-admin users and groups for them to be able to view and access S3 File
            Browser in Hue: filebrowser.s3_access:Access to S3 from filebrowser and
                filepicker.
