You can only assign Hue application permissions to groups or
            users within a group. Add the users to a group to whom you want to grant access to the
            S3 or ABFS File Browsers.importantThe "default" group in Hue does not have
                the permissions required to view S3 or ABFS File Browsers, by default. If your users
                belong to the default group, then you must manually grant the required
                permissions.

Sign in to Hue as an Administrator.

Go to admin > Manage Users > Groups.

Click on the group to whom you want to grant the filebrowser
                    application permissions.

On the Edit [***GROUP-NAME***] page, select the required
                    permission under the permission section and click
                        Update group.
