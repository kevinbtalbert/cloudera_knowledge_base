Using SQL to query HBase from HueCloudera Docs
Using SQL to query HBase from Hue
Hue provides a simple SQL interface to create and manipulate SQL tables that are stored
  in HBase, and define and
  manipulate
  views on HBase tables using Apache Phoenix in addition to HBase shell and database
  API.
Cloudera does not recommend manipulating Phoenix tables from HBase as this can lead to data
   loss.
The SQL connector is shipped with Hue so that you do not have to download and configure it
   yourself.
Following are some examples to create and manipulate the Phoenix SQL tables from the Hue
    editor:


Creating a table

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Company (company_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(225));


Upserting values in the table

UPSERT INTO Company VALUES(1, 'Cloudera');
UPSERT INTO Company VALUES(2, 'Apache');


Querying the table

SELECT * FROM Company;


Deleting a record

DELETE FROM Company WHERE COMPANY_ID=1;


Dropping the table

DROP TABLE Company;
