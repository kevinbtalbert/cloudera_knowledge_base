Using Amazon S3 with Hue
Hue can read to and write to an Amazon S3 bucket.
note
You can use the S3 browser to store and retrieve data
    from Amazon S3 buckets into Hue and vice versa. If your CDP cluster is secured using Knox, then
    the Hue users will be able to access the S3 folders as per the access rules set on the
    individual folders. The access permissions are governed by IDBroker.

In CDP, you can enable the S3 File Browser in Hue in the following three ways:
With IDBroker
Without IDBroker
With Ranger Authorization Service

        registering your AWS environment with CDP, then Hue uses RAZ as the default mechanism for
        enabling the S3 File Browser.
