Viewing Hive query history
The Queries tab on the Job Browser page in Hue displays all the queries that were run
             from
        various query interfaces, such as Beeline, Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC), Tableau, Hue, and
        other JDBC BI clients and tools.

Only Query Processor Administrators can view historical queries of all users to
                monitor resource utilization and control costs from the Hue Job Browser. Non-admin
                users can view only their queries.


Log in to the Hue web interface.

Click Jobs from the left assist panel.
The Job Browser page is displayed.

Click Queries.
The Hive queries that were run for the past seven days are displayed. You can
                    select the time period for which you want to view the historical data.
You can also filter queries by their status.
