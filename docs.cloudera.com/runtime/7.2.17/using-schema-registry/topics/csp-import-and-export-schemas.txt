Exporting and importing schemas
Learn how to export and import schemas between different Schema Regitry instances
    allowing services to exchange data without the challenge of managing and sharing schemas between
    them.
Schemas stored in Schema Registry can be exported to a JSON file. The exported JSON file can
      then be imported into another Schema Registry database.
During an import, SchemaMetadata, SchemaBranch, and SchemaVersion objects are put into the
      database. These objects retain their ID as well as a number of other properties that are
      available in the JSON file used for the import. This way, serializing and deserializing
      protocols can continue to function without any change and Schema Registry clients can
      seamlessly switch between different Schema Registry instances. Both import and export
      operations can be done either by using curl through the command line or by
      using the Schema Registry API.
