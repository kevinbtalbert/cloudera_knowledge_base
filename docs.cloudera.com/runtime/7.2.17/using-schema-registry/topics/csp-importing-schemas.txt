Importing schemas using Schema Registry APICloudera Docs
Importing schemas using Schema Registry API
One of the methods of importing schemas that were exported from one Schema Registry
        instance into another Schema Registry instance is using the Schema Registry API. You can
        also import schemas using curl through the command line.

The following steps describe how to import schemas by using the Schema Registry
                Swagger UI.

importantSchema import is only recommended to an empty Schema Registry
                    server or a Schema Registry server that has previously imported schemas.
                    Importing schemas to a Schema Registry that contains manually added schemas is
                    only possible if the Schema Registry instance has correctly configured ID
                    ranges. Otherwise, importing schemas might result in overlapping ID ranges and a
                    failed import. For more information on how to set up ID ranges, see ID
                        ranges in Schema Registry.





Ensure that the cluster, its hosts, and all its services are healthy.
Ensure that Schema Registry is commissioned and running.
Ensure that you have access to all credentials that are required to access
                        and use Schema Registry.
Ensure that you have access to a JSON file that contains the exported
                        schemas that you want to import. For more information on how to export
                        schemas, see Exporting schemas using Schema Registry API.
Ensure that you are logged in as a user with
                        access to the CDP environment containing the cluster with Schema
                        Registry.




In Management Console, go to Data Hub clusters.

Find and select the Data Hub cluster you want to import schemas to.

Under Services, click Schema
                        Registry.
The Schema Registry web UI opens in a new tab. 

In the tab that has the Schema Registry web UI open, replace
                        /ui/# at the end of the URL with
                    /swagger.

Click 3. Export/Import.

Click POST /api/v1/schemaregistry/import.

Click Try it out.

Set format to 0.

Set failOnError to true.

Click Choose file and select a JSON file containing the
                    schema data that you want to import.

Click Execute.

Schemas are successfully imported into the target Schema Registry instance.On successful import, a number of SchemaMetadata, SchemaBranch, and
                SchemaVersionInfo objects are added to the Schema Registry database.Objects added to the database retain the following property values from the import
                    file:
Schema Metadata objects retain the ID, type, schemaGroup, name, description,
                        compatibility, validationLevel, and evolve properties.
SchemaBranch objects retain the ID, name, schemaMetadataName, and
                        description properties.
SchemaVersionInfo objects retain the ID, schemaMetadataId, name,
                        description, version, and schemaText properties.
A successful import also results in a JSON file that contains the
                following:{
  "successCount": 0,
  "failedCount": 0,
  "failedIds": [

    0
  ]
}Where,
successCount is the number of successfully imported
                        SchemaVersionInfo objects.
failedCount is the number of SchemaVersionInfo objects that
                        failed to import.
failedIds contains the IDs of failed SchemaVersionInfo
                        objects.
Schemas (metadata/branch/version) that are already present in the
                database are skipped during an import. Skipped schemas are not counted in
                    successCount or failedCount.
