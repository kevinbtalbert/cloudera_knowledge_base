YARN resource allocation of
      multiple resource-types
You can manage your cluster capacity using the Capacity Scheduler in YARN. You can use
      the Capacity Scheduler's DefaultResourceCalculator or the
         DominantResourceCalculator to allocate available resources. 
The fundamental unit of scheduling in YARN is the queue. The capacity of each queue specifies the percentage of cluster
         resources available for applications submitted to the queue. You can set up queues in a
         hierarchy that reflects the database structure, resource requirements, and access
         restrictions required by the organizations, groups, and individuals who use the cluster
         resources.
You can use the default resource calculator when you want the resource calculator to
         consider only the available memory for resource calculation. When you use the default
         resource calculator (DefaultResourceCalculator), resources are allocated
         based on the available memory.
If you have multiple resource types, use the dominant resource calculator
            (DominantResourceCalculator) to enable CPU, , and memory
         scheduling. The dominant resource calculator is based on the Dominant Resource Fairness
         (DRF) model of resource allocation. DRF is designed to fairly distribute CPU,
         and memory resources among different types of processes in a mixed-workload
         cluster.
For example, if User A runs CPU-heavy tasks and User B runs memory-heavy tasks, the DRF
         allocates more CPU and less memory to the tasks run by User A, and allocates less CPU and
         more memory to the tasks run by User B. In a single resource case, in which all jobs are
         requesting the same resources, the DRF reduces to max-min fairness for that resource.
