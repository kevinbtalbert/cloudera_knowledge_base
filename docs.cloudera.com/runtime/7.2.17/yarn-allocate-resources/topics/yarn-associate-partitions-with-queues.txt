Associating partitions with queues
You can use partitions to run YARN applications on cluster nodes that have a
        specified partition.
Before associating partitions, you must create partitions and assign partitions to
            cluster nodes. For more information about creating partitions see, Creating partitions. note After you associate a
                partition with one or more queues, in the YARN Queue Manager UI, click
                    Overview > <Partition name> from
                the drop-down list and distribute capacity to the queues before switching allocation
                mode or creating placement rules.
noteThe term Partitions is used instead of Node Labels to be
                consistent with the YARN terminology.

Use Queue Manager to create and assign partitions to cluster nodes, associate the
                partitions (yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.accessible-node-labels)
                to queues and configure capacity to that queue for the specified partition. Queue
                Manager evenly distributes the available capacity among all the queues in the
                partition. You can manually modify the capacity on each partition of each queue, and
                also ensure that the sum of capacities of each partition of direct children of a
                parent queue at every level is equal to 100%. partitions that a queue can access
                (accessible partitions of a queue) must be the same as, or a subset of, the
                accessible partitions of its parent queue. 


 Assume that a cluster has a total of 8 nodes. The first 3 nodes (n1-n3) have
                partition = x, the next 3 nodes (n4-n6) have partition = y, and the final 2 nodes
                (n7, n8) do not have any partitions. Each node can run 10 containers.
The queue hierarchy is as follows:



Assume that queue “a” can access partitions “x” and “y”, and queue “b” can only
                access partition “y”. By definition, nodes without labels can be accessed by all
                queues.
Consider the following example label configuration for the queues, in the Relative
                resource allocation mode:
capacity(a) = 40, capacity(a, label=x) = 100, capacity(a, label=y) = 50; capacity(b)
                = 60, capacity(b, label=y) = 50
This means that:

Queue “a” can access 40% of the resources on nodes without any labels, 100% of
                    the resources on nodes with label=x, and 50% of the resources on nodes with
                    label=y.
Queue “b” can access 60% of the resources on nodes without any labels, and 50%
                    of the resources on nodes with label=y.

You can also see that for this configuration:
capacity(a) + capacity(b) = 100
capacity(a, label=x) + capacity(b, label=x) (b cannot access label=x, it is
                0) = 100
capacity(a, label=y) + capacity(b, label=y) = 100
For child queues under the same parent queue, the sum of the capacity for each label
                should equal 100%.
Similarly, you can set the capacities of the child queues a1, a2, and
                b1:
a1 and a2: capacity(a.a1) = 40, capacity(a.a1, label=x) =30, capacity(a.a1,
                label=y) =50 capacity(a.a2) = 60, capacity(a.a2, label=x) =70, capacity(a.a2,
                label=y) =50;
b1: capacity(b.b1) = 100, capacity(b.b1, label=y) = 100
You can see that for the a1 and a2 configuration:
capacity(a.a1) + capacity(a.a2) = 100
capacity(a.a1, label=x) + capacity(a.a2, label=x) = 100
capacity(a.a1, label=y) + capacity(a.a2, label=y) = 100
How many resources can queue a1 access?
Resources on nodes without any labels: Resource = 20 (total containers that
                can be allocated on nodes without a label, in this case n7, n8) * 40% (a.capacity) *
                40% (a.a1.capacity) = 3.2 (containers)
Resources on nodes with label=x
Resource = 30 (total containers that can be allocated on nodes with
                label=x, in this case n1-n3) * 100% (a.labelx.capacity) * 30% = 9 (containers)
To implement this example configuration, perform the following

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters > YARN Queue Manager UI
                    service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview
                    tab. 
Click on the three vertical dots on a queue and select the View/Edit
                        Queue Properties option.
In the Queue Properties dialog-box , select the x label from the
                        Accessible Partitions drop-down box, click +, again select
                        the y label from the Accessible Partitions drop-down box, and
                        click Save.


Repeat the above steps to assign x label for
                        a1 and a2 queues.
Click on the three vertical dots on b queue and select the
                        Edit Queue Properties option.
In the Queue Properties dialog-box, select the
                        y label from the Accessible Partitions
                    drop-down box, click +, and click
                        Save.
Repeat the above steps to assign y label for b1,
                        a, a1, and a2 queue. Queue Manager
                        automatically distributes the available capacity among all the queues in the
                        partition. If you want to modify the capacity of the queues, click on the
                            Partition drop-down box in the
                            Overview tab, select the label and modify the
                        queue capacity.
In the Overview tab, click on the
                        Partition drop-down box and select label
                        y.
Click on the three vertical dots on the a queue and select
                    the Edit Child Queues option.
Enter
                    the Configured Capacity of a1 to
                        50 and a2 to
                        50 and Click Save.
Click on the three vertical dots on the b queue and select
                    the Edit Child Queues option.
Enter the Configured Capacity of b1
                    to 100 and click Save.
Click on the three vertical dots on the root queue and
                    select the Edit Child Queues
                    option.
Enter the Configured Capacity of a
                    to 50 and b to
                        50 and click Save.
