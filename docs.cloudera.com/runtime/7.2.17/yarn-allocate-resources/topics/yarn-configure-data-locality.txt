Configuring data locality
Capacity Scheduler leverages Delay Scheduling to honor task locality
    constraints. There are three levels of locality constraint: node-local, rack-local, and
    off-switch. The scheduler counts the number of missed opportunities when the locality cannot be
    satisfied and waits for this count to reach a threshold before relaxing the locality constraint
    to the next level. You can configure this threshold using the Node Locality Delay
      (yarn.scheduler.capacity.node-locality-delay) and Rack Locality Additional Delay
      (yarn.scheduler.capacity.rack-locality-additional-delay) fields. 
To configure data locality, perform the following:

In Cloudera Manager, select the Clusters > YARN Queue Manager UI
        service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview tab. 
Click the Scheduler Configuration tab.
In the Node Locality Delay textbox, enter the number of scheduling opportunities
        that can be missed. Capacity Scheduler attempts to schedule rack-local containers only
          after missing this number of opportunities. You must ensure this number is same as the
          number of nodes in the cluster.
In the Rack Locality Additional Delay textbox, enter the number of missed
        scheduling opportunities, over the Node Locality Delay ones, after which Capacity Scheduler
        should attempt to schedule off-switch containers. A value of -1 means that the value is
          calculated based on the formula L * C / N, where L is the number of
          locations (nodes or racks) specified in the resource request, C is the number of
          requested containers, and N is the size of the cluster.
Click Save.
