Enabling Intra-Queue preemption
Intra-queue preemption prevents resource imbalances in a queue. 

Intra-queue preemption helps in effective distribution of resources within a queue based on configured user limits or application priorities.
To configure Intra-Queue Preemption (yarn.resourcemanager.monitor.capacity.preemption.intra-queue-preemption.enabled) on all queues, perform the following:


In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters > YARN Queue Manager UI
          service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview tab. 

Click the Configuration tab.

Select the Enable Intra Queue Preemption checkbox. 

Click Save.

For information about configuring intra-queue preemption for a specific queue, see

              Preemption for a specific queue.
