Configure queue ordering policies
You can configure the property for queue ordering policies (yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.ordering-policy) to FIFO or Fair. The default
    setting is FIFO.

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters > YARN Queue Manager UI
          service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview tab. 

Click on the three vertical dots on the queue you want to configure queue ordering
          policies and select the Edit Queue Properties option.

In the Queue Properties dialog-box, select the ordering policy
          as FIFO or Fair using the Ordering Policy
          drop-down box . 

Click Save.
