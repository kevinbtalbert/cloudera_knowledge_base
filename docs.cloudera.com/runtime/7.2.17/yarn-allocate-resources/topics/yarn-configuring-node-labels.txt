Enabling node labels on a
      cluster to configure partition
You can configure partitions on a cluster by making configuration changes on the YARN
      ResourceManager host. 

Create a Label Directory in HDFS.


Use the following commands to create a  node-labels
                     directory in which to store the Node Labels in HDFS:

sudo su hdfs
hadoop fs -mkdir -p /yarn/node-labels
hadoop fs -chown -R yarn:yarn /yarn
hadoop fs -chmod -R 700 /yarn
Where -chmod -R 700 specifies that only the
                           yarn user can access the node-labels
                        directory.



Use the following command to confirm that the directory was created in
                     HDFS:

hadoop fs -ls /yarn
The new node-labels directory should appear. The
                        owner should be yarn, and the permission should be
                           drwx:
                        Found 1 items
drwx------ - yarn yarn 0 2014-11-24 13:09 /yarn/node-labels





In Cloudera Manager, navigate to YARN >  Configuration.

Search for node label.

Find the Node Labels property and ensure that it is selected
               (enabled).

Find the Node Labels Directory property and set its value to
               reference the HDFS node label directory.
For example: hdfs://node-1.example.com:8020/yarn/node-labels/.
                  HDFS paths are automatically translated, however, any other file system
                  requires a full path to the Node Labels Directory. The default value of the
                     Node Labels Directory property is
                     /yarn/node-labels.

Start or Restart the YARN ResourceManager.
