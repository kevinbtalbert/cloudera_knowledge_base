Configuring the queue auto removal expiration time
The expiration time for automatic queue deletion is set to 300 seconds by default.
        You can change this value using the YARN Queue Manager UI. 

In Cloudera Manager navigate to Clusters >  YARN Queue Manager UI.
The Overview tab is opened, displaying a hierarchical view of the
                    queues.

Click Configuration.

Find the Queue Auto Removal Expiration Time property and
                    set the expiration time in seconds.

The default expiration time is 300, meaning that if auto queue deletion is
                        enabled for a queue, its dynamically created child queues are deleted 300
                        seconds after the last job finished on them. 


Click Save.

Restart the YARN service.
