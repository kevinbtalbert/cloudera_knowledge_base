Configuring the resource capacity of root queue in absolute mode
In absolute resource allocation mode when you remove or add new resources to your
        cluster, you can update the resource capacity for the root queue accordingly. You can
        configure the capacity of the root queue using the YARN Queue Manager UI.

In absolute resource allocation mode when the available resource capacity
                changes permanently in the cluster or in a partition, reconfiguring the resource
                capacity of the root queue might be needed.
In case of a resource capacity increase, you can update the root queue
                directly. 
However, if there was a decrease in the available resource capacity, you cannot
                update the root queue until child queues have been updated. In a case like this, you
                must update resource capacities starting from the lowest queue level. This is
                because a parent queue’s capacity cannot be decreased until the total resource
                capacity of all of its child queue is reduced.


In Cloudera Manager navigate to Clusters >  YARN Queue Manager UI.
The Overview tab is opened, displaying a
                    hierarchical view of the queues.
Optional: 
If there was a decrease in the available resources, configure the resource
                    capacity of the child queues.
You must update resource capacities starting from the lowest queue level. This
                    is because a parent queue’s capacity cannot be decreased until the total
                    resource capacity of all of its child queue is reduced. You might have to change
                    both the minimum and maximum values. 

Click the three vertical dots next to the root queue.

Select Edit Root Queue.
The Accessible Cluster Capacity dialog box is
                    displayed.

Configure resource capacity for the root queue.
The Accessible Cluster Capacity dialog box provides
                    information about the available resources:
Total Configured Memory and the delta to be adjusted
Total Configured vCores and the delta to be adjusted
If there was an increase in the resource capacity, the
                            Accessible Cluster Capacity dialog box looks
                        similar to the following:

If there was a decrease in the resource capacity, the
                            Accessible Cluster Capacity dialog box looks
                        similar to the following:



Click Save.
If the adjustable delta is less than zero, you cannot save the updated
                    configuration.


After saving the resource capacity of the root queue, the Failed to update
                    queue configuration error message is displayed with the following
                details: Validation failed for modify queue operation. Error message:
                    CapacityScheduler configuration validation failed:java.io.IOException: Failed to

This error message appears when there was a decrease in the available
                resources and you updated the resource capacity of the root queue before updating
                the child queues.
To resolve this issue, update the resource capacity of the child queues
                first, and then update the root queue.
