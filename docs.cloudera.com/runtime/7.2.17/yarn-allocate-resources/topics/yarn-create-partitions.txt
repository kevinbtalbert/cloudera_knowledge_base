Creating partitions
You must first create partitions to assign them to nodes and associate it with
      queues.
You must enable node labels on a cluster before you create a partition. For more
         information, see Enable node labels on a
            cluster. 

In Cloudera Manager, navigate to Clusters >  YARN Queue Manager UI service. 
A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the
                  Overview tab. 

Click Partitions.

Click +Create. 
The Create Partition dialog box is
               displayed.

Add a name for the partition in Partition Name.

Select Exclusive or Non-Exclusive
               node label type under Partition Type. 
For information about Exclusive or Non-Exclusive partition type, see Configure Partitions.

Select one or more unassigned nodes listed under Unassigned
                  Nodes and click the < arrow to move it under
                  Assigned Nodes to assign it to the partition. You can also
               search or filter the nodes using the regular expression.
