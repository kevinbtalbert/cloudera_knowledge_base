Setting a default partition
      expression
You can set a default partition on a queue. The default partition is used if no
      partition is specified when the application is submitted to the queue. By default, this field
      is empty, so applications get containers from nodes without a partition or label.

In Cloudera Manager, select the Clusters > YARN Queue Manager
                  UI service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the
                  Overview tab. 

Click on the three vertical dots on the queue and select the View/Edit
                  Queue Properties option. 

In the Queue Properties dialog-box, select the default
               partition from the Default Partition Expression drop-down
               list.

Click Save.
