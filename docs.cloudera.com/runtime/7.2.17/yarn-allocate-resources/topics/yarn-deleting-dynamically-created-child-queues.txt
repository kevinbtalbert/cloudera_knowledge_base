Deleting dynamically created child queues 
Dynamically created child queues can be deleted automatically once they become inactive,
  or manually with some limitations.
Automatic child queue deletion
The automatic queue deletion feature is enabled by default. As a result, dynamically created
    child queues are deleted 300 seconds after their last job is finished. You can disable this
    feature globally for all dynamic child creation enabled parent queues or for specific parent
    queues. Additionally, configuring the queue removal expiration time is also possible.noteThis feature is called auto queue deletion on the global level and queue
     auto removal on the queue level.

Manual child queue deletion
Unlike parent queues, dynamically created child queues cannot be deleted manually. No action
    or button exists that deletes a specific dynamically created child queue. Instead, you can
    delete them by either restarting the YARN service or deleting the parent queue.
