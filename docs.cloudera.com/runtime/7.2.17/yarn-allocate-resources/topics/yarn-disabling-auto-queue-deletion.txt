Disabling auto queue deletion globally
Dynamically created child queues are automatically deleted after they expire. If you
        want to keep all dynamically created child queues running after their last job is finished,
        you can disable automatic queue deletion on a global level. 

 By default automatic queue removal is enabled on two levels: globally and
                on the level of dynamic child creation enabled parent queues. The following steps
                describe how to disable the auto queue deletion feature on a global level, that is,
                dynamically created child queues are not deleted automatically once they become
                inactive. 
noteIf you want to disable the automatic queue removal for
                specific dynamic child creation enabled parent queues, use the Queue Auto
                    Removal (YARN restart required) Queue Manager property. For more
                information, see Disabling queue auto removal on a queue level.


In Cloudera Manager, navigate to YARN >  Configuration.

Search for queue deletion.

Find and clear the Capacity Scheduler Auto Queue
                        Deletion property to disable the auto queue deletion
                    feature.

Click Save.

Restart the YARN service.

Auto queue deletion is disabled. Dynamically created queues do not get deleted once
            they became inactive.
