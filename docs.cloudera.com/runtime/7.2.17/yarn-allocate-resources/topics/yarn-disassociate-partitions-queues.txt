Disassociating partitions
      from queues
You can disassociate a partition from the queue. You should disassociate a partition
      before you delete the queue. Before disassociating a partition from a queue, you should remove
      the partition capacity for that queue by setting it to zero.

In Cloudera Manager, select the Clusters > YARN Queue Manager
                  UI service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the
                  Overview tab. 

Click on the three vertical dots on a queue and select the View/Edit
                  Queue Properties option.

In the Queue Properties dialog box, from the
                  Accessible Partitions, click X next
               to the name of the partition. 






Click Save.
