Enabling override of default queue mappingsCloudera Docs
Enabling override of default queue mappings
By default, placement rules are considered only if a target queue is not specified
    during a job submission.You can change that behaviour to take placement rules into account
    whether a target queue is specified at job submission or not.

The yarn.scheduler.capacity.queue-mappings-override.enable property
        controls when placement rules are considered. In the YARN Queue Manager UI, this property is
        called Override Queue Mapping. By default, the property is set to
          false, which means the feature is disabled and placement rules cannot
        override the target queue that was specified at job submission. 
The following table shows how it is specified which queue should be used for a job in
        different scenarios:Table 1. Target queue speficiation scenarios

When placement rules override the target queue defined at job submission, the
        specified queue can  still be taken into account if the specified placement
        rule policy is used. For more information, see Placement rule policies.
