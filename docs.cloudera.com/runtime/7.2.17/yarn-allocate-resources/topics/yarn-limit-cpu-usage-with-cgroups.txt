Limit CPU usage with
      Cgroups
You can use cgroups to limit CPU usage in a Hadoop Cluster. 
You can use cgroups to isolate CPU-heavy processes in a Hadoop cluster. If you are using
         CPU Scheduling, you should also use cgroups to constrain and manage CPU processes. If you
         are not using CPU Scheduling, do not enable cgroups.
When you enable CPU Scheduling, queues are still used to allocate cluster resources, but
                  both CPU and memory are taken into consideration using a scheduler that utilizes
                  Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF). In the DRF model, resource allocation takes into
                  account the dominant resource required by a process. CPU-heavy processes (such as
                  Storm-on-YARN) receive more CPU and less memory. Memory-heavy processes (such as
                  MapReduce) receive more memory and less CPU. The DRF scheduler is designed to
                  fairly distribute memory and CPU resources among different types of processes in a
                  mixed- workload cluster.
Cgroups compliments CPU Scheduling by providing CPU resource isolation. It enables you to
         set limits on the amount of CPU resources granted to individual YARN containers, and also
         lets you set a limit on the total amount of CPU resources used by YARN processes.
Cgroups represents one aspect of YARN resource management capabilities that includes CPU
         Scheduling, partitions, archival storage, and memory as storage. If CPU Scheduling is used,
         cgroups should be used along with it to constrain and manage CPU processes.
