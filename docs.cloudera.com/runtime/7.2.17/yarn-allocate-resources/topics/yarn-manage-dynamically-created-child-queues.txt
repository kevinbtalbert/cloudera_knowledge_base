Managing dynamically created child queues
YARN Queue Manager UI provides an overview of your queue hierarchy where you can view
        and manage your dynamically created child queues.

You cannot directly delete dynamically created child queues. For more information
                about dynamic queue deletion, see Delete dynamically created child
                    queues.


In Cloudera Manager, select the YARN Queue Manager
                    UI.
A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the
                        Overview tab. A  leaf is displayed next to the queue name of parent queues
                    for which dynamic child creation is enabled.

Select the More Options menu and perform one of the
                    following actions for a dynamically created queue:


Edit Queue Properties: Available in relative
                            and absolute resource allocation mode.
More Information: You are redirected to the
                                Resource Manager UIv2 Queue page.
