Managing YARN Queue Manager
YARN Queue Manager manages Capacity Scheduler configuration It also provides a user
  interface (YARN Queue Manager UI) that makes it easier for Hadoop operators to create, configure
  and manage YARN queues on a global or queue level. 
As Capacity Scheduler is the supported scheduler in CDP, Cloudera recommends using
   YARN Queue Manager to manage the scheduler configuration.

Configuring YARN Queue Manager dependency If you add the YARN Queue Manager service to the cluster after     installing the cluster, you must configure the YARN Queue Manager     dependency.Accessing the YARN Queue Manager UIOnce you have enabled the Queue Manager UI, you can use it to manage your scheduler         configuration.Providing read-only access to Queue Manager UI You can now allow non-admin users to access YARN Queue Manager in a read-only mode. You     can either create a new user account with read-only role or use any existing user account with     read-only role in Cloudera Manager to access YARN Queue Manager UI. In the read-only access     mode, the user can view all the configurations but cannot make any changes to the     configurations.Configuring the embedded Jetty Server in Queue ManagerThe configuration properties of the Jetty Server embedded in the Queue Manager can be         configured using Cloudera Manager. The configuration of these properties can facilitate         debugging.
