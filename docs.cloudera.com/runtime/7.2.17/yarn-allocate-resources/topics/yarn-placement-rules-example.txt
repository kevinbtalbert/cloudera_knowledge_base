Example - Placement rules creation
You have to set up your placement rules to fulfill your specific need. In this example a
    cluster is shared among developers, QA engineers and test developers and there are nine
    placement logics that you want to set up.
The following is the placement logic that has to be achieved when creating placement rules:
If the user belongs to the devs primary group, the application should
          be placed to root.users.devs. This is reserved for developers.
If the user belongs to the qa primary group, then the application
          should go to root.users.lowpriogroups.<primaryGroup>. These queues
          have lower capacities and are intended for testers.
If the user belongs to the qa-dev primary group, then the application
          should go to root.users.highpriogroups.<primaryGroup>. These queues
          have higher capacities and are intended for test developers.
Place the application into the queue which matches the user name.
If there is no such queue, take the queue from the application submission context, but
          the queue should not be created if it does not exist and the parent is managed.
If none of the above matches, then the application should be placed into the
            root.default queue.
If the default placement fails , change the default queue to
            root.users.default.
Try a placement to the default queue again.
If that fails, reject the submission altogether.

Using the Queue Manager UI, this logic can be achieved in the following way:
Queue hierarchy
Queue with bolt signs next to their names are auto dynamic child creation enabled parents.
