How to read the Placement Rules table
In the Queue Manager UI you can view all of your placement rules on one page.
   Learning about this page can help you manage your placement rules according to your
   needs.
The placement rules overview page is displayed in Cloudera Manager if you select the
    Queue Manager UI and then go to the Placement
    Rules tab. It displays a table with the following columns:
Table 1. Placement rules overview page

Column Name
Description




Order


Placement rules are evaluated from top to bottom. This column provides the order of the
        placement rules.




Type


Indicates to the engine what the current rule should be matched against: application,
        user, or group.
Values: Application, Users,
         Group




Match


The string to match, or an asterisk "*" which means "all". For
         example, if the type is User and this string is "hadoop" then the
         rule will only be evaluated if the submitter user is "hadoop". The
         "*" does not work with groups.




Policy


Pre-defined or custom policies which defines where the application
         should be placed. 
Values: User, PrimaryGroup,
         PrimaryGroupUser,
         SecondaryGroup,
         SecondaryGroupUser,
         ApplicationName, Specified,
         Reject, DefaultQueue,
         SetDefaultQueue, Custom




Parent Queue


In the case of User, PrimaryGroup,
         PrimaryGroupUser, SecondaryGroup, and
         SecondaryGroupUser policies, this tells the engine where the matching
        queue should be looked for. For example, if the policy is PrimaryGroup,
        parent is root.groups and the submitted's group is "admin", then the
        resulting queue will be: root.groups.admin




Custom Value


It can have two types of values:
In the case of the SetDefaultQueue policy: The default queue will
          change from root.default to the value of this field.
In the case of the Custom policy: The value of this field will be
          evaluated directly by the placement rules evaluation engine, which means that various
          placeholders such as %application or %primary_group will
          be replaced with their respective values.





Create Queue?


It sets the create flag and it works differently in
         weight and in legacy mode.
If it is set to No, the target queue determined by the placement policy
         will not be created if it does not exist. That means that auto dynamic child creation will
        not happen.
However, even if it is set to Yes it is still not guaranteed that the
        queue will be created. You also have to ensure that for the specified parent queue the
        auto dynamic child creation feature is enabled.
The following policies do not support the create
         flag:

reject
setDefaultQueue
defaultQueue





Fallback


If the target queue does not exist or it cannot be created, it
         defines a fallback action.
Values: Skip, PlaceDefault,
         Reject
