How to read the Configurations table
In the Queue Manager UI you can view all of your Dynamic Configurations on one page.
        Learning about this page can help you manage the Dynamic Queue Scheduling
        feature.

The schedule overview page is displayed in Cloudera Manager if you select the Queue
                Manager UI and then go to the Schedule tab. It displays a
                table with the following columns: Table 1. Schedule table
