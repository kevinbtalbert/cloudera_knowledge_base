Reordering placement rules
Placement rules are evaluated in the order in which they appear in the placement rule
    list. When a job is submitted, the rules are evaluated, and the first matching rule is used to
    determine the queue in which the job is run.
When a job is submitted, the rules are evaluated from top to bottom, and the first matching rule
        is used to determine the queue in which the job is run.
If a rule is always satisfied, subsequent rules are not evaluated. By default, placement
        rules are ordered in the order they were added; the  rule added first appears first. You can
        easily reorder rules.
