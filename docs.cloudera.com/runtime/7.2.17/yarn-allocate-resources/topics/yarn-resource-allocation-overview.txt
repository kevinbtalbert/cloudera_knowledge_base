Resource allocation overview
You can allocate resources to queues by using either the Absolute mode, in which the
    actual units of vCores and memory resources are allocated, the Relative mode, in which resources
    are allocated as a percentage of total resources, or in the Weight mode, in which resources are
    allocated as a fraction of total resources. 

Relative mode: In the YARN Queue Manager UI, the capacity value is
        shown as a percentage. When editing queue resources, capacities are specified in
        percentages. The capacity allocated to a set of sibling queues must equal 100% of the
        parent.


Absolute mode: In the YARN Queue Manager UI, the capacity value is
        shown in units. When editing queue resources, a separate tab is displayed for each resource
        type. The total allocated capacity must be less than or equal to the capacity of the
        parent.
Weight mode: In the YARN Queue Manager UI, the capacity value is
        shown as a numerical value and is suffixed with “w”. For example, 5w. When editing queue
        resources, capacities are specified in weights or fractions of total resources. The
        resources are divided based on how the queue's weight relates to the sum of configured
        weights under the parent.noteIf you have an existing managed queue in
          Relative mode, then conversion to Weight mode is not allowed. You must delete the managed
          parent queue and then convert from Relative mode to Weight mode.


noteYARN Queue Manager does not support mixed allocation of resources. That is, some queues
        allocated using percentages and some queues using weights.
