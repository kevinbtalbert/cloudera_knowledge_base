Setting Application-Master resource-limit for a specific queue
The Application Master (AM) resource limit can be used to set a maximum percentage of cluster resources allocated specifically to Application Masters. The default value is 10% and exists to avoid cross-application deadlocks where significant resources in the cluster are occupied entirely by the Containers running Application Masters. 
  

This property also indirectly controls the number of concurrent running applications in the cluster, with each queue limited to a number of running applications proportional to its capacity.
To set the maximum Application Masters resource limit (yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-am-resource-percent) for a specific queue:


In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters > YARN Queue Manager UI
          service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview tab. 

Click on the three vertical dots on the queue and select View/Edit Queue
            Properties option.

In the Queue Properties dialog-box, enter the limit in the
            Maximum AM Resource Limit text box. 

Click Save.
