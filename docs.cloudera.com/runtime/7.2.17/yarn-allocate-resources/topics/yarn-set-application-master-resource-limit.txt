Setting default Application Master resource limit
The Application Master (AM) resource limit that can be used to set a maximum percentage of cluster resources allocated specifically to Application Masters. This property has a default value of 10%, and exists to avoid cross-application deadlocks where significant resources in the cluster are occupied entirely by the Containers running ApplicationMasters. 
  

The Maximum AM Resource Limit (yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-am-resource-percent) property also indirectly controls the number of concurrent running applications in the cluster, with each queue limited to a number of running applications proportional to its capacity.


In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters > YARN Queue Manager UI
          service. A graphical queue hierarchy is displayed in the Overview tab. 

Click the Configuration tab.

Enter the maximum AM resource limit in the Maximum AM Resource Limit
          text box. 

Click Save.

For information about overriding this limit on a per-queue basis, see Configure Application Master
              resource limit for a specific queue.
