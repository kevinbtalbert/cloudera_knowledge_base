Use FPGA with distributed shell
Once FPGA support is enabled, an FPGA resource can be requested by specifying
   yarn.io/fpga as a resource.
The following is a distributed shell example:
yarn jar /path/to/hadoop-yarn-applications-distributedshell.jar 
-jar /path/to/hadoop-yarn-applications-distributedshell.jar 
-shell_command "date" 
-container_resources memory-mb=2048,vcores=1,yarn.io/fpga=1 
-num_containers 1

This command runs the date command on a node which has an FPGA card
      installed.
