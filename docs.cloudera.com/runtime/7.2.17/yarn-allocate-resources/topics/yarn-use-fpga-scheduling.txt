Use FPGA scheduling
You can use FPGA as a resource type.
A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is a card that contains a matrix of configurable
            logic blocks, mostly logic gates. FPGA can be reprogrammed, meaning that the
            interconnections among the gates and integrated devices can be re-wired. That is in
            contrast to a regular CPU, as the internal wiring and connections inside a CPU cannot be
            changed: only the software that runs on it can be changed, but the hardware is always
            the same. FPGA, on the other hand, allows changes on a circuit level.
An FPGA device does not contain only rewirable logic gates (like AND or OR gates), but
            also memory, DSP, chip, external connectors and more.
Programming FPGAs
FPGAs can be programmed in various ways. The most popular methods are VHDL and
                Verilog. 
Intel FPGA cards allow the users to upload so-called OpenCL kernels to perform
                certain computations simultaneously and therefore rapidly. OpenCL is a framework and
                a set of standards that is currently developed and maintained by the Khronos Group.
                For more information, see Khronos' OpenCL documentation.


Configure FPGA scheduling and isolationYou can enable and configure FPGA as a resource type using Cloudera         Manager.Use FPGA with distributed shellOnce FPGA support is enabled, an FPGA resource can be requested by specifying    yarn.io/fpga as a resource.Parent topic: Resource scheduling and management
