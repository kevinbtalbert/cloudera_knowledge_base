Using partitions when
      submitting a job
You can use various methods to specify partitions when submitting jobs.

Set partitions when Submitting Jobs


You can use the following methods to specify partitions when submitting
                     jobs:


ApplicationSubmissionContext.setNodeLabelExpression(<node_label_expression>)
                           - sets the partition expression for all containers of the
                           application.


ResourceRequest.setNodeLabelExpression(<node_label_expression>)
                           - sets the partition expression for individual resource requests. This
                           overrides the partitions expression set in
                              ApplicationSubmissionContext.setNodeLabelExpression(<node_label_expression>).


Specify
                              setAMContainerResourceRequest.setNodeLabelExpression
                           in ApplicationSubmissionContext to indicate the expected
                           partition for the ApplicationMaster container.


You can use one of these methods to specify a partition expression, and
                        -queue to specify a queue, when you submit YARN jobs using
                     the distributed shell client. If the queue has a label that satisfies the label
                     expression, it will run the job on the partition(s). If the label expression
                     does not reference a label associated with the specified queue, the job does
                     not run and an error is returned. If no partitionn is specified, the job runs
                     only on nodes without a partition, and on nodes with non-exclusive partitions
                     if idle resources are available.

note
You can only specify one partition in the
                              .setNodeLabelExpression methods.


For example, the following commands run a simple YARN distributed shell "sleep
                     for a long time" job. In this example you are asking for more containers than
                     the cluster can run so you can see which node the job runs on. We are
                     specifying that the job should run on queue "a1", which our user has permission
                     to run jobs on. We are also using the -node_label_expression
                     parameter to specify that the job will run on all nodes with label "x".
sudo su yarn
hadoop jar /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-applications-distributedshell.jar
 -shell_command "sleep 100" -jar /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-applications-distributedshell.jar
 -num_containers 30 -queue a1 -node_label_expression x 

If you run this job on the example cluster we configured previously, containers
                  are allocated on node-1, as this node has been assigned partition "x", and queue
                  "a1" also has partition "x":
The following commands run the same job that you specified for partition "x", but
                  this time you will specify queue "b1" rather than queue "a1".
sudo su yarn
hadoop jar /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-applications-distributedshell.jar
 -shell_command "sleep 100000" -jar /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-applications-distributedshell.jar
 -num_containers 30 -queue b1 -node_label_expression x
When you attempt to run this job on our example cluster, the job will fail with
                  the following error message because label "x" is not associated with queue
                  "b1".
14/11/24 13:42:21 INFO distributedshell.Client: Submitting application to ASM
14/11/24 13:42:21 FATAL distributedshell.Client: Error running Client
org.apache.hadoop.yarn.exceptions.InvalidResourceRequestException: Invalid resource request, queue=b1 doesn't 
have permission to access all labels in resource request. labelExpression of resource request=x. Queue labels=y


MapReduce Jobs and Partitions


Currently you cannot specify a partition when submitting a MapReduce job.
                     However, if you submit a MapReduce job to a queue that has a default partition
                     expression, the default partition is applied to the MapReduce job.
Using default partition expressions tends to constrain larger portions of the
                     cluster, which at some point starts to become counter-productive for jobs -
                     such as MapReduce jobs - that benefit from the advantages offered by
                     distributed parallel processing.
