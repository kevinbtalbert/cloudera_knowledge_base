Running YARN
        Services
You can use YARN
        Services API to manage YARN services. You can use the YARN CLI to view the logs for running
        applications. In addition, you can use YARN distributed cache to deploy multiple versions of
        Mapreduce.
Previously, deploying a new service on YARN was not a simple experience. The APIs of existing
            frameworks were either too low level (native YARN), required writing new code (for
            frameworks with programmatic APIs), or required writing a complex specification (for
            declarative frameworks). Apache Slider was developed to run services such as HBase,
            Storm, Accumulo, and Solr on YARN by exposing higher-level APIs that supported running
            these services on YARN without modification. 
The new YARN Services API greatly simplifies the deployment and management of YARN
            services.

Deploying and managing services on YARNUsing the YARN Services API, you can run simple and complex template-based apps on     containers.Launching a YARN serviceLaunching a service saves the service file to HDFS and starts the service. Saving a YARN service definitionYou can save a service YARN file initially without starting the service and later refer to this service YARN file while launching other services.Creating new YARN services using UIThe YARN Web User Interface enables you to define new services. You can either create     standard services by providing their details or custom services by using JSON files containing     the required definitions.Managing the YARN service life cycle through the REST APIYou can perform various operations to manage the life cycle of a YARN service through the REST API.YARN services API examplesYou can use the YARN Services API for situations such as creating a single-component     service and performing various operations on the service.
