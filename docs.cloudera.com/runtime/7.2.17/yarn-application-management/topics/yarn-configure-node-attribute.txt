Configuring node attribute for application master placement
Use the Node Attribute property to describe the attributes of a Node. The placement
    preference assigns nodes as worker nodes or compute nodes
    using the Node Attribute property. Application Master (AM) container is placed to run on
      worker nodes instead of compute nodes. The worker group is
    more stable because YARN ResourceManager and HDFS NameNode run in it. Also, the
      worker group nodes are less likely to be shut down due to autoscaling. 
 By default, a script runs to tag nodes as worker nodes or
          compute nodes using the node attribute mapping rule. AM containers are
        placed to run on worker nodes instead of compute nodes.
        You can disable the script to not make a placement preference for running AM containers. 

In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > YARN. 
Go to the Configuration tab. 
Search for nm yarn-site.xml. 
Set the below property using advanced configuration snippet (safety-valve).
          Name: yarn.nodemanager.node-attributes.provider 
Value: config
Click Save. 
Click Actions and select Restart to
          restart the service.

noteTo enable the node attribute placement preference again, follow the above steps and delete
        the yarn.nodemanager.node-attributes.provider and
          config configuration. Restart the YARN service after updating the
        configuration.
