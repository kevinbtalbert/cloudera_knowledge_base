Migrating database
      configuration to a new location
The operations performed on queues in Queue Manager UI are stored as Queue Manager
      versions. You can either store these versions in the default database location on the host or
      configure a new location using Cloudera Manager UI.

By default, Queue Manager stores the operations performed on queues as versions in the config-service.mv.db database file on the host. Alternatively, you can configure a new database file in a new location and migrate the version information to the new file. 
For security reasons, if you do not want to allow users to access the default database,
            you can move the database file to an alternative location. During an upgrade, you can
            move the database file to some other location and then restore this file to the default
            location after the upgrade.

(Optional) You can view the version information in the Queue Manager UI that needs
               to be migrated to a new location.noteThe following
                  steps explain how to change the database to a new location and copy the existing
                  Queue Manager version information to the new database file. If you want to backup
                  the currently used database file to another location and not migrate, perform only
                  Steps 7, 8, 9 to backup the file.

In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters >
               queuemanager .

Go to the Configuration tab.

Specify the new file location like in Location for config-service
                     DB. The config-service database location should be prefixed with
                     jdbc:h2:. For example:
                     jdbc:h2:~/testDb,jdbc:h2:/var/lib/dbdir/test, and
                     jdbc:h2:/var/lib/***username***/db/config-service. 

noteThe config-service database file name should not contain only special
                     characters and dot (.) characters. Even though the file name is allowed during
                     the creation of database from the UI, in the backend the
                        .mv.db file is not created. You must have the required
                     permissions to the specified new file location. 






Click Save Changes.


Click Actions and select Restart.
                
After you add the new database location in the Queue Manager service
                  configuration, there will be a similar .mv.db file and
                     .trace.db file in the new location.

SSH into the host machine running the YARN Queue Manager
               service.ssh [***your_username***]@[***queue_manager_host_ip_address***]
Navigate to the directory where the configuration database file is
               stored.cd /var/lib/hadoop-yarn/
Find the default location of the initial database
               file.find / -name  "config-service.mv.db" 
/var/lib/hadoop-yarn/config-service.mv.db
               The complete path to the .db file is displayed.
Replicate the permission at the directory level for the new database location and
               verify if the database directory level permissions are the same. 
Copy the contents of the old file .mv.db file to the new
                  .mv.db
               file.# cp config-service.mv.db new-location-config-service.mv.db 
Type y to overwrite the file.
In Cloudera Manager, click Clusters > queue
                  manager. Click Actions and select
                  Restart to restart the service.

You have now changed the location of the database file. All queue information is now available in the new file and can be viewed from the Queue Manager UI.
