Launching a YARN service
Launching a service saves the service file to HDFS and starts the service. 

Run the following command to launch the sleeper service example. This sleeper example is
        provided with YARN, so it can be referred to by the name ;sleeper; or the path
        to the JSON file can be specified:
yarn app -launch sleeper-service <sleeper OR /path/to/sleeper.json>
This command saves and starts the sleeper service with two instances of the sleeper
        component. The service could also be launched by making calls to the REST API instead of
        using the command line. The service can be stopped and destroyed as follows. The stop
        command stops the service from running, but leaves the service JSON file stored in HDFS so
        that the service could be started again using a start command. The destroy
        command stops the service if it is running and removes the service information entirely.
yarn app -stop sleeper-service
yarn app -destroy sleeper-service
