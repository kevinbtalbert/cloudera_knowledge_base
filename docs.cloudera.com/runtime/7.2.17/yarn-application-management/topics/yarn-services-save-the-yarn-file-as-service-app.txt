Saving a YARN service definition
You can save a service YARN file initially without starting the service and later refer to this service YARN file while launching other services.
Run the following command to save the simple-httpd-service YARN
      file:
        yarn app -save simple-httpd-service /path/to/simple-httpd-service.jsonSaving
        or launching the service from a YARN file stores a modified version of the YARN file in
        HDFS. This service specification can then be referenced by other services, allowing users to
        assemble more complex services.
