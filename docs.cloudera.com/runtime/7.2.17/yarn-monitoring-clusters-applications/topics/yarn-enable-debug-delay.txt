Configuring debug delay
You can keep the applicationâ€™s localized files and log directory on the local disk
        for a predefined time before the NodeManager deletes them.

This feature can be useful for example when there is a problem with the log
                aggregation feature or if you want to diagnose YARN application issues.


In Cloudera Manager, select the YARN service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Search for deletion delay.

Find the Localized Dir Deletion Delay property.

Define the delay time in seconds.
If you want to diagnose YARN application issues, set this property to a large
                    value, for example to 600 seconds, to permit examination of these
                    directories.

Click Save Changes.
