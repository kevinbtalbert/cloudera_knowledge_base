Log aggregation properties
You can configure YARN log aggregation for your cluster by specifying values of
    specific properties depending on your requirements.


Name
Property
Default value
Description



Enable Log Aggregation
yarn.log-aggregation-enable
Enabled

Specifies if log aggregation is enabled.
If log aggregation is disabled, YARN container logs are not
                aggregated.



Log Aggregation Retention Period
yarn.log-aggregation.retain-seconds
7 days

Specifies how long aggregation logs are kept before they are deleted.



Log Aggregation Status Timeout
yarn.log-aggregation-status.time-out.ms
10 minutes

Specifies the maximum amount of time that the NodeManager has for reporting a
                container's log aggregation status. If no log aggregation status is sent by the
                NodeManager within the allotted time, the ResourceManager reports a TIME_OUT log
                aggregation status for that container.



Supported Log Aggregation File Formats
yarn.log-aggregation.file-formats
IFile and TFile

Specifies which log file formats are supported. The first file format in the list
                is used to write the aggregated logs. TFile format is always added to the end of the
                list, to support backward compatibility.



Remote App Log Directory for TFile Format
yarn.log-aggregation.TFile.remote-app-log-dir
empty

Specifies the path of the directory where application logs are stored
                after an application is completed if TFile format is selected for writing. This
                configuration overwrites the one given in NodeManager level
                (yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir).
This property is not backward compatible. If you change its value later,
                the logs of applications that are already finished cannot be read. 



Remote App Log Directory Suffix for TFile Format
yarn.log-aggregation.TFile.remote-app-log-dir-suffix
empty

The remote log directory is created at
                {remote-app-log-dir}/${user}/{thisParam} if TFile format is selected for writing.
                This configuration overwrites the one given in NodeManager level
                (yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir-suffix).
This property is not backward compatible. If you change its value later,
                the logs of applications that are already finished cannot be read. 



Remote App Log Directory for IFile Format
yarn.log-aggregation.IFile.remote-app-log-dor
empty

Specifies the path of the directory where application logs are stored after an
                application is completed if IFile format is given as the file format for writing.
                This configuration overwrites the one given in NodeManager level
                (yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir).
This property is not backward compatible. If you change its value later,
                the logs of applications that are already finished cannot be read. 



Remote App Log Directory Suffix for IFile Format
yarn.log-aggregation.IFile.remote-app-log-dir-suffix
empty

The remote log directory is created at
                {remote-app-log-dir}/${user}/{thisParam} if IFile format is selected for writing.
                This configuration overwrites the one given in NodeManager level
                (yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir-suffix).
This property is not backward compatible. If you change its value later,
                the logs of applications that are already finished cannot be read.



Log Aggregation Compression Type
yarn.nodemanager.log-aggregation.compression-type
none

Specifies the TFile compression type used to compress aggregated logs. Its value
                can be: gz, lzo or none.



Remote App Log Directory
yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir
/tmp/logs

Specifies the path of the directory where application logs are stored
                after an application is completed.
This property is not backward compatible. If you change its value later,
                the logs of applications that are already finished cannot be read. 



Remote App Log Directory Suffix
yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir-suffix
logs

The remote log dir will be created at
                {yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir}/${user}/{thisParam}. 
This property is not backward compatible. If you change its value later,
                the logs of applications that are already finished cannot be read. 



Log Aggregation Policy
yarn.nodemanager.log-aggregation.policy.class
All

Specifies the types of container logs that are uploaded during the log aggregation.
                Valid values are: Only AM, AM or Failed, All, Only Failed, Failed or Killed, None,
                or Sample.
