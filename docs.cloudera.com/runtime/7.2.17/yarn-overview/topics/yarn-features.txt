YARN Features
YARN enables you to
      manage resources and schedule jobs in Hadoop. 
YARN provides the following
         features:



Multi-tenancy
You can use multiple open-source and proprietary data access engines for
                     batch, interactive, and real-time access to the same dataset. Multi-tenant data
                     processing improves an enterprise’s return on its Hadoop
                     investments.
Cluster utilization
You can dynamically allocate cluster resources to improve resource
                     utilization. 
Multiple resource types
You can use multiple resource types such as memory, CPU, and GPU.
Scalability
Significantly improved data center processing power. YARN’s
                     ResourceManager focuses exclusively on scheduling and keeps pace as clusters
                     expand to thousands of nodes managing petabytes of data.
Compatibility
MapReduce applications developed for Hadoop 1 runs on YARN without any
                     disruption to existing processes. YARN maintains API compatability with the
                     previous stable release of Hadoop.
