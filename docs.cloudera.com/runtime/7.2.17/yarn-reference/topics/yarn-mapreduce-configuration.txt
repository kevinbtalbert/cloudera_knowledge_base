Step 7: MapReduce configuration
You can increase the memory allocation for the ApplicationMaster, map tasks, and
      reduce tasks.
The
         minimum vcore allocation for any task is always 1. The Spill/Sort memory allocation of 400
         should be sufficient, and should be (rarely) increased if you determine that frequent
         spills to disk are hurting job performance. 
The
         common MapReduce parameters mapreduce.map.java.opts, mapreduce.reduce.java.opts, and yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts are configured for you automatically based
         on the Heap to Container Size
            Ratio.
