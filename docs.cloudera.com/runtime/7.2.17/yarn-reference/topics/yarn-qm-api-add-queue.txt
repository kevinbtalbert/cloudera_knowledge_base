Request Body
{
  "queuePath": "{queue-path}",
  "queueName": "{queue-name}",
  "capacity": "{queue-capacity}",
  "maximum-capacity": "{queue-maximum-capacity}",
  "siblingCapacities": [
    {
      "queuePath": "{sibling-queue-path}",
      "queueName": "{sibling-queue-name}",
      "capacity": "{sibling-queue-capacity}",
      "maximum-capacity": "{sibling-queue-maximum-capacity}",
    }
  ],
  "message": "Added {queue-name}"
}  

noteThe siblingCapacities parameter is required only if you are
               adding a sibling to an existing leaf queue. You must ensure that the total capacity
               of the sibling queues and the new queue must be equal to 100% of the parent queue in
               the Relative mode. The total allocated capacity of the sibling queues and the new
               queue must be less than or equal to the capacity of the parent in the Absolute mode.
               For information about resource allocation, see "change link" Resource allocation overview.
