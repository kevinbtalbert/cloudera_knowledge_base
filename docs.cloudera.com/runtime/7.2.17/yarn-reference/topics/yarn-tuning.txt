Tuning Apache Hadoop YARN

YARN tuning overviewAbstract description of a YARN cluster and the goals of YARN tuning.Step 1: Worker host configurationDefine the configuration for a single worker host computer in your clusterStep 2: Worker host planningAllocate resources on each worker machine,Step 3: Cluster sizeHaving defined the specifications for each host in your cluster, enter the number of       worker hosts needed to support your business case.Steps 4 and 5: Verify settingsVerify the memory and vcore settings.Step 6: Verify container settings on clusterYou can change the values that impact the size of your containers. Step 6A: Cluster container capacityValidate the minimum and maximum number of containers in your cluster, based on the       numbers you enteredStep 6B: Container parameters checkingSee whether you have over-allocated resources.Step 7: MapReduce configurationYou can increase the memory allocation for the ApplicationMaster, map tasks, and       reduce tasks.Step 7A: MapReduce settings checkingVerify at a glance that all of your minimum and maximum resource allocations are       within the parameters you set.Set properties in Cloudera ManagerWhen you are satisfied with the cluster configuration estimates, use the values in the       spreadsheet to set the corresponding properties in Cloudera ManagerConfigure memory settingsThe memory configuration for YARN and MapReduce memory is important to get the best   performance from your cluster.
