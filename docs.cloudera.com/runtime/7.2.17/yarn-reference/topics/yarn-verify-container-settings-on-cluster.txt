Step 6: Verify container settings on cluster
You can change the values that impact the size of your containers. 
The minimum number of vcores should be 1. When additional vcores are
          required, adding 1 at a time should result in the most efficient
          allocation. Set the maximum number of vcore reservations to the size
          of the node.
Set the minimum and maximum reservations for memory. The increment should be the smallest
          amount that can  impact performance. Here, the minimum is approximately 1 GB, the maximum
          is approximately 8 GB, and the increment is 512 MB.
