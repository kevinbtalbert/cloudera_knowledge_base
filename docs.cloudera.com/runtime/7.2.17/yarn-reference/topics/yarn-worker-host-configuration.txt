Step 1: Worker host configuration
Define the configuration for a single worker host computer in your cluster
Step 1 is to define the configuration for a single worker host
          computer in your cluster.
 
As with any system, the more memory and CPU resources available, the
          faster the cluster can process large amounts of data. A machine with 4
          CPUs with HyperThreading, each with 6 cores, provides 48 vcores per
          host.
3 TB hard drives in a 2-unit server installation with 12 available slots in JBOD (Just a
          Bunch Of Disks) configuration is a reasonable balance of performance and pricing at the
          time the spreadsheet was created. The cost of storage decreases over time, so you might
          consider 4 TB disks. Larger disks are expensive and not required for all use cases. 
Two 1-Gigabit Ethernet ports provide sufficient throughput at the time the spreadsheet
          was published, but 10-Gigabit Ethernet ports are an option where price is of less concern
          than speed.
