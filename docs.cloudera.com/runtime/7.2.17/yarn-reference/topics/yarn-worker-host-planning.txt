Step 2: Worker host planning
Allocate resources on each worker machine,

 

Start
         with at least 8 GB for your operating system, and 1 GB for Cloudera Manager. If services
         outside of Cloudera Runtime require additional resources, add those numbers under Other
         Services. 
The HDFS DataNode uses a minimum of 1 core and about 1 GB of memory. The same
          requirements apply to the YARN NodeManager.
The spreadsheet lists several optional services: 
Impala daemon requires at least 16 GB for the daemon.
HBase Region Servers requires 12-16 GB of memory. 
Solr server requires a minimum of 1 GB of memory.
Kudu Tablet server requires a minimum of 1 GB of memory.


Any remaining resources are available for YARN applications (Spark and MapReduce). In
          this example, 44 CPU cores are available. Set the multiplier for vcores you want on each
          physical core to calculate the total available vcores.
