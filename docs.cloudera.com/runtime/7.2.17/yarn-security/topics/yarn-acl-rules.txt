YARN ACL rules
Learn about the YARN ACL rules to which all YARN ACLs must adhere.
All YARN ACLs must adhere to the following rules:

Special Values:

The wildcard character (*) indicates that everyone has access.noteYou cannot use the wildcard (*) character along with a list of users
        and/or groups in the same ACL. If you use the wildcard character it must be the only item in the ACL.

A single space entry indicates that no one has access.


If there are no spaces in an ACL, then all entries (the listed users
     and/or groups) are considered authorized users.
Group names in YARN Resource Manager ACLs are case sensitive. So, if you
     specify an uppercase group name in the ACL, it will not match the group name resolved from the
     Active Directory because Active Directory group names are resolved in lowercase.
If an ACL starts with a single space, then it must consist of groups
     only.
All entries after the occurrence of a second single space in an ACL are
     ignored.
There are no ACLs that deny access to a user or group. However, if you
     wish to block access to an operation entirely, enter a value for a non-existent user or group
     (for example,'NOUSERS NOGROUPS'), or simply
     enter a single space. By doing so, you ensure that no user or group maps to a particular
     operation by default.
If you wish to deny only a certain set of users and/or groups, specify
     every single user and/or group that requires access. Users and/or groups that are not included
     are "implicitly" denied access.
