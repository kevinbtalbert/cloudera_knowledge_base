YARN ACL syntax
Example of YARN ACL syntax.

noteIn all cases where a single space is required, you will see:
               <single space>.

Users onlyuser1,user2,userN
Use a comma-separated list of user names. Do not place spaces
                  after the commas separating the users in the list.

Groups only<single space>HR,marketing,support
You must begin group-only
                  ACLs with a single space. Group-only ACLs use the same syntax as users, except
                  each entry is a group name rather than user name.

Users and Groupsfred,alice,haley<single space>datascience,marketing,support
A comma-separated list of user names, followed by a single
                  space, followed by a comma-separated list of group names. This sample ACL
                  authorizes access to users “fred”, “alice”, and “haley”, and to those users in the
                  groups “datascience”, “marketing”, and “support”.




Examples

The following ACL entry authorizes access only to the members of
            “my_group”:<single space>my_group

The following ACL entry authorizes access to
            anyone:*

The following ACL authorizes access to the users “john”, “jane”,
            and the group
            “HR”:john,jane<single space>HR

In this example, six groups (“group_1” through “group_6”) are
            defined in the system. The following ACL authorizes access to a
            subset of the defined groups, allowing access to all members of
            groups 1 through 5 (and implicitly denies access to members of the
            group
            “group_6”):<single space>group_1,group_2,group_3,group_4,group_5
