Admin ACLs
Use the YARN Admin ACLs to allow users to run YARN administrator sub-commands, which
      are executed via the yarn rmadmin <command>.

importantThe YARN Admin ACL is triggered and applied
                only when you run YARN sub-commands via yarn
                rmadmin <cmd>. If you run other YARN commands via
              the YARN command line (for example, starting the Resource or Node
              Manager), it does not trigger the YARN Admin ACL check or provide
              the same level of security.

The default YARN Admin ACL is set to the wildcard character (*),
            meaning all users and groups have YARN Administrator access and
            privileges. So after YARN ACL enforcement is enabled, (via the
              yarn.acl.enable property) every user has YARN ACL
            Administrator access. Unless you wish for all users to have YARN
            Admin ACL access, edit the yarn.admin.acl setting
            upon initial YARN configuration, and before enabling YARN ACLs.
A typical YARN Admin ACL looks like the following, where the
            system's Hadoop administrator and multiple groups are granted
            access:hadoopadmin<space>yarnadmgroup,hadoopadmgroup
