Managing Access Control Lists
An Access Control List (ACL) is a list of specific permissions or controls that allow
  individual users or groups to perform specific actions upon specific objects, as well as defining
  what operations are allowed on a given object.
YARN ACLs do not deny access; rather, they identify a user, list of users, group, or list of
   groups who can access a particular object.
Like HDFS ACLs, YARN ACLs provide a way to set different permissions for specific named users
   or named groups. ACLs enhance the traditional permissions model by defining access control for
   arbitrary combinations of users and groups instead of a single owner/user or a single group.
