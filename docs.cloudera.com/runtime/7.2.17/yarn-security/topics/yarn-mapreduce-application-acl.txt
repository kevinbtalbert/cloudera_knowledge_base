MapReduce Job ACLsCloudera Docs
MapReduce Job ACLs
Create and use the following MapReduce Application ACLs to view YARN logs.



mapreduce.job.acl-view-job
Provides read access to the MapReduce history and the YARN logs.

mapreduce.job.acl-modify-job
Provides the same access as mapreduce.job.acl-view-job, and also allows the user to modify a running job.noteJob modification is currently limited to killing the job. No other YARN
       system modifications are supported. 


During a search or other activities, you may come across the following two
   legacy settings from MapReduce; they are not supported by YARN. Do not use them:

mapreduce.cluster.acls.enabled


mapreduce.cluster.administrators


Stopping an application
The Application ACL mapreduce.job.acl-modify-job determines whether or not a
    user can modify a job, but in the context of YARN, this only allows the user to stop an
    application.
The Application ACL mapreduce.job.acl-modify-job determines whether or not a user can modify a job, but
    in the context of YARN, this only allows the user to stop an application. The kill action is
    application agnostic and part of the YARN framework. Other application types, like MapReduce or
    Spark, implement their own kill action independent of the YARN framework. MapReduce provides the
    kill actions via the mapred command.
For YARN, the following three groups of users are allowed to stop a
    running application:
The application owner
A cluster administrator defined in yarn.admin.acl

A queue administrator defined in aclAdministerApps for the queue in which the
      application is running

Note that for the queue administrators, ACL inheritance applies, as
     described earlier.
