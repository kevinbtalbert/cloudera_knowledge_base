Queue ACLs
  Use Queue ACLs to control access rights to users and administrators to the Capacity
    Scheduler queues. Application submission can really only happen at the leaf queue level, but an
    ACL restriction set on a parent queue will be applied to all of its descendant
    queues.
In the Capacity Scheduler, ACLs are configured by granting queue access to a
      list of users and groups with the Submit Application ACL parameter. Use Queue
        Administer ACL control the administration of queues at various levels. Queue
      administrators can submit applications to the queue, stop applications in the queue, and
      obtain information about any application in the queue.
