YARN Ranger authorization support
The YARN Ranger authorization support feature enables each Data Hub clusterâ€™s YARN
  cluster to have a dedicated Ranger YARN repository. As a result admins can set different YARN
  policies for different Data Hub clusters.
The YARN Ranger authorization support feature enables admins to create separate YARN queues for
   users sharing the same cluster and to control who can submit jobs to each queue, and who can see
   or kill jobs within the queue. In addition, users without admin privileges can only see their own
   jobs in a given queue.
This feature is enabled by default in a new Data Hub cluster installation. Cloudera Manager
   automatically creates a Ranger YARN repository for each cluster. 
The YARN Ranger authozitation support is not enabled by default after migrating to CDP Public
   Cloud 7.2.10 or higher. That means no YARN Ranger repository is created after migration, and the
    cm_yarn repository is used until the cluster is deleted and a new DataHub
   cluster with Cloudera Manager 7.4.2 or higher is created.
Alternatively, you can enable this feature manually using Cloudera Manager.
