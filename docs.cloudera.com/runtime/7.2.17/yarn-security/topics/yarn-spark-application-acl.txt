Spark Job ACLs
Spark ACLs using a separate property for users and groups.
Both user and group lists use a comma-separated list of entries. The
      wildcard character “*” allows access to
      anyone, and the single space “ “ allows access to no one. Enable Spark ACLs using the property
        spark.acls.enable, which is set to false by default (not enabled) and must be changed
      to true to enforce ACLs at the Spark
      level.
Create and use the following Application ACLs for the Spark application:
Set spark.acls.enable
     to true (default is false).
Set spark.admin.acls
     and spark.admin.acls.groups for administrative
     access to all Spark applications.
Set spark.ui.view.acls
     and spark.ui.view.acls.groups for view access
     to the specific Spark application.
Set spark.modify.acls
     and spark.modify.acls.groups for
     administrative access to the specific Spark application.
