Application logs' ACLs
The MapReduce Application ACL mapreduce.job.acl-view-job determines
  whether or not you can view an application log.
Aaccess is evaluated through the following ACLs:
YARN Admin and Queue ACLs
Application ACLs


After an application is in the “finished” state, logs are aggregated,
   depending on your cluster setup. You can access the aggregated logs via the MapReduce History
   server web interface. Aggregated logs are stored on shared cluster storage, which in most cases
   is HDFS. You can also share log aggregation via storage options like S3 or Azure by modifying the
    yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir setting in
   Cloudera Manager to point to either S3 or Azure, which should already be configured.
The shared storage on which the logs are aggregated helps to prevent access
   to the log files via file level permissions. Permissions on the log files are also set at the
   file system level, and are enforced by the file system: the file system can block any user from
   accessing the file, which means that the user cannot open/read the file to check the ACLs that
   are contained within.
In the cluster storage use case of HDFS, you can only access logs that are
   aggregated via the:
Application owner
Group defined for the MapReduce History server


When an application runs, generates logs, and then places the logs into
   HDFS, a path/structure is generated (for example: /tmp/logs/john/logs/application_1536220066338_0001). So access for the application
   owner "john" might be set to 700, which means
    read, write, execute; no one else can view
   files underneath this directory. If you don’t have HDFS access, you will be denied access.
   Command line users identified in mapreduce.job.acl-view-job are also denied access at the file level. In such a use
   case, the Application ACLs stored inside the aggregated logs will never be evaluated because the
   Application ACLs do not have file access.
For clusters that do not have log aggregation, logs for running applications
   are kept on the node where the container runs. You can access these logs via the Resource Manager
   and Node Manager web interface, which performs the ACL checks.
