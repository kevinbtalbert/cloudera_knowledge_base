Searching applications
The Applications page displays the list of YARN applications in
    a tabular form. You can apply search filters on this list to show only those applications that
    match the search criteria. 
You can specify the search criteria either as regular
      expressions or SQL statements.

On the Applications page, select either
            Regex or SQL from the drop-down list
          depending on the type of search you want to perform.

In the Search box, specify the search criteria.

                  UI shows only those applications that mention the Elapsed

                  search criterion.
