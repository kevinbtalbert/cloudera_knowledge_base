ZooKeeper ACLs Best Practices: Atlas
You must follow the best practices for tightening the ZooKeeper ACLs or permissions for Atlas when provisioning a secure cluster.


ZooKeeper Usage:

/apache_atlas - Root zookeeper node which is configured for
                curator, under which nodes for leader election are created.


/apache_atlas/active_server_info - Znode used in HA environments
                for storing active server information.


/apache_atlas/setup_in_progress - Transient Znode used to ensure
                some setup steps are executed only from one instance. This gets deleted after use
                and should normally not be seen.


/leader_elector_path and /setup_lock - Transient
                Znodes.

/apache_atlas is the root node which is configuration driven. The
              default value is /apache_atlas but can be overwritten by setting the
              value for this property atlas.server.ha.zookeeper.zkroot

Default ACLs:

All znodes have world:anyone:cdrwa by default.


Security Best Practice ACLs/Permissions and Required Steps:

No user intervention is required for creating/using the Znodes. They are all managed
                internally by Atlas. Atlas exposes two configuration properties that define the auth
                and ACL - to use while creating these Znodes. 
Cloudera Manager should configure these correctly for a secure cluster. The
                recommended configuration is
                    atlas.server.ha.zookeeper.auth=sasl:atlas@<domain.com>
andatlas.server.ha.zookeeper.acl=sasl:atlas@<domain.com>,
                where <domain.com> should be replaced with the right value of the Atlas service
                user principal. (Assuming atlas is the service user name). When set this way, the
                ACLs for all Znodes will be
                    atlas.server.ha.zookeeper.acl=sasl:atlas@<domain.com>:cdrwa. 
noteConfiguring permissions from Cloudera Manager is not
                  allowed..
