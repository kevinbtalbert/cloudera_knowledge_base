ZooKeeper ACLs Best Practices

As more and more components begin to rely on ZooKeeper within a Hadoop cluster, there are
   various permissions that need to be maintained to ensure the integrity and security of the
   znodes. These permissions are different from component to component. You must follow the required
   steps for tightening the ZooKeeper ACLs or permissions when provisioning a secure cluster as a
   best practices guideline.
Some components only use ZooKeeper when they are running in their component specific HA mode.
   Others have separate secure and unsecure ACLs defined and switch between which to enforce based
   on the component knowledge of whether the cluster is secured or not.
In general, ACLs are pretty open and assume an unsecure cluster by default. These permissions
   need to be hardened for secure clusters in order to avoid inappropriate access or modification of
   this critical platform state.
