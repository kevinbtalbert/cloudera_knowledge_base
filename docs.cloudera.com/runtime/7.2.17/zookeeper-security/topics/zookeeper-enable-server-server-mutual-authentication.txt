Enable server-server mutual authentication
You can enable mutual authentication between multiple ZooKeeper Servers.

Support for mutual authentication between ZooKeeper Servers can be
                enabled through the Cloudera Manager Admin Console. For secured
                networks, server-to-server authentication is considered an optional
                security enhancement, so the capability is disabled by default:
Server-to-server SASL authentication requires all servers in the ZooKeeper ensemble
                to authenticate using Kerberos.


In Cloudera Manager, select the ZooKeeper service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Search for sasl.

Find the Enable Server to Server SASL Authentication and
                    select it.

Click Save Changes.

Click the Actions button.

Select Restart.
