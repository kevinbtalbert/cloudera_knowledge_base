Use Digest Authentication Provider in ZooKeeper
Cloudera recommends to override the default SHA1 algorithm and use a more secure one
  when using the Digest Authentication Provider in ZooKeeper.

When using the Digest Authentication Provider in ZooKeeper, for example for specifying
    SuperUser, it is recommended to override the default SHA1 algorithm and use a more secure one,
    such as SHA3-384 or SHA3-512. This is mandatory for FIPS compliant clusters.


In Cloudera Manager, select the ZooKeeper service.

Click the Configuration tab.

Find the Java Configuration Options for ZooKeeper Server.

Add the following configuration:

-Dzookeeper.DigestAuthenticationProvider.digestAlg=[***ALGORITHM***]
For example:
      -Dzookeeper.DigestAuthenticationProvider.digestAlg=SHA3-512
