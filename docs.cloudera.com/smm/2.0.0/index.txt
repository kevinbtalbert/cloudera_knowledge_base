Streams Messaging Manager is an operations monitoring/ management tool
that provides end-to-end visibility in an enterprise Apache Kafka
environment.
With SMM, you can gain clear insights about your Kafka clusters. You can
understand the end-to-end flow of message streams from producers to
topics to consumers. SMM helps you troubleshoot your Kafka environment
to identify bottlenecks, throughputs, consumer patterns, and traffic
flow. SMM enables you to analyze the stream dynamics between producers
and consumers using various filters. You can optimize your Kafka
environment based on the key performance insights gathered from various
brokers and topics. With the tight integration of Apache Atlas, you can
gain complete data lineage across multiple Kafka hops, producers, and
consumers with powerful data flow visualization.
