Add the SMM REST Server as a Service
Once you have installed the SMM management pack and updated the Base URL in Ambari,
        you are ready to add the SMM Rest Server as a service in your Ambari-managed HDF or HDP
        cluster. 

From the Ambari UI, launch the Add Service Wizard.

In Step 1, Choose Services, select Streams Messaging
                    Manager.

In Step 2, Assign Masters, add the host on which you
                    want to install the SMM REST Server.

In Step 4, Customize Services, select the Streams
                    Messaging Manager tab and add the configuration information for the SMM REST
                    Server.

Click through the rest of the Add Service Wizard and
                    click OK.

You can verify the SMM installation by launching the
                following:
http://{your hostname}:8585/swagger
http://{your hostname}:8585/api/v1/admin/brokers
In both cases the default user name is admin and the default
                password is Horton!#works.
