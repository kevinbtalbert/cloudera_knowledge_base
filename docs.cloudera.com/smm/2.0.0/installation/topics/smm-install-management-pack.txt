Install the SMM management pack
A management pack (mpack) bundles service definitions, stack definitions, and stack
        add-on service definitions so they do not need to be included with the Ambari core
        functionality and can be updated in between major releases.
You have obtained the management pack and public repository
            locations from the Hortonworks . Customer Portal following the instructions provided as
            part of the subscription fulfillment process.

Back up your Ambari resources folder:

cp -r /var/lib/ambari-server/resources /var/lib/ambari-server/resources.backup


Copy the bundle to /tmp on the node where you installed
                    Ambari. 

Install the SMM management pack.

ambari-server install-mpack 
--mpack=tmp/smm-ambari-mpack-2.0.0.0-<version>.tar.gz 
--verbose


Restart the Ambari Server:

ambari-server restart

                    Versions Section on Ambari, click Versions -> Manage Versions, Click HDP or HDF
                    version link. Update SMM link with its public repo link.
