Install the SMM REST admin server



Configure your SMM databaseInstall the SMM management packA management pack (mpack) bundles service definitions, stack definitions, and stack         add-on service definitions so they do not need to be included with the Ambari core         functionality and can be updated in between major releases.Update the SMM Base URLAdding the base URL tells Ambari where to look for the SMM repository. The base URL         will be included in the customer support portal, where you get the repository. This step is         necessary because you are using an existing Ambari instance that is already managing an HDP         or HDF cluster. Add the SMM REST Server as a ServiceOnce you have installed the SMM management pack and updated the Base URL in Ambari,         you are ready to add the SMM Rest Server as a service in your Ambari-managed HDF or HDP         cluster.
