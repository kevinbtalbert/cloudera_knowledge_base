SMM installation artifacts
Prior to starting installation, you must download the Streams Messaging Manager (SMM)
        software artifacts from the Cloudera Archive. Access instructions are provided as part of
        the subscription fulfillment process.

Make sure that you have an active subscription agreement and have your license key
                file ready along with the required authentication credentials (username and
                password).


If you only have your license key, you need to obtain authentication
                    credentials (username and password) by using the Generate
                        Credentials function on the CDP Private Cloud Base download
                        page.

Skip this step if you have your username and password ready.


Go to the SMM download locations page and identify the download
                    artifacts for your target system.

Use your authentication credentials to download the artifacts.
