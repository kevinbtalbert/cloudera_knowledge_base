Upload your TLS public key
If the SMM REST endpoint on your HDF or HDP cluster is TLS enabled, you must  upload
        the TLS public key to DPS.

From the command line, enter:

openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <cluster-name:cluster-port>


Copy the certificate, including the begin and end lines, and save to a file
                    named SMM.pem.

From the DataPlane left navigation pane,  click
                    Settings.

Click Upload to upload your SMM.pem
                    file
