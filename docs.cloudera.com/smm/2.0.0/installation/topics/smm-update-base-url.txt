Update the SMM Base URL
Adding the base URL tells Ambari where to look for the SMM repository. The base URL
        will be included in the customer support portal, where you get the repository. This step is
        necessary because you are using an existing Ambari instance that is already managing an HDP
        or HDF cluster. 
Update the base URL with the base URL you created for the
            SMM REST Server (Cluster Agent) management pack when you created the local repo. For example:
http://webserver.com/SMM/centos7/2.0.0.0-x/


From the Ambari menu, click the admin drop-down on the
                    top right of your Ambari Dashboard. Then select Manage
                        Ambari.

From the Clusters view on the left,
                        clickVersions. Then select the HDP
                        versions or HDF versions link, depending
                    on your cluster. 

Add the SMM Base URL appropriate for your operating system.

Click Save.
