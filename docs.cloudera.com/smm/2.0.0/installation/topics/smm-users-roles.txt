Assign users the Kafka DevOps role
Users must be assigned the Kafka DevOps role before they can
        access SMM from the DP Platform UI.

From the DataPlane left navigation pane, go to
                    Users.

Identify the user to which you want to give SMM access, and select
                        Edit from the Actions icon on
                    the right-hand side.

Add Kafka DevOps to the roles for the user and click
                        Save.

That use is now able to access SMM from the DataPlane
            UI.
