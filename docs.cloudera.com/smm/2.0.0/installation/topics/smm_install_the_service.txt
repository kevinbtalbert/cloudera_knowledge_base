         SMM Application
To install the Streams Messaging Manager application, you log into the DP Platform
      host, install your SMM application RPMs, and then load your Docker image and initialize your
      environment.
You have successfully installed DP Platform and DP Platform is
         running.

Log in as root to the host on which you set up the DP Platform repositories. 

sudo su


Install the RPMs for your service application. 

yum install smm-app

A folder is created that contains the Docker image tarball files and a
               configuration script.
             If the yum command fails, then the local
               repository was not set up correctly. Check the repository file /etc/yum.repos.d/smm-app.repo on the
               host.
         
Navigate to the directory containing the installation scripts for the service, for
               example: 
cd
/usr/smm-app/current/streams-messaging-manager/bin


Load the Docker images and initialize the environment. 

./smmdeploy.sh init

Loading the images might take a while. note
If you run into errors while deploying, you must destroy the deployment using
                        ./smmdeploy.sh destroy command and re-install
                     the app. To check the logs of the container, you can use the command ./smmdeploy.sh logs. 



Verify that the container you installed is running. 
./smmdeploy.sh ps
