Set Up a Local
      Repository
Setting up a local repository involves moving the tarball to the selected mirror
      server and extracting the tarball to create the repository. You can use the same local
      repository for DP Platform, the SMM application, and the SMM REST Server, or you can create
      unique local repositories for each.
Ensure that you have downloaded the required tarballs from the
         customer portal, following the instructions provided as part of the product procurement
         process.

Copy the SMM Application and SMM REST Server (Cluster Agent) tarballs to the web
               server directory and expand (uncompress) the archive file:


Navigate to the web server directory you previously created. 
cd /var/www/html/
All content in this directory is served by the web server.


Move the tarballs to the current directory and expand each of the repository
                     tarballs that you downloaded.
Replace <file-name> with the actual name of the RPM
                     tarball that you are expanding.
tar zxvf <file-name>.tar.gz
During expansion of the tarball, subdirectories are created in
                        /var/www/html/, such as DSS/centos7SMM/centos7. These
                     directories contain the repositories.Expanding the app tarball takes several
                        seconds.



Confirm that you can browse to the newly created local repositories by using the
               base URLs:
http://<webserver-host-name>/<repo-name>/<OS>/<service-version-X>



<webserver-host-name>This is the FQDN of the web server host.
<repo-name>This is composed of the abbreviated name of the
                        repository.For the SMM, the repository name is
                        SMM-APP.
<OS>This is the operating system version.
<service-version-X>This is the version number of the downloaded
                        repository with an appended unique number.


Base URL Examples
 Base URL:
               http://webserver.com:port/DSS/centos7/1.1.0.0-X
 Base URL for the SMM Application:
          http://webserver.com:port/SMM-APP/centos7/2.0.0.0-x
 Base URL for the SMM REST Server (Cluster Agent):
           http://webserver.com/SMM/centos7/2.0.0.0-x/

Be sure to record these Base URLs, because you
                  need them when installing the application on the host, and installing the
                  associated agent on the clusters.
Be sure to record these Base URLs, because you need them when
                  installing the application on the host.


If you have multiple repositories configured in your environment, deploy the
               following plugin on all the nodes in your cluster.

yum install yum-plugin-priorities


Edit the /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/priorities.conf file to add the
               following values:

[main]
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0



The repositories  are now prepared for installation.


Create the configuration file for the  repository.
