Deleting a Notifier
You can use SMM to delete a notifier that you create in your environment. You can
        delete a notifier only if the notifier is not mapped to an alert policy.

Perform the following steps to delete a notifier:


From the left navigation pane, select Alerts.
The Alerts Overview page appears.

Click NOTIFIERS.

Find the notifier you want to delete from the list of available notifiers, and
                    click the delete icon beside the notifier.

Click Yes.
