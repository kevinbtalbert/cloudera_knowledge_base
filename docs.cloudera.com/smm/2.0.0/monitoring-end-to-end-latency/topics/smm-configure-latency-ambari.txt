Description


Enable Latency Metrics Processing


By default, the latency metrics processing is enabled. You can
                                    turn it off by selecting the check-box.



latencyMetricsConfig.metrics.15m.ttl.secs


By default, the 15 minutes granularity metrics are stored for 2
                                    weeks (12096000 secs). You can modify the value. Longer the
                                    duration, greater will be the storage requirements.



latencyMetricsConfig.metrics.clean.frequency.ms


The older metrics stored are purged in regular intervals. The
                                    purging frequency is defined by this interval in milliseconds.
                                    By default, the cleanup happens every 6 hours.



latencyMetricsConfig.metrics.storage


All metrics are stored in the local disk of SMM provided in this
                                    option.
