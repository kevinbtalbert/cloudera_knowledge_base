Configuring SRM Properties in SMM
You need to configure SRM properties to implement cross-cluster Kafka topic
        replication in SMM.

Go to Streams Messaging Manager Service in the Ambari
                    UI.

Go to CONFIGS tab, and click
                        ADVANCED.

Configure MirrorMaker in SMM and add relevant SRM host, port, protocol about
                    where SRM is installed.


Go to Advanced
                                streams-messaging-manager-srm-config.


Check the Configure Mirror Maker(SRM) service
                            option.


Confirm that mirrorMakerServiceConfig.host is
                            the host where Mirror Maker is running.


Confirm that mirrorMakerServiceConfig.port is
                            the port on which Mirror Maker is running.


Verify that mirrorMakerSeriveConfig.protocol is
                            the protocol used by Mirror Maker. For example, http or https. 



If SRM is SSL enabled, changeÂ the value of the mirrorMakerSeriveConfig.protocol
                    property to https and perform the following steps:


Go to Custom
                                streams-messaging-manager-srm-config.


Click Add Property.
The Add Property dialog appears.


You need to add relevant properties from the following list:



Protocol
hostnameVerifierClass
keyStoreType
keyStorePath
keyStorePassword
keyPassword
keyStoreProvider
keyManagerFactoryProvider
keyManagerFactoryAlgorithm
trustStoreType
trustStorePath
trustStorePassword
trustStoreProvider
trustManagerFactoryProvider
trustManagerFactoryAlgorithm



For example, add the properties in the following
                            fashion:Key=streamsReplicationManagerConfig-protocol, Value=TLV5
Key=streamsReplicationManagerConfig-hostnameVerifierClass, Value=some.class
Key=streamsReplicationManagerConfig-keyStorePath, Value=/etc/security/keystore/keystore.jks



Similarly, enable jersey client properties in Custom
                        streams-messaging-manager-srm-config as shown in the following
                    example:

Key=mirrorMakerServiceConfig-jersey.config.client.connectTimeout, Value=3000


Restart SMM.
