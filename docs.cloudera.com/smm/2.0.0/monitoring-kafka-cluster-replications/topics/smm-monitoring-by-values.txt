Monitoring Throughput and Latency by Values
You can fetch the average, maximum, and minimum values for throughput, replication
  latency, and checkpoint latency.
You can do this at the following levels:
Cluster Replication Level. Click the AVG, MAX, or MIN buttons, as shown in the following
          image, to fetch average, maximum, or minimum values of throughput, replication latency,
          and checkpoint latency for cluster replications.
Topic Level. Click the AVG, MAX, or MIN buttons, as shown in the following image, to fetch
          average, maximum, or minimum values of throughput, replication latency, and checkpoint
          latency for topics.
