Streams Messaging Manager
2.0.0 has the following known issues at this time.
SMM does not trigger alert immediately when SRM goes down
Problem: If the SRM cluster goes down, SMM might take 15 minutes to send the alert
    through email or display the alert on the UI.

First set of produced messages are not counted in total messages displayed in SMM
Problem: You might notice minor discrepancy in the BytesIn,
     BytesOut, and MessagesIn timeline metrics for the newly
    created topics and in the outMessagesCount timeline metric for the producers
    when the time period is selected all the way up to topic initialisation or usage time. The
    discrepancy in the metrics could utmost be off by the first minuteâ€™s measurement.
The discrepancy happens due to the lazy initialisation of metrics in the Kafka brokers and by
    default the metric reporter is configured to report the metrics once in a minute to the external
    systems post topic initialisation or usage.
Workaround: The graphs in the topic and producer profile page, however, reflect the
    true state of the metrics the way they are recorded.

Deployment of the activation.jar for airgapped SMM environments
Problem: SMM downloads and installs the activation-1.1.1.jar as part of the startup process. This
    requires the host to be connected to the internet to be able to download the jar from the
    central repository. If the host is not connected to the internet, you get an error.
Workaround: In case the host is not connected to the Internet, the activation-1.1.1.jar needs to be downloaded manually by
    the administrator and copied to the following application lib folder:
     /usr/smm/current/streams-messaging-manager/libs.
