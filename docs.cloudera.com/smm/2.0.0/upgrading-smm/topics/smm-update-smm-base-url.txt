Update the SMM REST Server Base URL
Adding the base URL tells Ambari where to look for the SMM repository. The base URL
        will be included in the customer support portal, where you get the repository. This step is
        necessary because you are using an existing Ambari instance that is already managing an HDP
        or HDF cluster.

Update the SMM Base URL.

From Ambari, go to Manage Versions and update the
                        current HDF or HDP version. Click the current HDF or HDP version, and find
                        the SMM-2.0 section and update SMM base URL. 


Verify that /etc/yum.repos.d/ambari-hdp-1.repo or
                        ambari-hdf-1.repo has the updated SMM base URL. If it does
                    not, manually edit this file to set the correct base URL.
For example: 
baseurl=http://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.hortonworks.com/SMM/centos7/2.x/BUILDS/2.0.0.0-x
