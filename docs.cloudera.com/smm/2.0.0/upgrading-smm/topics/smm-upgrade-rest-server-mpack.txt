Upgrade the SMM REST Server Management Pack
A management pack (mpack) bundles service definitions, stack definitions, and stack
        add-on service definitions so they do not need to be included with the Ambari core
        functionality and can be updated in between major releases. To upgrade the SMM REST Server
        mpack, stop Ambari Services, run the upgrade-mpack command, and restart the
        Ambari Server. 

From Ambari Services section, choose Streams Messaging
                    Manager. Go to Actions and Stop,
                    to stop the SMM service.

Upgrade the SMM REST Server mpack:

ambari-server upgrade-mpack --mpack=/path/to/smm-ambari-mpack-<version>-<build>.tar.gz --verbose
Where:

Version – is the version of the SMM REST Server mpack to which you are
                            upgrading.
Build – is the build number of the SMM REST Server mpack to which you
                            are upgrading. 

Both the version and the build number are available in the Hortonworks
                        Customer Portal, which you can access following the instructions provided to
                        you as part of the subscription fulfillment process. 


Restart Ambari Server:

ambari-server restart
