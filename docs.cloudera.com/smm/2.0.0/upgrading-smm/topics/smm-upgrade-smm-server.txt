Upgrading the SMM REST Server
To upgrade the SMM REST Server, you must verify your existing installation, install
        the version to which you want to upgrade, and then verify the new installation. 

 Confirm the current SMM component and version. For example:  

yum list installed | grep streams-messaging-manager
 streams-messaging-manager_2_0_0_0_xx.noarch


 Display the current version associated with each component. For example: 

smm-select status | grep streams-messaging-manager
 streams-messaging-manager - 2.0.0.0-xx


 Install binaries for the SMM services to which you want to upgrade. 

yum install -y streams-messaging-manager_<build>_<version>


 Ensure that no SMM processes are present on your cluster node:  

ps aux | grep streams-messaging-manager


 Use smm-select to ensure that you have created the
                    appropriate links to the new SMM installation: 

smm-select set streams-messaging-manager 2.0.0.0-x


 Confirm that smm-select displays the new SMM service
                    versions. For example: 

smm-select status | grep streams-messaging-manager
 streams-messaging-manager - 2.0.0.0-x
