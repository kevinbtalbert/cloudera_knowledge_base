Bidirectional Replication of Active Clusters
Configuration example for two active Kafka clusters setup with bidirectional
    replication.

A typical scenario involves two active Kafka clusters within the same region but in
        separate availability zones. Clients can connect to either cluster in case one is
        temporarily unavailable. This example demonstrates the steps required to set up a deployment
        with two clusters configured with bidirectional replication. Additionally, it also provides
        example commands to start replication between clusters.

          Clusters




Install the following configuration file on every broker.

# two clusters: primary and secondary
clusters = primary, secondary
primary.bootstrap.servers = primary_host1:9092, primary_host2:9092, primary_host3:9092
secondary.bootstrap.servers = secondary_host1:9092, secondary_host2:9092, secondary_host3:9092

# bidirectional replication between primary and secondary
primary->secondary.enabled = true
secondary->primary.enabled = true



Run the srm-driver with the
            --clusters option on every Kafka broker host.Running the
            srm-driver with the --clusters option allows you to
          specify which clusters each instance of the driver should write to. In this example, both
          instances of the driver are set up to read data from all clusters but only write to the
          cluster they are running on. This allows you to distribute replication workloads. 

On primary
              hosts:srm-driver --clusters primary

On
              secondaryhosts:srm-driver --clusters secondary


Optional: If you want to monitor replication, run
            srm-service on one host per cluster. Each instance of the service
          should target the cluster its running on.
# on a single primary host
srm-service --target primary

# on single secondary host
srm-service --target secondary

Replicate data between clusters with the following commands:
srm-control topics --source primary --target secondary --add ".*"

srm-control topics --source secondary --target primary --add ".*"
