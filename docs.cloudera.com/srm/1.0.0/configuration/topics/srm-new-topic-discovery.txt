New Topic and Consumer Group Discovery
Understand how SRM discovers new topics and consumer groups on source
    clusters.
The discovery and replication of newly created topics or consumer groups is not instantaneous.
      SRM checks source clusters for new topics and consumer groups periodically, as controlled by
      the refresh.topics.interval.seconds and
        refresh.groups.interval.seconds properties. By default both properties are
      set to 10 minutes. As a result, the discovery and replication of new topics or groups can take
      up to 10 minutes. 
Cloudera does not recommend using a refresh interval lower than the default value for
      production environments as it can lead to severe performance degradation.
