Installing from Packages
Install SRM from packages.

Obtain the SRM software artifacts from the Cloudera Downloads portal. For more information,
        see Download from the SRM repository.

Copy the package to the machine you want to install SRM on. Install SRM:
For RHEL/CentOS:
yum install [SRM_PACAKAGE_NAME]

For Ubuntu/Debian
dpkg -i [SRM_PACAKAGE_NAME]

For SLES
zypper install [SRM_PACAKAGE_NAME]

Replace [SRM_PACAKAGE_NAME] with the name of the package
          you have downloaded. For example.
            streams-replication-manager-0.0.1.1.0.0.0-42.x86_64.rpm. Optional: Specify an alternate temporary-file directory for RocksDB.
          This step is only required if you have mounted /tmp with the
            noexec option. In this case you have to specify an alternate
            tmp directory for RocksDB. You can achieve this by adding the alternate
          directory path to srm-env.sh: 
Navigate to the SRM config directory located at
                /opt/streams-replication-manager/config.
Open srm-env.sh with an editor of your choice and add the
              following environment variable:
export ROCKSDB_SHAREDLIB_DIR=/root/tmp/srmrocksdb

noteVerify that the specified directory exists and that the users running SRM have
                read, write and execute permissions. If the directory does not exist, create it and
                assign the correct permissions.


SRM is installed on the host.
Use the command line tools provided with SRM to start the driver and service.
