Installing from ZIP or TAR Archives
Install SRM from ZIP or TAR archives.
Obtain the SRM software artifacts for your system from the Cloudera Downloads Portal. For
        more information, see Download from the SRM repository.
Create a home directory for SRM.Cloudera recommends
            /opt/streams-replication-manager/.mkdir -p /opt/streams-replication-manager/ 
Extract the files from the downloaded archive.
Use the unzip or tar command or any other archive
          manager to extract the archives. For
          example:tar -xzvf [ARCHIVE_PATH] -C /opt/streams-replication-manager/ unzip -o [ARCHIVE_PATH] -d /opt/streams-replication-manager/Replace
            [ARCHIVE_PATH] with the path to the archive you have downloaded. For
          example, /root/streams-replication-manager-0.0.1.1.0.0.0-42.tgz.
Verify that the directories have correct file permissions. If not assign
          them.
chmod -R 755 /opt/streams-replication-manager/

Set environment variables:
Navigate to the SRM config directory. For example,
                  /opt/streams-replication-manager/[ARCHIVE_NAME]/config.Replace
                [ARCHIVE_NAME] with the full name of the archive that you have
              downloaded. For example,
              streams-replication-manager-0.0.1.1.0.0.0-42.
Open srm-env.sh with an editor of your choice and add the
              following environment variables:
export SRM_HOME=/opt/streams-replication-manager/[ARCHIVE_NAME]
export SRM_BIN_DIR=${SRM_HOME}/bin
export SRM_CONF_DIR=${SRM_HOME}/config
export SRM_LOG_DIR=${SRM_HOME}/logs
export SRM_PID_DIR=${SRM_HOME}/run


Optional: Specify an alternate temporary-file directory for RocksDB.
              This step is only required if you have mounted /tmp with
              the noexec option. In this case you have to specify an alternate
                tmp directory for RocksDB. You can achieve this by adding the
              following environment variable to
              srm-env.sh:export ROCKSDB_SHAREDLIB_DIR=/root/tmp/srmrocksdb
noteVerify that the specified directory exists and that the users running SRM have
                read, write and execute permissions. If the directory does not exist, create it and
                assign the correct permissions.

Optional: Add the SRM bin directory to your
            PATH environment variable. For example:
export PATH=/opt/streams-replication-manager/[ARCHIVE_NAME]/bin:$PATH
SRM is installed on the
      host.Use the command line tools provided with SRM to start the driver and service.
