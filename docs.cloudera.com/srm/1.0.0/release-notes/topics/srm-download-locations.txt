SRM software artifacts can be downloaded from the Cloudera Archive. To access the
    artifacts, you must have an active subscription agreement and a license key file along with the
    required authentication credentials (username and password).
The license key file and authentication credentials are provided in an email sent to customer
      accounts from Cloudera as part of the subscription fulfillment process.importantYou must have your authentication credentials (username and password) to access the SRM
        artifacts in the Cloudera Archive. Your authentication credentials are not the same as the
        credentials you use to access the support portal.
In case you did not receive an email or do not have access to your authentication
      credentials, you can retrieve them in the following ways:
Contact your Cloudera sales representative.
File a non-technical case within the Cloudera support portal for our Support team to assist you.
Use the CDP Private Cloud Credential Generator (requires a license key):
Log in to the account associated with your license and subscription agreement on
              cloudera.com.
Go to the CDP Private Cloud Base Downloads page.
Click Download Now.
Enter the text of the “PGP Signed Message” within your license key in the
                Generate Credentials text box.
Click Generate Credentials.The Credential Generator
                returns your username and password.


Once you have obtained your credentials, you can use them to access the software artifacts on
      the Cloudera Archive.
You can directly click any of the links provided in the following tables and provide your
      credentials through a browser prompt. Alternatively, you can also manually construct a URL
      that contains the credentials. For
      example:https://username:password@archive.cloudera.com/p/product/version/OS/artifact
