MM2-163: SRM does not sync re-created source topics until the
            offsets have caught up with target topic
 Messages written to topics that were deleted and re-created are
            not replicated until the source topic reaches the same offset as the target topic. For
            example, if at the time of deletion and re-creation there are a 100 messages on the
            source and target clusters, new messages will only get replicated once the re-created
            source topic has 100 messages. This leads to messages being lost.
None




CSP-736: SRM may automatically re-create deleted topics 
 If auto.create.topics.enable is enabled,
            deleted topics are automatically recreated on source clusters.
Prior to deletion, remove the topic from the topic
            whitelist with the srm-control tool. This prevents topics from being
            re-created.srm-control topics --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --target [TARGET_CLUSTER] --remove [TOPIC1][TOPIC2]




CSP-462: Replication failing when SRM driver is present on
            multiple nodes
 Kafka replication fails when the SRM driver is installed on
            more than one node. 
None



Limitations


SRM cannot replicate Ranger authorization policies to or from
            Kafka clusters
Due to a limitation in the Kafka-Ranger plugin, SRM cannot
            replicate Ranger policies to or from clusters that are configured to use Ranger for
            authorization. If you are using SRM to replicate data to or from a cluster that uses
            Ranger, disable authorization policy synchronization in SRM. This can be achieved by
            setting sync.topic.acls.enabled to false.
