Learn how to set up security for SRM.
SRM can operate in both secure and unsecure environments, as well as a mix of both. In
        addition, it can also connect to clusters that have differing security setups. Configuring
        security can be achieved by adding the appropriate security related properties to your
           srm.properties configuration file. The properties set should match the
        security setup of the cluster or clusters that SRM is connecting to.
