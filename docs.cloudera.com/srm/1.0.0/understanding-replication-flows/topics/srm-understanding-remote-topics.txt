Remote Topics
Learn about SRM's remote topics.In any replication flow, the selected source topics are replicated to remote topics on the target
      cluster. Remote topics reference the source cluster via a naming convention. For example, the
        topic1 topic from the us-west source cluster creates the
        us-west.topic1 remote topic on the target cluster. Figure 1. Simple Replication Flow ExampleRemote topics can themselves be replicated. In this case, the remote topic references all source
      and target clusters. The prefix in the name will start with the cluster closest to the final
      target cluster. For example, the topic1 topic replicated from the
        us-west source cluster to the us-east cluster and then to
      the eu-west cluster will be named
      us-east.us-west.topic1.Figure 2. Complex Replication Flow Example
tipYou might want to have your Kafka consumers read messages from both source and
      remote topics simultaneously. To achieve this, Kafka consumers should include a wildcard topic
      name pattern. For example, suppose that you want your consumer to read from
        topic1 located in us-west and its remote counterpart,
        us-west.topic1, located in us-east. In such a case, you
      can use the .*topic1 pattern, which matches any topic that ends with
        topic1.
