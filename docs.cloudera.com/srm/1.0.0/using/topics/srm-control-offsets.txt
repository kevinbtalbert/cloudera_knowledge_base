Offsets Subcommand
Learn how to use the offsets subcommand of the
      srm-client command line tool.
SRM automatically translates consumer group offsets between clusters. The offset mappings are
      created by SRM, but are not applied to the consumer groups of the target cluster directly.
      Consumers can be migrated from one cluster to another without losing any progress by using the
        offsets subcommand on the target cluster to export the translated offsets
      of the source cluster. For
      example:srm-control offsets --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --target [TARGET_CLUSTER] --group [GROUP1] --export > out.csv
Exported
      offsets can then be applied to the consumer groups in the target cluster with the
        kafka-consumer-groups tool. For detailed steps on cluster migration, see
        Migrating Consumer Groups Between Clusters.
The offsets subcommand reads configuration properties from a configuration
      file. When not specified otherwise, it uses the default configuration file. If required, you
      can use the --config option to specify a different configuration file.
      srm-control --config [path/to/srm.proerpties] offsets --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --target [TARGET_CLUSTER] --group [GROUP1] --export > out.csv

Client Override Options
The offset subcommand supports client override options. Client override
        options allow users to temporarily specify or override configuration properties. These
        options also enable users to issue srm-control commands even if the SRMâ€™s
        configuration file is not available on the host that the command is being issued from. While
        it is possible to specify a range of properties with the client override options, and they
        can prove to be a powerful tool in certain scenarios, Cloudera recommends that you use the
          srm.properties configuration file to manage client configuration
        options.
The following client override options are available: 
--bootstrap-servers: Specifies the bootstraps servers.
--props: Specifies client configuration properties.

note
Client override options always take precedence over the srm.properties
          file. 

A simple example of using client override options is when you want to change the bootstrap
        server. This can be done in two ways. 
You can specify the bootstrap server with the --bootstrap-servers option.
        srm-control --bootstrap-servers localhost:9092 offsets --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --group [GROUP] --export > out.csv
Alternatively, you can use the --props option together with the
          bootstrap.servers Kafka property to define the bootstrap server.
        srm-control --props bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092 offsets --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --group [GROUP] --export > out.csv
