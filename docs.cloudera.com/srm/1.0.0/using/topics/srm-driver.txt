Learn how to use the srm-driver command line tool which is used to
    launch SRM.
SRM is launched with the srm-driver command line tool. The driver is
      responsible for connecting to the specified clusters and performing replication between them.
      The driver uses a configuration file to identify which clusters it should connect to. When not
      specified otherwise, it uses the default configuration file. If required, you can use the
        --config option to specify a different configuration file. 
Run the driver with the following command: srm-driver
By default the driver will read from and write to all clusters specified in the configuration
      file.  Optionally you can use the --clusters option which is used to specify
      the clusters that the driver should target or in other words write to. 
When the driver is started with the --clusters option it will still connect
      to and read data from all clusters specified in the configuration file, but will only write
      data to the clusters specified with the --clusters option. This allows you to
      distribute replication workloads. 

Target specific clusters with the following
      command:srm-driver --clusters [CLUSTER_1] [CLUSTER_2]
Although the driver launches SRM, it does not kick off replication. Data will only be
      replicated between clusters once the allowlist is populated with either topics or groups using
      the srm-control tool.
