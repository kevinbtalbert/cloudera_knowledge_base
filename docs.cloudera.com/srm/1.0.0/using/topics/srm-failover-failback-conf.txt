Configure SRM for Failover and Failback
Learn how to configure SRM for failover and failback.

To prepare for a failover or failback scenario you have to set up SRM with bidirectional
        replication. Additionally, you have to make sure that all mission critical topics and
        consumer groups are whitelisted on both the primary and backup clusters.


Set up bidirectional replication between clusters:

note
The following example contains the minimum required properties only. For a more
              in-depth configuration example for a cluster setup with bidirectional replication, see
              Configuration Examples.



Configure the following configuration properties based on your environment.
# Specify clusters and add connection information

clusters = primary, secondary
primary.bootstrap.servers = primary_host1:9092, primary_host2:9092, primary_host3:9092
secondary.bootstrap.servers = secondary_host1:9092, secondary_host2:9092, secondary_host3:9092

# Enable bidirectional replication 

primary->secondary.enabled = true
secondary->primary.enabled = true


Whitelist required consumer groups and topics on the primary cluster.
Whitelist groups: 

srm-control groups --source [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --target [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --add [GROUP1],[GROUP2]



Whitelist topics:
srm-control topics --source [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --target [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --add [TOPIC1],[TOPIC2]

Whitelist required remote topics and consumer groups on the secondary
          cluster.
important
 If remote topics and consumer groups are not whitelisted on the secondary cluster, a
              failback operation will be impossible to carry out. 


Whitelist remote groups:
srm-control groups --source [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --target [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --add [GROUP1],[GROUP2]


Whitelist remote topics:
srm-control topics --source [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --target [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --add [PRIMARY_CLUSTER.TOPIC1],[PRIMARY_CLUSTER.TOPIC2]

Verify that all required topics and consumer groups are whitelisted.
Verify consumer groups:
srm-control groups --source [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --target [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --list
srm-control groups --source [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --target [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --list


Verify topics:
srm-control topics --source [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --target [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --list
srm-control topics --source [SECONDARY_CLUSTER] --target [PRIMARY_CLUSTER] --list




SRM is set up with bidirectional replication and all mission critical topics and consumer
        groups are whitelisted on both the primary and secondary clusters.
