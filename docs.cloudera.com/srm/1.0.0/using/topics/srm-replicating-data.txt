Replicating Data 
A step by step guide on how to start replicating data between Kafka clusters with
    SRM.
In SRM a replication can be set up with the help of the
        srm-driver and srm-control tools. 

Verify that SRM is configured correctly. Make sure that connection information for
        each Kafka cluster is added as well as at least one source->target
        replication is specified and enabled.


Launch SRM with the srm-driver tool.


srm-driver

Alternatively, if you want to use a properties file other than the default, you can do
            so with the --config
            option.srm-driver --config [path/to/srm.properties]



The driver connects to the clusters defined in your configuration. However, data
            replication is not yet started.
Update the topics whitelist to start data replication.
srm-control topics --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --target [TARGET_CLUSTER] --add [TOPIC1],[TOPIC2]

Alternatively, if you want to use a properties file other than the default, you can do
            so with the --config option.
srm-control --config [path/to/srm.properties] topics --source [SOURCE_CLUSTER] --target [TARGET_CLUSTER] --add [TOPIC1],[TOPIC2]

note If required, instead of listing the topics that you want to add, you can also use
            regular expressions to add multiple topics with one command. 


The topics you specify with the --add option are added to the topic
        whitelist and are replicated to the specified target cluster.
