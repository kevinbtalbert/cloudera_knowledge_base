Learn how to use the srm-service command line tool which is used to
    launch the SRM REST service and Kafka streams application.
The srm-service tool launches a REST service and a Kafka streams application,
      which enable users to monitor replications. 
Each instance of the service is associated with a specific target cluster. The tool uses a
      properties file to acquire connection information for the target cluster. When not specified
      otherwise, it uses the default configuration file. If required, you can use the
        --config option to specify a different properties file. 
Additionally, a second configuration file, srm-service.yaml, is required for
      settings specific to the service, for example which HTTP ports to use. Use the
        --yaml option to specify which srm-service.yaml file to
      use. As with --config, the --yaml option is only required if
      you are storing the file in a non-default location. For .rpm or .deb based installations, the
      yaml file is read from
        /opt/streams-replication-manager/config/srm-service.yaml. For ZIP or TAR
      based installations, the service will default to
        $SRM_CONF_DIR/srm-service.yaml.
Run the SRM services with following
      command:srm-service --target [TARGET_CLUSTER] The
      yaml file supports Dropwizard properties as well as changing the rpc port used by srm-service
      nodes for communication. The default port is 6669. To change the default port, add the
      following to the yaml configuration file:
      rpcPort: 8081
server:
  applicationConnectors:
    - type: http
      port: 8081
