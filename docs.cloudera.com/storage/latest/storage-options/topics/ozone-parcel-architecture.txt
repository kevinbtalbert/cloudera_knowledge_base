Ozone parcel block diagram
This is a block diagram of CDP Private Cloud Base with Ozone and Ozone parcels as
    storage. You can upgrade Ozone parcels without upgrading the Ozone service or CDP Private Cloud
    Base cluster.



When the Ozone parcel is activated, only the Ozone software bits are picked up from the Ozone Parcel.
