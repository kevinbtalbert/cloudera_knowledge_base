Adding Ozone HttpFS gateway
Ozone now supports HttpFS Gateway. This allows Ozone to integrate with other tools
        through REST APIs. HttpFS service is a Jetty based web application that uses the Hadoop
        FileSystem API to talk to the cluster. HttpFS service is an optional role available in an
        Ozone cluster.
You must ensure that your Ozone deployment meets the
            following requirements:
You must have Ozone parcel 2 on the Ozone cluster. For more information on
                    installing Ozone parcel, see Ozone
                        Parcel Installation documentation.
Cloudera Manager version is 7.10.1.


Restart the CDP Private Cloud Base cluster to ensure
                    dependent components use the correct version of Ozone.
