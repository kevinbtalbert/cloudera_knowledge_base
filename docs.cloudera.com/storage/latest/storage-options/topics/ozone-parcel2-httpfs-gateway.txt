Ozone HttpFS gateway
Ozone now supports HttpFS Gateway. This allows Ozone to integrate with other tools
  through REST APIs. HttpFS service is a Jetty based web application that uses the Hadoop FileSystem
  API to talk to the cluster. HttpFS service is an optional role available in an Ozone
  cluster.
You can use HttpFS as a gateway to access data on an Ozone cluster behind a firewall. HttpFS is
   the only system that is allowed to cross the firewall into the Ozone cluster. You can use HttpFS
   to access data in Ozone using:
HTTP utilities such as curl and wget
HTTP libraries Perl from other languages than Java

HttpFS service provides REST HTTP gateway supporting File System operations such as read and
   write. HttpFS service is interoperable with the webhdfs REST HTTP API. You can use the webhdfs
   client FileSystem implementation to access HttpFS using:
Ozone filesystem CLI (ozone fs) 
Java applications using the Hadoop FileSystem Java API. 

HttpFS has built-in security that supports the following:
Hadoop pseudo authentication 
Kerberos SPNEGO 
Other pluggable authentication mechanisms
Hadoop proxy user support
