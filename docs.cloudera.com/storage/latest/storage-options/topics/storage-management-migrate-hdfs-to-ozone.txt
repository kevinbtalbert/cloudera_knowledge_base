Migrating your data from HDFS to Ozone 
You can migrate data from your existing HDFS deployment to Ozone for benefits such as
  scaling the metadata to billions of files; supporting denser, more cost-effective storage nodes as
  a part of a strategy to segregate storage and compute; or cold storage and archival storage
  needs.
This document assumes that you have an existing HDFS cluster from which you want a part or
   whole data to be moved to Ozone. The Ozone service can exist in the same cluster as HDFS or in a
   different cluster. 
For more information, see the Migration from HDFS to Ozone documentation.
