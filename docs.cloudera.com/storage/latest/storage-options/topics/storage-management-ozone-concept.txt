Apache Ozone - Next-Gen Storage
Apache Ozone is a scalable, redundant, and distributed object store optimized for big
  data workloads. Apart from scaling to billions of objects of varying sizes, applications that use
  frameworks like Apache Spark, Apache YARN and Apache Hive work natively on Ozone without any
  modifications. Ozone natively supports the S3 API and provides a Hadoop-compatible file system
  interface. Ozone is typically available in a CDP Private Cloud Base deployment.
Ozone consists of three important storage elements: volumes, buckets, and keys. Each key is
   part of a bucket, which, in turn, belongs to a volume. Only an administrator can create volumes.
   Depending on their requirements, regular users can create buckets in volumes. Ozone stores data
   as keys inside these buckets.
When a client writes a key, Ozone stores the associated data on DataNodes in chunks called
   blocks. Therefore, each key is associated with one or more blocks. Within a DataNode, multiple
   unrelated blocks can reside in a storage container.
To understand the concepts of Ozone, you can refer to the Ozone overview and introduction documentation.
For storing and configuring Ozone, refer to the Ozone How to documentation.
