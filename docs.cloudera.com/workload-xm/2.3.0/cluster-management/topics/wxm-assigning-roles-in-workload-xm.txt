Assigning Access Roles in Workload XM
Workload XM supports cluster privilege role types that define who is entitled
    to access jobs and queries that are created by the user, who is entitled to create and
    administer cost centers and view cluster costs, and who is entitled to access and administer
    jobs and queries within either a specific cluster or across all clusters within the Workload XM environment. 
Limiting the trust boundary for jobs, queries, cluster costs, and administrative management
      at the cluster level, enables more control over the security and access management of your Workload XM environment.
