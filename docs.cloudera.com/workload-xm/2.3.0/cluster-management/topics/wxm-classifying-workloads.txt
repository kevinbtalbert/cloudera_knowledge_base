Classifying Workloads for Analysis with Workload Views
The Workload View feature enables you to analyze workloads with much finer
        granularity. For example, you can analyze how queries that access a particular database or
        that use a specific resource pool are performing against your SLAs. Or you can examine how
        all the queries are performing on your cluster that are sent by a specific user.
