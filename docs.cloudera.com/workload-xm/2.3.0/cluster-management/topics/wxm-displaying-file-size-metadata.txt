Displaying File Size Metadata
Steps for displaying a table's File Size report and the metadata that describes the
        table's file size distribution. 
Describes how to open a table's File Size report and display the metadata. importantAt this time the Workload XM File
                Size Report feature is only supported on CDH Workload clusters, version 6.3 to
                version 7.0, with Cloudera Navigator enabled. CDP Workload clusters are not
                supported.

Verify that you are logged in to the Workload XM web UI.


In the URL field of a supported web browser, enter the Workload XM URL that
                            you were given by your system administrator and press
                                Enter. 


When the Workload XM Log in page opens, enter your Workload XM user name and password access credentials.


Click Log in.



In the Search field of the Clusters page, enter the name
                    of the cluster whose workloads you want to analyze.

From the Navigation side-bar, select File Size
                    Report.

In the File Size Report page, either search for a
                    specific table, or locate the table by sorting the tables by the number of
                    files, the number of partitions, or the table size. 
For example, the File Size Reports shows that the Animantarx table has 7
                    million files and 913 partitions. 



To display details about the table's file size distribution, select a table
                    name. 
For example, the following details window shows that the Aerosteon table uses
                    42 data files that range from 10 to 24.5 GiB and the graph displays the Q1 and
                    Q3 file size distribution.
