Displaying the Metadata of a Table
Steps for displaying a table's metadata that could be causing a query to run slowly. 
Describes how to display the metadata of a table used in your query, such as the
            table's file size distribution that could be causing your query statement to run
            slowly.

Verify that you are logged in to the Workload XM web UI.


In the URL field of a supported web browser, enter the Workload XM URL that
                            you were given by your system administrator and press
                                Enter. 


When the Workload XM Log in page opens, enter your Workload XM user name and password access credentials.


Click Log in.



In the Search field of the Clusters page, enter the name
                    of the cluster whose workloads you want to analyze.

From the Navigation side-bar, select Summary.

In the Queries page, select the query of interest and then select the
                        HDFS Tables Scanned tab.
For example, the Duration column shows that the query
                    took over six hours to run and the HDFS Tables Scanned
                    section displays the metadata for the tables that were scanned. noteThis is not the number of files accessed, but the
                        total number of files that were in the table the last time a HDFS snapshot
                        was taken before the query was run. 



To display details about the table's file size distribution, select a table
                    name.
