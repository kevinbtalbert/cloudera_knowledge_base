Identifying File Size Storage Issues
Data stored in small files or partitions may create performance issues. The File size
  reporting feature helps you identify data that is stored inefficiently in small files or
  partitions. 
importantAt this time the Workload XM File Size
   Report feature is only supported on CDH Workload clusters, version 6.3 to version 7.0, with
   Cloudera Navigator enabled. CDP Workload clusters are not supported.
A table's data maybe stored in a large number of files, perhaps millions of files. For example,
   the first time you run an Impala query it loads the metadata for each file, which can cause
   processing delays. In addition, every time you change a query, refresh the metadata, or add a new
   file or partition, Impala reloads the metadata. This puts pressure on the NameNode, which stores
   each file's metadata.
The Workload XM file size reporting enables you to identify tables that have a large
   number of files or partitions. For example, for queries that run slowly or when an Impala cluster
   crashes, you can view a table's metadata to determine whether a large number of files or
   partitions are causing the problem.
noteBefore you can view the file size metadata in Workload XM,
   you must enable file size reporting in Cloudera Manager. Once enabled, the file size metadata is
   saved in HDFS, which is then forwarded to Workload XM by Telemetry Publisher.
