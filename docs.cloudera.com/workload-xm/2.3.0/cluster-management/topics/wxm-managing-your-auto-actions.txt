Managing your Auto Actions
Steps for updating, deleting, duplicating, and disabling an auto action.
The following Auto Actions management tasks are performed in the Auto Actions Management page,
      which is accessed by selecting Auto Actions in the Workload XM Navigation side-bar. 
Updating your Auto Action
 In the Auto Actions Management page, click the action’s vertical
        ellipsis, as shown in the following image, and select Edit. Make your
        changes and then click Update. 



Deleting an Auto Action 
In the Auto Actions Management page, click the action’s vertical
        ellipsis, and select Delete. In the confirmation message, click
          OK to confirm. The action is permanently removed. noteUnless the action is no longer required, Cloudera
          recommends disabling the action, as you may require the action at another time.
        

Duplicating an Auto Action 
In the Auto Actions Management page, click the action’s vertical
        ellipsis, and select Clone. Replace the exisiting name with a new
        unique name for the cloned auto action, make any other changes, and then click
          Create. A new auto action is created and is displayed on the Auto
        Actions Management page.
noteYou must change the name of the cloned auto action before a new
        one can be created. 

Disabling an Auto Action 
In the Auto Actions Management page, click the action’s vertical
        ellipsis, and select Disable. In the confirmation message, click
          OK to confirm. The action is no longer active and the
          Disabled state is displayed in the action’s
          Status column on the Auto Actions Management
        page.
