Troubleshooting
The Workload XM purge event does not delete directories and files that do not
        have the full wxm owner and file permissions. Files and directories
        may revert back to the hdfs owner when a restore is created from a
        snapshot. In this case and before creating an automatic or manual purge event you must
        verify the owner and file permissions of the required files to be purged.
To reset your HDFS files and directories as the wxm owner with full administrative
        permissions do the following: 
In a terminal go to the /etc directory and open the hdfs
            password file by entering: vim passwd
Search for the kafka parameter. 
Replace /sbin/nologin with /bin/hash. 
Save the file. 
Grant full wxm access permissions to the hdfs password file by
            using the chown command.


Tracking your Purge Event from Log Entries
You can determine if the purge event was successful or identify potential problems from the
        Cloudera Manager Admin API Server log files.
The Admin API Server log file entries also list the names of the files and directories that
        were deleted and provide details about how many files and directories were deleted, the sum
        total size of the files and directories that were deleted, and the time they were deleted.
