Workload XM Purge Event Parameters 
Lists the Workload XM purge event parameter settings that enable you to set
    the event’s execution time, frequency, and maximum purge duration. You can also exclude files
    and directories from being purged with the blobstore.purger.paths.to.keep
    parameter setting.
Table 1. Purge Event Parameters

Parameter
Description
Example



blobstore.purger.frequency
The purge event’s recurring schedule, based on one of the following values: 
None. By default, the purge process is set to none.
Daily. When this value is set for the first time, files
                  are automatically deleted the next day at 1am. 
Weekly. By default, files are automatically deleted every
                  Saturday at 1am.
Monthly. When this value is set for the first time, files
                  are automatically deleted the last Saturday of the month at 1am. Thereafter, files
                  are deleted every 28th day. The monthly parameter uses the 28 day calendar
                  format

blobstore.purger.frequency = none


blobstore.purger.start.time

The purge event’s start time, based on the 24-hour time format. Where, 01:00 and
                0:00 are valid time values, and 24:00, 1:0, and 01:0 are not valid time values
By default, Workload XM schedules the purge process when it will cause the least
                amount of disruption to users.

noteCloudera recommends scheduling a time during non-peak
                  working hours or job execution hours.


blobstore.purger.start.time = 01:00


blobstore.purger.paths.to.keep

Lists the files and directories that are to be excluded from the purge
                event. 
Where each file and/or directory is separated by a comma and where:
a file value must use its full path, directory name, and file name.
a directory value must use its full path and directory name.



blobstore.purger.paths.to.keep=
/cloudera-dbus/ImpalaQueryProfile/2021030217/7d2bcefa-8819 -4fa1-be0c-4529ee4eb98f,
/cloudera-dbus/HiveAudit,
/cloudera-sigma-olap-impala/02f54999-b9a 4-4dca-8237-d1b047755efb,
/cloudera-sigma-sdx-payloads/2bc85719-7a3e-4438-96a4-8fc0f77ff



blobstore.purger.delete.request.limit

The maximum deletion limit.
By default, the maximum number of files that can be deleted by the purge
                process is 500,000. This ensures that a purge cycle is not overloaded, does not
                introduce bugs, or takes up too much time. 
When the deletion limit is met, the purge process:
                
Stops processing for a daily scheduled value.
Stops processing and restarts the next day for all other scheduled
                    values.

noteThe purge event’s maximum deletion limit calculates
                  all the files in a dbus directory as one file. When you exclude a file or files
                  that reside in the dbus directory from the purge process, the purge event’s
                  maximum deletion limit condition calculates all the files in the directory minus
                  those files you have excluded. 

blobstore.purger.delete.request.limit=500000
