Triggering Actions across Jobs and Queries
You can trigger action alerts, that are defined by you, across your workload
    applications, jobs, and queries whilst they are running with the Workload XM Auto
    Actions feature. When a workload application, job, or query matches the action's defined
    threshold value, the auto action event is triggered. For example, you may have a scenario where
    too much memory is being allocated to specific jobs and you would like to take an action before
    a problem occurs, such as avoiding memory exhaustion. In this case, you can create an auto
    action that triggers a notification alert when a job is identified as having an over-allocation
    of memory. You can then either manually take steps to alleviate the problem or include the
      Kill action option that stops the job in question. 
importantBefore you can use the Auto Actions feature you
      must set the required auto actions configuration properties in Telemetry Publisher. For

Considerations and Limitations
The following describes consideration decisions and limitations when using Auto Actions:
Killing a workload application, job, or query could impact other workloads. Especially when
            another workload is dependent on the results of the killed workload application, job, or
            query. Before triggering a Kill type action, Cloudera recommends
            using the Notification only action alert until you have verified
            that no issues will arise.
By default, the Workload XM UI limits the amount of displayed audit events to
            500 and sorts them in ascending order (newest time stamp first). To display older audit
            events, change the date range duration and/or the time range duration from the
            time-range list on the Auto Actions Events page.
Too Fast To Collect: The minimum polling interval is
              one minute. If you have jobs or queries that overlap or start
            before the minimum polling interval is completed there may not be enough time for Workload XM to evaluate your auto action’s definition. For example, if Workload XM starts polling at 1:00:00 PM and polling finishes by 1:00:10 PM
              (10 seconds) and then a job starts at 1:00:12 PM and finishes before 1:01:00 PM, there
              is not enough of a time lapse for Workload XM to evaluate and trigger your
              action alert.
Too Fast to Kill: Under normal conditions the evaluation and
            invocation phases of an auto action is within the span of one
            minute. If you have jobs or queries whose run time is less than one minute, Workload XM may complete the evaluation phase but not have time to complete the
            invocation phase, such as killing the job. Depending on the context of your auto action,
            this may or may not be an issue. But if, for example, you have a workload cluster that
            is dedicated for specific jobs and a rogue job is run before the action is triggered,
            then this could be an issue

For example, when a job is taking too long to run it may delay other jobs waiting         in the queue. With Auto Actions, you can create an auto action alert that informs you         through an email when a job is exceeding its usual runtime so that you can decide whether to         manually take steps to alleviate the problem or have an auto action that will kill the job         or query process for you.Understanding the Events and Management FieldsDescribes the fields in the Auto Actions Events and Management pages.Managing your Auto ActionsSteps for updating, deleting, duplicating, and disabling an auto action.Auto Action Email Notification ExamplesExamples of a Workload XM Auto Actions alert notification email.
