Understanding the Purge Date used by the Purge Event
Describes the Workload XM purge event's criteria that is based on the file's
  data group and the data group's retention limit and how the purge date is calculated.
The purge event’s criteria is based on the maximum data retention policy, described in days,
   for the following HDFS data groups:
Temporary data, when the retention period exceeds 8 days 
Staging data, when the retention period exceeds 31 days 
Detailed data, when the retention period exceeds 181 days 
Summarized data, when the retention period exceeds 731 days 

The purge date is calculated by subtracting the retention days, specified by the maximum data
   retention period policy, from the current date and comparing the resultant date with the data’s
   timestamp date. If the data’s timestamp date is less than or
    equal to the resultant date the data is removed.
The data’s timestamp date is determined by where the data resides:
If the data resides in the cloudera-bus root directory, the timestamp date is extracted from
     the subdirectory name. For example, if the directory name is
      /cloudera-dbus/HiveAudit/2021030623. The timestamp date extracted by
     the purge event is 2021/03/06, using the YYYY/MM/DD date format.importantThe purge event deletes files from the cloudera-dbus directory as follows:
If the date is successfully extracted and is less than or equal to the resultant date,
         all the files in the directory are removed and are counted as one
        file by the maximum deletion limit. 
If the date is successfully extracted, is less than or equal to the resultant date, and a
        file or files are set in the blobstore.purger.paths.to.keep parameter, all
        the files except the file or files set in the
         blobstore.purger.paths.to.keep parameter are removed and each file that is
        removed is counted by the maximum deletion limit. 

If the data resides in a cloudera-sigma-olap-impala, cloudera-sigma-partial-pse,
     cloudera-sigma-pse-extended, or cloudera-sigma-sdx-payloads root directory, the timestamp date
     is extracted from the file’s last modified time. 

Obsolete data can be purged from the following HDFS root directories: 
cloudera-dbus
cloudera-sigma-olap-impala
cloudera-sigma-partial-pse
cloudera-sigma-pse-extended
cloudera-sigma-sdx-payloads
