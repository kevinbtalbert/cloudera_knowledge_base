autoactions.definition.cache.refresh.minutes
5

This setting controls, in minutes, how long an Auto Action definition is stored in
                cache on the cluster.
Your Auto Action definitions can be stored in cache on the cluster. As an Auto
                Action definition rarely changes, setting this value increases the delivery speed of
                requests by reducing the number of calls to Workload XM.

autoactions.definition.cache.refresh.minutes=5
