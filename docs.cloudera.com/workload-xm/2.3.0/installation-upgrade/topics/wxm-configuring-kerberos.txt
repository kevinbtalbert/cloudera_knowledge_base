Workload XM must be able to create Phoenix tables in data storage. If you
        are installing Workload XM in a Kerberized environment, it must be able to
        securely create these tables.
Describes how to add the wxm user as a HBase superuser, which securely enables Workload XM to create and store Phoenix tables.

In a supported web browser on the Workload XM cluster, log in to
                    Cloudera Manager.

In Cloudera Manager, select Hosts and then
                        Parcels.

In the Parcels page, select the HDFS service.

In the HDFS-1 page, click the Configuration tab.

In the Search field, enter hbase superusers, which
                    displays the HBase Superusers property.

In the HBASE-1 (Service-Wide) field, enter wxm, which
                    adds the wxm user as a HBase superuser.

tipIf the HBASE-1 (Service-Wide) field is
                        not visible, click the plus icon.


Click Save Changes.
