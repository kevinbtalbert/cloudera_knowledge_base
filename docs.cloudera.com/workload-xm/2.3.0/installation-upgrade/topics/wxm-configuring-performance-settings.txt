In a supported web browser on the Workload XM cluster, log in to
                    Cloudera Manager.

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters and then the
                        Service name. For example, ZooKeeper.

In the Service name page, click the
                        Configuration tab, and then search for the
                        Property name. For example, in the Search field, enter
                        maxClientCnxn, which locates the Maximum
                        Client Connections setting for ZooKeeper.

Change the setting to the value for the service as listed in the
                        Performance Improvement Settings table. For example,
                    change the Maximum Client Connections setting, to
                        300.

Repeat steps 2 to 4 for the hbase.regionserver.handler.count and the
                    hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles properties listed for the HBase service.

For the hbase.ipc.server.max.callqueue.size property do the following:


In the HBase Configuration tab, search for
                                safety valve.
In the HBase Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety
                                Value) for hbase-site.xml section, click Add
                                Another.
Add the hbase.ipc.server.max.callqueue.size
                            setting and set the value to 2147483648 bytes (2GB).



Restart HBase, ZooKeeper, and any other dependent services.
