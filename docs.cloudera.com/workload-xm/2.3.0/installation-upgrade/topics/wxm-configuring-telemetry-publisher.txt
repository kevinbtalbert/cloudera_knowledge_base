Configuring Telemetry Publisher
Tasks for enabling Cloudera Telemetry Publisher, which collects and sends diagnostic
  information about job and query processes to Workload XM.
Cloudera Telemetry Publisher is a role in the Cloudera Manager Management Service that collects
   and sends your workload information to Workload XM. For example, when new clusters are
   added with Cloudera Manager, Telemetry Publisher automatically sends the new cluster information
   to Workload XM. noteCloudera highly recommends that you assign
    a dedicated disk for the Telemetry Publisher Service role on your Workload cluster. This
    prevents any issues when sending data to Workload XM from affecting operations other
    than those performed by Telemetry Publisher.Where, depending on the number and size of the
     jobs run on the cluster, the minimum supported disk drive size is 500GB. This size includes
     enough disk space for Telemetry Publisher to store data locally when it is unable to send data
     to Workload XM due to connectivity or other issues.

Redacting DataTelemetry Publisher collects diagnostic data from logs, job configurations, and SQL   queries, and then sends this data to Workload XM. As this diagnostic information may   contain sensitive information it is important to mask this data before Telemetry Publisher sends   it to Workload XM.Enabling the Telemetry Publisher ServiceActivating the Telemetry Publisher service for Workload XM.Associating a Workload Cluster with Telemetry PublisherSteps for connecting your Workload cluster with the Telemetry Publisher         service.Adding a Proxy ServerSteps for configuring a proxy server, which adds extra security by enabling an         intermediary gateway for sending your workload data to Workload XM.
