Configuring TLSCloudera Docs
Configuring TLS
Enable secure connections for data transfers and user access with either the Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) protocol or the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, which ensures access
    authenticity and securely protects your data.
noteCloudera recommends that you configure your cluster to use auto-TLS, which eases the
      process of configuring TLS/SSL.
TLS/SSL is supported between the following services: 
The supported web browser and the Workload XM UI.
Telemetry Publisher and the Workload XM API.
The Workload XM UI and the Workload XM API.
The Workload XM Servers and Impala.

Configure the TLS properties based on the edge connection that you want to encrypt. 
The following tables list the property settings for enabling TLS/SSL encrypted communication
      between the Workload XM system components:
The supported web browser connected to the Workload XM UI.
The Console Server and other REST Clients connected to the Admin API Server, the API
          Server, and the Databus API Server.
The Pipeline Server, the Analytic Database Server, the Entities Server, the Databus
          Server, and a SDX Server connected to Impala Server.
