Confirm Installation of Main Components
Lists the Workload XM main component services. These services must be
        installed before installing Workload XM. 
You must verify that the following services are installed on the cluster in which Workload XM is to be installed.
In a supported web browser on the Workload XM cluster, log in to
                    Cloudera Manager.
In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters, and then confirm
                    that your Workload XM cluster has the following required
                    services:



HBase
HDFS
Hive
(Optional) Hue. noteThough an optional service, Cloudera
                        recommends installing Hue on the cluster in which Workload XM is
                        to be installed as it provides troubleshooting and extraction
                        services.
Impala
Phoenix
ZooKeeper



noteTo optimize performance, Cloudera highly recommends that you do not install any other
                services on the Workload XM cluster.
