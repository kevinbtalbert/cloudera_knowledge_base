Deploying the Installation Files
Steps for copying the Workload XM installation files from the computer
        where the files were downloaded to the Cloudera Manager Server parcel directories on the Workload XM cluster.
Describes how to deploy the downloaded Workload XM installation files to the cluster on which you plan to install
                Workload XM.

Verify that you have the domain name of the Cloudera Manager Server host on the
                        Workload XM cluster.

In a terminal on the computer where the installation files were downloaded, log
                    in to the Cloudera Manager Server host and verify that you can establish a
                    secure shell (SSH) and a secure copy protocol (SCP) connection between the
                    computer where the installations files were downloaded and the Cloudera Manager
                    Server host.

Go the directory where the Workload XM installation files were
                    downloaded.

As the root user, SSH to the Cloudera Manager Server host.
For example,
                    sh root@domainname

In the directory where the WXM installation files were downloaded, do the
                    following:


Using the SCP protocol, copy the WXM parcel files to the
                                /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo directory of the Cloudera
                            Manager Server by entering the following command:

scp WXM-version_build-el7.parcel root@cm_mgr_server_host:/opt/cloudera/parcel-repo/

scp WXM-version_build-el7.parcel.sha root@cm_mgr_server_host:/opt/cloudera/parcel-repo/



Copy the WXM CSD file to the /opt/cloudera/csd
                            directory of the Cloudera Manager Server by entering the following
                            command:

scp WXM-version_build.jar root@cm_mgr_server_host:/opt/cloudera/csd/




In Cloudera Manager Server go to the /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo
                    and the /opt/cloudera/csd directories and set the ownership of
                    the copied files and change the read, write, and execute permissions to 644 by
                    entering the following commands:

chown cloudera-scm:cloudera-scm /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo/WXM-*; 
chmod 644 /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo/WXM-*;

chown cloudera-scm:cloudera-scm /opt/cloudera/csd/WXM-*; 
chmod 644 /opt/cloudera/csd/WXM-*;



Restart the Cloudera Manager Server by entering the following command:

service cloudera-scm-server restart


In a supported web browser, log in to Cloudera Manager on the Workload XM cluster.

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters, and locate and
                    select Cloudera Management Service.
The Cloudera Management Service page opens.

From the Actions menu, click
                        Restart.

In the Restart message, confirm restarting the management roles by clicking
                        Restart.
