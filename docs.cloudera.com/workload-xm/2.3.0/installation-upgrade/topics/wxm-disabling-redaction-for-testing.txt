Disabling Redaction for Testing
Steps for disabling the Log and Query redaction property in Telemetry Publisher for
        testing tasks.
Describes how to disable the Log and Query Redaction
            property, which by default, is enabled for Telemetry Publisher. importantTo protect sensitive data from being accessed
                by unauthorized users, Cloudera strongly recommends that log and query redaction is
                enabled for both HDFS and the Telemetry Publisher service.The
                    Log and Query Redaction property works with the
                    Log and Query Redaction property in HDFS. Both redaction
                properties must be disabled for Telemetry Publisher to start.noteThe Log and Query Redaction configuration property is
                available in Cloudera Manager version 5.16 and later.

In a supported web browser on a Workload cluster, log in to Cloudera Manager
                    with administrative privileges. 

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters,
                        HDFS, and then click the
                        Configuration tab. 

In the Search field, enter
                    redact, which locates the Log and Query redaction
                    properties for HDFS.

Deselect the Enable Log and Query Redaction property
                    check box.

Click Save Changes.

In the Cloudera Manager Home page, select Clusters,
                    locate and select Cloudera Management Service, and then
                    select the Configuration tab. 

From the Filters panel in the SCOPE section, select Telemetry
                        Publisher.

In the Search field, enter redact, which displays the
                        Log and Query Redaction property.

Deselect the Log and Query Redaction property check box
                    for the Telemetry Publisher Default Group.

Click Save Changes.

Restart both the HDFS and the Telemetry Publisher services, which disables the
                    log and query redaction feature.
