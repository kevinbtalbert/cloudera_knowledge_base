Enabling File Size Reports
Steps for enabling file size reports from HDFS. These reports help you to identify
        where your data is stored inefficiently, such as in small files or partitions, which can
        cause performance issues.
Describes how to enable file size reports in Cloudera Manager.importantAt this time the Workload XM File
                Size Report feature is only supported on CDH Workload clusters, version 6.3 to
                version 7.0, with Cloudera Navigator enabled. CDP Workload clusters are not
                supported.

In a supported web browser on your Workload cluster, log in to Cloudera
                    Manager.

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters and then locate and
                    select Cloudera Management Service.

Click the Configuration tab and in the
                        Search field enter small
                    files, which displays the small files properties.

Select the Small Files Reporting: Enable Data Collection
                    check box.

From the Small Files Reporting: HDFS Service for Data
                        Staging property list, select the HDFS service option that you
                    require.

In the Small File Reporting: HDFS Staging Location
                    field, enter the path and directory name that you require as the staging area
                    for file size analysis.

Click Save Changes.
