Enabling Key Trustee Keys
Describes how to access files from HDFS with Telemetry Publisher when your access keys
  are stored in the Cloudera Key Trustee Server.
By default, when keys are stored in the Key Trustee Server the HDFS user for Telemetry
   Publisher (hdfs) does not have permission to access files. 
To enable access to your files in HDFS, the Telemetry Publisher user must belong to the user
   groups that authenticate user access for the Job History Server and the Spark History Server. For
   example, if the hadoop user group authenticates access for the Job History Server and the spark
   user group authenticates access for the Spark History Server, then the Telemetry Publisher user
   must belong to the hadoop group and the spark group to download files from HDFS.
