Incorrect Installation Parcel Placement
Adding the Workload XM installation parcels in the wrong directory on the
        Cloudera Management Server host causes distribution and activation issues. The Workload XM installation parcel files must reside in the
            /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo directory.
Issues arise when the Workload XM installation
            parcels are incorrectly placed in the wrong directory and the Cloudera SCM server is
            restarted. This task discusses the type of error messaged generated, where to locate the
            parcel error messages, and what to do when you receive this type of message.If your
                installation of  Workload XM fails and you receive a message that reports
                a "getpwnam()" error, do the following:

Verify that the Workload XM installation parcels are residing in the
                        /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo directory of the Cloudera Management
                    Server.

Verify whether the parcel is correctly distributed and activated, by going to
                    the Parcels page in Cloudera Manager.  
An example of the errors displayed on the Parcel page during the Workload XM parcel distribution process is shown below: 



In a terminal, move the displaced parcel from the wrong directory to the
                        /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo directory. 

Restart the Cloudera SCM server and Cloudera SCM agent by using the following
                    commands:

service cloudera-scm-server restart
service cloudera-scm-agent restart
