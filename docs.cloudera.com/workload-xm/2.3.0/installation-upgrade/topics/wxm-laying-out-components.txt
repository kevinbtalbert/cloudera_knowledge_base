Laying Out Components
 Horizontally scaling improves performance by enabling multiple devices to share the
        processing and memory workload. Cloudera recommends that you leverage the Workload XM cluster resources by installing its components as
        described.
Describes how to display your current layout and how to layout the Workload XM services for optimum performance. The following table lists
                the components and the layout for a five node cluster. Where,
One node must include all the Workload XM
                        component role types.
The Databus API Server, Databus Server, Analytic Database Server, Baseline
                        Server, Entities Server, SDX Server, and Pipelines Server role types can
                        scale out to multiple nodes. As listed in the Node 2, 3, and 4 columns.
Due to inter service dependencies, the following role types are grouped.
                        Where, if one of the components is on a host then all the other components
                        in that group must be on the host, which is enforced by Cloudera Manager:
                            
Databus API Server, Databus Server.
Analytic Database Server, Baseline Server, Entities Server, SDX
                                Server, and Pipelines Server. 
Admin API Server, API Server, Console Server.
For example, if you add a new Databus API Server, you must also add
                            a Databus Server to that node.
Configure multiple Phoenix Query Server hosts, which reduces bottlenecks.
                        Where, the number of Phoenix Query Server hosts should be proportional to
                        the number of Workload XM roles. For example, if you have
                            roles on 5 nodes, at least 5 Query Servers are recommended for Phoenix.
                                Workload XM internally balances loads on those
                        hosts.
importantOnly one host must be configured

In a supported web browser on the Workload XM cluster, log in to
                    Cloudera Manager.

In Cloudera Manager, select Hosts and then
                        Roles.
The roles assigned to each node appear as shown in the below example:






Compare your existing layout with the layout described in the
                        Component layout for a five node Workload XM cluster
                    table above.

(Optional) To leverage resources, spread the Workload XM (WXM) roles
                    throughout the cluster. For more information on how to assign roles, see the
                    Cloudera Manager documentation.
