Network Port Requirements
Lists the network port numbers and their respective protocols used by Workload XM and dependent services.

noteTo enable communication, you may need to reconfigure or update your
    firewall.

 Protocols are defined as follows:
UI Port (ui.port ), which serves the Workload XM user interface (UI)
     and communicates using HTTPS when TLS/SSL is enabled, otherwise it communicates using
     HTTP.
API Port (api.port), which listens for REST calls to API-based
     servers. It communicates using  HTTPS when TLS/SSL is enabled, otherwise it communications
     using HTTP. 
Metrics Port (webservice.port), which exposes an interface to the
     metrics that the Workload XM roles collect. 
GRPC Port (grpc.port), which listens for gRPC requests against the
     backend servers. This protocol is used for inter-role communication.

The following table lists the port numbers that must be enabled for Workload XM
   communication:
