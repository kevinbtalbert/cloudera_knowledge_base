Redacting Data
Telemetry Publisher collects diagnostic data from logs, job configurations, and SQL
  queries, and then sends this data to Workload XM. As this diagnostic information may
  contain sensitive information it is important to mask this data before Telemetry Publisher sends
  it to Workload XM.
Cloudera recommends that before you configure Telemetry
   Publisher you redact your data.
