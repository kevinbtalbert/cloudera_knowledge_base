Redacting MapReduce Data
Telemetry Publisher reads the job configuration file from HDFS. You can enable data
        redaction for your MapReduce jobs pulled from HDFS by Telemetry Publisher by adding your
        MapReduce job configurations in the YARN Redacted MapReduce Job
            Properties property.
Steps for adding MapReduce job configurations in YARN that
            enable data redaction when MapReduce data is pulled from HDFS.

In a supported web browser on your Workload cluster, log in to Cloudera
                    Manager.

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters,
                        YARN, and then click the
                        Configuration tab.

Search for the Redacted MapReduce Job Properties
                    property.

noteBy default, several MapReduce job configuration
                        properties are set for you by the YARN service. Do not change these
                        settings.


Add additional MapReduce job configurations by clicking the plus sign
                    (+), which is located after the last configured property, and entering
                    the default gateway group.

Click Save Changes.

Restart the YARN service.
