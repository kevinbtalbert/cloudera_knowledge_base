Redacting Spark DataCloudera Docs
Redacting Spark Data
By default, redaction is enabled in the YARN service for Spark SQL data.
The YARN service redacts Apache Spark SQL sensitive data from event and executor logs. noteTo ensure that Telemetry Publisher only sends redacted data to Workload XM do not change the spark.redaction.regex
        configuration property.
