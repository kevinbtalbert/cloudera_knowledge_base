Securing the Workload XM Service Data
Describes how to enable secure connections and access authenticity when transferring
  data between components of Workload XM and your data.
Workload XM stores your workload data in HDFS and HBase, where the HDFS data is
   created in the root path and the directories have wxm:impala ownership. Configuring Kerberos and TLS/SSL ensures access authenticity and
   protects connections to your data.

Configuring KerberosWorkload XM must be able to create Phoenix tables in data storage. If you         are installing Workload XM in a Kerberized environment, it must be able to         securely create these tables.Configuring TLSEnable secure connections for data transfers and user access with either the Transport     Layer Security (TLS) protocol or the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, which ensures access     authenticity and securely protects your data.
