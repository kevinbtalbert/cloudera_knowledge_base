  If problems still exist, contact Cloudera support.


Failure Creating a Phoenix SchemaMapping a Phoenix schema to a HBase namespace enables multitenancy. Before running a   Phoenix job you must verify that namespace mapping is enabled in the HBase safety valve. Once   enabled, tables that are created with the Phoenix schema are mapped to the HBase   namespace.Incorrect Installation Parcel PlacementAdding the Workload XM installation parcels in the wrong directory on the         Cloudera Management Server host causes distribution and activation issues. The Workload XM installation parcel files must reside in the             /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo directory.
