Upgrading to the 2.3.0 version of Workload XM
Steps for upgrading to the 2.3.0 version of Workload XM.
Describes the pre tasks and steps for upgrading to Workload XM version
            2.3.0.

These steps assume that you have:
Scheduled the upgrade and informed your users of the Workload XM
                        service interruption. 
Verified that your Workload XM cluster is running a supported
                        version of Cloudera Manager and the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) and that
                        your Workload clusters are running a supported version of Cloudera Manager
                        and Cloudera Platform.
Recorded the Cloudera Manager host name of the server that contains an
                        installation of Workload XM, as this value is required during
                        upgrading. tipLog in to Cloudera Manager
                            and record the name of the host running the Cloudera Manager
                        UI.
Downloaded the 2.3.0 version of the Workload XM installation
                        parcel and checksum from the Cloudera Downloads website.
Downloaded the 2.3.0 version of the Workload XM installation CSD
                        (.jar) file from the Cloudera Downloads website.
If upgrading from a 2.1.x release version of Workload XM,
                        verified that there are no remaining messages in the ZooKeeper queue. 
In a terminal log in to a host running ZooperKeeper and list the
                                current queues by running the following
                                command:/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/zookeeper/bin/zkCli.sh -server [zk_server]:2181 ls /wxm/onprem/zkqueueThe
                                    following terminal output is an example of a current queue
                                    output:
                                    HiveAudit, HiveHistoryProtobuf, HiveOnMrTable, ImpalaQueryProfile, LlapHistoryProtobuf, MrJhist, MrTaskLog, OozieWorkflow, Pse, SdxDetails, SparkEventLog, SparkTaskLog, TezHistoryProtobuf, YarnApp, YarnAppMetrics, sigmaadb-broadcast, upload-processing-update-queue
Verify that all the queues are empty by running the
                                following:for q_n in HiveAudit HiveHistoryProtobuf HiveOnMrTable ImpalaQueryProfile LlapHistoryProtobuf MrJhist MrTaskLog OozieWorkflow Pse SdxDetails SparkEventLog SparkTaskLog TezHistoryProtobuf YarnApp YarnAppMetrics sigmaadb-broadcast upload-processing-update-queue
  do
    echo $q_n: $(/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/zookeeper/bin/zkCli.sh -server [zk_server]:2181 stat -w /wxm/onprem/zkqueue/${q_n} | grep "numChildren")
  done
Verify that all the count values are 0.
If there are messages in the queue, do the following:
Stop the DBUS services, which stops any new incoming
                                        data.
Allow Workload XM to finish processing any
                                        existing messages.
Stop any remaining components.


Stopped the Workload XM service and its services.



Verify that the Workload XM Service and its services are stopped.
                

Do the following:


In a terminal, SSH into the Cloudera Manager host server.


Copy the downloaded parcel (.parcel) and its checksum (.sha) file to
                            the /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo directory of the Cloudera
                            Manager Server on the Workload XM on-premises cluster.


Copy the downloaded CSD (.jar) file to the
                                opt/cloudera/csd directory of the Cloudera Manager
                            Server on the Workload XM on-premises cluster.



In the /opt/cloudera/parcel-repo directory, set the ownership
                    of the parcel and sha files to cloudera-scm:cloudera-scm.
                

In the /opt/cloudera/csd directory, set the ownership of the
                    CSD .jar file to cloudera-scm:cloudera-scm. 

In a supported web browser on the Workload XM on-premises cluster,
                    log in to Cloudera Manager.

In Cloudera Manager, select Clusters,
                        Parcels, and then
                    Distribute.
In the list of parcels, the latest version appears with a gray Distribute
                    label. 

Activate the Workload XM installation files by selecting
                        Activate Only. Do not restart. 

From the Cloudera Manager Host, restart the Cloudera Manager Server by entering
                    the following:

service cloudera-scm-server restart


Navigate to the Workload XM service in the Cloudera Manager UI and
                    then from the Actions menu do the following: 

importantUnless stated, all the following
                        steps must be performed, as the results of each action is required by Workload XM and its services. Redoing an
                            Actions step that may have been completed in
                        another upgrade does not harm the upgrade, whereas skipping an
                            Actions step when the component has not been
                        created or upgraded could cause issues.



Depending on the Workload XM release version you are
                            upgrading from, run the commands to create the required directories in
                            HDFS on the Workload XM cluster as follows:


If upgrading from a 2.1.0, 2.1.3, 2.2.0, or a 2.2.1 release
                                    version of Workload XM, select each of the
                                        Create... Directory actions to create the
                                    following directories: 
auto_action_audit
cloudera-dbus 
cloudera-sigma-olap 
cloudera-sigma-olap-impala 
cloudera-sigma-partial-pse 
cloudera-sigma-pse-extended 
cloudera-sigma-sdx-payloads 
cluster_events
cluster_metrics 
hive_on_mr_table 
impala_query 
pse_root 
yarn_app_metrics 

If upgrading from a 2.2.2 release version of Workload XM, select Create the
                                        cluster-events Directory.




If upgrading from a 2.1.0, 2.1.3, 2.2.0, or 2.2.1 release version of
                                Workload XM, add a Shared Data Experience (SDX) role by
                            doing the following:


From the Actions menu, select
                                        Add Role Instances. 
In the SDX server field of the
                                        Assign Roles panel, click
                                        Select hosts.
In the Host Selected dialog box, select the check box next to
                                    the hostname you require for the Workload XM SDX
                                    Server role and then click OK.




Run the command to upgrade the database schemas by selecting
                                Upgrade Database Schemas.


Restart the Workload XM service, by selecting
                                Restart.


As shown in the following image: 



Once all the roles have started, from the Actions menu,
                    select Repair Workload Database.

importantRebuilding the database may take up
                        to 45 minutes.
