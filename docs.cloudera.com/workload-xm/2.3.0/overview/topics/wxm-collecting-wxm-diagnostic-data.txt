Collecting Workload XM Diagnostic Metrics
When you enable Workload XM, the Cloudera Management Service starts the
  Telemetry Publisher role. Cloudera Telemetry Publisher collects and transmits metrics, as well as
  configuration and log files, from Impala, Oozie, Hive, YARN, and Spark services for jobs running
  on your clusters to Workload XM. Telemetry Publisher collects metrics for all the
  clusters that use Workload XM-enabled environments. 
Understanding the sources of information sent to Workload XM and how that data is
   redacted is described in the following topics.
