Table 1. Impala Statement Types

Statement Type
Description



ALTER TABLE
Changes the structure or properties of an existing table. For example,
                  ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PARTITION (month=1,
                  day=1);


ALTER VIEW
Changes the characteristics of a view. For example, ALTER VIEW
                    view_name AS SELECT * FROM
                  table_name;


COMPUTE STATS
Collects information about volume and distribution data in a table and all
              associated columns and partitions. For example, COMPUTE STATS
                    table_name;


CREATE DATABASE
Creates a new database. For example, CREATE DATABASE
                    database_name;


CREATE FUNCTION
Creates a user-defined function (UDF), which you can use to implement custom
              logic during SELECT or INSERT operations. For
                example, CREATE FUNCTION function_name LOCATION
                    'hdfs_path_to_jar'
                  SYMBOL='class_name';


CREATE ROLE
Creates a role to which privileges can be granted. After privileges are granted
              to the role, then the role can be assigned to users. A user who has been assigned a
              role is only able to exercise the privileges of that role. For example,
                  CREATE ROLE role_name;


CREATE TABLE
Creates a new table and specifies its characteristics. For example,
                  CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name
data_type) PARTITIONED BY (column_name
data_type) LOCATION
                'hdfs_path';


CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
Creates a new table with the output from a SELECT statement. For example,
                  CREATE TABLE table_name AS SELECT * FROM
                    table_3;


CREATE TABLE LIKE
Creates a new table by cloning an existing table. For example, CREATE
                  TABLE table_name_2 LIKE
                  table_name_1;


CREATE VIEW
Creates a shorthand abbreviation (alias) for a query. A view is a purely logical
              construct with no physical data behind it. For example, CREATE VIEW
                    view_name AS SELECT * FROM
                  table_name;


DDL
The Data Definition Language, whose SQL statements change the structure of the
              database by creating, deleting, or modifying schema objects, such as databases,
              tables, and views. For example, CREATE TABLE;


DESCRIBE DB
Displays metadata about a database. For example, DESCRIBE
                    database_name;


DESCRIBE TABLE
Displays metadata about a table. For example, DESCRIBE
                    table_name;


DML
The Data Manipulation Language, whose SQL statements modify the data stored in
              tables. For example, INSERT;


DROP DATABASE
Removes a database from the system. For example, DROP
                    database_name;


DROP FUNCTION
Removes a user-defined function (UDF) so that it is not available for execution
              during Impala SELECT or INSERT operations. For example, DROP FUNCTION
                    function_name;


DROP STATS
Removes the specified statistics from a table or a partition. For example,
                  DROP STATS table_name;


DROP TABLE
Removes a table and its underlying HDFS data files for internal tables, although
              not for external tables. For example, DROP TABLE
                    table_name;


DROP VIEW
Removes the specified view. Because a view is purely a logical construct with no
              physical data behind it, DROP VIEW only involves changes to metadata in the metastore
              database, not any data files in HDFS. For example, DROP VIEW
                    view_name;


EXPLAIN
Generates a query execution plan for a specific query. For example,
                  EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table_1;


GRANT PRIVILEGE
Grants privileges on specified objects to groups. For example, GRANT
                    privilege_name ON TABLE table_name TO
                    role_name;


GRANT ROLE
Grants roles on specified objects to groups. For example, GRANT ROLE
                    role_nameTO GROUP
              group_name;


LOAD
Loads data from an external data source into a table. For example,
                  LOAD DATA INPATH 'hdfs_file_or_directory_path' INTO
                  TABLE tablename;


N/A
These queries failed due to syntax errors and Impala is not
              able to identify a query type for them.


REFRESH
Reloads the metadata for a table from the metastore database, performs an
              incremental reload of the file, and blocks the metadata from the HDFS NameNode.
                REFRESH is used to avoid inconsistencies between Impala and
              external metadata sources, specifically the Hive Metastore and the NameNode. For
                example, REFRESH table_name;


REVOKE PRIVILEGE
Revokes privileges on a specified object from groups. For example,
                  REVOKE privilege_name ON TABLE
                    table_name;


REVOKE ROLE
Revokes roles on a specified object from groups. For example, REVOKE
                  ROLE role_name FROM GROUP
                  group_name;


SELECT
Requests data from a data source. For example, SELECT * FROM
                    table_1;


SET
Sets configuration properties or session parameters. For example, SET
                  compression_codec=snappy;


SHOW COLUMN STATS
Displays the column statistics for a specified table. For example,
                  SHOW COLUMN STATS table_name;


SHOW CREATE TABLE
Displays the CREATE TABLE statement used to reproduce the current structure of a
              table. For example, SHOW CREATE TABLE
                  table_name;


SHOW DATABASES
Displays all available databases. For example, SHOW
                  DATABASES;


SHOW FILES
Displays the files that constitute a specified table or a partition within a
              partitioned table. For example, SHOW FILES IN
                  table_name;


SHOW FUNCTIONS
Displays user-defined functions (UDFs) or user-defined aggregate functions
              (UDAFs) that are associated with a particular database. For example, SHOW
                  FUNCTIONS IN database_name; or SHOW AGGREGATE
                  FUNCTIONS IN database_name;


SHOW GRANT ROLE
Lists all the grants for the specified role name. For example, SHOW
                  GRANT ROLE role_name;


SHOW ROLES
Displays all available roles. For example, SHOW
              ROLES;


SHOW TABLES
Displays the names of tables. For example, SHOW
              TABLES;


SHOW TABLE STATS
Displays the statistics for a table. For example, SHOW TABLE STATS
                    table_name;


TRUNCATE TABLE
Removes the data from an Impala table, while keeping the table. For example,
                  TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;


USE
Switches the current session to a specified database. For example, USE
                    database_name;
