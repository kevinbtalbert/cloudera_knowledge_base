Workload XM Reference Overview
This section provides additional information that support the features and functions in
      Workload XM. 
The following topics provide descriptions of health checks for jobs that involve Hive,
      MapReduce, Oozie, and Spark, and descriptions of health checks for workloads that involve
      Impala. In addition to health check descriptions, these topics also provide recommendations
      for addressing the conditions that trigger health checks and information about a query's
      state, type, and potential SQL issues that are identified by Workload XM. 

Hive, MapReduce, Oozie, and Spark Health ChecksLists the health check tests that are performed by Workload XM at the end of     a Hive, MapReduce, Oozie, or Spark job. They provide job performance insights, such as the     amount of data the job processed and how long the job took. You can find the health checks on     the Hive, MapReduce, Oozie, or Spark engine's Jobs page in the Health       Check list. Impala Health ChecksLists the Impala health check tests that are performed by Workload XM at the     end of an Apache Impala job. They provide performance and query insights, such as pointing out     queries that may be causing bottlenecks. You can find the Impala health checks on the Impala     Queries page in the Health Check list.Impala Query StatusLists the query states for workloads that use Apache Impala. You can find the status of     your query on either the Summary page in the Trend widget or on the Impala Queries page     in the Status list.Impala Statement TypesLists the SQL statement types for workloads that use Apache Impala. You can find the     statement types on the Impala Queries page in the Type list. For more detailed     information about these types of SQL statements, click the Related       Information link below.Potential SQL IssuesLists the most common SQL mistakes made during statement creation that are identified     as potential issues by Workload XM. The Health Check list, on the engineâ€™s Queries     page, categorizes the health tests. For example, for Hive, MapReduce, Oozie, and Spark engines,     the Insufficient Partitioning and Many Materialized       Columns health checks, test for query and schema issues.Workload XM Cluster Services Health ChecksLists the ZooKeeper health check tests that are performed on your Workload XM cluster services. They provide processing performance insights, such as messaging queue     bottlenecks and delays that can cause workload scheduling issues. You can find the ZooKeeper     Queue and Processing Timers metric charts in the Workload XM Charts Library tab and the following Health checks on the Workload XM related cluster service's page in the Health Tests     section.
