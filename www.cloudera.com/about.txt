 Discover Cloudera Data Platform






















Meet our leadership
Cloudera was founded in 2008 by some of the brightest minds at Silicon Valley’s leading companies, including Google, Yahoo!, Oracle, and Facebook. And in 2011, 24 engineers from the original Hadoop team at Yahoo! spun out to form Hortonworks. Both companies, who joined forces in January 2019, were founded on the belief that open source, open standards, and open markets are best. This belief remains central to our values, evidenced by our significant investments in engineers and committers working with the open source community. Today, Cloudera has offices around the globe and is headquartered in Silicon Valley, California.
Our leadership      Our board











 






 
      
      
      Our Mission In Action: Cloudera in the Community.
      























Cloudera’s mission is to make data and analytics easy and accessible for everyone: by improving access to skills, software and mentorship we are increasing diversity in the technology sector and driving global
economic sustainability. 











 








 










Fresh Squeeze on Data
In order to make complex STEM concepts less abstract and more relatable for 8- to 12-year-olds, we partnered with the education company ReadyAI, and created a downloadable children's book, A Fresh Squeeze on Data.
Since launch, A Fresh Squeeze on Data has been translated into 7 languages, downloaded over 3 million times and implemented in schools over 300,000 times using the complimentary lesson plan.










 



 







 











 



 







Boys & Girls Club
In partnership with Boys & Girls Clubs of Middle Tennessee and Boys & Girls Clubs of the Peninsula, Cloudera launched the Teen Accelerator program, with a vision to work with high school youth in underserved areas to provide them with skills utilized in the corporate workplace and provide them with resources that they may not otherwise have access to. This program consists of three phases, beginning with online learning, progressing to mentorship by Cloudera employees, and ending with a summer internship at Cloudera.
