ACI Worldwide (ACI) powers electronic payments for more than 5,100 organizations around the world. More than 1,000 of the largest financial institutions and intermediaries as well as thousands of leading merchants globally rely on ACI to execute $14 trillion each day in payments and securities. The company provides real-time, immediate payments capabilities and enables the industry’s most complete omni-channel payments experience.
Challenge
The financial services industry encounters a variety of unique challenges with data. These companies not only need the ability to process huge amounts of data from traditional and non-traditional sources, but they also need to ensure the data is secure. Without the proper data, the company is unable to make informed decisions on how to best serve customers.
Solution
Hortonworks provides a key component of ACI’s Big Data solution, enabling the company to make real-time decisions about transactions flowing through its Universal Payments framework. Hortonworks Connected Platforms gave ACI more flexibility with how data flows and more consistency in how data is stored.
Results
These solutions are much more cost effective due to the open source model. The platform brought a cheaper cost of ownership and a reduction of cost per transaction for processing. ACI’s Big Data initiative was sparked out of the opportunity of fraud detection. The company has several fraud products that collect information for financial institutions and merchants. All this data is captured, processed, and used to make real-time business decisions. This helps the company detect possible threats and ensure the data is secure.
