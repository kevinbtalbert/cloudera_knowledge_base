Santander Group is a leading retail and commercial bank founded and based in Spain. Ranked as the 1st bank in the euro zone by market capitalization, the organization runs a variety of diversified businesses around the world, with a clear focus on digital transformation. With an array of new digital solutions, Santander Group is setting the benchmark for technology innovation for the best customer experience.
 
Challenge
The bank could no longer process the vast amount of data being generated reliably and within reasonable timelines. The Group was on the lookout for a scalable big data infrastructure to fuel growth.
 
Solution
The Group deployed Cloudbreak, part of HDP, along with open source tools such as Spark, Nifi, and Kafka to power its hybrid data architecture.
 
Results
The Group has achieved a consistent overview of data across the organization, reduced infrastructure cost by 20x, and a 10x faster time to market for applications.




Cloudera professional services has been instrumental as we began our cloud journey. By setting up brand new interfaces and extending already existing ones, the team has been able to address all the various requirements needed for the data lake to run on our IaaS.
-Javier Nieto Centeno, Architecture & Innovation IT Expert, Santander Group
