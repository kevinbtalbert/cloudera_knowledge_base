Cox Automotive: Bringing Value and Insight into Data from 20 Previously Separate Brands


















Cox Automotive: Bringing Value and Insight into Data from 20 Previously Separate Brands















Cox Automotive is bringing together data from its 20 brands, including AutoTrader.com and Kelley Blue Book, to gain new insights across the automotive lifecycle and introduce new products and services that wouldn’t be possible otherwise.









 

















    
    
      Overview
      




Cox Automotive is a leading provider of products and services for automotive dealers and car buyers. The company unites 20 brands, including AutoTrader.com, Kelley Blue Book, Manheim, NextGear Capital, and vAuto, to help transform the way people buy and sell cars. As Cox Automotive was formed, executives sought to implement an enterprise data strategy that would enable the company to deliver new customer experiences using rich automotive data from across its brands.
When the 20 brands came together, it was not possible to bring all the data together in the traditional environments such as Netezza or SQL Server.
 





    
    
      Solution
      




Today, the company has adopted a Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub (EDH) strategy totaling more than 1 petabyte (PB) of data and incorporating 200 million rows of data daily.








As we've moved to Cloudera’s platform, powered by Apache Hadoop, we have been able to eliminate the challenges we faced with our legacy environments. We can acquire the data quickly and bring it directly to the analysts across the company very quickly. We can also avoid the pain of building extract, transform, load (ETL) processes and structuring all the data in potentially multiple environments. Now, everyone across multiple business units can have access to the same datasets, and analyze them with the tools and skills they already use.”
Scott Salter, Vice President, Enterprise Data Services, Cox Automotive




    
    
      Impact: Lower TCO, Real-Time Insights, Improved Inventory Management
      




With Cloudera, the team reduced the total cost of ownership of its data environment by about 50 percent per terabyte (TB). But the real value they see is from new products and capabilities. The new EDHs are helping the company provide auto dealers with new insight to help them better manage their inventory, with a broad view to industry supply and consumer demand.Additionally, using a Spark Streaming application, Cox Automotive is now able to offer real-time updates on how ad campaigns impact searches and other activity on specific vehicles, providing important insights to advertisers.








The biggest value that we'll get is throughput on our data from an analytics and product development standpoint. On the inventory management side, we understand what cars are for sale in the market and we understand the consumer demand in that market for those cars. By connecting this data, we very easily see if there’s too much supply based on the demand, and we can provide pricing and sales recommendations to help dealers get the best value from a particular car in the quickest amount of time. When we show our analysts, executives, and IT staff what’s possible, we can see the light bulbs going off.
Scott Salter, Vice President, Enterprise Data Services, Cox Automotive
