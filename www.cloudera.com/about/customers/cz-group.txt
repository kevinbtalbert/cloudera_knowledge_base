With a simple mission to deliver affordable and accessible healthcare insurance services for everyone, CZ Group is a Netherlands-based institution with 3.8 million policyholders, 8 Service Offices and various consultation locations across the country. Formed in 1930, the group helps consumers receive the best possible care at a stable low premium whilst delivering quality, control and guarantee availability, now and in the future.
Challenge
Processing data has always been a significant challenge for companies operating in the insurance domain. With a large customer base of nearly four million policy owners in the country, the group’s data infrastructure was preventing the team from adequately processing hundreds of millions of data points coming from its users on a daily basis, due to organizational silos and the lack of a modern infrastructure to analyze information at scale. Current systems were preventing insurers from analyzing both semi-structured and unstructured data, something health insurance institutions deal with on a regular basis.
In addition to acting as the main asset for predicting and addressing customer behavior, data was playing a crucial role in the realms of fraud detection and demand generation, two of the strongest pillars of any institution offering insurance products. Legacy data infrastructures were preventing the group from making informed predictions as to where customer demand would generate from, as well as developing modern algorithms to predict fraud.
Solution
With the increasing importance to rely on data to remain competitive from a business perspective, CZ was on the lookout for an analytics solution able to sustain its journey towards becoming fully data-driven, as well as delivering a superior experience from a customer standpoint. The group decided to standardize its analytics capabilities on Cloudera.
"We built a solution to address the need for speed across our call centers and provide our teams with timely insights that would help them deliver the best service. The new platform is offering some of the most advanced data tools, resulting in faster action across our operation centers, better business forecasting as well as improved employee training resulting from customer interactions,” continued Hasaart. “The Cloudera platform has proved to be an invaluable tool within our business, enabling the group to obtain a centralized view of our datasets leading to increased agility and compliance."
Results
Tangible benefits have been recorded around the ability to process data in real time, which has increased the speed at which medical treatment can be authorized. Customer communication is delivered more rapidly, with superior quality due to the large amount of information available at the customer representative’s fingertips and thanks to a smarter knowledge database providing the right information at the right time to the employees.
With the ability to ingest data at scale from heterogeneous sources in real-time, CZ has been able to align with organizational KPIs by analyzing customer sentiments, gaining unprecedented visibility into its customer base and achieving faster decision making.




The Cloudera platform has proved to be an invaluable tool within our business, enabling the group to obtain a centralized view of our datasets leading to increased agility and compliance.
-Fleur Hasaart, Data Science Manager, CZ
