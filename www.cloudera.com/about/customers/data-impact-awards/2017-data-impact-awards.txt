Business Impact







Instrument Your Business (two-way tie)











Deutsche Telekom IT GmbH
The Deutsche Telekom big data platform, driven by Cloudera, integrates and analyzes network, CRM and customer care data to improve asset monitoring, maintenance, customer satisfaction and fraud detection. Advanced analytics implemented in the customer services area is on track to increase efficiency and grow revenue by tens of million EUR group-wise annually. Significant improvements have been registered in prepaid-conversion or retention campaigns. The fraud detection tool, implemented in T-Mobile Czech Republic, helps fight fraud scenarios like International Revenue Share Fraud and Sim Box Fraud. With new advanced automation techniques, the fraud tool dramatically decreased detection time, lowered costs and made products safer for our customers. In the operational area, machine learning was key in decreasing the number of production incidents by almost 50%.

UBS (nominated by Cognizant)
UBS’s Data Refinery provides users with a powerful ecosystem for greater business efficiency. A Financial Advisor Scorecard provides a 360-degree analysis of FA activities, resulting in better performance and increased revenue. Fraud detection and anti-money laundering insights have helped analysts review millions of transactions daily. UBS worked with Cognizant and Cloudera to create a data refinery that delivers a unified view of enterprise data. The platform generates insights that have led to new business opportunities and enables users to consume data with confidence thanks to centralized governance.

Secure Your Business











Western Union (nominated by Streamsets)
Western Union moves billions of dollars each year for consumers and businesses and continues to innovate, developing new ways to send money through digital, mobile, and retail channels. Real-time analysis of more than 14 million transactions daily gives Western Union an edge in its work to deliver the speed, simplicity and security customers demand. Now, analysts can quickly drill down into potential issues – such as sudden spikes in credit card authorizations – to evaluate risk and prevent losses. Western Union uses Cloudera and StreamSets to identify potentially fraudulent activity much more quickly and with its real-time enterprise data hub, Western Union can rapidly uncover and investigate anomalies to help stop fraud.

Customer Insight











Credit Suisse (nominated by Cognizant) 
Credit Suisse’s Predictive Analytics platform has driven significant productivity saving – nearly 10 hours a month per analyst – and has provided new insight into investment strategies for clients. The platform currently analyzes more than 54 TB of data from Credit Suisse databases, external data feeds, and public data sets, with two TB being added daily. Being able to run the platform on commodity hardware enabled Credit Suisse to reduce total cost of ownership by 38 percent. Credit Suisse worked with Cognizant and Cloudera to create a Predictive Analytics platform that delivers targeted recommendations for trading ideas, research material, investment strategies and much more.

Technical Impact







Cloud Pioneers (two-way tie)











Air New Zealand (nominated by Enterprise IT)
Air New Zealand operates a significant number of international flights each year to around 50 airports worldwide. Although network scheduling is a complex and traditionally manual process, the airline worked with Enterprise IT and deployed Cloudera on Amazon Web Services to review extensive flight data and uncover patterns which could help the airline to optimise its flight schedules. Air New Zealand has used this data to better manage airport take-off and landing times, which has in turn increased the reliability of the schedule for customers and grown revenue opportunities through new flight connections.
 
Celgene (nominated by Deloitte Consulting)
Celgene’s modern on-demand cloud-based architecture enabled it to leapfrog its current BI and advanced analytics capabilities and dramatically improve speed to delivery of actionable insights. As a result, its data scientists can find critical correlations much more quickly, which has been instrumental for improving time to market, increasing its market reach and for reducing overall costs across the value chain. Celgene, which manufactures drug therapies for cancer and inflammatory disorders, worked with Deloitte to achieve a 99 percent savings in process run times for Real World Patient data analysis and a 70 percent reduction in operating costs by migrating legacy workloads via Cloudera Enterprise.







 



Innovators in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence











Thomson Reuters
Thomson Reuters helps organizations separate fact from rumor on Twitter and uncover breaking events in milliseconds with Reuters Tracer. This bot journalist in training, via Cloudera, analyzes 13 million tweets daily to determine if an event is true and newsworthy, and what its scope and impact is. Reuters Tracer has broken over 50 major news stories, including the shooting in San Bernardino, California, the Brussels bombings, and the 2016 earthquake in Ecuador. These early alerts have given Reuters journalists anywhere from an eight- to a 60-minute head start over other news organizations. Reuters Tracer also helps businesses keep pace with a rapidly changing news landscape, alerting customers when market-moving events are reported.

Special Impact







Modern Architecture for Big Results











TD Bank Group
TD Bank Group reduced data management costs by 60 percent and storage costs by 98 percent per gigabyte with its new data lake and analytics platform, powered by Cloudera. But more importantly, the platform made possible Griffin, an easy-to-use API framework that encapsulates the complexities of common model development tasks and saves thousands of lines of complex code. TD Bank’s data lake and analytics platform is used by more than 25 corporate units for everything from propensity modelling to sentiment analysis. The bank’s API framework, Griffin, opens the opportunity for analysts across the bank to build new machine learning and artificial intelligence use cases without in-depth machine learning expertise. It also helps shorten development and delivery timelines for big data projects from months to weeks.







 



Rookie of the Year











GlaxoSmithKline (nominated by Anaconda, AtScale, Cloudwick Technologies, Kinetica, Streamsets, Tamr, and Zoomdata)
GlaxoSmithKline’s Big Data Information Platform delivers a holistic view of all data within the company’s R&D division for the first time in the company’s history. In just 11 months, the team evaluated and fully deployed the new platform, working with Cloudera, Anaconda, AtScale, Cloudwick Technologies, Kinetica, StreamSets, Tamr, Trifacta, and Zoomdata. By gaining greater efficiency and new insights across its many R&D processes, GlaxoSmithKline expects to bring new drugs to market much more quickly and less expensively to help patients. The platform combines more than five petabytes of data across more than 2,100 silos to give scientists an immense analytic advantage and actionable data-driven insights.

Societal Impact











Cerner
Cerner’s HealtheIntent℠ gathers and analyzes millions of gigabytes of data that transcends numerous systems to help caregivers shift from reactive care to proactive health and prevention. HealtheIntent℠, which leverages Cloudera, gives providers the insights they need to deliver high-quality care to patients. For example, the platform provides proactive alerts if a patient experiences early onset conditions of potentially life-threatening illnesses. The impact can be measured in both dollars and lives.
