Business Impact







 












Grow Your Business






Commonwealth Bank of Australia
Commonwealth Bank of Australia worked with Cloudera to implement a modern data platform with an AI-powered customer decisioning layer that dramatically improves how the bank interacts with its customers. The bank brought together 27 billion data points and uses AI to understand the next-best conversation 21 million times each weekday. The bank coordinates all interactions via its branch network and Australian-based contact centers and presents it back through digital channels, ATMs, email and direct mail. It helps facilitate interactions as simple as helping a customer complete an application or update their contact details, for which CBA has completed 200,000 in the past year.

Protect your Business






Voya Financial (nominated by AtScale, Cognizant, Collibra, Experian, Oracle, Real-Time Technology, StreamSets, and Syncsort)
Voya Financial prevented millions of dollars of fraudulent transactions by deploying predictive analytic capabilities on Cloudera. Seeing an increase in account takeover fraud attempts across the industry, Voya Financial’s digital and security teams collaborated to better monitor and prevent fraudulent attempts on customer funds. Using a modern data platform from Cloudera and partner solutions from AtScale, Cognizant, Collibra, Experian, Oracle, Real-Time Technology, StreamSets, and Syncsort, Voya improved the speed, performance, and quality of fraud analytics—reducing its risk for a wide variety of fraud including account takeovers, application fraud, claim fraud, rebating, theft, and overbilling and kickbacks.

Connect Products and Services






Toshiba Memory Corporation
Toshiba Memory Corporation is revolutionizing flash memory semiconductor manufacturing using Cloudera to detect defective parts earlier in the manufacturing process and identify the root cause of defects several times faster. In the semiconductor industry, increasing the yield rate is critical because a mere one percent improvement can result in significant cost reductions. Toshiba Memory’s ability to apply machine learning on petabytes of sensor and apparatus data enabled detection of small defects and inspection of all products instead of a sampling inspection.  This helps Toshiba Memory increase product quality and continue to deliver high-quality products to its customers.

Technical Impact







 












Enterprise Machine Learning






AbbVie
AbbVie, one of the world’s largest global research and development pharmaceutical companies, established a big data platform to provide end-to-end operations visibility, agility, and responsiveness. AbbVie’s platform uses analytics and machine learning, including natural language processing, deep learning, and unsupervised learning, to proactively identify issues and opportunities. Some of the company’s use cases include responding to demand variability, improving pharmaceutical product performance, creating a more insightful search capability, and detecting temperature anomalies during shipments. Connecting internal, external and unconventional data (such as sensor and video data) helps the organization create an end-to-end product performance strategy, while common governance and security enable self-service capabilities for business users.

Modern Data Warehousing






Barclays (nominated together with BlueData)
Barclays’ data warehouse ingests data from more than 300 sources and runs thousands of jobs daily. With its warehouse transformation initiative, Barclays is using Cloudera to bring near-real-time data feeds into its warehouse. As a result, Barclays can now make instant decisions on customer offers, down from 14 days. It also gained real-time status on all branches and ATMs in the UK and expanded fraud monitoring to include billions of transactions.

Cloud Success






FairVentures Lab (nominated by Cazena)
FairVentures’ cloud-based Data Lab enables analytic teams across its affiliate companies to test, model, and collaborate on analytic use cases—no small feat in a complicated, multi-national, and highly-regulated financial corporation. FairVentures’ Data Lab improves data access and availability to drive innovation and analytic discoveries by actuaries and data scientists. The speed of deployment, SaaS-like usability, and powerful features made the Data Lab an overnight success in an industry used to slow-moving, multi-month projects. And business leaders report that Data Lab capabilities help them recruit new analytics and data science talent, critical in an industry with an aging workforce that is heading for retirement. The lab uses Cloudera running on Cazena’s Fully-Managed Big Data as a Service on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Special Impact







 












Rookie of the Year






Carrefour Spain
Retailer Carrefour Spain gained a 360-degree customer view and can now manage stock in real time using a modern data platform from Cloudera to power a variety of workloads.  In just 12 months, Carrefour Spain obtained self-service analytic capabilities that enable business users to more quickly calculate sales indicators and monetize data. The company can also minimize the gap between model development and automation, detect stock mismatches between systems in real time, more quickly detect point-of-sale anomalies, and identify customer propensity to particular products to optimize coupon issuance and redemption.

Greentube
Greentube is transforming the gamer experience using Cloudera on Microsoft Azure to bring together and analyze user behavior in real time for more targeted campaigns, recommendations, and personalized gaming experiences. Previously, Greentube faced numerous constraints created by data silos and lack of real-time analytic capabilities. Now, the company’s Marketing and Fraud teams are capturing insight they couldn’t before. This insight led to over €1 million in incremental revenue through subscription upgrades from targeted in-game offers, a two percent revenue increase from game recommendations in one cohort, and a 20 percent load reduction, which reduced operational costs, with detection and resolution of a bot network playing on one casino platform in demo mode.

Societal Impact






ADP
ADP has an unmatched dataset on the U.S. workforce. Teaming with Cloudera, it’s using data science, machine learning, and AI in new ways to help employers close the pay equity gap. According to the ADP Research Institute, on average, men make 28 percent more than women across all industries. Within the financial services and healthcare fields, or when you consider race, the difference is even more pronounced. Leveraging Cloudera, ADP can give employers unique insight into their workforce to identify where pay gaps potentially exist. And, drawing from anonymized data from over 30 million employees, they can help employers ensure that compensation is not only equitable but competitive.

IQVIA
IQVIA, The Human Data Science Company, is using big data and advanced analytics to revolutionize clinical research and positively impact the lives of millions of people.  While much work is being done worldwide to reduce healthcare costs, improve access to care, and deliver new treatments, the progress has been slow. IQVIA is re-envisioning healthcare using a data-driven approach. IQVIA’s platform brings together more than 2PB of data from 250 data warehouses worldwide and, and with the help of Cloudera technologies, provides analytic insights that can drive dramatic change in healthcare—from helping pharmaceutical companies understand market need in seconds instead of hours or days, to enabling clinicians to identify qualified patients for clinical trials in minutes. It’s giving patients earlier access to potentially lifesaving treatments, and helping reduce both drug costs and time to market to bring life-saving drugs to market faster and less expensively.

Business Transformation






United Overseas Bank Group – UOB
United Overseas Bank (UOB) has a richer understanding of its customers’ preferences and can make their banking experience simple, safer and reliable using technology. In harnessing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, the bank is enhancing its operational performance. Working with Cloudera, UOB  developed a big data solution to give various groups in the Bank faster access to relevant and quality data for analyses. Different business functions, such as compliance and retail banking, can draw on the insights generated to optimize their business processes and design distinctive customer experiences.
