Docomo Digital is transforming mobile commerce and increasing conversion rates by 20 percent with Cloudera.


DOCOMO Digital is an innovative payment solution provider and the European-based operation of NTT DOCOMO, a global technology innovator from Japan. The company works with more than 200 mobile telecom operators and over 300 global and local payment methods across 35 countries, processing more than €3 billion in transactions annually.
Challenge
Through its digital payment services and digital content and marketing solutions, DOCOMO Digital helps merchants and service providers enhance the customer experience and increase conversion rates across digital devices. To support this work, the company needed to better analyze each customer’s journey, categorizing user behavior and creating user profiles for improved campaign targeting and fraud detection.




Our data is growing around 40 terabytes [TB] a year and we needed a platform to support this growth and help us understand what our users are doing in real time.
-Ruben Manzano, Technology Director, Digital Marketing and Big Data, DOCOMO Digital



Solution
By implementing a Cloudera enterprise data hub, DOCOMO Digital can apply big data processing, data analytics, and machine learning algorithms to create solutions that help companies increase the success of mobile commerce initiatives. The company’s first areas of focus have included helping mobile marketers increase conversion rates through more accurate A/B testing and improving fraud detection in mobile commerce.
“The streaming data processing has been the most relevant part to make these projects happen,” said Carmine Giordano, manager, Database Administration, DOCOMO Digital. “Thanks to Cloudera, it has been really easy to build an architecture with optimal performance and we can create more efficient machine learning algorithms with all our data in an enterprise data hub.”
Implementation
Security is a primary concern in mobile commerce, and DOCOMO Digital executives needed to confirm that its platform provided the strong security controls necessary to meet regulatory requirements, such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and company standards.
“Cloudera Enterprise is fully compliant with PCI standards,” said Carmine Giordano. “Security on Cloudera is well structured and covers all our needs for strong data security standards. Cloudera Support and Cloudera Navigator complete the reasons we chose Cloudera over other Hadoop solutions.”
Results
According to Ruben Manzano, DOCOMO Digital can now exploit its data to its fullest potential, essential in the company’s ability to achieve its goal to connect five billion mobile users by 2020.
For example, the company can now detect about 95 percent of fraud attempts, a huge step in helping it reduce fraud in mobile commerce.
Additionally, real-time insight into customer behavior has enabled DOCOMO Digital to provide A/B solutions that dramatically increase conversion rates. “We increased our conversion rate by 20 percent,” said Ruben Manzano. “Just one percent increase can make a real difference, so a 20 percent increase, as we did in this particular use case with machine learning, shows the possibilities that we can achieve across our business.”
