Emirates NBD is a leading banking Group in the UAE and a key participant in the global digital banking industry with over 90% of all financial transactions and requests conducted outside of its branches. Emirates NBD’s partnership with Cloudera focuses on building a world-class Enterprise Data Platform (EDP). By using big data in banking to provide data-driven analytics and operational intelligence, the bank aims to enhance the customer experience through deeper, more personalized customer insights.
Challenge
Emirates NBD embarked on a USD $270 million digital transformation to extend its competitive advantage across the Middle East and its expanding international operations. The bank knew that accelerating its digital capabilities and providing the right technology infrastructure for emerging innovation like Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning, required a superior information architecture for collecting, managing and analyzing the bank’s growing data sources across its seven trading entities.
Solution
Emirates NBD wanted to leverage the best technology in the market to custom-build its EDP.  The Cloudera platform provided a highly scalable EDP foundation with flexible architecture to store and analyze the bank’s growing data in a single, open source platform. This provided ease of integration with Emirates NBD’s systems and applications, with data rapidly moved in and out of the platform through bulk load processing. Emirates NBD also leveraged a data integration tool from Informatica, a Cloudera partner, to load data in batch mode.
Together, Cloudera and Informatica delivered a proven set of solutions for rapidly curating data into trusted information. Built-in big data governance and big data security made this comprehensive suite of management solutions fast, flexible, and enterprise-ready to turn big data into trusted insights.
Results
The EDP is expected to deliver a total benefit of USD $14 million over the next five years. This new world-class Enterprise Data Platform, built on Cloudera and leveraging Informatica, is now enabling instant customer and operational insight, plus fraud detection. All trusted data is available centrally and securely to users via the platform with automated reporting functionality. The big data enterprise platform enables an end-to-end digital transformation delivering innovation across the bank, and a personalized customer experience.




Today’s information-driven economy means data is one of our most critical assets. Aligned with our digital strategy, we are committed to harnessing the power of data to drive deep customer insight, accelerate our time-to-market for emerging digital innovation that is reliant on such data, and to leverage advanced analytics to enhance business performance.
-Abdulla Qassem, Group Chief Operating Officer, Emirates NBD
