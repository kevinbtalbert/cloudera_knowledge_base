Challenges
A financial services company based in Europe reached a roadblock with its existing data infrastructure. Its on-premises environment had critical use cases running on systems that were reaching their end-of-life (EOL) by mid-2021. The current platform was also lacking in key areas - missing AI, ML, and streaming capabilities while requiring long lead times to deploy new use cases.
Both production and testing/development were happening on the same platform, and it was unable to develop and support new use cases in a timely manner, which stifled innovation. This lack of scalability and inefficiency of the legacy environment prompted the IT board to issue a mandate for accelerating to a Cloud based architecture. The company wanted to productionize its environment as well as provide a Cloud based platform that would allow new use cases to be deployed.
This created a sense of urgency, as a solution needed to be established before the legacy platform hit EOL, not to mention staying on-premises would end up incurring a 20% higher cost over the next 3 years. The migration of critical workloads needed to be successful in short timescales.
Solutions
To address these challenges and adhere to the board’s mandate, this financial services organization turned to Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) on public cloud with Cloudera Machine Learning (CML). CDP Public Cloud provides all of the capabilities and flexibility needed to develop new use cases.
The company invested in a Success Package to secure and accelerate its journey to the cloud, which included Cloudera’s training, Professional Services (PS), and executive alignment and partnership with Accenture and Microsoft. This customer engaged PS to implement the Accelerated Cloud Execution (ACE) program. A series of white glove and tailored enablement sessions were provided with Cloudera product specialists across multiple areas in CDP. 
The pre-defined workshop sessions enabled, educated, and up-skilled the customer’s teams to extract business value with CDP, resulting in faster time to value through use case deployment.
Results
Through this new future proof data architecture, this financial services company will be able to support the IT Boards’ mandate and rapidly increase its innovation cycle. By enabling cloud adoption, use cases can be deployed in minutes rather than months and they have realized a  €800K capex saving on infrastructure. The company has already begun onboarding new CML use cases. They have started engagement teams to collaboratively plan and execute on critical timelines within the organization, focusing on skill development to accelerate company initiatives.
