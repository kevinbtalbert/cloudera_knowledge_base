Globe Telecom is enhancing customers’ mobile experiences, delivering relevant advertising with a modern analytic environment based on Cloudera.


Accounting for more than 50 percent of the Philippines’ mobile revenues, Globe Telecom leads the mobile market, while also generating one-third of the country’s fixed broadband revenues and enterprise data connections.
Challenge
“What we would like to do,” said Globe Telecom Chief Technology and Information Officer and Chief Strategy Officer Gil Genio, “is enable our customers to live a digital lifestyle—how they work and how they play—allowing them to have wonderful experiences supported by the company’s robust and pervasive mobile network.”
Globe Telecom’s mobile data volumes grew by 66 percent in 2017, reaching 600 petabytes (PB). However, consumer spending on mobile services isn’t increasing at the same rate. Globe Telecom must optimize investments, bundle product offerings, and deliver contextual advertisements that elicit the most response.  
Also, its traditional data warehousing infrastructure was expensive and couldn’t accommodate the speed or scale of Globe Telecom’s data.
Solution
Globe Telecom’s modern data management infrastructure, based on Cloudera, is helping the company enhance customers’ mobile experiences and deliver relevant advertising. Globe Telecom’s new analytical environment ingests massive volumes of real-time, granular network signal information and combines that with batch loads from billing systems, payments, and more. Organizations across the company, including Marketing, Credit, and Finance, benefit from direct access to the platform. 
Additionally, Globe has begun to leverage the Cloudera Data Platform to more effectively personalize the customer experience.




The Cloudera Data Platform running on AWS helps us manage our data, interpret analytics, and put those insights into action with customer segmentation so we can better tailor how our customers discover, buy and use our services
-Gil Genio, Chief Technology and Information Officer, Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Telecom



Results
"Cloudera is uniquely positioned to help us manage our data so we can get into the real core of our purpose, which is to more effectively market, to more effectively change the custom experience of a customer, and at the end of the day to make their mobile lifestyles even more effective," said Genio.
Today, Globe is leveraging analytics to perform customer segmentation that would have been previously impossible, resulting in a better mobile experience and more effective ads.
By future-proofing its analytical environment, Globe is maintaining a competitive edge in a fast-moving, global industry.  
“Two years ago, we were probably a bit behind mobile companies around the world,” said Genio. “But today, we're trying to solve those challenges simultaneously with many other companies around the world… We can manage, interpret, and, at the end of the day, democratize all of that information that's all visible to us.”
