Hilton is an American multinational hospitality company, founded in 1919 and headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia. Currently, its portfolio includes 5,500 hotels across 110 countries. Hilton has 14 brands across different market segments including economy, luxury, and full-service hotels.
 
Challenge
The traditional model at Hilton involved multiple data warehouses across different technologies. This meant data was very siloed and inconsistent for the organization. There was a need to become more data centric to better serve customers.
 
Solution
Hilton is leveraging a modern data architecture of HDP and HDF, running on a private cloud in AWS.
 
Results
The framework that Hilton has built is leading to unlimited opportunities, including the ability to do inline pricing on the fly and customer 360 analytics for reservations and profile data. This helps the organization be more informed on what its customers are expecting and increases the velocity on how these insights can be utilized.




You put all the pieces in one framework, one umbrella, I think the opportunities are unlimited. We are very serious about it and we truly believe that Hortonworks will help us achieve our end goal.
-Sudhir Menon VP, Enterprise Information Management, Hilton
