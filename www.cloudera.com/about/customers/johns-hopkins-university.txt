Johns Hopkins University is an American private research university, founded in 1876 and located in Baltimore, Maryland. It is considered the first research university in the United States, and is organized into 10 divisions on campuses in Maryland and Washington, D.C. These divisions include the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Applied Physics Laboratory, among various others.
Challenge
Data is hugely sensitive for Johns Hopkins University, especially for the medical program and Applied Physics Lab. Johns Hopkins needed a platform that was both robust and secure for housing its data.
Solution
Johns Hopkins is utilizing HDF, including components like Apache NiFi, Apache Knox, Apache Atlas, and Apache Ranger.
Results
The university is now able to achieve results that would never be possible without a big data platform. It’s now able to ingest data from disparate sources, transport data from various sources to the Hadoop cluster, and help clinicians administer more targeted treatments.




There are things that we are able to do with Hortonworks that I cannot imagine how we would do without a big data platform. The business value has been exemplary because we're able to get in a ton of data from disparate sources.
-Conrad Fernandes, Information Security Engineer, Johns Hopkins APL
