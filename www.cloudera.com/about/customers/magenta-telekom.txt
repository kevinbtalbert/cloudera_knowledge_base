Magenta Telekom is a 100% subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG, one of the largest communications companies in Europe and the United States. Magenta Telekom provides telecommunications, TV and entertainment in Austria, has approximately 2,500 employees and 7.2 million network connections.
Challenge
Magenta Telekom wanted to find a scientific way of understanding its customer base, their experience and how this correlated to technical issues on the network. With 7.2 million connections, this was no small task and involved a vast amount of data. The company needed to bring together its business leaders and data scientists in a way where they could communicate and generate transformative business results.
Solution
By using HDP, processing and analyzing the vast amount of data both now and in the future was not a problem. Magenta Telekom used the platform to process customer data that could indicate trends in why customers were deciding to move operators and where their experience may be sub-optimal. Additionally, Apache Hive and Apache Spark are being utilized for machine learning.
Results
Magenta Telekom can now analyze the anonymized data produced by billions of network ‘events’ which can provide insights into the issues being experienced by customers and allow the operator to invest in areas that can improve the experience of customers as fast as possible. This allows customers to be retained and see continual improvements in the service delivered, giving the business healthier margins and more flexibility to invest in the next innovative service or technology.




The scale of data analysis we are performing to better understand our customers required a powerful system that could scale and adapt as we create more datasources and use technology to automatically act on those data insights. Cloudera was pivotal in allowing us to build an intelligent customer satisfaction model around our data that could directly improve the service delivered to our customers.
-Dr. Wasif Masood, Data Science Lead, Magenta Telekom
