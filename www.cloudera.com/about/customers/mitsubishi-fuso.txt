Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation (MFTBC) is a leading manufacturer of trucks, buses, and industrial engines. With a focus to shape itself into a data-driven organization, MFTBC continues to grow through business innovation and provision of new value added services to its customers. One such breakthrough innovation is Truckonnect, which integrates vehicle sensor data and other data to bring relevant information to the customer’s fingertips.

Truckonnect diagnoses vehicles' conditions such as engine and transmission statuses and provides vital information for speedy repairs of problems, efficient operation, and reduction of fuel consumption. This service is available on its Super Great truck models.

The information analysis platform behind Truckonnect is supported by Microsoft Azure HDInsight, a cloud service based on the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP). The company chose HDP because it is enterprise ready and because Hortonworks has the greatest number of contributors in the Hadoop community. MFTBC relies on Hortonworks expertise for immediate results and regular improvements to the platform. For a smoother construction and operation of the system, MFTBC uses Hortonworks Professional Services.
