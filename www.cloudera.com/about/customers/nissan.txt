Nissan Motor Company Ltd is a Japanese multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Nishi-ku, Yokohama. The company sells its cars under the Nissan, Infiniti, and Datsun brands.
Challenge
Connected cars that leverage driving data are a vision that automobile manufacturers are aggressively pursuing. Nissan Motor Company Ltd (Nissan) is on this journey also. The company was experiencing a variety of business challenges, namely the need for infrastructure capable of storing huge volumes of vehicle driving data and product quality data on a long-term basis. Also, it had a need for a Hadoop platform capable of deploying a variety of data cross-functionally.

Solution
Nissan turned to Hadoop as the solution for its Big Data problem, relying on Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP). The open source model appealed to the company due to the large numbers of engineering talent in the market and the flexibility to pivot if circumstances changed down the road.

Result
The deployment has introduced a data lake capable of storing all types of company data. The demand for and deployment of data continues to increase significantly. While the project is still in the early stages, the expectation is that the platform will host up to 500TB of data by late 2017.




The fact that HDP® is the most open-source compliant product available made a big difference. Unlike other products, HDP did not require installation of any proprietary (non-open source) modules.
-Mr. Akinori Baba, Manager Of IT Architecture And Production Services, Global IT Division
