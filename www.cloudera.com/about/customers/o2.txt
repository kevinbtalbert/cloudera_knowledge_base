O2 is the commercial brand of Telefónica UK Limited, a leading digital communications company owned by Telefónica S.A. and the mobile network operator with the highest customer satisfaction in the UK according to Ofcom. With over 25 million customers, O2 runs 2G, 3G and 4G networks across the UK, as well as operating its nationwide O2 Wifi service. O2 has over 450 retail stores and sponsors the O2 arena, O2 Academy venues and England Rugby.
Challenge
O2 needed a unified data hub that complied with new International Financial Reporting Standards, plus the ability to take advantage of the transformative power of Big Data and digital analytics.
Solution
The infrastructure provisioned by Hortonworks acted as the foundation layer for Accenture to run end-user applications. It consisted of Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP®) and Hortonworks Data Flow (HDF), the former providing a core repository to run various analytics and the latter streaming specific datasets to the various O2 reporting warehouses.
Results
O2 realized significant business value with HDP and HDF, including meeting the IFRS 15’s 99.9 percent daily accuracy requirement, the ability to process 20 million records daily, mitigating security risks and avoiding significant fines, and enabling data access in days instead of weeks.




The Financial Data Hub is a testament to what can be achieved when the business and IT collaborate to deliver significant results and huge steps on our transformation journey.
-Stephen Devereux, Head Of Business Intelligence, O2
