Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin Company, is uncovering patterns in aircraft performance and parts that can help improve flight safety, optimize aircraft operations, and significantly reduce costs.


Overview
Sikorsky, a premier helicopter company worldwide and a division of Lockheed Martin, strives to be the safest OEM of helicopters. To achieve its goal, the company wanted to conduct more advanced analytics so it could better predict and resolve potential issues before they caused flight groundings or safety issues.
Impact
Rapid, data-driven decision support has helped Sikorsky further enhance safety, reduce risk, and reduce costs.




Safety was the driver, and now we're seeing that result in advantages across the board. Cost reductions, availability increases, readiness increases, having the right parts in the right place, so we're really flowing that out across all of our product line.
-Matt Tarascio, Director, Intelligent Technologies, Analytics, and Sustainment, Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin Company



Solution
Using a scalable data management and analytics platform built on Cloudera Enterprise, Sikorsky can process and store data in a reliable way, and analyze full data sets across entire fleets. The use of Cloudera Enterprise enables staff to focus on aviation challenges instead of worrying about monitoring the cluster or upgrades. “What excites me about working at Sikorsky is solving these really, really hard problems. ...these helicopters that people are flying to do really important things. ...they're search and rescue in the ocean, they're saving people's lives, medivac, these types of things. Being able to support people doing those things, using data is amazing,” explained Mike Koelemay, Supervisor, Data Science, Advanced Analytics, Sikorsky.
