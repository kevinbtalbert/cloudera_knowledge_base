Symcor is one of Canada's leading providers of business processing and client communications management services, supporting major banks, insurance, retail, and telecommunications companies. It offers item processing, cash management, and integrated statement services; and print and electronic solutions.
Challenge
Data is helping drive the growth at Symcor, where the company provides fraud detection and prevention services to its clients. The biggest challenge the company was facing was how to protect clients' data by offering digital and data services.
Solution
Symcor uses Hortonworks to enable its comprehensive data governance policies, to deliver on clients’ needs. With Apache Ranger and Active Directory, Symcor is able to provide on-demand access to Hadoop for certain periods of time.
Results
Symcor is now able to increase security because no one has full-time access to the Hadoop clusters at any given time.




From the beginning, Hortonworks has worked with us to come up with the most innovative enterprise-grade data governance as a first-class citizen in our process, end-to-end. We see our partnership consistently growing in the future.
-Chris Wojdak, Senior Program Managing Architect, Symcor
