Vizient is the nation’s largest member-driven healthcare services company. Backed by network-powered insights in the critical areas of clinical, operational and supply chain performance, Vizient empowers members to deliver exceptional, cost-effective care at every turn. The company is fueling new business models and new approaches to care—all through the power of brilliant connectivity.
Challenge
Healthcare organizations face distinct challenges in managing the quantity of their data along with being able to utilize data from numerous different sources. Data is crucial in healthcare. For doctors to be able to recommend the correct treatments they need to have access to the right information.
Solution
Vizient has gained significant value through Hortonworks Connected Data Platforms. The ability to take in data from a variety of different sources enables the company to move much faster. It can take lab and patient data, recognize patterns within, and provide this data to advisors in the field working with its members. These medical professionals can then provide recommendations for how members can improve their health.
Result
Big Data gives healthcare organizations the ability to let multiple hospitals exchange information, leading to a 360 view of their members. With this information, doctors can give a more complete diagnosis. Without Big Data, none of this would be possible and healthcare organizations would be operating without having the complete picture.




Hortonworks enables us to take data in any of the different formats we could receive and map that through to feed all our different analytic devices. This is a competitive edge that allows us to move faster.
-Chuck DeVries, VP, Tech Strategy And Enterprise Architecture
