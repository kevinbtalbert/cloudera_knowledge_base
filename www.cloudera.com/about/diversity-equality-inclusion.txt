Diversity, Equality & Inclusion
Enabling a more diverse and inclusive Cloudera across every aspect of our business.













 












 Our commitment
 Our people
  Employee resource groups
 Supplier diversity
 Join us






















Cloudera is committed to deliberate and decisive action to address inequality in our workplaces and communities. We actively advocate tolerance, understanding, inclusiveness, and non-violence.

Anything less is simply unacceptable.











 



















Our people
Cloudera is committed to building a more diverse environment, but we are not yet where we want to be. Our DE&I team is working with leaders and team members across the business to help narrow representation gaps. 
 
While this data reflects our current progress , it is merely a snapshot of our opportunity for growth. As we continue reviewing our diversity analytics and enhance our commitment to transparency and accountability, we will begin sharing comprehensive data on a quarterly basis.

Gender is reported globally while race/ethnicity data is US only at the moment. All demographic data is self reported.

Employee resource groups (ERGs)

They collaborate with us to enable a safe and supportive culture while providing education and strategic insights that support Cloudera’s goals and objectives.
