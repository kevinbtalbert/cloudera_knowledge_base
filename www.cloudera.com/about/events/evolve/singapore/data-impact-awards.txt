Data Impact Awards: Showcasing your success with data











 








Our annual awards recognise organisations utilising Cloudera's solutions to champion innovation. We showcase only the best of the best, highlighting the impact data-driven projects, supported by Cloudera, have within these organisations, the wider industry, and the world.
 
This year, we will be presenting the APAC Data Impact Awards at the flagship Evolve 23 event in Singapore, the conference for data and analytics leaders focused on the future of data innovation in business.







 























 

















Each submission must fall into only 1 of the following categories:






Modernised Data Architecture
Organisations that have tackled transformative business use cases by leveraging on a data lakehouse, data mesh and/or data fabric, to collect, enrich, report, serve and predict, with portable data services across environments without refactoring or redevelopment.
Transformative AI
Organisations that have built and deployed use cases for enterprise-scale machine learning and have industrialised AI to automate, secure and optimise data-driven decision-making and/or applications. 
Cloud Innovation
Organisations that are driving business innovation by unlocking value from data in multiple environments - in the private cloud or across hybrid and multiple public clouds.
Industry Transformation
Organisations that move their business to the next level and disrupt their industry by identifying new technologies, applying new skills and operationalising processes
People First
Organisations who are tackling some of the most difficult workplace and societal challenges affecting companies and the world around us, transforming the future of workplace culture and society as a whole through employee lifecycle.







 










 










 








 



All finalists will be celebrated as the region's leading innovative data-driven organisations at Evolve and on Cloudera's publicity channels. Finalists will also be invited to an APAC Data Impact Awards Gala dinner with Cloudera's global leadership team on Tuesday, 11 July 2023 in Singapore.
 
All submissions will be reviewed and you will be notified if your submission has been selected as a finalist. If you are submitting on behalf of another company, we will connect with you to coordinate any outreach.
