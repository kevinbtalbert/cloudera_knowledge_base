HYBRID CLOUD—
THE POWER OF “AND”








 Watch Now




























See the power of private and public cloud in action
Times of change bring opportunity. People and organisations that seize the moment thrive in unpredictable environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital disruption and highlighted that the importance of data to business has never been more critical. Organisations that have flourished adopted technological innovations, enabling them to respond effectively, at scale by successfully harnessing the power of their data.
As global economies and organisations return to growth, there is an opportunity for all of us to build choice, flexibility and security into our data and analytics, adapting quickly to changing needs. To minimise the impact of uncertainty, business organisations and governments need to actively expand how and where to successfully access and leverage data.
Join us at Cloudera Sessions 2021 to hear from industry experts, thought-leaders, and your peers about how to take advantage of the data opportunity. The agenda has been designed for you to learn how Hybrid delivers freedom of choice—private and public clouds, performance and cost management, security and self-service, flexibility and control. It looks like your job just got a whole lot easier.

Customers are evolving... are you?








Joe Rodriguez, Senior Managing Director, Industry Solutions, Financial Services, Cloudera 
Anthony Behan, Managing Director, Telecommunications, Media & Entertainment, Cloudera 

Maintaining customer loyalty to a brand has never been harder. While buyers will sing a company’s praises when they are happy with services, pricing, and customer service – there is a huge risk of losing that customer to a competitor, in an instant, over the slightest issue. Customers today are better-informed and more connected to the world than ever before. They want access and accuracy at lightning quick speed. And let’s face it, customers today don’t tolerate perceived poor service, inflated pricing, or inferior products. Businesses have become entirely customer-focused because the customers are in charge and if a business doesn’t meet the customer’s needs, someone else will… your nearest competitor is only one click away. In this session, Joe Rodriguez and Anthony Behan answer important questions like:

How do we keep up with the expectations of a new generation of customers?
How do new trends, like crypto, play a role in the future of customer transactions?
How can data play a role?
Plus, they will share insights and experience on how Cloudera can help your business make good decisions in today’s highly volatile environment, to be ready for tomorrow.

Keynote: Data in a world of disruption







Shawn Kanungo, Disruption Strategist 
Disruptors see the world differently. They bring unique viewpoints, technologies, talent and ideas from all over the world. But, to become part of the new breed of disruptors today, it requires us to abandon the set of ideas and practices that may have made us once successful.
To build both mindset and muscle around disruption, leaders will need to treat data as electricity, while at the same time, making room for magic in a world of uncertainty. We need to be bold, brave, and experimental.
In this rapid-fire presentation, shot completely in a 750-person empty theatre, Shawn Kanungo provides a bold roadmap for future disruptors.
