      Cloudera and Hortonworks Merger FAQ
      












Cloudera and Hortonworks are announcing the proposed merger of two leading next generation data platform companies. The transaction is expected to close in Q1 calendar year 2019.
The combined company will possess the scale, resources and unique assets to capture more of the very large and fast growing data market opportunity. Together we will be stronger - with approximately $720 million in TTM revenue, more than $500 million in cash, zero debt, and a growing top line.









This transaction is about innovation. We share a commitment to customer success and a vision for how to accelerate the market to capture more of it. Together we intend to develop the industry’s first enterprise data cloud, enabling actionable insights from the Edge to AI.  
In CY20 or FY21 we expect to be more than $1B in revenue, growing at more than 20% per year, and generating more than 15% operating cash flow margins.









 




What is being announced?







Cloudera and Hortonworks will be merging to create the industry’s first enterprise data platform to deliver actionable insights from the Edge to AI. This merger will expand the customer reach and expansion opportunity for both companies and accelerate innovation for IoT, cloud, data warehousing, machine learning and AI.












What are the terms of the transaction?







Under the terms of the transaction agreement, Cloudera shareholders will own approximately 60% of the equity of the combined company and Hortonworks shareholders will own approximately 40%. Hortonworks shareholders will receive 1.305 common share of Cloudera for each share of Hortonworks stock owned.












When is the transaction expected to close?







The transaction is expected to close in calendar year Q1 2019.












What happens until the transaction closes?







Both organizations continue to operate independently, essentially as if there was not an agreement in place to merge. 












Who will lead the combined company?







Following completion of the transaction, Cloudera’s Chief Executive Officer, Tom Reilly, will serve as Chief Executive Officer; Hortonworks’ Chief Operating Officer, Scott Davidson, will serve as Chief Operating Officer; Hortonworks’ Chief Product Officer, Arun C. Murthy, will serve as Chief Product Officer; and Cloudera’s Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frankola, will serve as Chief Financial Officer, of the combined company. Hortonworks’ Chief Executive Officer, Rob Bearden, will join the board of directors.  Current Cloudera board member, Marty Cole, will become Chairman of the board of directors.

The board of directors of the newly-formed company will initially comprise nine directors.  Four directors, including Mr. Bearden, will come from Hortonworks’ existing board of directors. Five directors, including Mr. Reilly, will come from Cloudera’s existing board of directors. A tenth director will be selected by the combined board. A majority of the board of directors will be independent under New York Stock Exchange standards.
We will form the best go-forward management team, leveraging top talent from each company.  We expect representatives from each company to play key roles in fulfilling our shared vision of creating the industry’s first enterprise data cloud for enabling actionable insights from the Edge to AI.  












What will be the name of the new company?







The name of the combined company will be Cloudera, Inc.












What does this allow customers to do that they couldn’t do before?







Our combined products will give customers a more robust ability to store, manage, analyze and derive actionable insights from all of their data from the edge to the datacenter, across any cloud, and back to the edge.  We will deliver an end-to-end data cloud that operates across the enterprise. Together, we will handle IoT, data warehousing, and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workloads. The combined company will also accelerate the development of hybrid cloud capabilities and create a single standard platform for big data in the enterprise.












How does this compare to what other competitors offer?







We intend to bring together our combined assets to enable enterprise IT to span public clouds, datacenters, the Edge and everywhere in between. Our mission is to deliver a platform that works with cloud ease and elasticity everywhere enterprises need to work - the industry’s first enterprise data cloud from the Edge to AI.
Once the companies are combined, we will be able to provide more information about how our combined offerings will compare to other competitors in the market.












What does HDP bring to CLDR?







In addition to a shared commitment and investment in the open source big data ecosystem, Hortonworks has innovated in ways that benefit the market and create new revenue opportunities. For example, the Hortonworks DataFlow, or HDF, offering extends Cloudera’s reach to the edge, making IoT and streaming data applications easier to build and operate, all with the trusted security, data governance, metadata and management that enterprises require. This represents a new capability to the Cloudera customer base and a new offering for the joint company to sell to Cloudera customers.












What does CLDR bring to HDP?







In addition to a shared commitment and investment in the open source big data ecosystem, Cloudera has innovated in ways that benefit the market and create new revenue opportunities. For example, the Cloudera Data Science Workbench (CDSW) and Workload Experience Manager (WXM) make machine learning, data science and data warehousing applications easier to build and operate, providing a foundation for AI solutions. These represent new capabilities to the Hortonworks customer base and a new offering for the joint company to sell to Hortonworks customers.












How many customers will the combined organization have?







Together Cloudera and Hortonworks will have an installed base of more than 2,500 customers. We will also have more than 800 customers with greater than $100K in ARR and more than 120 customers with greater than $1M in ARR.  Demonstrating how complementary our businesses are, of these $1M+ customers, only a handful are in common.












What happens to customers who rely on current products of the two companies







Nothing will change with respect to current offerings and support of existing customers of Hortonworks and Cloudera, except that support will be enhanced based on greater combined resources and a path constructed to a superior unified platform in the future.   Cloudera 6 and Hortonworks 3 are the latest major platform releases from the two companies, both built on the Apache Hadoop 3 release. Each of these platforms will be maintained and supported for three years.












What is the long-term product and support roadmap?







Post-closing, we plan to merge the HDP and CDH into a single offering that is a functional superset of them both. We will include a migration path from the HDP 3 and CDH 6 platforms, so that customers can move their workloads easily when they are ready to do so.












What is the merged company’s position on open source?







We remain absolutely committed to open source. Each of the companies has made major contributions to the projects in the ecosystem from inception. Together, we will continue to do so.
Open source conveys real strategic benefits. The community innovates more broadly than any single company can. Open source creates standards and makes them easy for customers to adopt. It empowers developers to build on the platform, by exposing its implementation. And it insulates customers from lock-in and bad vendor behavior.
Cloudera has also developed non-open source components in its products as a way to differentiate its offerings and deliver greater value to customers. Those developments have been aimed at preventing large competitors from co-opting the big data ecosystem, for example by taking open source components without contributing back to the community.
The merged company will continue to invest in open source, and to develop proprietary components and products that meet the needs of our customers.












Will this change how customers purchase or obtain support?







No. Customers and prospects should be secure in the promise that both CDH and HDP will remain supported post-merger for a minimum of three years. 












Will there be changes to pricing or licensing?







There will not be any immediate changes due to the merger as both companies will continue to operate normally as separate entities. Existing customer agreements and subscriptions will remain in force. There may be changes in pricing or licensing driven by standard business requirements, new market opportunities and competition, as would be the situation irrespective of the agreement to merge.












Will this change how partners engage with either company?







Each of us has terrific partnerships and a well-developed ecosystem.  Except for some extraordinary partners like IBM and Intel, these partners have had to split their resources and attention between our platforms.  As one much larger entity, these partners can justify investing more resources in the resulting relationship and concentrate their investments in our unified platform.  The combination will make it easy for partners to streamline all their engineering and go-to-market activities. Most importantly, our partnerships with the public cloud providers will be much more meaningful as together we bring more large customers with production workloads to their platforms.












What are the expected synergies from the transaction?







Given the strategic fit between the companies, we are confident that there will be significant opportunities to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of our internal operations. We expect these improvements to drive more than $125M of cost synergies per year, while allowing additional investment in growth areas including IoT, hybrid cloud, data warehousing, machine learning and AI. At this point we do not have, and are not prepared to share or discuss, any more precision around the steps to generate the cost synergies.
CY19, or FY20 for Cloudera, will be the year where we integrate the companies, and take steps to generate more than $125M in annual cost synergies. In CY20 or FY21 we expect to be more than $1B in revenue, growing at more than 20% per year, and generating more than 15% operating cash flow margins.
