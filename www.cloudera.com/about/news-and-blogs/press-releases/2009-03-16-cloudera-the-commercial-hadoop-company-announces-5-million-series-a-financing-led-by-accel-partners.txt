Cloudera, the Commercial Hadoop Company, Announces $5 Million Series A Financing Led by Accel Partners






 









Investors Include Top Executives From High Technology Firms Flickr, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, MySQL, Opsware, Palm, VMware, Wily Technology, Yahoo!, YouTube
BURLINGAME, CA–(Marketwire – March 16, 2009) – Cloudera, the commercial Hadoop™ company, today announced that it has closed a $5 million round of Series A financing led by Accel Partners. Founded in late 2008 by leading experts on complex, large-scale data from Facebook, Google, Oracle and Yahoo!, Cloudera’s mission is to bring the power of Hadoop to organizations large and small. Hadoop, a powerful new way to manage and mine vast volumes of information, is the data processing engine behind some of the world’s largest and most popular Web sites.
“We’re fortunate to have Accel Partners as our venture capital partner as well as the financial support of some of the most respected and successful private investors and technology executives in high technology,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “We believe that Hadoop is a disruptive new technology for mining valuable business information in the enormous streams of new data generated in enterprises today. Processing this kind of large-scale data has been too expensive or too technically difficult for all but the most sophisticated IT organizations until now. Our mission is to use Hadoop to make big data processing capabilities accessible and affordable for all companies.”
“Cloudera has critical elements that we look for in category-defining companies — a world-class founding team, great technology, and a disruptive and large market opportunity,” said Ping Li, a partner at Accel Partners. “Cloudera is uniquely positioned to bring the power of Hadoop to businesses, whether it be a scale out implementation inside a modern enterprise or harnessing the benefits of a hosted cloud solution.” Li has also joined the Cloudera board of directors.
The founding team at Cloudera includes:
– Mike Olson, who was vice president at Oracle and prior to that CEO at
open source database pioneer Sleepycat Software;
– Christophe Bisciglia, who created and led Google’s Academic Cloud
Computing Initiative that partnered with the National Science Foundation
(NSF) to make Google-hosted Hadoop clusters available for research and
education worldwide;
– Dr. Amr Awadallah, co-founder of VivaSmart, acquired by Yahoo! where
Dr. Awadallah served as vice president of engineering and used Hadoop
extensively across the Yahoo! online services, including mail, search,
finance and news;
– Jeff Hammerbacher, conceived, built, and led the data team at Facebook
responsible for driving many of the applications of statistics and machine
learning as well as building out the infrastructure to support these tasks
for massive data sets.
In addition to Accel Partners, investors in Cloudera include Mike Abbott (senior vice president, Palm), David desJardins (early Google employee), Caterina Fake (co-founder, Flickr), David Gerster (entrepreneur), Diane Greene (former CEO of VMware), Youssri Helmy (entrepreneur), Dr. Qi Lu (president of the Online Services Group, Microsoft; former executive vice president, Yahoo!), Marten Mickos (former CEO, MySQL), In Sik Rhee (former chief tactician, Opsware; founder, Loudcloud), Mendel Rosenblum (founder VMware), Jeff Weiner (president, LinkedIn; former senior vice president, Yahoo!), Dick Williams (CEO, Illustra; former CEO, Wily Technology), Gideon Yu (Facebook CFO; former senior vice president, Yahoo!; CFO, YouTube).
