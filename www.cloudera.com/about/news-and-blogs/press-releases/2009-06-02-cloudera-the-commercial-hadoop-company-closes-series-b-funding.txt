Cloudera, the Commercial Hadoop Company, Closes Series B Funding






 









Led by Greylock Partners, Additional Funding to Accelerate Growth of Hadoop/MapReduce in Enterprise and Internet Markets
SAN FRANCISCO, CA–(Marketwire – June 2, 2009) – Cloudera, the commercial Hadoop™ company, today announced that it has secured a Series B venture capital funding round led by Greylock Partners, bringing its total funding to date to more than $11 million. Aneel Bhusri, Partner at Greylock, has joined Cloudera’s Board of Directors. Existing investor Accel Partners, which led the Series A round, also participated in the round.
With proven investments such as Red Hat and WorkDay, Greylock Partners brings deep expertise and operational experience in enterprise software, particularly in data management.
“Cloudera is uniquely positioned to take advantage of a large market opportunity around complex, large-scale data in the enterprise,” said Aneel Bhusri, partner at Greylock Partners. “The rapid adoption of Hadoop/MapReduce, Cloudera’s team of leading experts on large-scale data who come from Facebook, Google, Oracle and Yahoo!, and their rapid customer acquisition strongly positions the company to lead this revolution in data management.”
Cloudera’s mission is to bring the Hadoop/MapReduce platform — a powerful new way to store and manage vast volumes of data — to the enterprise. The combination of under-utilized data within corporations and the new generation of data-intensive applications demand a new data analytics and data processing platform. Hadoop/MapReduce has proven to be the solution that can serve this new market need. Hadoop is already the data processing engine behind some of the world’s largest and most popular Internet businesses. With this latest capital investment, Cloudera plans to drive the company’s growth across all strategic functions including product development, training, support, sales, and marketing.
“Cloudera has all the ingredients to change the game and data management. The Hadoop technology has been proven to solve complex, large-scale data problems, the founding team comes with the deepest implementation experience in Hadoop and MapReduce, and customer adoption and interest is accelerating. The growth we have seen since the company started just eight months ago has been very strong,” said Ping Li, general partner at Accel Partners. “We firmly believe the company will become a category leader in a growing and new market around data management.”
“We are thrilled to have Greylock on the Board to help take the company to the next phase of growth,” said Mike Olson, CEO at Cloudera. “The expertise Accel, Greylock and our other investors bring will further accelerate Cloudera’s penetration of the enterprise and Internet markets.”
Cloudera’s other investors include Diane Greene (former CEO of VMware), Marten Mickos (former CEO of MySQL), and Jeff Weiner (President of LinkedIn).
