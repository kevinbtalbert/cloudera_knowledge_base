Cloudera Founder to Speak on Next Generation Data Management Platform at Structure 09






 









Jeff Hammerbacher to Discuss Distributed Data Storage and Processing Layers, Specifically Hadoop
SAN FRANCISCO, CA–(Marketwire – June 25, 2009) – Cloudera, the commercial Hadoop™ company, today announced that Jeff Hammerbacher, founder and Chief Scientist at Cloudera, will speak about the Hadoop/MapReduce platform at GigaOm’s Structure 09 on Thursday, June 25 at the Mission Bay Conference Center in San Francisco.
Cloudera’s mission is to bring the Hadoop/MapReduce platform — a powerful new way to store and manage vast volumes of data — to the enterprise. The combination of under-utilized data within corporations and the new generation of data-intensive applications demands a new data analytics and data processing platform. Hadoop/MapReduce has proven to be the solution that can serve this new market need, and is already the data processing engine behind some of the world’s largest and most popular Internet businesses.
“Traditional data management systems were not built to handle petabytes of information or to allow for complex, deep analysis,” said Hammerbacher. “Solving that problem requires a new approach, and a new platform for data management like Hadoop/MapReduce.”
Structure 09 is a conference designed to explore the next generations of Internet infrastructure. The event looks at the changing needs and rapid growth in the sector, and this year’s event will consider the impact of the global economy.
