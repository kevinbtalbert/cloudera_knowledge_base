Cloudera Announces VMware vCloud API Integration With the Cloudera Distribution for Hadoop






 









Simplifies the Process of Deploying Hadoop in the Cloud
SAN FRANCISCO, CA–(Marketwire – September 1, 2009) – Cloudera, the commercial Hadoop™ company, today announced that the Cloudera Distribution for Hadoop has implemented integrations with the VMware vCloud™ API and will make this available for users running in a vCloud Express environment. Cloudera will be conducting demonstrations of the distribution on the VMware platform at the VMware vCloud Pavilion at VMworld 2009 in San Francisco from September 1st through September 3rd.
“Manually configuring systems like Hadoop for the cloud can be a real challenge,” said Dan Chu, Vice President, of Emerging Business, VMware. “Running the Cloudera distribution with the VMware vCloud™ API integrations on the VMware platform simplifies the process of deploying Hadoop, and we’re excited to collaborate with Cloudera on this breakthrough.”
Hadoop enables users to store and explore large quantities of complex data, using custom analyses. The Cloudera Distribution for Hadoop on the VMware platform allows users to deploy these workloads on an internal cloud or in service provider external clouds, such as the vCloud Express services announced at VMworld 2009. Developers now have the option of running a Cloudera distribution for Hadoop in the cloud with the vCloud Express provider of choice, and know that it will be compatible across a broad ecosystem of providers, as well as their internal datacenter.
“Using VMware’s vCloud™ APIs we are able to provide a pre-configured environment with Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop, which can be deployed elastically over a dynamic number of nodes,” said Amr Awadallah, founder and CTO, Cloudera, Inc. “Furthermore, the combination of VMware vCloud™ API and VMware’s industry-leading virtualization platform, allows transparent deployment to both internal and/or external clouds without requiring any system changes.”
Cloudera is also co-hosting a cocktail reception during VMworld on Tuesday, September 1 from 5pm to 8pm at The St. Regis Hotel.
