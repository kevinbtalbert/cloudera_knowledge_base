Cloudera Adds Executive to Team With Focus on Customer Success






 









Omer Trajman Joins Cloudera as VP, Customer Solutions, to Work Closely With Enterprises Rolling Out New Data Platform Based on Cloudera Distribution for Hadoop
SAN FRANCISCO, CA–(Marketwire – January 19, 2010) – Cloudera, the commercial Apache Hadoop company, today announced the addition of Omer Trajman as VP, Customer Solutions. Trajman brings more than 10 years of software engineering, delivery, technical sales, and thought leadership at Vertica, Welllogic and Escher Group.
Trajman spent the past five years at Vertica, most recently serving as senior director for cloud and virtualization. In his prior role as director of field engineering, he was responsible for ensuring customer success from pre-sales to production at enterprises with some of the largest growing data challenges.
“Cloudera’s customers are building powerful new analysis systems on a new data platform for the enterprise. They are looking to us for thought leadership, architectural guidance and implementation help in building this platform into their business. Omer has a tremendous track record of engagement with customers across industry verticals,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “He is a welcome addition to the world-class business team we’re building to complement the world-class engineering team assembled in 2009.”
Trajman’s customer success record and thought leadership among enterprises is well respected. At Cloudera, he will work directly with enterprise customers as they deploy the Cloudera Distribution for Hadoop in production environments.
“Cloudera is poised for fast growth in 2010 having forged strong relationships with their customers and proven they deliver real value,” said Trajman. “I look forward to working closely with Cloudera’s enterprise customers and helping them succeed.”
Omer Trajman was a visiting scholar at Oxford University studying Computation and Electrical Engineering and received his undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from Tufts University.
