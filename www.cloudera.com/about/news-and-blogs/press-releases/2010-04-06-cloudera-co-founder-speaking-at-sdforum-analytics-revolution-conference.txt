Cloudera Co-founder Speaking at SDForum Analytics Revolution Conference






 









Cloudera co-founder Amr Awadallah will be on the “Analyzing Big Data” panel at the SDForum Analytics Revolution Conference next week.
Cloudera Co-founder and CTO Dr. Amr Awadallah will be taking part in a panel discussion called “Analyzing Big Data” at SDForum’s The Analytics Revolution Conference at 11:25am on Friday, April 9th. The conversation will focus on how cloud computing, distributed storage systems and MapReduce are used to process large amounts of data.
According to the conference program, “Many companies now have large, ill-structured datasets that can only be stored and analyzed using clusters of computers. This panel will describe how Cloud Computing, distributed storage systems and MapReduce are used to process ‘big data.’ Several companies with huge (even awesome) data collections will describe the data they collect and how they store and analyze their data.”
Other panelists include Joshua Klahr from Yahoo!, James Phillips from Northscale and Joydeep Sen Sarma from Facebook.
Cloudera offers enterprises a powerful new data platform built on the popular Apache Hadoop open-source software package. Originally developed and employed by dominant Web companies like Yahoo and Facebook, Hadoop is now widely used in finance, technology, telecom, media and entertainment, government, research institutions and other markets. With Hadoop, enterprises can easily explore complex data using custom analyses tailored to their information and questions.
Cloudera offers products, professional services, technical support and training that complement the Open Source Hadoop platform, enabling enterprises to lower their data-processing costs and get more value from the information they collect and generate.
