Cloudera Names Enterprise Software Marketing Veteran John Kreisa to Executive Team






 









Former Business Objects and Mark Logic executive joins Cloudera as Vice President of Marketing
SAN FRANCISCO, CA – (Marketwire – April 7, 2010) – Cloudera, the commercial Apache Hadoop company, today named John Kreisa as Vice President of Marketing. With nearly two decades of enterprise software product marketing and product management experience, Kreisa will play a key leadership role in developing and executing Cloudera’s global growth strategy.
“John has deep enterprise marketing experience in the high-growth and highly competitive business intelligence and infrastructure software markets. His track record of growing businesses and spearheading development in new markets speaks for itself,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “Interest in Apache Hadoop is accelerating quickly, and John’s wealth of knowledge and expertise will help take Cloudera to the next level.”
Prior to Cloudera, Kreisa held various senior marketing roles in innovative and category-leading technology companies, including three years at Mark Logic Inc., an information infrastructure software provider, and Business Objects. Most recently at Mark Logic, John was Director of Industry Solutions and Director of Product Marketing, where he contributed to a wide range of marketing initiatives and focused on enabling industry-focused sales teams with applied messaging, sales tools, competitive analysis and positioning. Widely quoted, John was also the primary company spokesperson for press and analysts, spoke at dozens of industry events, and was a key contributor to demand generation activity and company events. Before Mark Logic, he spent six years in product marketing at Business Objects, which was a pioneer in the Business Intelligence (BI) market and helped to establish the category.
“Cloudera and Hadoop solve the real-world business issues of complex data and analytics facing the enterprise today,” said Kreisa. “I look forward to the opportunity of building out markets that can benefit greatly from the power of Hadoop and working closely with customers to intimately understand their business needs. Cloudera is on the cusp of major change and I am excited to be a part of a company that will fundamentally alter the way organizations perform fast, reliable analysis of both structured and complex data.”
