Cloudera Selected by AlwaysOn as an OnDemand Top 100 Winner






 









Recognized for creating new opportunities in cloud computing and SaaS.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, April 8, 2010 – Cloudera, the commercial Hadoop™ company, today announced that it has been chosen by AlwaysOn as one of the OnDemand Top 100 winners. Inclusion in the OnDemand 100 signifies leadership amongst its peers and game-changing approaches and technologies that are likely to disrupt existing markets and entrenched players. Cloudera was specially selected by the AlwaysOn editorial team and industry experts spanning the globe based on a set of five criteria: innovation, market potential, commercialization, stakeholder value, and media buzz.
Cloudera and the OnDemand Top 100 companies will be honored at AlwaysOn’s OnDemand event on April 19th, 2010, at Hewlett-Packard’s Worldwide Headquarters in Palo Alto, CA.
This two-and-a-half-day executive event features CEO presentations and high-level debates on how the Internet is disrupting how companies—from small businesses to large enterprises—create, store, distribute, analyze, and take advantage of their mission-critical data.
“As the digital information created by businesses continues to explode at astronomical rates, the need to store, manage, analyze, and share this information is becoming extremely challenging,” said Tony Perkins, founder and editor of AlwaysOn. “We congratulate this year’s OnDemand 100 for providing the technology platforms and services needed to manage and leverage this new era of information complexity and overload.”
The OnDemand 100 winners were selected from among hundreds of other technology companies nominated by investors, bankers, journalists, and industry insiders. The AlwaysOn editorial team conducted a rigorous three-month selection process to finalize the 2010 list.
Cloudera provides enterprises software, support, professional services, and training and certification for the popular Apache Hadoop open-source software package. Originally developed and employed by dominant Web companies like Yahoo! and Facebook, Hadoop is now widely used in finance, technology, telecom, media and entertainment, government, research institutions and other markets. Cloudera is enabling enterprises to take advantage of a new data management platform.
A full list of all the OnDemand Top 100 winners can be found on the AlwaysOn website at:

“Like the large web properties that started using Apache Hadoop because they ran into problems managing large-scale data, enterprises today are discovering that the information they’re collecting is coming with an increasing diversity and velocity and needs a new approach to how it is stored and analyzed.,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH) is an advance in data management because it helps enterprises process, store and analyze their structured or complex data, including text, images, weblogs, or video. We’re honored to be recognized as innovators in the enterprise data market.”
