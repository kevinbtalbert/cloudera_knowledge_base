RALEIGH, NC–(Marketwire – April 23, 2010) –
What:
International Workshop on Massive Data Analytics over the Cloud
(MDAC 2010)
When: April 26, 2010
Where:
Raleigh Convention Center
Raleigh, NC
Cloudera Co-founder and CTO Dr. Amr Awadallah is a keynote speaker at the International Workshop on Massive Data Analytics over the Cloud (MDAC 2010) on Monday, April 26th. His presentation, “Hadoop: An Industry Perspective,” will focus on real business use of the massively scalable storage and batch data processing Hadoop system.
MDAC 2010 is a one-day workshop held at the World Wide Web Conference. The program will have two keynotes — the second from Dr. Vijay Narayanan of Yahoo! Labs Silicon Valley on “Large Scale User Modeling on Hadoop” — and eight full additional presentations.
Awadallah has worked with Hadoop, and data analytics in particular, for over a decade. Amr started Cloudera, along with his three co-founders, after coming from Yahoo!, where he led a team that used Hadoop extensively for data analysis and business intelligence across the Yahoo! online services. As Cloudera’s CTO, he is bringing the power of Hadoop to the enterprise.
Cloudera provides products, professional services, technical support and training that complement the popular Apache Hadoop open-source software package, enabling enterprises to lower their data-processing costs and get more value from the information they collect and generate.
