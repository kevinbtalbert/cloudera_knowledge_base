Cloudera Executive Speaking About Cloud Standards at Interop Las Vegas






 









Cloudera Vice President of Customer Solutions Omer Trajman is taking part in a panel discussion entitled “Portable Clouds: Navigating Cloud Standards” at Interop Las Vegas on Wednesday, April 28th at 11:30am.
LAS VEGAS, NV–(Marketwire – April 26, 2010) –
What: Interop Las Vegas
When: April 28, 2010
Where: Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino
3950 Las Vegas Blvd. South
Las Vegas, NV
Cloudera Vice President of Customer Solutions Omer Trajman is taking part in a panel discussion entitled “Portable Clouds: Navigating Cloud Standards” at Interop Las Vegas on Wednesday, April 28th at 11:30am. The conversation will focus on whether truly portable, interoperable cloud platforms will become a reality.
With competing cloud standards and formats emerging, there is no common language for managing cloud computing operations. This session will examine the cloud standards that are attempting work with one another to create an interoperable cloud platform.
As the head of all customer-facing work at Cloudera, Trajman helps enterprises deploy and manage complex data and processing in production environments using Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop. He has a tremendous track record of engagement with customers across industry verticals, and has extensive experience interacting with various cloud standards.
Panelists include Thorsten von Eicken, CTO and Founder at RightScale, Jason Lochhead, CTO of Hosting Services at Terremark Worldwide, and Ellen Rubin, Vice President of Products at CloudSwitch.
Cloudera provides products, professional services, technical support and training that complement the popular Apache Hadoop open-source software package, enabling enterprises to lower their data-processing costs and get more value from the information they collect and generate. Hadoop is widely used in finance, government, telecom, media and entertainment, technology, research institutions and other markets.
