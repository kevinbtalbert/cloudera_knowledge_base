PROVIDENCE, RI–(Marketwire – May 10, 2010) -
What: Brown University IPP Symposium on Cloud Computing
When: May 13, 2010
Where: Brown University
Providence, RI
Room 368 and the 3rd Floor Atrium (CIT)
Jeff Hammerbacher, Co-founder and Vice President of Products at Cloudera and recently named a 2010 Best Young Tech Entrepreneur by Bloomberg BusinessWeek, is speaking at the Brown University IPP Symposium on Cloud Computing about evolving a new analytical platform on Thursday, May 13th at 1:00pm. He will discuss real world experiences of what has (and has not) worked across industries and workloads, and what new software components might help complete a new analytical platform.
According to the program, “This symposium will explore why computing as a utility is finally happening, and the huge implications for society, business, science, and research. It will bring together experts from industry and academia, and also talk about the challenges for Computer Science to making hundreds of thousands of computers work together in a transparent way.”
Apache Hadoop is a new analytical data processing platform that crunches structured and complex data. It was designed to run on clusters of inexpensive commodity servers that can grow and shrink on demand to meet the storage and processing needs of the enterprise. Hadoop is widely used in finance, government, telecom, media and entertainment, technology, research institutions and other markets by companies such as JP Morgan, Visa, Samsung, Netflix, the Apollo Group, and Nokia.
Cloudera enhances the Hadoop platform through its suite of products, professional services, technical support and training, enabling enterprises to lower their data-processing costs and get more value from the information they collect and generate.
