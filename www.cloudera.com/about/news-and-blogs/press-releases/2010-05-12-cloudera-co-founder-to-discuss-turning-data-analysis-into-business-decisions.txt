Cloudera Co-Founder to Discuss Turning Data Analysis Into Business Decisions
NEW YORK, NY–(Marketwire – May 12, 2010) -
What: East Coast CIO Forum
When: May 17, 2010
Where: The Harvard Club
New York, NY
Jeff Hammerbacher, Co-founder and Vice President of Products at Cloudera, is a featured speaker in a discussion about data management and analytical processing at The Harvard Club in New York City on Monday, May 17th. The session, entitled “A Demon of our own Design: Searching for Hay in Haystacks,” will cover why CIOs need to examine their data in order to make good business decisions.
Apache Hadoop is a next-generation data management technology that can digest many different types of data, including structured and complex data, and runs on clusters of inexpensive commodity servers. With its flexible, scalable and programmable data processing engine, businesses can run sophisticated algorithms that extract new value from the data they store. Data plus powerful analyses delivers insights that simply weren’t available with less data or processing power.
Cloudera enhances the Apache Hadoop platform through its products, professional services, technical support, and training, enabling enterprises to lower their costs for data-processing and analysis and get more value from the information they collect and generate. Hadoop is widely used in finance, government, telecom, media and entertainment, technology, research institutions and other markets by companies such as JP Morgan, Visa, Samsung, Netflix, the Apollo Group, and Nokia. With Hadoop, enterprises can easily explore complex data using custom analyses tailored to their information and questions.
The East Coast CIO Forum is the second conversation by the same speakers that convened at the Forum in December 2009.
