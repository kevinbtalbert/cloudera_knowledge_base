Cloudera Recognized as Leading Startup Early in 2010 for Making Hadoop Accessible to Enterprise






 









Receives More Than Half a Dozen Awards in Four Months for Helping Enterprises Lower Data-Processing Costs and Get More Value From Information They Collect
SAN FRANCISCO, CA–(Marketwire – May 13, 2010) – Cloudera, the commercial Apache Hadoop company, today announced that it has been recognized with seven awards in the first four months of 2010. Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop is becoming the industry standard for enterprises looking to effectively deploy Hadoop and related technologies. Cloudera enhances the Hadoop capabilities through its suite of products, professional services, technical support and training, enabling enterprises to lower their data-processing costs and get more value from the information they collect and generate.
Since January 2010, Cloudera has been honored with:
* Bloomberg BusinessWeek Best Young Tech Entrepreneurs
* Gartner Cool Vendors
* Venture Capital Journal Top 20 most promising startups
* Intelligent Enterprise Editors’ Choice Awards
* CRN 10 Hot Open-Source Cloud Computing Plays
* AlwaysOn OnDemand Top 100
* TiE50 Finalist
“Being recognized by so many notable sources validates Cloudera’s market-leading position and the value of the Apache Hadoop platform as an excellent data processing and deep analysis system that’s designed to meet the needs of the enterprise,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “Cloudera is revolutionizing the data management landscape by providing the next-generation of software, training and resources to help enterprises unlock the power of their data.”
Hadoop was originally created by Cloudera architect Doug Cutting to support distribution for the Nutch search engine project. Facebook, Google and Yahoo! continue to be key contributors to the Apache Hadoop project. Cloudera harnesses the same technology that powers these large Web companies and packages it up for the enterprise. Cloudera leads the evolution of this nascent technology as well as its integration with existing enterprise infrastructures.
Hadoop is widely used in finance, government, telecom, media and entertainment, technology, research institutions and other markets by companies such as JP Morgan, Visa, Samsung, Netflix, the Apollo Group, and Nokia. With Hadoop, enterprises can easily explore complex data using custom analyses tailored to their information and questions.
