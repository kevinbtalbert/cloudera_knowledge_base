Cloudera Lead Architect and Apache Hadoop Creator Doug Cutting to Speak to Chicago Hadoop Users Group






 









Doug Cutting, creator of Apache Hadoop and lead architect at Cloudera, is speaking to the first ever meetup of the Chicago Area Hadoop User Group on Wednesday, May 19th at 6pm CT at Orbitz Worldwide headquarters in downtown Chicago.
CHICAGO, IL – (Marketwire – May 17, 2010) -
What: Chicago Area Hadoop Users Group Meetup
When: May 19, 2010
Where: Orbitz Worldwide headquarters
Citigroup building
500 West Madison, 3rd Floor
Chicago, IL
Doug Cutting, creator of Apache Hadoop and lead architect at Cloudera, is speaking to the first ever meetup of the Chicago Area Hadoop User Group on Wednesday, May 19th at 6pm CT at Orbitz Worldwide headquarters in downtown Chicago. He will provide insight into what he sees as the direction for Hadoop and will discuss real world use cases of organizations using Hadoop to store and analyze data.
Doug is the creator of numerous successful open source projects, including Lucene, Nutch and Hadoop. Doug joined Cloudera in 2009 from Yahoo!, where he was a key member of the team that built and deployed a production Hadoop storage and analysis cluster for mission-critical business analytics.
Apache Hadoop is a new analytical data processing platform that crunches structured and complex data. It was designed to run on clusters of inexpensive commodity servers that can grow and shrink on demand to meet the storage and processing needs of the enterprise. Hadoop is widely used in finance, government, telecom, media and entertainment, technology, research institutions and other markets by companies such as JP Morgan, Visa, Samsung, Netflix, the Apollo Group, and Nokia.
Cloudera enhances the Hadoop platform through its suite of products, professional services, technical support and training, enabling enterprises to lower their data-processing costs and get more value from the information they collect and generate.
