Cloudera Named to GigaOM Structure 50 List






 









Selected by GigaOM Editors, the Inaugural Structure 50 List Represents The Leading Innovators In Cloud Computing and Infrastructure – From Young Startups to the Biggest Tech Titans
Palo Alto, CA – May 18, 2010 – Cloudera Inc., the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced that it has been named to GigaOM’s inaugural Structure 50 list, honoring leading cloud computing and infrastructure companies. Selected in a rigorous review by GigaOM editors, the Structure 50 list encompasses a wide range of recent entrants and established industry leaders.
“We are excited to be recognized among the leading cloud computing and infrastructure companies by GigaOM, an organization known for its long standing dedication to advancing cloud-based technologies and innovation,” said Amr Awadallah, cofounder and CTO at Cloudera. “This designation provides further validation that Cloudera’s Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services are solving significant real world challenges facing data-driven organizations today. The explosion of Big Data in the enterprise is a complex problem that requires a new kind of infrastructure, and we’re enabling customers to unlock the latent business value inside all that data.”
“The Structure 50 companies are changing the face of computing. The editors at GigaOM reviewed hundreds of companies to identify the leaders in cloud computing based on product innovation, market impact, technology development and visionary leadership,” said Derrick Harris, GigaOM Structure Editor and Conference Chair. “The inaugural Structure 50 list recognizes the enormous contribution these companies are making to business, technology and society.”
The Structure 50 companies will be recognized at the GigaOM Structure 2011 conference, June 22-23, in San Francisco. In its fourth year, Structure 2011 is a must-attend cloud computing and Internet infrastructure industry event for executives, investors, entrepreneurs, and technology decision makers. For more information on Structure 2011 and a complete list of the 2011 Structure 50 companies, visit https://event.gigaom.com/structure.
