Cloudera Co-Founder Presenting New Analytical Platform at SIGMOD






 









Jeff Hammerbacher, Co-founder and Vice President of Products at Cloudera, is presenting a session entitled “Experiences Evolving a New Analytical Platform: What Works and What’s Missing” at SIGMOD on Tuesday, June 8th.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA – (Marketwire – June 2, 2010) -
What: ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference
When: June 6-11, 2010
Where: Hyatt Regency
Indianapolis, IN
Jeff Hammerbacher, Co-founder and Vice President of Products at Cloudera, is presenting a session entitled “Experiences Evolving a New Analytical Platform: What Works and What’s Missing” at SIGMOD on Tuesday, June 8th.
Named a 2010 Best Young Tech Entrepreneur by Bloomberg BusinessWeek, Hammerbacher has extensive experience working in the field of data analytics. Prior to his work as an executive at Cloudera, while at Facebook, Hammerbacher’s team produced the Apache projects Hive, a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Apache Hadoop, and Cassandra, a distributed storage system designed to scale across commodity servers.
According to the conference program, “The annual ACM SIGMOD/PODS conference is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences.”
Apache Hadoop is a new analytical data processing platform that crunches structured and complex data. It was designed to run on clusters of inexpensive commodity servers that can grow and shrink on demand to meet the storage and processing needs of the enterprise. Hadoop is widely used in finance, government, telecom, media and entertainment, technology, research institutions and other markets by companies such as JP Morgan, Visa, Samsung, Netflix, the Apollo Group, and Nokia.
Cloudera enhances the Hadoop platform through its suite of products, professional services, technical support and training, enabling enterprises to lower their data-processing costs and get more value from the information they collect and generate.
