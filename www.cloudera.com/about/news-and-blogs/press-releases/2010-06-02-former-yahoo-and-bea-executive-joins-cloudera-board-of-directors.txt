Former Yahoo! and BEA Executive Joins Cloudera Board of Directors






 









Cloudera Adds Scott Dietzen, Previously SVP, Applications at Yahoo!, President and CTO at Zimbra, and CTO of BEA Systems, to the Board
SAN FRANCISCO, CA – (Marketwire – June 2, 2010) – Cloudera, the commercial Apache Hadoop company, today announced that software industry veteran Scott Dietzen is joining its Board of Directors. A former senior executive at Yahoo!, Zimbra and BEA Systems, Dietzen brings a wealth of experience and leadership to Cloudera.
“Dietzen had a hand in establishing the web application platform category with WebLogic and in the open source and Web 2.0 waves with Zimbra,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “His experience growing innovative tech startups into wildly successful software businesses will be a tremendous asset to Cloudera.”
Dietzen has extensive leadership experience, having helped build, sell, and transition three major Internet technology companies. Most recently, he was SVP, Applications at Yahoo!, where his responsibilities included Yahoo! Mail, Messenger, Flickr, Answers, Groups, and Zimbra. He came to Yahoo! via the acquisition of open source email startup Zimbra, where he served as President and CTO. Before that Dietzen was CTO of BEA Systems — acquired by Oracle in 2008 — which he came to with the acquisition of Java and web application server pioneer WebLogic. Dietzen holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon.
“I have been very lucky in getting to work with hugely talented teams on transformative technologies that address essential and growing business needs,” said Dietzen. “Cloudera is in precisely this sweet spot — the Hadoop technology family has the chance to redefine how enterprises deal with exponentially growing data, and thereby deliver substantially more compelling and more customized products and services.”
Cloudera provides products, professional services, technical support and training that complement the popular Apache Hadoop open-source software package, enabling enterprises to lower their data-processing costs and get more value from the information they collect and generate. Hadoop is widely used in finance, government, telecom, media and entertainment, technology, research institutions and other markets.
