Cloudera Helps Hadoop Summit Reach New Heights






 









Keynoting, Sponsoring, Speaking, and Leading Training at Third Annual Hadoop Summit on June 29 in Santa Clara
SAN FRANCISCO, CA – (Marketwire – June 10, 2010) – Cloudera, the commercial Apache Hadoop company, today announced its participation at the third annual Hadoop Summit on June 29 at the Hyatt Regency in Santa Clara, California. Cloudera will be giving a keynote talk, co-sponsoring the lunch, leading sessions, and providing Hadoop training for the event.
“The Apache Hadoop platform has made huge strides in the last year. In addition to web companies that use Hadoop, there are now organizations in financial services, telecom, government, research institutions, and many other industries, using Hadoop. At Cloudera, we’ve seen a significant uptick in the number of enterprises interested in the platform,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “We’re thrilled to participate in such a vibrant community, building out a powerful data platform that helps all types of organizations use insight gained from that analysis to more effectively run their business.”
Organized by Yahoo!, Hadoop Summit sessions span numerous industries and cater to all levels of expertise. Doug Cutting, creator of the Apache Hadoop project and architect at Cloudera, will be giving a keynote entitled, “Hadoop Grows Up.” Additionally, Cloudera will lead a presentation about Hadoop Integration Patterns and Practices and taking part in a panel session about Hadoop frameworks.
Cloudera will provide hands-on Apache Hadoop training as well as certification options for new users, developers and administrators throughout the week of Hadoop Summit: June 28, June 30, July 1 and July 2. Training will be given at a nearby venue and Cloudera will provide shuttle service from the Hyatt Regency to the training location.
Cloudera provides products, professional services, technical support and training that complement the popular Apache Hadoop open-source software package, enabling enterprises to lower their data-processing costs and get more value from the information they collect and generate. Hadoop is widely used in finance, government, telecom, media and entertainment, technology, research institutions and other markets.
