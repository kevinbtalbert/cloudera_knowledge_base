Cloudera and Quest Software Partner to Connect Hadoop and Oracle






 









Companies Will Cooperate on Development Efforts for a Connector Between Oracle and Hadoop, Complementing Sqoop, Cloudera’s SQL-to-Hadoop Database Import Tool
SAN FRANCISCO, CA – (Marketwire – June 21, 2010) – Cloudera, leading provider of Hadoop-based software and services, and Quest Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: QSFT) today announced a partnership to develop, support and distribute an Oracle connector for Hadoop. The connector will be available for free download on both Cloudera and Quest’s websites. Under the terms of the partnership users will be able to freely download Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH) directly from the Quest site.
Code-named “Ora-Oop,” the connector will provide connectivity between Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop and Oracle through an interface that allows for bidirectional, scalable and functional data transfer between Oracle databases and Hadoop. Ora-Oop will complement Sqoop, an open source tool packaged within CDH designed to import data from relational databases into Hadoop.
“Quest Software is the leading provider of third-party tools for Oracle, and Cloudera is focused on making it easier to work with Hadoop and integrate Hadoop-based systems with existing data sources,” said Dr. Amr Awadallah, co-founder and CTO at Cloudera. “This partnership brings together the two leaders in their respective industries to provide advanced connectivity to Hadoop, enabling organizations to easily expand their data storage and analysis capabilities by combining structured data and complex.”
Ora-Oop will support Oracle datatypes and table variants thus avoiding many of the performance issues associated with existing Hadoop-Oracle interfaces.
“Cloudera has emerged as a Hadoop thought leader in the industry, and working together, we want to educate the Oracle community and existing customers on the value of Hadoop technology,” said Billy Bosworth, vice president and general manager for Enterprise Database at Quest Software. “While the first step of this partnership is to enable Hadoop developers to get fast, reliable access to Oracle data, we look forward to an ongoing collaborative effort to help bring both the enterprise and database professional into the future with Hadoop.”
Working together to develop a connector is one of several activities in the partnership plans between Cloudera and Quest, which also includes product bundling and joint commercial support of the new Hadoop to Oracle connector, the availability of Cloudera’s Distribution of Hadoop from the Quest website and co-marketing of the joint solution.
The Ora-Oop connector will be freely available on both www.cloudera.com andwww.quest.com. Additionally, Quest Software is making CDH available from its website.
Cloudera provides products, professional services, technical support and training that complement the popular Apache Hadoop open-source software package, enabling enterprises to lower their data-processing costs and get more value from the information they collect and generate. Hadoop is widely used in finance, government, telecom, media and entertainment, technology, research institutions and other markets.
