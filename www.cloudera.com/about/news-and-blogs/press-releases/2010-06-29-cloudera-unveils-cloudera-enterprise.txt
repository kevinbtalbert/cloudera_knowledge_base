Cloudera Unveils Cloudera Enterprise






 









New Product Combines Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH) With Integrated Deployment Management Tools and Enterprise-Class Support to Help Organizations Put Apache Hadoop Into Production
SANTA CLARA, CA – (Marketwire – June 29, 2010) – Hadoop Summit –Cloudera, a leading provider of Hadoop-based data management software and services, today unveiled Cloudera Enterprise. Cloudera Enterprise is next generation data management software and the first product specifically designed to help organizations fully leverage the Apache Hadoop platform in a production environment, enabling them to cost-effectively store, manage and analyze all of their data.
“More and more organizations are struggling with an onslaught of data and are turning to Hadoop to address their storage and analysis challenges,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “Cloudera is leading the way with Cloudera Enterprise. We offer a package of software and support that lowers the barriers and enables them to easily and safely put Hadoop into production.”
Combining Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH), integrated deployment management tools and enterprise-class support, Cloudera Enterprise is the preferred software choice for large-scale and complex data management. Cloudera Enterprise enables organizations to quickly and easily take advantage of the power of Hadoop to extract value out of their most granular and voluminous data, which often had to be either put to long-term storage or discarded.
“With this release Cloudera is delivering on a broad vision for a Hadoop-based data management platform,” said the Senior Vice President of a large financial institution. “Additionally, Cloudera Enterprise has the broader components which make it right for enterprise deployments.”
“The new management tools delivered in Cloudera Enterprise fill an important need for managing our Hadoop cluster,” said Anil Madan, Director of Engineering, Analytics Platform Development at eBay. “These new tools make it easy to perform critical activities including user access, authorization and lifecycle management of end user jobs.”
Inspired by direct customer feedback, the new management tools address crucial enterprise deployment requirements faced by customers as their deployments grow. The feature-rich tools include authorization management and provisioning, integration configuration and monitoring and resource management, and simplify the operation of Hadoop clusters as they grow and mature.
The authorization management and provisioning tool enables organizations to monitor and manage user activity within a cluster. Features include seamless LDAP integration enabling organizations to integrate directly with their existing user authentication system, delegated group administration so that separate groups can manage their own pool of users, application access control providing administrators with advanced control over data access and user logging so that administrators can review individual user activity for advanced security.
The integration configuration and monitoring tool eases the management of data integration points into a Hadoop cluster. Features include mass configuration and change management enabling administrators to apply configuration changes across a large set of interfaces and connections, and monitoring and event handling which enables administrators to use a central console to monitor all of the data flow activity and to easily handle exceptions.
The resource management tool lets administrators monitor usage of assets within a Hadoop cluster. Features include user and group usage tracking which enables track back and cross charge activity, and quota administration which allows administrators set quotas for resource usage protecting and controlling against over resource usage within a cluster.
“Increasingly organizations are turning to Hadoop for cost-effective storage and large-scale analysis of enterprise data,” said Rachel Chalmers, Research Director with The 451 Group. “Cloudera Enterprise makes it possible for enterprises looking to leverage the advantages of Hadoop to do so in a safe and supported manner.”
“Increasingly, users of MicroStrategy’s highly scalable, fully interactive BI environment are pointing it toward data stored in Apache Hadoop,” said Sanju Bansal, COO at MicroStrategy. “To meet customer requirements, MicroStrategy is working closely with Cloudera to deliver integration and support for Cloudera Enterprise.”
“Quest has partnered with Cloudera because of their expertise for Hadoop, which is reflected in Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop, their comprehensive distribution offering for Apache Hadoop,” said Christian Hasker, director of product management, Quest Software. “With our first project to build an Oracle connector for Hadoop underway, we look forward to an ongoing collaboration with Cloudera to help make Hadoop more accessible for organizations.”
“Vertica is excited about the availability of Cloudera Enterprise, the latest product offering from Cloudera to be natively integrated and optimized to the Vertica Analytic Database 4.0,” said Colin Mahony, VP of Products and Business Development at Vertica. “Cloudera Enterprise and Vertica 4.0 offer enhanced bi-directional parallelism between Hadoop and Vertica so that massive volumes of information can be passed back and forth seamlessly node to node or cluster to cluster.”
Additional Information
Cloudera Enterprise also includes Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop version 3, which was also released today. CDH v3 sets a new standard for Hadoop-based data management platforms by significantly expanding the software. CDH v3 is freely available to download at http://www.cloudera.com/developers/downloads/.
Sold as a subscription, Cloudera Enterprise also includes enterprise-class support providing organizations with the peace of mind needed to put Hadoop into production in the most critical data processing workloads.
