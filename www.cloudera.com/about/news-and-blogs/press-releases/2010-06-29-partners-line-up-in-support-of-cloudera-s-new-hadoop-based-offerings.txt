Partners Line Up in Support of Cloudera’s New Hadoop-Based Offerings






 









Cloudera Enterprise and Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH), Announced Today, Hailed by Cloudera’s Partners as the Preferred Choice by Organizations Deploying Apache Hadoop
SANTA CLARA, CA – (Marketwire – June 29, 2010) – Hadoop Summit – Cloudera, a leading provider of Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced support for Cloudera Enterprise and Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH) from Acer, AMD, Netezza, Talend and Yahoo!
Today, Cloudera announced Cloudera Enterprise, next generation data management software that combines Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH), integrated deployment management tools and enterprise-class support to help enterprises cost-effectively store, manage and analyze all their data. Cloudera also released CDH version 3, the latest version of CDH, which consists of the core Apache Hadoop platform and 8 additional open source projects that make it ideal for use in production environments.
Cloudera has a vibrant and growing partner ecosystem, developed to help organizations achieve success with Hadoop. Together, Cloudera and its partners provide enterprises with the most cost-effective way to perform large-scale data storage and analysis. Today those partners have come out with strong statements supporting the new offerings.
Partner Support:
“Acer Group has teamed up with Cloudera to deliver on its commitment to bring reliable Hadoop solutions to customers worldwide,” said Gianluca Degliesposti, vice president of Global Server Business Development for Acer Group. “Acer Group’s next generation servers are designed to work with both storage and computing intensive workloads executed on the latest release of Cloudera Distribution for Hadoop. Together, Acer Group and Cloudera deliver a well-tested Hadoop solution for complex data management with industry leading value to performance ratios.”
“Fast growing web and cloud computing environments are expected to dramatically impact information technology, and AMD has anticipated this shift by designing AMD Opteron™ processor-based platforms specifically for these environments,” said Margaret Lewis, director of Software Strategy, AMD (NYSE: AMD). “Cloudera is a leader in this area, delivering efficient data via Apache Hadoop, and the work they’re doing is a perfect example of how AMD Opteron processors can be used to provide the energy and cost efficiency required by the cloud.”
“As the data warehouse appliance leader, we are increasingly seeing customers use Hadoop as a useful complement to our platform to collect, stage and transform complex data,” said Brad Terrell, Vice President and General Manager of Digital Media, Netezza. “Because of the stability and industry-leading scope of Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop, we recommend that our customers interested in Apache Hadoop deploy Cloudera alongside Netezza for the most reliable, complete Hadoop deployment.”
“As the leading provider of open source data integration solutions, Talend is very excited by the possibilities the latest release of Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop offers our customers. Cloudera’s products increase the ability to store, manage and analyze complex data,” said Vincent Pineau, Vice President & General Manager, Talend Americas. “By using Cloudera’s enterprise-grade Hadoop distribution coupled with Talend’s powerful, easy to use data integration solutions, customers are able to improve the scope, speed, and productivity of data integration for structured and complex data.”
“We’re excited Cloudera is adopting Oozie, Yahoo!’s workflow engine for Hadoop, and incorporating it into Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop. We created Oozie to manage our huge variety of complex ETL and data analysis workloads across Yahoo!, and are running it in the world’s largest Hadoop deployment,” said Eric Baldeschwieler, vice president, Hadoop at Yahoo!.
