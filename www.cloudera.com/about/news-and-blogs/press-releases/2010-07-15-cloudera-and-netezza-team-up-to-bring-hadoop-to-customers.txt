Cloudera and Netezza Team Up to Bring Hadoop to Customers






 









New Relationship Extends Data Warehousing Strategy With Hadoop
PALO ALTO, CA and BOSTON, MA – (Marketwire – July 15, 2010) – Cloudera, a leading provider of Hadoop-based data management software and services, and Netezza Corporation (NYSE: NZ), the global leader in data warehouse, analytic and monitoring appliances, today announced an agreement to connect Netezza data warehouse appliances and Apache Hadoop, making it possible for customers to gain more insight from their data.
Under the terms of the agreement, Cloudera is building a connector that will enable data movement and transformation between the Netezza TwinFin® appliance and Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH), which will be available in Cloudera Enterprise. Additionally, Netezza will enable downloads of CDH on its customer support website and each company will train the other’s salesforce on the value of Cloudera products and services when combined with Netezza’s broad line of data warehousing appliances. Commercial support for the connector will be provided by Cloudera.
“Hadoop is a powerful complement to Netezza systems. Maximizing the interoperability between Netezza and Hadoop and enabling our customers to better leverage each technology for its unique strengths creates value by enabling our customers to solve large-scale data analysis challenges in ways previously not possible,” said Brad Terrell, Vice President and General Manager of Digital Media, Netezza. “Partnering with Cloudera provides our customers with the industry-standard Hadoop platform and enterprise-grade support for their production deployments.”
Customers are looking to Hadoop to provide an additional capability to their existing warehouses, which gives them new analysis and storage functionality for complex data types. Direct integration of Hadoop with existing data warehousing technologies enables organizations to collect, stage and process their complex data at scale. Once the data has been processed organizations can deliver the highest value information to data warehouses via high-speed connectors for interactive analysis.
“Customers are increasingly looking to augment their data warehouse with Hadoop to add new cost effective storage and data processing functionality to their enterprise. By integrating the Netezza TwinFin appliance and Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop customers can easily move data between these complementary technologies,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “We’re thrilled that Netezza, a leader in the data warehousing Magic quadrant, has selected Cloudera as the way to deliver reliable commercial use of Hadoop.”
CDH is the most comprehensive and broadly adopted Hadoop platform on the market, lowering the barrier to Hadoop adoption and accelerating time-to-value. It consists of core Apache Hadoop and eight additional open source projects, all tested and integrated into a single platform, making it the most complete Hadoop-based distribution.
