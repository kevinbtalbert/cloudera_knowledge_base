Cloudera's Distribution for Hadoop (CDH) Enables Rapleaf to Manage Massive Amounts of Social Data






 









CDH Handles Information Company’s Requirements for Scaling Data
PALO ALTO, CA – August 24, 2010 – Cloudera, a leading provider of Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced that Rapleaf, an information company focusing on personalizing web experiences, is leveraging Cloudera’s distribution for Hadoop (CDH) for data storage and analysis.
Rapleaf processes large quantities of data in order to help companies better understand who their customers are. After encountering throughput and gridlock issues using MySQL, Rapleaf soon realized it could not scale effectively enough with its current data platform and set out to re-architect its entire workflow.
After finding and leveraging CDH, Rapleaf is now able to process a variety of data at a fast enough speed to help keep its business running.
“As part of our effort to personalize people’s online experiences, we are constantly collecting and analyzing large amounts of data,” said Jeremy Lizt, Rapleaf’s vice president of engineering. “Hadoop is a critical part of our infrastructure and Cloudera has helped us leverage the technology to make it work for our business model.”
“Rapleaf is an example of how organizations are leveraging massive data to create valuable insights,” said Mike Olson, CEO, Cloudera. “We pride ourselves on enabling organizations to easily expand data storage and analysis capabilities to meet new and emerging business needs. In this case, Rapleaf now has the key functionalities it needs to take advantage of Hadoop.”
CDH is the most comprehensive and broadly adopted Hadoop-based platform on the market, lowering the barrier to Hadoop adoption by making it simple to install and easy to integrate into the datacenter. It consists of core Apache Hadoop and eight additional open source projects, all tested and integrated into a single platform, making it the most complete Hadoop-based distribution.
