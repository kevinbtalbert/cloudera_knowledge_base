Cloudera Named "Cool Vendor" by Leading Analyst Firm






 









Cloudera Included in Cool Vendors in Data Management and Integration, 2010 by Industry Analyst Firm Gartner.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA–(Marketwire – April 28, 2010) – Cloudera, the commercial Apache Hadoop company, today announced that it has been included in the list of “Cool Vendors” in the “Cool Vendors in Data Management and Integration, 2010″ report by Eric Thoo, Donald Feinberg, Ted Friedman and Andreas Bitterer of Gartner, Inc.
According to Gartner, “Use of Hadoop is growing in commercial organizations. We believe there are many implementations in ‘stealth’ mode today, hidden within business analytic groups and with little or no support from the IT department. As the use grows within the organization and becomes more mission-critical, there is an increasing need for support and other services.”
“Enterprises today collect and generate more data than ever before. Business users ask more sophisticated questions and need to explore data in more detail than legacy systems allow. They must combine a variety of data from many sources and extract real, actionable information and insight from it quickly,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH) makes this possible. We believe Cloudera’s inclusion in Gartner’s Cool Vendors data management report is another sign that enterprises are in need of this new technology and looking for new solutions that make it easy to manage their growing volumes of mixed data.”
Cloudera offers software, services and training, which enable enterprises to maximize their investment in the popular Apache Hadoop open-source software package. Originally developed and employed by dominant Web companies like Yahoo and Facebook, Hadoop is now widely used in finance, technology, telecom, media and entertainment, government, research institutions and other markets. With Hadoop, enterprises can easily explore complex data using custom analyses tailored to their information and questions.
About Gartner’s Cool Vendors Selection Process
Gartner’s listing does not constitute an exhaustive list of vendors in any given technology area, but rather is designed to highlight interesting, new and innovative vendors, products and services. Gartner disclaims all warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to this research, including any warranties of merchantability or fitness of a particular purpose.
Gartner defines a cool vendor as a company that offers technologies or solutions that are: Innovative, enable users to do things they couldn’t do before; Impactful, have, or will have, business impact (not just technology for the sake of technology); Intriguing, have caught Gartner’s interest or curiosity in approximately the past six months.
