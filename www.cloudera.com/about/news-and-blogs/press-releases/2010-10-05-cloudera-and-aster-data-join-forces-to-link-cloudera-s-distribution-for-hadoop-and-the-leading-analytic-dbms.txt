Cloudera and Aster Data Join Forces to Link Cloudera's Distribution for Hadoop and the Leading Analytic DBMS






 









Partnership delivers joint solution, allowing customers to easily capture, consolidate and store 100 percent of their enterprise data for deeper business insights
Palo Alto, Calif. – Oct. 5, 2010 – Cloudera, a leading provider of Hadoop-based data management software and services, and Aster Data, a market leader in big data management and advanced analytics, today announced an agreement that unites Cloudera Distribution for Hadoop (CDH) with Aster Data nCluster. The integration enables customers to leverage MPP platforms for large-scale data processing, management and analytics across structured and unstructured formats to analyze massive amounts of data for deeper business insight.
Cloudera is building a massively parallel, two-way connector for high-speed movement of data between CDH and Aster Data nCluster. The connector will be supported as part of Cloudera Enterprise. Customers deploying both technologies can take advantage of the fast connectivity to rapidly exchange data between the systems for maximum performance and more flexible analytics capabilities.
“Customers are already successfully using Aster Data’s and Cloudera’s solutions together,” said Quentin Gallivan, chief executive officer, Aster Data. “This partnership allows us to bring even deeper value to other organizations looking to manage diverse data types and drive advanced analytic applications using both platforms. The combination is a powerful one that will drive even bigger breakthroughs in advanced analytics.”
The growing challenge for enterprise data managers is that data comes in many shapes and sizes: relational tuples, log files, sensor data, semi-structured textual data like email and more. The data streaming into companies changes over time, and forcing it into a highly-structured format is often impractical. As a result, organizations have been forced to throw away valuable data because it’s unwieldy to store or analyze in traditional infrastructure products. Customers are turning to Hadoop to capture, consolidate and store this deluge of data which threatens to overwhelm traditional systems and processes. The collaboration between Aster Data and Cloudera allows those customers to easily capture this data and do sophisticated data exploration, modeling and transformation in CDH and move data into Aster Data nCluster to provide more structure for fast, interactive and highly-advanced analytics.
As an example retailers can use CDH and Aster Data nCluster together to expand their range of data analysis capabilities. They would use CDH to capture web, application and search logs for long running and large-scale processing to analyze yearly and seasonality trends. They can then load data into Aster Data nCluster for high-speed analysis where frequent analytics is done to look for near real-time, daily or weekly buying patterns and consumer purchasing behavior, resulting from new marketing and sales promotions and run other key time-sensitive business analytics such as cross channel analytics. The combination of CDH and Aster Data’s solution provides critical new analytic capabilities enabling far deeper insight into customer behavior and trends that creates a major competitive advantage for any retailer.
“Our customers use CDH to process enormous amounts of data and transform it into something usable by other systems and analytical users,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “Our partnership with Aster Data makes it easier for customers to get even more value from their data with tight coupling of MPP solutions for data processing, data management, and advanced analytics in a single enterprise-grade solution.”
Under the agreement between the two companies, in addition to technical integration and certification, Aster Data and Cloudera will work together on joint sales and go-to-market activities.
CDH is the most comprehensive and broadly adopted Hadoop-based platform on the market, lowering the barrier to Hadoop adoption by making it simple to install and easy to integrate into the datacenter. It consists of core Apache Hadoop and eight additional open source projects, all tested and integrated into a single platform, making it the most complete Hadoop-based distribution. For more information about CDH, visit http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop/.
Aster Data will be exhibiting at the annual Hadoop World conference taking place in New York City on October 12. Attend Hadoop World 2010 for additional examples of Hadoop in the enterprise.
About Aster Data
Aster Data is a market leader in big data management and advanced analytics. Aster Data’s nCluster is the first MPP data warehouse architecture that allows applications to be fully embedded within the database engine to enable ultra-fast, deep analysis of massive data sets. Aster Data’s unique “applications-within™” approach allows application logic to exist and execute with the data itself. Termed a “Data-Analytics Server,” Aster Data’s solution effectively utilizes Aster Data’s patent-pending SQL-MapReduce together with parallelized data processing and applications to address the big data challenge. Companies using Aster Data include Coremetrics, MySpace, comScore, Akamai, Full Tilt Poker, and ShareThis. Aster Data is headquartered in San Carlos, California and is backed by Sequoia Capital, JAFCO Ventures, IVP, and Cambrian Ventures, as well as industry visionaries including David Cheriton and Ron Conway.
