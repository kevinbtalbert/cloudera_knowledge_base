Cloudera Recognized for Innovation by JPMorgan Chase






 









JPMorgan Chase & Co. Names Cloudera Into Hall of Innovation for Business Impact and Disruptiveness
PALO ALTO, CA–(Marketwire – October 7, 2010) – Cloudera, a leading provider of Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced it was selected into the JPMorgan Chase Hall of Innovation at the 2nd annual J.P. Morgan Technology Innovation Symposium.
This award is given to three companies after careful review of more than 100 suggested nominations by JPMorgan Chase technology executives. Cloudera was selected based on its technology’s ability to cut costs, create competitive advantages and for the technology’s disruptiveness. Hadoop is changing the way companies are working with data enabling them to capture, consolidate and analyze data they had been moving directly to tape or throwing away. This newly captured data enables organizations to improve internal and external business practices and customer interaction.
“As the amount of data that businesses create continues to grow, the need to store, manage and analyze the information grows with it,” says Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “Recognition from JPMorgan Chase highlights the importance of tools that make massive amounts of data more valuable and manageable.”
Cloudera provides software, support, professional services, training and certification for the Apache Hadoop open source software package. Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH) is the most comprehensive and broadly adopted Hadoop-based platform on the market, and it lowers the barrier to Hadoop adoption by making it simple to install and easy to integrate into the data center. CDH is 100% Apache licensed and freely available for download. Battle hardened for the enterprise, it consists of core Apache Hadoop and eight additional open source projects, all tested and integrated into a single platform, making it the most complete Hadoop-based distribution available today.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) is a leading global financial services firm with assets of $2 trillion and operations in more than 60 countries. The firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers, small business and commercial banking, financial transaction processing, asset management, and private equity.
