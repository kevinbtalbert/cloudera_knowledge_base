Pentaho and Cloudera Partnership Streamlines Hadoop 'Data to Dashboard' Cycle






 









Combined Offering Enables Business Users to Take Advantage of Hadoop With Ability to Easily and Cost-Effectively Mine, Visualize and Analyze Their Hadoop Data
NEW YORK, NY – October 12, 2010 – Hadoop World – Pentaho Corporation, the open source business intelligence (BI) and data integration leader, today announced a partnership with Cloudera, a leading provider of Hadoop-based data management software and services, to combine Pentaho’s business intelligence and data integration capabilities with Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH). Together, Cloudera and Pentaho will provide enterprises with a robust, feature-rich Hadoop offering that is simple to use, faster to deploy, easier to manage and accessible to a broader set of users.
The combination of Cloudera’s Enterprise with Pentaho for Hadoop provides the first complete end-to-end data integration and BI offering that enables organizations to:
Easily manage and deploy Hadoop clusters in their data center;
Connect to streaming data sources like web servers, search logs and application logs;
Rapidly integrate Hadoop into existing data architectures by easily moving data between Hadoop and databases, data warehouses and other enterprise data stores;
Quickly load data, perform data transformations and set up cubes to begin analyzing data;
Visualize and analyze Hadoop data for improved business intelligence.
The Pentaho and Cloudera partnership provides for collaborative engineering and development efforts to enable the integration of the two companies’ technologies. Over the course of Q4 2010 and the first half of 2011, Pentaho and Cloudera will team up to sponsor a series of webinars and seminars focused on the on-boarding of Hadoop deployed solutions within enterprises.
Quotes and Multimedia
“The Pentaho and Cloudera partnership means that combined customers can more quickly integrate Hadoop within their enterprise data environments while also providing exceptional analytical capabilities to a wider set of business users,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “Together, Cloudera and Pentaho are making it possible to deploy Hadoop across a broader set of organizations, address a broader set of use cases and deliver value to a broader set of users.”
“Pentaho and Cloudera are solving two very important challenges for enterprises,” said Richard Daley, founder and CEO of Pentaho. “Not only can organizations more effectively collect, store and manage rapidly growing volumes of new data; they can also make better business decisions by mining, analyzing and visualizing this data quickly, easily and extremely cost-effectively.”
