Quest Software and Cloudera Unveil First Release of 'OraOop' at Hadoop World 2010






 









OraOop Helps Enterprises Take Advantage of Hadoop’s Cost Benefits, Provides High-Performing and Scalable Data Transfer between Oracle and Hadoop
NEW YORK CITY – Hadoop World 2010 – Oct. 12, 2010 – Quest Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: QSFT) and Cloudera, Inc. today at Hadoop World unveiled the first release of OraOop, a connector between Oracle and Apache Hadoop that allows for fast and scalable data transfer between Oracle databases and Hadoop. OraOop is now available as a freeware download at www.quest.com/Ora-Oop, and as a supported component of Cloudera Enterprise at www.cloudera.com.
“Since partnering with Cloudera and first announcing this project, we’ve seen interest in OraOop quickly take off. With Hadoop getting serious consideration from more large organizations, the need for a tool that will connect the Hadoop framework with existing Oracle databases is front and center,” said Guy Harrison, director of development at Quest Software. Harrison is presenting on data exchange between Hadoop and relational databases today at Hadoop World, where OraOop will be unveiled. “The most common use is from organizations that want to transfer data from their Oracle databases into Hadoop in order to take advantage of Hadoop’s lower cost of storage and analytical capabilities. Today’s release of OraOop provides them with an enterprise-ready tool to move data between Oracle and Hadoop.”
Developed by Quest, OraOop is designed as a freeware plug-in to Sqoop, Cloudera’s existing open-source framework. OraOop provides a faster, more scalable solution for the enterprise that has performed up to five times faster than Sqoop alone for highly clustered data during testing. OraOop also avoids scalability issues that can occur with Sqoop when data has no primary key or is not stored in primary key order, and provides users with a reduced overhead on the Oracle instance – up to 80 percent reduction in CPU consumption, and up to 95 percent reduction in IO time.
“OraOop has a robust roadmap in place, and we look forward to future releases that continue to improve compatibility and performance of data transfer between Oracle and Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop,” said Ed Albanese, business development at Cloudera. “We are very pleased that OraOop is now generally available, and that customers of Cloudera’s products will have a commercial grade connector, which facilitates enterprise level adoption of Hadoop.”
