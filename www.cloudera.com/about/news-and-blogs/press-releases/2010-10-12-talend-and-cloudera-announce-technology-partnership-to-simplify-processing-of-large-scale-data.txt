Talend and Cloudera Announce Technology Partnership to Simplify Processing of Large Scale Data






 









Combination of Talend Integration Suite and Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop Provides Unparalleled Ease of Use and Scalability
Los Altos & Palo Alto, Calif., October 12, 2010 — Talend, the recognized market leader in open source data management software, and Cloudera, a leading provider of Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced a technology partnership to integrate the two companies’ open source solutions to tackle the critical issue of data management. With this partnership, Talend and Cloudera customers can now better leverage Apache Hadoop to drive unprecedented scalability for simplified data transformation and processing.
By partnering together, Talend and Cloudera provide enterprises using Hadoop with the highly scalable processing and distribution capabilities required to handle vast amounts of structured and complex data. Talend’s data integration environment makes it possible to create and execute transformation jobs directly in Hadoop, while bringing unmatched usability to Hadoop for the definition of data transformations thanks to Talend’s intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
At the same time, Hadoop brings to Talend unparalleled scalability to increase the power of its data integration processes; instead of using costly and difficult-to-manage high-range servers, customers can deploy Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH) on inexpensive hardware, taking advantage of the highly scalable and massively parallel MapReduce architecture to execute data integration processes. Talend’s native support for Hadoop makes it possible to scale to any level and support any complex data type, so companies can leverage their Hadoop clusters for peak data volumes and complex transformations.
“Together, Talend and Cloudera offer an extraordinary level of integration to help companies change the way they handle very large sets of data,” said Bertrand Diard, CEO and co-founder of Talend. “Combining the transformation capabilities of Talend Integration Suite with the unprecedented scalability of Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop helps customers to simplify processing of their data while enabling a level of scalability that large organizations demand.”
The technology partnership further demonstrates the power of the complete open source Hadoop platform. Talend provides full compatibility with Sqoop, a SQL-to-Hadoop database import and export tool, and Hive, the data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop. For example, companies that need to extract data from applications can leverage Talend’s connectors to extract it from disparate sources and load it into Hadoop using Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop data-loading features, including Sqoop and Flume. Talend can also connect reference data sets to load data into CDH via Sqoop.
“Customers use Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop to filter through immense amounts of complex data,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “The integration of Talend and Hadoop will simplify and accelerate this quest, enabling organizations of all sizes to tackle the largest and most complex data projects with ease.”

More than 1,500 paying customers around the globe, including eBay, Virgin Mobile, Sony Online Entertainment and Allianz, subscribe to Talend’s solutions and services to minimize the costs and maximize the value of data integration, ETL, data quality and Master Data Management.
