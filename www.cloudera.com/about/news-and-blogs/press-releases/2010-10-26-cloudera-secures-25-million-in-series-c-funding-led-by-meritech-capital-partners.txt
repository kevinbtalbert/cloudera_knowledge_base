Cloudera Secures $25 Million in Series C Funding, Led by Meritech Capital Partners






 









Cloudera Continues to Grow and Attract Investment With Heightened Demand for Production-Ready Hadoop Platforms
Palo Alto, Calif. – Oct. 26, 2010 – Cloudera, a leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced that it has secured $25 million in a Series C financing led by Meritech Capital Partners. The company’s current investors, Accel Partners and Greylock Partners, also participated. The funding will be used to further invest in product development and services to support growth and adoption of Hadoop by enterprise organizations. Today’s funding follows a Series B investment of $6 million led by Greylock Partners in June 2009. This brings Cloudera’s total funding to $36 million.
“Cloudera has emerged as a clear leader in driving enterprise adoption of Hadoop. The company’s execution on product and services is impressive,” said Rob Ward, managing director of Meritech Capital Partners. “Enterprises will continue to produce massive amounts of data and Hadoop is proving to be critical to making sense of that data. With Cloudera’s track record, vision, products, team and partnerships, the company is well-positioned to be the major catalyst in driving Hadoop adoption.”
More and more organizations are turning to Hadoop to meet the deluge of data they are faced with because it offers a cost-effective platform for capturing, consolidating and analyzing data. Cloudera provides both software and services that make it faster and easier to put Hadoop into production. The company has experience helping large and small organizations get more value out of their data. This new round of investment will expand Cloudera’s ability to meet the growing interest around Hadoop and related technologies.
“Hadoop adoption among enterprises is strong and accelerating,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “This year, we released major upgrades to our open source platform and introduced Cloudera Enterprise, our subscription offering with the tools and support necessary for mission-critical Hadoop deployment. As customer interest intensifies in the US and around the world, we need to increase our capacity and reach. Meritech’s investment helps us advance our offerings and satisfy the high demand we’re seeing.”
“Cloudera continues to prove itself to be a disruptive data management player,” said Ping Li, general partner at Accel Partners. “Enterprises are swamped by data today and they desperately need a way to store, analyze and act on it. We’ve always believed that Cloudera is uniquely positioned to become a category leader in a growing market around data management by solving those problems. The demand we see for Cloudera’s products is great validation.”
