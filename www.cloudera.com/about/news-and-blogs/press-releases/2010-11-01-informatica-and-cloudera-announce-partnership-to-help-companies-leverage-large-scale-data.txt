The two companies are able to provide a level of integration coupled with the global resources that organizations need to gain a competitive advantage while they grow their business.”
“During the past decade, data volumes, ranging from the unstructured formats of social media sites, to the structured formats within databases and applications have exploded,” said Girish Pancha, executive vice president, Data Integration, Informatica. “It has become increasingly clear that organizations are struggling to make sense of and leverage the vast amount of both structured data as well as social data that is captured and processed. Now, our customers will be able to leverage their data of virtually any scale.”
“Today, the real strength of Hadoop does not come out unless you’re coding complex algorithms, which normally only the quants can do,” said Donald Feinberg, Vice President and Distinguished Analyst, Gartner. “The adoption of Hadoop by the larger integration and application vendors will help build the ecosystem, integration, packaged functionality and resources needed to accelerate broader of Hadoop by enterprises.”
