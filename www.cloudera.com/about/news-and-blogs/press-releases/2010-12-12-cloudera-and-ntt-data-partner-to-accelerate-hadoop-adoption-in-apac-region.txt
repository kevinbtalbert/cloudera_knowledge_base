Cloudera and NTT DATA Partner to Accelerate Hadoop Adoption in APAC Region






 









Largest IT services firm in Japan selects Cloudera as strategic technology partner to bring Hadoop to its customers
Palo Alto, Calif. – Oct. 12, 2010 – New York – Hadoop World – Cloudera, a leading provider of Hadoop-based data management software and services, and NTT DATA CORPORATION (TSE – 9613) Japan’s largest IT services provider, today announced a multi-faceted partnership that will accelerate the adoption of Hadoop in APAC with a focus on the Japanese market.
To meet the growing demand for Hadoop in Japan and the APAC region in general, NTT DATA and Cloudera have joined to promote and support Apache-Hadoop. Under the terms of the agreement, NTT DATA will distribute and sell Cloudera products and support, promote and resell Cloudera training and create joint marketing materials to service Hadoop demand in Japan.
NTT DATA is responsible for the IT operations at some of the world’s largest companies. They successfully use their technical knowledge and abilities along with partnerships with industry leaders to help companies succeed with their biggest and most important IT initiatives. NTT DATA has deep expertise introducing open source technologies to Japanese customers and has embraced Hadoop, selecting Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH) as a key addition to its portfolio of supported products.
Cloudera has extensive experience helping organizations move their Hadoop implementations from initial proof of concept to full production systems. In addition to providing leading Hadoop products and support, Cloudera is committing training and market development resources to work with NTT DATA in Japan. Customers looking to take advantage of Hadoop can rely on the combined expertise of both companies to deliver success with their projects.
“Japanese companies in the financial services, government, telecommunications and web services verticals are experiencing unprecedented growth in data volumes and analytic opportunities. As a result, demand for Cloudera products is growing fast in that region,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “Cloudera is pleased to expand our operations into the APAC region through a broad, strategic partnership with NTT DATA, a company with tremendous experience in delivering the highest levels of service.”
NTT DATA will work with customers to integrate Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop (CDH) into their current enterprise data environments to collect, capture and analyze data in measurable and manageable ways.
“We are pleased to be partnering with Cloudera to bring the transformational power of Hadoop to Japan. Companies are drawn to Hadoop because they need to store, process and analyze large sets of complex data,” said Shinichi Yamada, EVP & CTO of NTT DATA. “We’ve seen a heightened demand over a short period of time for Hadoop and Cloudera’s products and services. This partnership will give us the ability to further promote Cloudera’s Distribution for Hadoop to a market that is already demanding Hadoop.”
CDH is the most comprehensive and broadly adopted Hadoop-based platform on the market, lowering the barrier to Hadoop adoption by making it simple to install and easy to integrate into the datacenter. It consists of core Apache Hadoop and eight additional open source projects, all tested and integrated into a single platform, making it the most complete Hadoop-based distribution.
