Cloudera Sponsors Apache Software Foundation






 









Provider of Apache Hadoop-Based Software and Services Continues its Dedication to Open Source and the Apache Community
Palo Alto, Calif. – January 4, 2011 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced that it has become an Apache Software Foundation (ASF) sponsor. Furthering its commitment to open source, Cloudera’s sponsorship of the non-profit, volunteer-run foundation will help aid organizational, legal and financial support for a broad range of Apache licensed projects. Other Apache Software Foundation sponsors include Google, Yahoo!, and Facebook.
Through a collaborative development process Apache projects deliver freely available software that attracts large communities of users. The pragmatic Apache License makes it easy for all users, both commercial and individual, to deploy Apache products.
“The Apache Software Foundation has made tremendous contributions to the open source ecosystem since 1999,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “The Hadoop project, since its very earliest days, has relied on Apache infrastructure and governance. The entire Hadoop community benefits enormously from ASF support. Cloudera is pleased and proud to join ASF as a sponsor.”
As the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based software and services, Cloudera actively contributes to the Hadoop project as well as other related Apache projects including HBase, Hive, Avro, Whirr, Pig and Zookeeper. Cloudera’s Distribution for Apache Hadoop (CDH) is 100% open source, Apache licensed and freely available for download. For more information, visit http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop/.
