Cloudera Helps Tynt Customers Get a Clear Picture of Reader Interest






 









Cloudera’s Distribution for Apache Hadoop (CDH) processes all visitor copy/paste activities data for more than 600,000 online publishers
Palo Alto, Calif. – January 12, 2010 – Cloudera, the leading provider ofHadoop-based data management software and services, today announced that Tynt, a company that analyzes web visitor engagement to drive new revenue opportunities for content publishers, has achieved significant benefits usingCloudera’s Distribution for Apache Hadoop (CDH) in production for data storage and processing.
Tynt processes large quantities of visitor copy/paste activity data in order to help publishers better track and understand how content links are shared throughout the Internet. Tynt processes more than 20 billion viewer events per month on behalf of their publishers, often exceeding 20,000 events per second. This data empowers online publishers to increase site visits, user engagement and maximize revenue through deep insight into how content is being consumed and shared. Prior to using Hadoop, the company was adding new MySQL databases weekly just to keep up with the incredible growth they are experiencing. Needing a scalable solution, Tynt selected Cloudera’s Distribution for Apache Hadoop because of Cloudera’s established reputation for Hadoop-related domain experience, and went into production with CDH in April 2010.
“We couldn’t have survived another month without transitioning to Hadoop,” said Cameron Befus, vice president of engineering, Tynt. “After researching many options, we sought out the people that do Hadoop best and signed on with Cloudera. The Hadoop system that we implemented has worked beautifully, with virtually no downtime.”
More than 600,000 sites use Tynt’s technology including Time Inc. and Conde Nast family of Magazines.
“Tynt is an example of how enterprises are making sense of massive amounts of data with Hadoop,” said Mike Olson, CEO, Cloudera. “We are committed to providing the industry-standard Hadoop-based platform for demanding workloads like this one. For many companies today, data is money. Cloudera’s products, services and training help our customers solve hard business problems and make that transformation.”
CDH is the most comprehensive and broadly adopted Apache Hadoop-based platform on the market and is 100% open source and free under the Apache license. CDH lowers the barrier to Apache Hadoop adoption by making it simple to install and easy to integrate into the datacenter. It consists of core Apache Hadoop and nine additional open source projects, all tested and integrated into a single platform, making it the most complete Apache Hadoop-based distribution.
