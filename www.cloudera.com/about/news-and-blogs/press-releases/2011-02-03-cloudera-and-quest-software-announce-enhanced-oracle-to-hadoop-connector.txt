Cloudera and Quest Software Announce Enhanced Oracle to Hadoop Connector






 









Companies Release OraOop 1.1 Adds Support for Oracle RAC
Palo Alto, Calif. – February 3, 2011 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Hadoop-based data management software and services, and Quest Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: QSFT) today announced the availability of OraOop 1.1 and OraHive 1.0. These new releases build upon the companies’ partnership to develop, support and distribute Oracle connectivity for Apache Hadoop and includes new support for Oracle RAC deployments.
The OraOop connector provides connectivity between Cloudera’s Distribution for Apache Hadoop (CDH) and Oracle through an interface that allows for bidirectional, scalable and functional data transfer between Oracle databases and Hadoop. OraOop was designed as a freeware plug-in to Sqoop, Cloudera’s existing open-source framework. Commercial support for OraOop is available via Cloudera Enterprise. OraOop is the first and only fully supported connector available between Oracle and Apache Hadoop.
“OraOop 1.1 verifies our commitment to making Hadoop easy for enterprises to integrate with as many data sources as possible,” said Ed Albanese, head of business development at Cloudera. “Support for Oracle database platforms is vital for Cloudera customers. Quest Software is a key member of Cloudera’s rapidly growing partner ecosystem and proven experts in providing useful tools to work with Oracle database platforms.”
“The initial release of OraOop provided tremendous benefits for customers wanting to connect Oracle to Hadoop,” said Guy Harrison, director of development at Quest Software, and Oracle ACE. “This new release adds even more value for users and we are looking forward continuing our collaborative partnership with Cloudera, enabling Hadoop professionals with fast, reliable access to Oracle data.”
The connectors are freely available on both www.cloudera.com and www.quest.com.
