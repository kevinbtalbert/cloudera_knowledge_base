Cloudera Secures Investment and Technology Development Agreement From IQT to Support U.S. Intelligence Community






 









Partnership demonstrates Apache Hadoop momentum in the government market
Palo Alto, Calif. – February 3, 2011 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced a strategic investment and development agreement from In-Q-Tel (IQT), the strategic investment firm that identifies innovative technology solutions to support the missions of the U.S. Intelligence Community.
This partnership will serve as a catalyst for Cloudera’s efforts towards assisting and expanding the adoption of Hadoop technology within the U.S. Government. Cloudera is proud to work alongside IQT to bring ground-breaking technologies to the U.S. Intelligence Community.
Cloudera offers a powerful Apache Hadoop-based data management platform that helps government organizations store and analyze very large amounts of complex data. IQT invested in Cloudera due to the rapid adoption of Hadoop within the government and the significant potential for deployments with its partners. Cloudera provides the commercial backing IQT’s partners need to deploy Hadoop in mission-critical applications.
“Cloudera has an established reputation for its Hadoop-related domain experience in software, services, training and support,” said T.J. Rylander, Partner on IQT’s Investments team. “We believe the company’s technical excellence as well as its software and training capabilities will provide an important resource for our customers in the area of big data management and analytics.”
Cloudera’s Distribution for Apache Hadoop (CDH), which is 100% open source and free for download, is the most comprehensive and broadly adopted Hadoop-based platform available. CDH lowers the barrier to Hadoop adoption by making it simple to install and easy to integrate into the datacenter. Organizations needing the most cost-effective way to perform large-scale data storage and processing in production environments use Cloudera Enterprise to manage and monitor their Hadoop operations during rigorous enterprise workloads.
“Cloudera’s open source platform and our Cloudera Enterprise offering have seen strong adoption among our commercial customers over the last two years,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “This new investment by IQT is a validation of Cloudera’s progress to date, and reflects the deep interest in Hadoop that we see among federal users. I’m very pleased to work with such a strong partner in bringing large-scale, high-performance, powerful data analysis tools to government clients.”
About IQT
In-Q-Tel is the strategic, not-for-profit investment firm that works to identify, adapt, and deliver innovative technology solutions to support the missions of the U.S. Intelligence Community. Launched in 1999 as a private, independent organization, IQT’s mission is to identify and partner with companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve the national security interests of the United States. Working from an evolving strategic blueprint defining the Intelligence Community’s critical technology needs, IQT engages with entrepreneurs, growth companies, researchers, and investors to deliver technologies that provide superior capabilities for the CIA and broader U.S. Intelligence Community.
