Mary Rorabaugh brings dynamic experience at managing high-growth companies
Palo Alto, Calif. – March 1, 2011 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, today named Mary Rorabaugh Vice President of Finance.
“Cloudera is leading the charge to deliver an enterprise-grade platform based on Apache Hadoop to the market. Demand has grown significantly over the last year, and that’s why it is imperative for us to have a seasoned executive like Mary to help manage Cloudera’s growth,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “Mary has an excellent track record of driving companies to succeed.
