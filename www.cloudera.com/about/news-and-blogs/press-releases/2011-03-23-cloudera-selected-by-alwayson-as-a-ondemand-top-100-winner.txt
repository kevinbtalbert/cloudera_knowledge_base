Cloudera Selected by AlwaysOn as a OnDemand Top 100 Winner






 









Recognized for creating new opportunities in cloud computing and SaaS
Palo Alto, Calif. – March 23, 2011 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced that it has been chosen by AlwaysOn as one of the OnDemand Top 100 winners. Inclusion in the OnDemand 100 signifies leadership amongst its peers and game-changing approaches and technologies that are likely to disrupt existing markets and entrenched players. Cloudera was specially selected by the AlwaysOn editorial team and industry experts spanning the globe based on a set of five criteria: innovation, market potential, commercialization, stakeholder value, and media buzz.
Cloudera and the OnDemand Top 100 companies will be honored at AlwaysOn’s OnDemand event on March 28, 2011, at Hewlett-Packard’s Worldwide Headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif.
This two-and-a-half-day executive event features CEO presentations and high-level debates on how the Internet is disrupting how companies—from small businesses to large enterprises—create, store, distribute, analyze, and take advantage of their mission-critical data.
“As the digital information created by businesses continues to explode at astronomical rates, the need to store, manage, socialize, and share this information is becoming extremely challenging,” says Tony Perkins, founder and editor of AlwaysOn. “By providing innovative technologies that help enterprises better compete in this new era of information complexity and move their data out into the cloud, the OnDemand 100 represent some of the highest-growth opportunities in the private company marketplace.”
The OnDemand 100 winners were selected from among hundreds of other technology companies nominated by investors, bankers, journalists, and industry insiders. The AlwaysOn editorial team conducted a rigorous three-month selection process to finalize the 2011 list.
Cloudera is the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based software and services and works with customers in financial services, web, telecommunications, government and others industries. The company’s products, Cloudera Enterprise and Cloudera’s Distribution for Apache Hadoop, help organizations profit from all of their information.
A full list of all the OnDemand Top 100 winners can be found on the AlwaysOn website at:
https://www.aonetwork.com/AOStory/Announcing-2011-OnDemand-100-Top-Private-Companies
“We’re tremendously pleased to have won a place on the AlwaysOn OnDemand 100 roster for a second straight year,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “This is an honor we share with the global Apache Hadoop community — together, we’ve built a powerful, flexible and truly innovative system for taming the flood of data confronting enterprises today. Cloudera’s customers are using our products to turn raw data into a better understanding of their customers, markets and businesses. They use what they learn to build better products, to serve their customers better and to drive new growth and profits.”
