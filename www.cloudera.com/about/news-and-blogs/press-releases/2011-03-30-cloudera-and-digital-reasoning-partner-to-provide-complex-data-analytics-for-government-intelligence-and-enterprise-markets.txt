Cloudera and Digital Reasoning Partner to Provide Complex Data Analytics for Government Intelligence and Enterprise Markets






 









Synthesys expands use of Cloudera’s Distribution including Apache Hadoop (CDH3) by adding Apache HBase support
Palo Alto, Calif. – March 30, 2011 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced that Digital Reasoning, the leader in complex, large-scale unstructured data analytics, has integrated Cloudera’s Distribution including Apache Hadoop (CDH3) along with support of HBase, the open-source, distributed, column-oriented store into the upcoming Version 3.1 release of Synthesys. The integration allows Digital Reasoning to achieve extreme scale capabilities and provide complex data analytics to government and commercial markets.
“Cloudera and its team of Hadoop experts have worked closely with us to break new ground in complex analytics. Together, Cloudera and Digital Reasoning deliver identification and linking of entities on extremely large and diverse data sets for the most demanding customers ,” said Tim Estes, CEO of Digital Reasoning. “Previously, only ‘silos’ of key intelligence data could be analyzed in isolation, but with Synthesys’ integration of Cloudera’s CDH3 and HBase support we can combine algorithms for our automated understanding with a platform that can handle scale and complexity to connect the dots in a way not possible before.”
Designed as a next-generation solution for advanced analytics over both complex and structured data, Synthesys helps decision makers for large government intelligence projects and commercial enterprises make better sense of their data. Synthesys’ integration with CDH3 and HBase will provide confidence to those tasked with solving the government’s largest and most demanding data analytics challenges.
“Our work with Digital Reasoning bolsters Cloudera’s commitment to fostering Hadoop adoption in the U.S. government market,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “With CDH3 integration, Digital Reasoning’s government customers can extract valuable and actionable insight from the enormous amounts of data they generate.”
CDH3 is the most comprehensive and broadly adopted Apache Hadoop-based platform on the market and is 100% open source and free under the Apache license. CDH3 lowers the barrier to Apache Hadoop adoption by making it simple to install and easy to integrate into the datacenter. It consists of core Apache Hadoop and nine additional open source projects, all tested and integrated into a single platform, making it the most complete Apache Hadoop-based distribution.
