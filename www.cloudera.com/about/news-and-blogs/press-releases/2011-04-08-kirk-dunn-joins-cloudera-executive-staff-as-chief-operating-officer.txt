Kirk Dunn Joins Cloudera Executive Staff as Chief Operating Officer






 









Brings extensive hands-on experience running successful venture-backed companies
Palo Alto, Calif. – April 8, 2011 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, has named industry veteran Kirk Dunn as the company’s Chief Operating Officer.
“Cloudera’s growth over the past six quarters has been remarkable,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “We’re poised for a great 2011, but we have a great deal to do. Kirk’s broad experience – at large and small companies and in a variety of roles – is a tremendous addition to our leadership team. I am very pleased to welcome such a seasoned executive to Cloudera.”
Prior to joining Cloudera as COO, Kirk served as Chief Executive Officer at PowerFile, a venture-backed company building hybrid storage systems, and at Bang Networks, makers of an intelligent messaging platform for enterprise users. Before joining Bang Networks, Kirk led North American sales at Inktomi Corporation.
“2010 was a breakout year for Cloudera with respect to customer acquisitions, strategic partnerships, product innovation, venture funding, industry awards and a wildly successful Hadoop World user conference,” said Kirk Dunn, COO at Cloudera. “I am excited to build off Cloudera’s awareness and momentum to bring Hadoop into even more enterprise environments in 2011.”
