Apache Hadoop Creator and Cloudera Chief Architect Doug Cutting to Keynote Hadoop World 2011 in New York City






 









Cloudera Hosts Third Annual Conference Showcasing the Latest Advances by Community and Commercial Users of Apache Hadoop, November 8 and 9
Palo Alto, Calif. – May 5, 2011 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced the third annual Hadoop World conference to be held November 8 and 9 at the Sheraton Towers in New York City.
With more than 800 attendees in 2010, Cloudera’s Hadoop World conference has become the world’s leading Hadoop-related event featuring presentations in the last two years from organizations on the cutting edge of Hadoop developments and production deployments such as AOL, China Mobile, eBay, Facebook, GE, HP, Intel, JP Morgan Chase, Microsoft, The New York Times, Orbitz, Twitter, VISA, Yahoo! and more.
“Hadoop World has exceeded everyone’s expectations and for 2011 we decided to double the scope of the event to be able to accommodate the overwhelming interest,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “We want the conference to have the best possible content for the Apache Hadoop community members, practitioners and business sponsors. We’re designing Hadoop World 2011 to best serve this vast ecosystem with a comprehensive mix of real-world customer use examples and technology talks across all the components in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.”
Hadoop World 2011 will include more than 50 sessions across business and technical tracks spanning infrastructure, applications and use cases, in addition to keynotes from industry luminaries including Doug Cutting, the creator of Apache Hadoop and chief architect at Cloudera. Additional keynote sessions will be announced in coming months. Hadoop World sessions are ideal for developers, administrators, and business users of all skill levels. Cloudera will also provide hands-on training and certification for administrators and developers in New York City during the week of Hadoop World.
“For anyone interested in Apache Hadoop or Big Data, Hadoop World is a must attend conference,” said Stephen O’Grady, Principal Analyst at RedMonk. “From developers to users to players in the Hadoop ecosystem, it’s an event with something for every audience.”
“Hadoop is arguably the key technology for unstructured ‘big data’ management and analytics, said Guy Harrison, Director of Research and Development at Quest Software. “For organizations evaluating or implementing Hadoop, Hadoop World represents a unique opportunity to exchange information and benefit from the experiences of other Hadoop users.
Register now for early bird Hadoop World conference passes at $395 (full price passes will be $595). Additionally, the call for speakers is now open. To submit a session proposal or to register for Hadoop World, please visit here.
