Cloudera Named Among the World's 50 Most Promising Startups by TiE Silicon Valley






 









Company to be Honored in Award Ceremony at TiECon 2011
PALO ALTO, Calif. — May 13, 2011 — Cloudera Inc., the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced it has been named by TiE Silicon Valley to the 2011 TiE50 in the software/cloud computing category. The annual award honors the world’s 50 most promising technology startups. Cloudera and the other Tie50 winners will be honored in a ceremony at TiEcon 2011 on May 13th in Santa Clara, California.
“Cloudera was clearly ranked among the best of the breed by a team of 60 highly accomplished and experienced judges. These experts included globally recognized venture capitalists, CEOs, academia and serial entrepreneurs,” said Vish Mishra, chairman of TiEcon 2011 and president of TiE Silicon Valley. “Being recognized as a TiE50 winner is a true testament to their entrepreneurial spirit and world class caliber.”
The TiE50 program screened more than 1600 companies worldwide through a multi-tier screening and judging process. Cloudera and others were selected for excellence in their respective domains: software/cloud computing, internet, mobile, energy and life sciences.
“TiE50 companies this year again represented an extraordinary set of ideas, innovation and business opportunities. Since its inception two years ago, 94% of TiE50 companies have been funded, attracting over $20 billion in investments; 42 companies have already exited,” said Ram K. Reddy, chair TiE50 2011. “We plan to feature our finalists and winners through various channels and outreach programs during the year.”
TiEcon is the world’s largest conference for entrepreneurs featuring two action-packed days of rich dialogue, networking and deal making with thousands of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, industry executives and thought leaders.
