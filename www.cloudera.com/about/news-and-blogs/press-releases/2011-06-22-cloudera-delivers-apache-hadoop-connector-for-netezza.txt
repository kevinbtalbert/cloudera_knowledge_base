Cloudera Delivers Apache Hadoop Connector For Netezza






 









New Connector Integrates Tightly with Netezza Environments, Harnessing the Power of Apache Hadoop to Provide a Powerful Offering for Large Scale Data Management
Palo Alto, CA — June 22, 2011 — Cloudera Inc., a leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced the immediate general availability of the Cloudera Connector for IBM Netezza appliances. The connector allows Netezza users to leverage Cloudera’s Distribution including Apache Hadoop (CDH) and Cloudera Enterprise services, support and management tools to derive highly articulated analytical insights from large unstructured data sets. The Cloudera Connector, which is the first of its kind for CDH and Cloudera Enterprise, enables high-speed, bilateral data transfer between CDH and Netezza environments.
“As the amount of data that organizations need to process, especially for analytics, continues to increase, Apache Hadoop is increasingly becoming an important data integration tool to enhance performance in reducing very large amounts of data to only what is needed in the data warehouse,” said Donald Feinberg, VP and distinguished analyst at Gartner. “Hadoop presents a viable solution for organizations looking to address the challenges presented by large scale data and has the potential to extend the capabilities of a company’s data warehouse by providing expanded opportunities for analysis and storage for complex data sets.”
The Cloudera Connector allows CDH to take advantage of Netezza environments, creating a staging area that can rapidly aggregate and analyze data sets to determine their value and suitability for wider user access, before applying them to an organization’s database. Used in combination, Cloudera Enterprise and Netezza technologies enable users to collect, stage and process complex data sets at scale to ensure they are storing a highly usable and available form in the database for interactive analysis. Support for the connector is for Netezza customers looking to leverage CDH or Cloudera Enterprise.
“Our combined solution allows users of IBM Netezza appliances – a clear leader in the data warehousing market – to easily integrate their databases with CDH and Cloudera Enterprise in a commercially supported way,” said Ed Albanese, head of business development at Cloudera. “The significant speed, cost savings and data analysis capabilities enabled by Cloudera’s Distribution including Apache Hadoop, continue to attract businesses looking to extend their data management capabilities to address an exciting new class of opportunities with fast changing, fast growing data sources.”
