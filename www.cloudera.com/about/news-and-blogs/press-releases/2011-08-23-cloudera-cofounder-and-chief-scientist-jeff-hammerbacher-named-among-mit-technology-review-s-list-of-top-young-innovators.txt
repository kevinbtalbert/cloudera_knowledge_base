Cloudera Cofounder and Chief Scientist Jeff Hammerbacher Named Among MIT Technology Review’s List of Top Young Innovators






 









TR35 Honorees to be Recognized at Technology Review’s emtech MIT 2011 Conference in October
Palo Alto, CA – August 23, 2011 – Cloudera today announced that cofounder and Chief Scientist Jeff Hammerbacher has been recognized by Technology Review magazine as a TR35 Honoree for 2011. The TR35 recognizes the world’s top innovators under the age of 35, spanning energy, medicine, computing, communications, nanotechnology and other emerging fields.
Jeff Hammerbacher, honored for his compelling vision and contribution to open source technology, was selected as a member of the TR35 class of 2011 by a panel of expert judges and the Technology Review editorial staff, who evaluated more than 300 nominations. He will join other TR35 honorees in discussing their achievements at the emtech MIT 2011 conference, taking place at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Mass., October 18-19, 2011. All of the TR35 winners for 2011 will be featured in the September/October issue of Technology Review and online at www.technologyreview.com/tr35/.
“Technology innovation is key to driving growth and progress in the areas of research, medicine, business and economics,” said Jason Pontin, editor-in-chief and publisher of Technology Review. “This year’s group of TR35 recipients is driving the next wave of transformative technology and making an impact on the way we live, work and interact. We look forward to profiling and working with these technology leaders each year and watching their continued advancement in their respective fields.”
Prior to co-founding Cloudera in 2008, Jeff was an entrepreneur in residence at Accel Partners. Before Accel, he conceived, built and led the data team at Facebook. The data team was responsible for driving many of the applications of statistics and machine learning at Facebook, as well as building out the infrastructure to support these tasks for massive data sets. They produced open source projects such as Hive and Cassandra, and their work was recognized at conferences such as CHI, ICWSM, SIGMOD and VLDB. Before joining Facebook, Hammerbacher was a quantitative analyst on Wall Street. He earned his bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Harvard University and recently served as a contributing editor for O’Reilly’s Beautiful Data.
“It is an honor to be recognized as a TR35 recipient amongst such an amazing pool of forward-thinking individuals,” said Hammerbacher. “People like us are inspired by developing applications and products that solve problems and provide genuine utility to others. Cloudera was created to empower organizations to derive business value from the deluge of data by leveraging the enormous potential of the Apache Hadoop platform. Even as data volumes grow and evolve at an increasingly rapid pace, the work we’re doing at Cloudera provides users with the tools to harness the information latent in all their data, turning it into a new driver for their businesses.”
Additional information about past and present TR35 winners and judges is available at www.technologyreview.com/tr35/.
