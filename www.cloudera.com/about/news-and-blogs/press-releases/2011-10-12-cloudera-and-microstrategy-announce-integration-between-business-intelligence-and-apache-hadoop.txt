Cloudera and MicroStrategy Announce Integration Between Business Intelligence and Apache Hadoop






 









New VLDB Drivers and Cloudera Connector for MicroStrategy Now Available, Enabling Enterprises to Unlock Valuable Business Insight from Structured and Unstructured Data Sets
Palo Alto, Ca. and Tysons Corner, Va., October 12, 2011 – Cloudera Inc., the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, and MicroStrategy® Incorporated (Nasdaq: MSTR), a leading worldwide provider of business intelligence (BI) software, today announced an integration that enables companies to unlock valuable business insight from structured and unstructured data stored in Apache Hadoop.
With minimal programming skills or experience required in using Hadoop, MicroStrategy customers can now quickly and easily generate intuitive reports from large volumes of data without having to write HiveQL or MapReduce programs. MicroStrategy has developed Very Large Database Drivers (VLDB) specifically for Cloudera that generate optimized queries for Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH). MicroStrategy’s robust business intelligence platform in combination with Cloudera’s expansive data analysis platform delivers a powerful solution that enables organizations to easily reveal the valuable business insight hidden in their large, highly complex data sets, combine data from Hadoop with corporate data warehouses or other data sources, and deploy BI applications within and outside the organization.
In addition, Cloudera now distributes an open database connectivity (ODBC) driver—the Cloudera Connector for MicroStrategy—that was developed in conjunction with, and has been fully certified by, both MicroStrategy and Cloudera. The connector allows MicroStrategy customers to extract and deliver actionable insights from massive data sets stored in Hadoop.
“With this integration, MicroStrategy allows its customers to access and analyze the hundreds of terabytes of data stored in Hadoop, and transform that data into valuable insights to make timely business decisions,” said Sanju Bansal, MicroStrategy Chief Operating Officer. “MicroStrategy helps companies unlock the value of big data to grow their business, gain a competitive edge, and monetize customer relationships.”
“Both unstructured and structured data is multiplying rapidly within nearly every enterprise organization. Customers are seeking new ways to leverage all of their data to drive actionable insight,” said Ed Albanese, head of business development at Cloudera. “We are pleased to deliver the Cloudera Connector for MicroStrategy, which marks an important step in helping companies to access, visualize and understand data stored in Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop as easily as they view data stored in any existing structured database.”

MicroStrategy software enables leading organizations worldwide to analyze the vast amounts of data stored across their enterprises to make better business decisions. The MicroStrategy platform delivers actionable information to business users via the web and mobile devices, including the iPad, iPhone, and BlackBerry.
