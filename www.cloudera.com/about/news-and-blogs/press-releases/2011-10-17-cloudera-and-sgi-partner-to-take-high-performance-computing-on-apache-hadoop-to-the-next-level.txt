Cloudera and SGI Partner to Take High Performance Computing on Apache Hadoop to the Next Level






 









Under Strategic Distribution Agreement, SGI Will Ship Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop and Cloudera Enterprise Management Suite Factory-installed On SGI Hadoop Clusters
Palo Alto, CA and Fremont, CA, October 17, 2011 – Cloudera Inc., the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, and SGI (NASDAQ: SGI), the trusted leader in technical computing, today jointly announced that their companies have signed an agreement for SGI to distribute Cloudera software pre-installed on SGI® Hadoop Clusters. SGI, which recently set a world record performance benchmark for Terasort data processing and analysis leveraging Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH) and is a member of the Cloudera Connect Partner Program, will resell and offer level one support for Cloudera software and services – including Cloudera University training courses – to its customers. The relationship will also enable the two companies to jointly build, sell and deploy integrated, high performance Apache Hadoop-based commercial solutions.
Apache Hadoop is a powerful and disruptive open source technology that addresses the economic, flexibility and scalability issues surrounding massive amounts of enterprise data and enables actionable insights to be derived from structured and unstructured data sets. Hadoop, which forms the infrastructure foundation of many of the world’s leading social media companies, including Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, has rapidly become a leading solution to the new challenges generated by Big Data.
Together, SGI Hadoop clusters and Cloudera’s software, services and support form a complete, end-to-end solution for enterprises deploying Apache Hadoop in performance-intensive environments. As the global leader in technical computing, SGI was among the first technology vendors to embrace and proliferate the use of Apache Hadoop in the Federal and enterprise sectors, and is currently running the largest Hadoop clusters servers in the world. Cloudera has pioneered the use of Apache Hadoop in business applications and was first to make Hadoop enterprise-ready, delivering best of breed management software, support and training services. CDH is the most widely deployed Hadoop distribution in both commercial and non-commercial environments, bundling 100% pure open source Apache Hadoop with other leading open source components in the Hadoop stack.
“We understand the power of Hadoop. Since the technology’s inception, we have successfully deployed tens of thousands of Hadoop servers to our customers,” said Bill Mannel, vice president of product marketing at SGI. “Leveraging Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop together with our SGI Hadoop Cluster, we achieved a world record Hadoop benchmark for data processing and analysis – 81% faster than the competition. CDH, combined with Cloudera’s management suite, puts the promise and potential of Hadoop – and the complete Hadoop stack – within reach. We are pleased to work with Cloudera, and together, we are enabling our mutual customers to streamline the path to putting Hadoop to work for their businesses.”
“The combination of Cloudera’s market-leading software with SGI’s first-class products and reputation in the HPC market enables global access and delivery capacity for Apache Hadoop in stalwart HPC verticals, including defense, intelligence, research and telecommunications,” said Ed Albanese, Head of Business Development for Cloudera. “This partnership enables Cloudera to better serve a segment of customers accustomed to factory-installed products and solution-oriented delivery. We’re pleased that SGI has selected Cloudera products and will offer these products as a bundled component of their proven server line.”
