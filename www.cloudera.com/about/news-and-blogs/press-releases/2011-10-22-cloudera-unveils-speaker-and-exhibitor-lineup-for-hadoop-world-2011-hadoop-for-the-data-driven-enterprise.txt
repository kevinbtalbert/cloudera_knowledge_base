The assembled experts in attendance at Hadoop World will provide valuable insights into how businesses can make the most of Hadoop clusters, irrespective of how far along they are in the deployment process.”
Attendees of Hadoop World 2011 will benefit from Apache Hadoop-focused learning, networking and training experience. The two-day event will offer real-world use cases across a variety of industries, with technical deep dives on the latest advancements in the Hadoop stack.
