Cloudera Gears Up for Record Attendance at Its Third Annual Hadoop World Conference in NYC






 









Cloudera Gears Up for Record Attendance at Its Third Annual Hadoop World Conference in NYC
PALO ALTO, CA – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, is gearing up for its third annual Hadoop World conference  in New York City, November 8 and 9. The sold out event brings together some of the  most influential voices in data management and business intelligence along with more than 1400 attendees, and the two-day event is the largest gathering of practitioners, developers, influencers and vendors in the Hadoop ecosystem.
The conference offers 60 educational breakout sessions across five tracks, each exploring the conference theme: Hadoop for the Data-Driven Enterprise.Keynote addresses are slated from Cloudera CEO Mike Olson; Cloudera Chief Architect and creator of Apache Hadoop Doug Cutting; eBay VP of Experience, Search and Platforms Hugh Williams; Executive Vice President and CTO for Informatica James Markarian; Managing Director, Office of the CIO for JP Morgan Chase Larry Feinsmith; as well as insights from distinguished industry analysts from 451 Group, Forrester and Ovum. Educational sessions will highlight cutting edge developments in the Apache Hadoop platform and feature real-world deployment stories and use cases from British Sky Broadcasting, CBS Interactive, Cloudera, Credit Mutuel Arkea, Dell, Disney, eBay, Facebook, IBM Netezza, HP Vertica, Informatica, Intel, Jive, LinkedIn, NetApp, NTT Data, Nokia, Oracle, Orbitz, Teradata, VMware, and many more.
“Over the past year, the rest of the world has discovered ‘the secret’ of Hadoop and Big Data in general — our recent survey shows that Big Data projects in the enterprise will emerge from early adopter status in two years,” said Tony Baer, principal analyst for Ovum. “The vendor community has discovered what those on the front lines already know: there is a business case for Big Data and a place for NoSQL in the enterprise mainstream. The technology is rapidly maturing, and the time to start planning for adoption is now.”
“It’s been exciting to see the rapid adoption of Apache Hadoop, as demonstrated by the wide range of Hadoop World sessions describing production applications,” said Doug Cutting, creator of Apache Hadoop and Cloudera architect. “Hadoop World gives its attendees the tools they need to make real and lasting advancements to their organizations.”
theCube: Broadcasting Live from Hadoop World
SiliconANGLE.com‘s theCube will be broadcasting live from the event, providing in-depth editorial coverage, breaking news and analysis from the show floor. Hosts John Furrier, editor and founder of SiliconANGLE, and Dave Vellante, cofounder at Wikibon, will be delivering up-to-the-minute Hadoop World event news and updates at: https://siliconangle.tv/
“We’re excited to be bringing theCube back to Hadoop World this year,” said John Furrier, editor and founder, SiliconANGLE. “Apache Hadoop has become one of the most popular topics in Big Data. We look forward to discussing Hadoop trends and best practices, along with how Hadoop is driving the future of data analytics and business intelligence with the most influential voices in the Apache Hadoop community.”
Cloudera Developer and Administrator Training Dates
Hadoop World attendees will also have the opportunity to participate in Cloudera University’s comprehensive training courses and certification exams during the week of Hadoop World in New York City. Attendees can get formal training on Apache Hadoop, MapReduce, administration, Hive, Pig, HBase and more. Or, if attendees are up to the challenge, they can kick off the week by registering for Cloudera’s Certification Exam for Developers or Administrators, taking place Monday evening, November 7 — one of the few times this year the Cloudera certification exams will be offered outside of a Cloudera University public course.
Cloudera’s Hadoop World Conference takes place November 8-9, 2011, at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers in Manhattan.
