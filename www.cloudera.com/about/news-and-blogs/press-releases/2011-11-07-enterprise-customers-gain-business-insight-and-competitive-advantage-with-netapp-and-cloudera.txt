Enterprise Customers Gain Business Insight and Competitive Advantage With NetApp and Cloudera






 









NetApp and Cloudera Partner to Speed Deployment, Simplify Manageability, and Reduce Costs of Enterprise Hadoop Infrastructures
SUNNYVALE, CA and PALO ALTO, CA, Nov 07, 2011 - Global competition today is generating more, bigger, and more complex data than ever before, from point-of-sale data to mobile phone data to scientific and market research information. There is an opportunity for enterprise customers to exploit new ways to manage and analyze this data to spark innovation, make better decisions, and drive successful outcomes that will create a competitive business advantage. Apache Hadoop has emerged to process and analyze large, complex datasets in distributed computing environments and help businesses improve insight into their growing data.
NetApp, Inc. (NTAP) today announced a preconfigured, ready-to-deploy solution called NetApp(R) Open Solution for Hadoop that will enable customers to maximize the value of their enterprise Hadoop implementations with improved flexibility and performance and lower total cost of ownership. NetApp and Cloudera, Inc., teamed to distribute Cloudera’s Distribution including Apache Hadoop (CDH) and Cloudera Enterprise, a subscription service comprised of Cloudera Support and Hadoop management software, with NetApp Open Solution for Hadoop to speed enterprise deployment and production use of Apache Hadoop.
NetApp Open Solution for Hadoop Removes Barriers to Analyzing Data
NetApp Open Solution for Hadoop is a packaged, ready-to-deploy modular Hadoop cluster for enterprise Hadoop deployments, with the following features and benefits:

Rapid deployment and simple scalability
Higher overall cluster performance
Reduced costs by providing self-healing technology, hardware RAID, and global spare drives
Lower total cost of ownership

NetApp Open Solution for Hadoop provides customers with the access and analytics to mine value from their data and to extract profit from their big-data assets. Customers can leverage their existing server and database systems for analytics on extremely large datasets and maximize the return on investment of their data over time. Now customers have a pathway to start with Hadoop.
“Customers are looking for business advantages from the wealth of their unstructured data. Today, it’s like finding a needle in a haystack,” said Rich Clifton, senior vice president and general manager, NetApp Technology Enablement and Solutions Organization. “NetApp Open Solution for Hadoop will help customers get answers fast and process more, as well as provide the reliability and performance that our customers have come to expect from NetApp.”
NetApp and Cloudera Deliver Best-in-Class Hadoop Solution
NetApp and Cloudera give organizations an open, nonproprietary solution that is highly scalable and offers enterprise storage features that improve performance and reduce costs. Joint customers can leverage Hadoop to accelerate adoption of analytic applications that deliver real-time results across intense data and computational workloads. Together, NetApp and Cloudera are delivering an open solution that enables a best-in-class partner-based solution stack.
CDH is a major enabler for the enterprise adoption and production use of Apache Hadoop. Enterprises can manage the complete operational lifecycle of their Apache Hadoop systems because CDH facilitates deep visibility into Hadoop clusters. It also automates the ongoing system changes needed to maintain and improve the quality of operations.
“More applications work on CDH than any other Hadoop distribution, and Cloudera is real-world proven by a broad range of companies across many verticals. By partnering with NetApp, customers now have more choices and the ability to deploy an open Hadoop solution with a leading storage vendor,” said Ed Albanese, head of Business Development for Cloudera. “We’re excited about the increasing diversity of architectures that enables Hadoop to be used in more places and deliver greater infrastructure efficiency, predictability, and simplicity.”
“NetApp has a long history of supporting open standards and giving our customers the flexibility and efficiency they need to drive results from their data. Our strategy for Hadoop is no different, and we will give customers choice for their Hadoop implementations, from enterprise-class to open-source Apache Hadoop solutions,” said Clifton. “Cloudera strengthens our enterprise-ready NetApp Open Solution for Hadoop, and together we make deployment of enterprise Hadoop easier, simplify management, and reduce the cost of deployments.”
