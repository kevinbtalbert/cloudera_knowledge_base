Oracle Selects Cloudera to Provide Apache Hadoop Distribution and Tools for Oracle Big Data Appliance






 









Redwood Shores, CA and Palo Alto, CA – January 10, 2012 – Oracle and Cloudera, a leader in Apache Hadoop-based software and services for the enterprise, today announced a joint agreement to provide an Apache Hadoop distribution and tools for Oracle Big Data Appliance. Oracle has integrated Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH) and Cloudera Manager software into Oracle Big Data Appliance, an engineered system designed to provide high performance and scalable data processing environment for Big Data. Together, Oracle and Cloudera deliver the full power of Hadoop on an easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use platform.
News Facts

Oracle Big Data Appliance is an engineered system of hardware and software that incorporates Cloudera’s Distribution including Apache Hadoop and Cloudera Manager, an open source distribution of R, Oracle NoSQL Database Community Edition, Oracle HotSpot Java Virtual Machine and Oracle Linux running on Oracle’s Sun servers.
Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH) is an enterprise-ready, 100% open source distribution of Apache Hadoop. Drawing from the innovations of a diverse open source community, CDH is the most reliable, secure and widely deployed commercial distribution of Apache Hadoop for the enterprise.
The integrated Oracle and Cloudera architecture has been fully tested and validated by Oracle, who will also collaborate with Cloudera to provide support for Oracle Big Data Appliance.
Oracle today also announced Oracle Big Data Connectors, a portfolio of software products that enables customers to easily integrate data stored in CDH Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or Oracle NoSQL Database with Oracle Database 11g.
Leveraging Cloudera technology as part of the Oracle Big Data Appliance complements Oracle’s end-to-end solution for Big Data. Together with Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud and Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine, Oracle Big Data Appliance and Oracle Big Data Connectors deliver everything customers need to acquire, organize and analyze Big Data within the context of all their enterprise data.
