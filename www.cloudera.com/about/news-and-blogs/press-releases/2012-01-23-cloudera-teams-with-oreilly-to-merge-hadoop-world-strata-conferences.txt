Cloudera Teams With O’Reilly Media to Merge Hadoop World and Strata Conferences






 









PALO ALTO, CA and SEBASTOPOL, CA, Jan 23, 2012 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) – Two of the most important Big Data events will join forces in 2012: Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based software and services, and O’Reilly Media, the leader in spreading the knowledge of innovators through technology books, online services, magazines, research, and tech conferences, today jointly announce plans to merge their Hadoop World and Strata Conferences. Combining two of the industry’s premier data science events into one exceptional program, Hadoop World will now be a featured program at the 2012 Strata Conference New York, which the two companies will co-present.
Launched in February 2011, the Strata Conference has emerged as the industry-leading event that brings together practitioners, researchers, IT leaders, and entrepreneurs to discuss big data, Hadoop, analytics, visualization, data markets, and more. Hadoop World, which got its start as an annual event in 2009, was established to advance understanding and adoption of the popular open source platform, Apache Hadoop, the world’s fastest growing open source technology. For the past three years the conference has offered valuable insights and education to address the business challenges and opportunities of Big Data from some of the brightest minds and most influential voices in the data management and business intelligence communities.
“Hadoop World has always been a robust and diverse community-based event, not just another vendor user conference. In just three short years, we were able to grow it into a world-class forum with global visibility, explosive growth, and the support of a rich ecosystem of participants from both the open source and vendor communities — including partners, customers, competitors, and more. We are tremendously proud of that accomplishment,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “As the ecosystem has continued to grow and mature, it became apparent to us that, as good stewards of the community, it was time to collaborate with a leading independent organization to help shape the event’s direction and evolution. O’Reilly Media has a remarkable track record of spotting, and then explaining, the important social and technical changes that shape the industry. The synergies between Strata and Hadoop World are profound, and combining the conferences into one, comprehensive event celebrates and supports the growing number of data-driven enterprises.”
“From its launch in February 2011, Strata has been the center of the data science and Big Data communities, and we’re delighted to add the top quality content of Hadoop World to Strata. Our new combined conference will continue to be the nexus for everyone in big data and data science,” said Edd Dumbill, Strata general manager. “Today, advantage and innovation depend on filtering large amounts of information to create insight from data so plentiful and diverse it often looks like noise. Offering the ability to cheaply analyze such big data, Apache Hadoop technology has already played a pivotal role in bringing big data analysis to the industry. Cloudera has established Hadoop World as the leading Hadoop conference and we’re excited to join forces with them to continue growing the big data ecosystem.”
The Strata Conference New York will take place in New York City, October 24-25, 2012. A call for speaking proposals will open on February 28, 2012. For more information, visit: strataconf.com.
