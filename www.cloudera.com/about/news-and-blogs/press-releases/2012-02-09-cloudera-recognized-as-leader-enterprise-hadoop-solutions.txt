Cloudera Recognized as a Leader in Enterprise Hadoop Solutions by Independent Research Firm






 









According to Industry Research Report, Cloudera is the “Hadoop Pure Play Vendor with the Greatest Adoption”
Palo Alto, CA—February 9, 2012— Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based software and services, today announced that Forrester Research, Inc. has identified it as a leader in enterprise Hadoop solutions. The independent research firm published its findings in “The Forrester Wave™: Enterprise Hadoop Solutions, Q1 2012” (February 2012) report.
In the report, Forrester Research remarked: “Cloudera is a well-established startup among pure-play vendors in the emerging Hadoop solution market. Its core open source product, Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH), has strong uptake among many early adopters and is popular with cloud/SaaS providers that have built Hadoop-based services. Cloudera has software, cloud/SaaS, and appliance offerings, and a substantial and growing professional services force focused on Hadoop training and consulting.”
“Cloudera continues to be a clear and consistent leader in Apache Hadoop-based software and services. Our integrated, tested, completely open source distribution of Apache Hadoop, comprehensive suite of management applications and full range of support and services, provide enterprises with the means to quickly and easily deploy and maintain Hadoop in production,” said Charles Zedlewski, VP of Product at Cloudera. “We remain deeply committed to the Apache Hadoop open source community and an avid participant in the evolution and advancement of the project. Every component within CDH is 100% open source, and Cloudera employs leading contributors and committers across the Hadoop ecosystem and has incubated prominent projects such as Apache Flume, Sqoop and Oozie. We’re pleased to be recognized by Forrester as a leading vendor in the Enterprise Hadoop market.”
