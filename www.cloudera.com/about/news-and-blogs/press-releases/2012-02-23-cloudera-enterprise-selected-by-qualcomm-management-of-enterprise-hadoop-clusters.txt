Cloudera Enterprise Selected by Qualcomm for Comprehensive, Proactive Management of Enterprise Hadoop Clusters






 









World Leader in 3G and Next Generation Mobile Technologies Obtains Rights to Deploy Cloudera Enterprise
Palo Alto, CA – February 23, 2012 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based software and services, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) for the Cloudera Enterprise offering. Cloudera Enterprise, comprised of Cloudera Support and Cloudera Manager, is a subscription-based service designed to provide data driven enterprises with visibility, reliability, automation and support for the CDH platform (Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop), which helps Qualcomm derive meaningful insights from its Big Data. Qualcomm chose Cloudera Enterprise 3.7 to manage the HBase and Hadoop clusters of several of its new products and services under development.
“We are thrilled that Qualcomm has selected CDH as their platform for exciting new applications and that they have selected Cloudera Enterprise for their support and management needs,” said Charles Zedlewski, VP of Product at Cloudera. “Cloudera is privileged to have a rich track record of success with leaders in the telecommunications industry with more than 80% of the top North American carriers, equipment manufacturers and service providers as customers.”
Cloudera provides its customers with an enterprise-class solution that enables centralized monitoring and management of their Hadoop clusters and HBase infrastructure.
About Cloudera Enterprise 3.7
Cloudera Enterprise 3.7 is the answer for organizations looking to deploy and run Apache Hadoop at scale in production environments. Comprised of both Cloudera Manager and Cloudera Support, a subscription to Cloudera Enterprise provides data driven enterprises with the visibility, reliability and automation for the Apache Hadoop platform needed to cost-effectively derive meaningful analytics from their large unstructured and structured data sets. Features include:

Intelligent Hadoop Log Management: Gathers and scans Hadoop logs for irregularities and proactively create events for the operator.
Global Time Control: Correlates cluster-wide jobs, activities, logs, system changes, configuration changes and service metrics along a single timeline to dramatically simplify diagnosis.
Alerts: Alerts on nodes or services in poor health, as well as jobs or activities that are slow or failing; integrates with the central company alerting system.
Support Integration: Takes a snapshot of the cluster state and automatically sends it to a Cloudera support professional to assist with diagnosis and resolution.
