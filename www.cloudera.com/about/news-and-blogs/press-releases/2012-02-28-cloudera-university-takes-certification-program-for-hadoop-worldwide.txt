Cloudera University Takes Industry Leading Certification Program for Apache Hadoop Worldwide






 









Meets Market Demand for Standalone Certification Programs as Big Data Drives Rising Need for Qualified Hadoop Professionals
Palo Alto, CA – February 28, 2012 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software, services and training, announced today that its industry leading certification programs are now available worldwide. Cloudera’s Certifications for Apache Hadoop will be available both to students who have taken Cloudera University training courses and those who have learned Hadoop on their own. Exams for the two certifications, Cloudera Certified Administrator for Apache Hadoop (CCAH) and Cloudera Certified Developer for Apache Hadoop (CCDH), validate a candidate’s skills in administering or developing for Apache Hadoop clusters and will be offered at over 5,000 Pearson VUE testing centers in 165 countries. Cloudera sets the industry standard for training and certification for the complete Hadoop stack. The company has trained over 10,000 students to-date and expects to train more than 10,000 in the coming year.
“Having certified Hadoop expertise is one of the most sought after and highly paid skill sets in the IT job market today,” said Julie Lockner, senior analyst and vice president, Data Management Solutions at ESG. “Cloudera University’s newly expanded certification program puts another stake in the ground, continuing Cloudera’s industry leadership in providing the Hadoop certification and training that is a rapidly growing need in the Big Data arena.”
The new certification exams will be available worldwide starting on May 1, 2012, priced at $295 each. Complete exam objectives, sample questions, how to purchase exam vouchers and other information about Cloudera’s certifications will be available on the Cloudera University website at http://university.cloudera.com. For a limited time, students attending any Cloudera developer or administrator course will receive a voucher for the full cost of the associated exam.
Cloudera will also be providing an opt-in “confirmation of certification” service for prospective employers in order to validate an individual’s certification status.
“As Big Data requirements have exploded within the commercial, DoD and intelligence communities, our customers look to us to provide and support technologically sound Apache Hadoop-based solutions. We have been able to exceed expectations leveraging the excellent training courses and certifications provided by Cloudera,” said Lee Shabe, vice president, Data Tactics Corporation. “These respected and valued certifications have put us ahead of our competitors and enabled our employees to advance their careers.”
The shortage of IT professionals with advanced Big Data capabilities represents a common challenge for organizations who have or want to add Hadoop technology to their infrastructure. By expanding its certification offerings and making it possible for individuals with advanced Hadoop skills to officially certify their proficiency, Cloudera is generating a bigger pool of qualified candidates from which companies can choose and is increasing the number of Hadoop professionals in the market.
“There is a massive and sharply rising demand for CCDH and CCAH credentials all over the world, so we are expanding Cloudera University’s training programs to many more countries this year, and we also wanted to make certification attainable wherever in the world you happen to be,” explained Sarah Sproehnle, director of Educational Services at Cloudera. “Hadoop is an integral part of the rapidly growing Big Data landscape, and Hadoop training and certification are absolutely critical to both successful enterprise deployments and ongoing management of this technology.”
