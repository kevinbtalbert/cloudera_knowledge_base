Cloudera Announces HBaseCon 2012, the Industry’s First Apache HBase Community Conference






 









Palo Alto, CA – March 8, 2012 – Cloudera will be hosting HBaseCon 2012 in San Francisco on May 22, 2012. HBaseCon is the first industry conference for Apache HBase users, contributors, administrators and application developers. The HBaseCon program committee is comprised of Apache HBase PMC members who are developing a robust line-up of educational talks and workshops that will share practical insights as well as illustrative use cases. Attendees can look forward to general sessions in the morning and an afternoon comprised of three tracks focused on: Development, Operations and Applications for HBase.
“It’s going to be a great day out for the community. Anyone with any kind of an HBase itch at all whether apps, ops or dev should be sure to drop by,” said Michael Stack, engineer at StumbleUpon and champion of the HBase community. “Our goals with HBaseCon are to give the attendees a platform for connecting with their peers and sharing experiences with this technology and to ultimately advance the development of HBase.”
The theme of this first HBaseCon is “Real-Time Your Hadoop,” and the conference will be a culmination of the best of the community and will include speakers and sponsors from across the HBase landscape. “This event is all about bringing together the great and inquiring minds that use HBase and strengthening community support,” said Todd Lipcon, software engineer at Cloudera and Apache HBase committer.
“There is a whole ecosystem being created around HBase, and the community is thriving and incredibly involved,” said Lars George, solutions architect for Cloudera and author of HBase: The Definitive Guide. “HBaseCon will bring the community together in a collaborative and resourceful way, and I look forward to being a part of this first conference.”
“Cloudera is proud to continue its support of the Apache HBase community by hosting HBaseCon,” said Charles Zedlewski, VP of Product at Cloudera. “Cloudera was the first company to provide an Apache Hadoop based distribution with support for HBase and a great many Cloudera employees are committers and contributors to the Apache HBase project. HBase has enjoyed exceptional adoption in the enterprise as a platform for real-time Big Data management and has become an essential element of any enterprise distribution.”
Early bird registration ends April 6 and there is a discounted price for contributors. Sponsorship opportunities are currently open and more information can be found here: http://www.hbasecon.com/sponsors/
HBaseCon takes place May 22, 2012, at the InterContinental Hotel in San Francisco. For more information please visit: http://www.hbasecon.com/
Cloudera will also offer a hands-on HBase training session after the conference, May 23 and 24, 2012 for developers already familiar with Apache Hadoop. For more information please visit: http://www.hbasecon.com/training/.
