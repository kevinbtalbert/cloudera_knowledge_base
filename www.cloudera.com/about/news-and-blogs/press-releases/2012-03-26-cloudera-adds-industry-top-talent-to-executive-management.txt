Cloudera Adds Industry’s Top Talent to Executive Management Team






 









Alan Saldich to Lead Marketing, Tim Stevens to Drive Business and Corporate Development
Palo Alto, CA – March 26, 2012 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software, services and training, today announced the continued expansion of its executive management team with the appointment of Alan Saldich as Vice President of Marketing and Tim Stevens as Vice President of Business and Corporate Development. The two seasoned industry veterans have joined Cloudera on the heels of the company’s recent successes, including a $40 million Series D funding round and significant partnerships with technology leaders including Dell, NetApp, Oracle and SGI.
Alan Saldich served as Vice President of Product Marketing at Riverbed Technology, a 1,400-employee public company that develops high performance IT infrastructure solutions. With over 22 years of experience, he has held a variety of leadership roles in marketing, finance and operations at eight companies. He ran Product Marketing at Riverbed from 2002 when he was the first employee hired by the two founders, until late 2009. By then it was a global public company, generating about $400 million in annual revenues. Saldich holds a B.Sc. in mechanical engineering from University of California, Berkeley, and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.
“The Big Data revolution is the most important development in IT in the last decade, and Apache Hadoop is the foundation of this phenomenon,” said Alan Saldich, Vice President of Marketing at Cloudera. “I’m extremely excited to join Cloudera, which has by far the top technical team in the Apache Hadoop space. Furthermore, Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop is the only complete solution available, and it’s by far the most popular in the marketplace. I’m really looking forward to helping Cloudera extend its lead and help more enterprise customers extract real value from the oceans of data they already have.”
Tim Stevens joins Cloudera from QuinStreet, where he served as Senior Vice President of Business and Corporate Development, as well as President of International Operations, all in support of the company going public during his tenure. At QuinStreet, Stevens oversaw more than 100 business partnerships and acquisitions and spearheaded the launch and management of QuinStreet’s international operations. Prior to QuinStreet, Stevens served as Senior Vice President of Business Services at Borland Software and Senior Vice President of Business Development at Inktomi. He started his career as a corporate and securities lawyer at Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati. Stevens holds B.S. degrees in Finance and Management from the University of Oregon and a J.D. degree from the University of California, Davis.
“Cloudera is enabling enterprises to leverage their data in remarkable ways to achieve new levels of innovation and business value that were never before possible,” said Tim Stevens, Vice President of Business and Corporate Development at Cloudera. “I am proud to be joining Cloudera and look forward to working with Cloudera’s partners to build and strengthen our world class partner ecosystem to help speed the development and adoption of Apache Hadoop in the enterprise.”
“Both Alan and Tim are industry leaders with exceptional track records, and their experience and expertise will be significant to Cloudera’s success during this phase of rapid growth and expansion,” said Mike Olson, CEO at Cloudera. “We welcome Alan and Tim to our management team and look forward to the positive impact each will have on extending Cloudera’s market leadership.”
