Cloudera Selected by AlwaysOn as an OnDemand Top 100 Winner






 









Recognized for Industry Leadership, Game-Changing Strategy and Technology in Hadoop Solution Market
Palo Alto, CA – March 30, 2012 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based software, services and training, today announced that AlwaysOn named the company as an OnDemand Top 100 winner for 2012. Inclusion in the OnDemand 100 signifies leadership amongst peers and recognizes game-changing approaches and technologies likely to disrupt existing markets and entrenched players. Cloudera was selected by the AlwaysOn editorial team and industry experts worldwide based on a set of five criteria: innovation, market potential, commercialization, stakeholder value and media buzz.
“Digital information has expanded exponentially during the past year. As the emergence of robust, innovative apps needed to manage this information continues, a complex world of interconnected business intelligence and ideas is being created at a new macro level,” said Tony Perkins, founder and editor of AlwaysOn. “This year’s OnDemand 100 winners are continuing to use disruptive technology and ideas to merge valuable legacy data and systems with new, vital streams of information. The results are being deployed in the cloud by any number of SaaS products and services, changing the way all businesses coexist. The OnDemand 100 continues to represent some of the highest-growth opportunities in the private company marketplace.”
“We’re pleased and proud to be recognized as an OnDemand Top 100 company,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “Enterprises today have a huge challenge; they’re collecting more information from more sources than ever before, but they are struggling to store and understand all of it. Cloudera offers software and services that unlock the enormous value in Big Data for our customers. The recognition by AlwaysOn is a strong endorsement of what we do and a clear acknowledgment that Big Data is changing the business landscape.”
Cloudera and the OnDemand Top 100 companies will be honored at AlwaysOn’s OnDemand event on April 4, 2012, at Hewlett-Packard’s Executive Briefing Center in Cupertino, CA. The OnDemand 100 winners were selected from among hundreds of other technology companies nominated by investors, bankers, journalists and industry insiders. The AlwaysOn editorial team conducted a rigorous three-month selection process to finalize the 2012 list.
