Cloudera Announces New Japanese Subsidiary






 









Cloudera KK to Help Spur Hadoop Adoption in APAC Region
PALO ALTO, CA AND TOKYO, JAPAN – April 25, 2012 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software, services and training, today announced that it has established a Japanese subsidiary, Cloudera KK, and an office in Japan. Cloudera’s formal presence extends availability of its products and support offerings to Japanese enterprises that have deployed or are seeking to deploy Apache Hadoop and related technologies in the Hadoop stack to unlock business insights from their Big Data.
To provide Hadoop enterprise support services in Japan, Cloudera KK is working with NTT DATA and Nippon Steel Solutions Corporation.
“We believe that the presence of Cloudera KK will significantly propel Hadoop deployments and its application in Big Data forward in Japan,” said Mr. Hiroshi Endo, Senior Vice President Senior Executive Manager System Platforms Sector, NTT DATA. “We are excited to work closely together to deliver superior support services and solutions for enterprises, and also to promote open source software such as Apache Hadoop-based solutions. NTT DATA looks forward to the global development of the Hadoop platform. By partnering with the industry leader, Cloudera, we are able to address the growing demand of enterprise customers for a more effective approach to Hadoop.”
“We welcome the establishment of Cloudera in Japan, and we strongly believe that sophisticated utilization of Big Data technology is a critical element for growth and innovation of Japanese enterprises. We are truly pleased to work closely with Cloudera and its industry-standard Apache Hadoop distribution and enterprise services and training,” said Yutaka Miyabe, Senior Executive Director, NS Solutions. “As a partner of Cloudera we will provide distribution, consulting and technical support services in Japan and will encourage the broader use of Apache Hadoop technology by Japanese enterprises.”
In addition to business development, sales and marketing for the Japanese market, Cloudera Japan offers local technical support and local classes and certification from Cloudera University, the most established and industry-recognized training and certification for Apache Hadoop and related technologies. To date, there are more than 200 Cloudera University-certified Hadoop engineers in Japan, and Cloudera is committed to providing more training and certification resources across the region.
“We view establishing operations in Japan as a vital step in Cloudera’s global expansion, and we’re proud that Cloudera Japan marks our first formal entity abroad,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “Our presence in Japan will provide increased support, software, training and availability of services for Apache Hadoop users and will foster wider adoption of Apache Hadoop-based solutions. We will be focusing significant attention on Cloudera’s growth in this market, and we look forward to building new partnerships and engaging new customers.”
Giuseppe Kobayashi will lead the ongoing expansion of the company’s presence in Japan as the Representative Director of Cloudera Japan. His proven track record in executive management of U.S. high tech firms establishing business in Japan will help to accelerate Cloudera’s growth in this market.
“Cloudera drives the industry standard for Hadoop and Big Data across all markets and is unrivaled in its longstanding reliability, integrity and commitment to its partners and customers,” said Kobayashi. “As demand for Big Data in Japan continues to grow, Cloudera’s presence will empower Japanese enterprises to implement Hadoop and explore machine data that was previously left idle. I look forward to contributing to the company’s aggressive growth and expansion and to seeing where the Big Data revolution will go in Japan.”
