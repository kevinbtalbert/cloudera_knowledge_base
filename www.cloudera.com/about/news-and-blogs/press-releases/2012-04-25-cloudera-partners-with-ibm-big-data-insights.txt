Cloudera Partners with IBM to Bring Big Data Insights to Joint Customers






 









Leading Hadoop-based Software, Services and Training Company Continues to Expand Partner Ecosystem
PALO ALTO, CA – April 25, 2012 – Cloudera, the leading provider of enterprise-grade Apache Hadoop data management software, services and training, today announced it is partnering with IBM to integrate Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH) and Cloudera Manager with IBM’s Big Data platform. Together, these technologies will deliver a world-class solution that enables organizations across sectors to harness the transformative power of Big Data analytics.
The Cloudera and IBM partnership will provide customers with unique advantages:

IBM BigInsights will run on CDH and Cloudera Manager, pushing the limits of high performance, scalability and platform extensibility.
All customers will benefit from a complete solution which will include the most widely deployed and feature complete Hadoop platform, BI capabilities (BigSheets, text analytics) and connectors to IBM Netezza, IBM DB2, IBM InfoSphere Warehouse and IBM Smart Analytics System.
Customers will be able to go beyond business analytics into the world of next-gen applications that innovate on data.

“Big Data is more than a challenge; it is an opportunity to find insight in new and emerging types of data, to make your business more agile, and to answer questions that, in the past, were beyond reach,” said Rob Thomas, VP of Business Development, IBM. “IBM’s platform for Big Data uses technologies like Hadoop to open the door to a world of possibilities, and by partnering with Cloudera, we are empowering our customers with more choices when deploying this game-changing technology.”
“For those customers who prefer IBM, they will be able to choose our industry leading platform for Hadoop and have more options when deploying business analytics,” said Tim Stevens, VP of Business and Corporate Development at Cloudera. “As the leading Hadoop vendor, Cloudera is committed to developing a Hadoop ecosystem that supports a broad set of applications and industries.”
