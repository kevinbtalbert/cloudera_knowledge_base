Cloudera Partners With Hadoop Managed Services Provider MetaScale to Help Large Traditional Enterprises Adopt Apache Hadoop






 









MetaScale Joins Cloudera Connect Partner Program
PALO ALTO, CA–(Marketwire – May 17, 2012) – Cloudera Inc, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software, services and training, today announced that Hadoop managed services provider MetaScale has joined Cloudera’s rapidly growing partner ecosystem, Cloudera Connect. MetaScale specializes in solutions for traditional brick-and-mortar enterprises across all industry verticals looking to efficiently establish and grow their Big Data expertise, experience immediate tactical success and begin to build out their fundamental Big Data capability in an organized and precise fashion. As the only company able to provide a full spectrum of services focused on Big Data in the virtual private cloud, MetaScale is partnering with industry leader Cloudera to enable customers to take advantage of Hadoop without an upfront investment in skills and resources.
“As we’ve witnessed firsthand, traditional enterprises are faced with an overwhelming number of challenges when building Hadoop clusters, as well as a shortage of skilled Hadoop workers. The partnership between MetaScale and Cloudera solves these issues by combining Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH), Cloudera Enterprise management software and Cloudera University training programs with MetaScale’s ability to host managed Hadoop clusters and associated data management technologies in the cloud,” said Krishna Nimmagadda, Head of Marketing and Business Development at MetaScale. “We’re empowering our customers to ask questions they couldn’t ask before and learn more from their data and their customers to potentially create new business models, increase revenues and reduce costs and complexities.”
MetaScale’s services include building and configuring Hadoop clusters; operating, managing and monitoring the cluster; integrating with other data management technologies; running data-cleansing and other data management projects; writing and developing MapReduce applications; and custom solution design and system integration. MetaScale, a subsidiary of Sears Holdings has deep expertise in providing data management services based on the Apache Hadoop framework. The company’s Hadoop Center of Excellence runs Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH) and has worked closely with Cloudera in providing Hadoop support to Sears’ companies for many years.
“MetaScale is opening the door for large-scale traditional enterprises that haven’t taken advantage of or investigated the potential of Apache Hadoop to benefit immediately from Hadoop and Big Data analytics in the cloud with a minimum IT investment,” said Tim Stevens, Vice President of Business and Corporate Development at Cloudera. “We’re excited to be working closely with MetaScale and look forward to the benefits that our mutual customers can reap from this partnership.”
About MetaScale
MetaScale provides best-in-class, technology-managed services and solutions to enterprises that are looking to unlock the potential in their data without the time, cost and complexity associated with traditional big data initiatives. MetaScale delivers an end-to-end solution so time is better spent analyzing and driving business value from big data. MetaScale provides a full spectrum of services in a private cloud that leverages Hadoop, and helps businesses perform complex analytics and batch-production schedules not possible prior to Hadoop. Part of the Sears Holdings family of companies (Sears Holdings Corporation-NASDAQ SHLD), MetaScale offers a mix of speed, scale, skills, and end-to-end solutions unavailable anywhere else in the big data space.
