Cloudera Named a Finalist for the 2012 Red Herring Top 100 Americas Award






 









Cloudera Acknowledged as a Leader Among Top 100 Most Innovative and Promising Technology Ventures in North America
PALO ALTO, CA – May 18, 2012 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based software, services and training, today announced it has been selected as a finalist for Red Herring’s Top 100 Americas award, a prestigious list honoring the year’s most promising private technology companies from the North American business region. As a finalist, Cloudera will be presenting to the Red Herring judges in Santa Monica on May 23, 2012.
The Red Herring editorial team selected the most innovative companies from a pool of hundreds from across North America. The nominees are evaluated on both quantitative and qualitative criteria, such as financial performance, technology innovation, quality of management, execution of strategy, and integration into their respective industries. This unique assessment of potential is complemented by a review of the actual track record and standing of a company, which allows Red Herring to see past the “buzz” and make the list a valuable instrument for discovering and advocating the greatest business opportunities in the industry.
“We’re very pleased that Red Herring has recognized Cloudera as a finalist for this prestigious award,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “We’ve been working for years with innovative companies to extract real value from Big Data. Our open source software platform, our enterprise-grade management software and our services and training are deployed across an enormous range of companies and a variety of vertical markets to handle diverse workloads. Demand for Big Data solutions is exploding. Red Herring’s acknowledgment is a welcome validation of what we are doing and is a testament to the game-changing potential of Big Data.”
“This year was very rewarding,” said Alex Vieux, publisher and Chairman of Red Herring. “There are so many great companies producing truly innovative and amazing products and technologies. We had a very difficult time narrowing the field and selecting the finalists from such a group of future stars. Cloudera shows great promise and therefore deserves to be on the short list. Now we are faced with the difficult task of selecting the Top 100 winners.”
Finalists for the 2012 edition of the Red Herring 100 Americas award are selected based upon their technological innovation, management strength, market size, investor record, customer acquisition, and financial health. During the several months leading up to the announcement, hundreds of companies in the, security, Web 2.0, software, hardware, life sciences, cloud, mobile and other sectors completed their submissions to qualify for the award.
The finalists are asked to present their winning strategies at the Red Herring Americas Forum in Santa Monica, California, May 21-23, 2012. The Top 100 winners will be announced at a special awards ceremony the evening of May 23 at the event.
