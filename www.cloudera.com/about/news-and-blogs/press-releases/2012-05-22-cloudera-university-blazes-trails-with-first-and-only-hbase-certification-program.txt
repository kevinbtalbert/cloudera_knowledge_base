Cloudera University Blazes Trails with First and Only HBase Certification Program






 









Cloudera Expands Market Leading Global Training and Certification Offerings In Anticipation of Upsurge in Demand for HBase Expertise
PALO ALTO, CA – May 22, 2012 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software, services and training, today announced the introduction of the Cloudera Certified Specialist in Apache HBase (CCSHB) credential. This Certification will be awarded to individuals who pass a comprehensive exam covering all aspects of Apache HBase, delivered at Pearson VUE test centers worldwide. The CCSHB certification joins the existing Cloudera Certified Developer for Apache Hadoop (CCDH) and Cloudera Certified Administrator for Apache Hadoop (CCAH) certification programs.
“It is essential that more people are trained on HBase as the opportunities for the use of this technology in production are multiplying rapidly,” said Jean-Daniel Cryans, Database Engineer at StumbleUpon. “This is why I have participated in creating this certification program and look forward to the further collaboration and developments that are sure to follow. The CCSHB exam was shaped with the assistance of members from the community; those who pass it prove that they can be trusted to handle your big data.”
HBase, often called ‘the Hadoop database,’ is a non-relational database providing high-speed lookup, insertion, modification and deletion of large amounts of data stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System. It is in heavy use at many large organizations.
Over the last three years, Cloudera has seen the popularity of HBase explode as it has matured into an enterprise-ready data store for low latency access to big data. It’s been tremendously exciting to work at the forefront of this new technology, and I’m thrilled to see the expansion of Cloudera’s leading edge HBase training and certification programs,” said Todd Lipcon, Cloudera Engineer and member of the HBase Project Management Committee.
“Interest in HBase continues to grow dramatically, especially over the last year, and companies need to recruit staff who already have a deep understanding of the product,” said Sarah Sproehnle, Director of Educational Services at Cloudera. “Cloudera University is the most mature and established training program for Apache Hadoop and related technologies in the world, with over 12,000 people coming through our curriculum in the past three years. Given our experience and time in the market, we are able to pioneer new training programs and certifications in a way that no other company can.”
Pricing and Availability
The CCSHB exam costs $145. It is currently in private beta and will be publicly available on July 1st. It will be available as a standalone certification or packaged with other training and certification offerings. As a special offer, all attendees at HBaseCon 2012 in San Francisco will receive a voucher to take the exam for 50% off the standard price.
