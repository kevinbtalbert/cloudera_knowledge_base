Peter Cooper-Ellis Joins Cloudera Executive Team as Vice President of Engineering






 









VMware, BEA Systems and SpringSource Veteran Brings 30 Years of Enterprise Software and Open Source Experience
PALO ALTO, CA – May 22, 2012 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software and services, has named industry veteran Peter Cooper-Ellis as the company’s Vice President of Engineering.
Prior to joining Cloudera as Vice President of Engineering, Cooper-Ellis was Vice President of Engineering for the Cloud Application Platform Division of VMware, where he led the acquisition of Gemfire, a distributed in-memory data grid. Before his tenure at VMware, he served as Senior Vice President of Products for SpringSource (acquired by VMware in 2009) where he managed the Spring Framework open source project, led the development of tcServer, the SpringSource enterprise distribution of Apache Tomcat, and was a member of the leadership team that grew the SpringSource open source community to 3 million developers. Previous to SpringSource, Cooper-Ellis was Executive Vice President and General Manager for the WebLogic Server product line at BEA Systems. While at BEA, he was recognized for growing the WebLogic Server Unit business from its inception to the creation of BEA’s flagship product, BEA WebLogic Server, the world’s leading Java application server. He had management responsibility for more than one dozen acquisitions and was responsible for growing the engineering organization from 60 to more than 500 engineers.
“Since Cloudera’s very first days, we have concentrated on building an exceptional engineering team,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “That focus is a big part of the reason for our success to date. We continue to grow quickly in every metric that matters – in the number and capability of our products, in our customer base, in headcount in every department and particularly in product development. We must continue to hire, retain and manage the top technical talent in the industry. Peter is a seasoned leader with a remarkable record of success in doing just that. His deep experience with open source software and his long career building top-quality enterprise products makes him the ideal person to lead Cloudera’s engineering organization.”
“Cloudera is a company on the rise, with skyrocketing team growth, diverse product lines and significant strategic partnerships,” said Peter Cooper-Ellis, VP of Engineering at Cloudera. “It’s a terrific opportunity to be joining this team just as Cloudera is poised for takeoff. I look forward to leveraging Cloudera’s leadership in the market to increase both innovation in the open source Apache Hadoop community, as well as market adoption of the company’s products and services.”
