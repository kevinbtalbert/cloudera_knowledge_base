Cloudera and DataSift Partner to Deliver Big Data Insights from Social Data






 









Cloudera Powers DataSift’s Hadoop Clusters and Crunches Through the Vast Volumes of Historical Data to Help Deliver Social Media Insights to DataSift Customers
PALO ALTO, CA – May 31, 2012 – Cloudera Inc., the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software, services and training, and DataSift Inc., the social data platform company, today announced that the two companies are working together to deliver business insights from one of the largest public sources of social data on the planet. DataSift is powering its Hadoop clusters with Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH), which performs the Big Data heavy lifting to help deliver DataSift’s Historics, a cloud-computing platform that enables entrepreneurs and enterprises to extract business insights from historical public tweets.
With the help of Cloudera’s technology, DataSift enables companies to extract insights from billions of public social interactions. DataSift’s powerful platform evaluates each social interaction from multiple dimensions, applying natural language processing to turn unstructured data into structured, digestible information ready for analysis to identify sentiment, topics, web-links, location and social media influence. These capabilities provide an unprecedented ability for companies to filter social data, extract meaning and create actionable insights. As the preferred and most widely deployed Hadoop platform on the market, CDH supports over half a petabyte of relevant data for DataSift.
“DataSift was founded with the vision that companies are increasingly looking to social media to provide answers to questions about their business and brand, whether that’s for social media monitoring, business intelligence, tracking breaking news or making stock-trading decisions,” said Nick Halstead, Founder and CTO at DataSift. “The integration of Cloudera’s technology into DataSift provides us with a robust, enterprise platform that enables our customers to ask and answer these questions in minutes, whether they are analyzing data from last week or last year.”
“As data continues to accumulate at an unprecedented rate, enterprises need to be able to analyze and act at an ever increasing velocity,” said Charles Zedlewski, VP of Product at Cloudera. “In partnering with DataSift, Cloudera is excited to help unlock these insights into what is rapidly becoming one of the largest bodies of social data on the planet.”
