Cloudera Connect Partner Program Drives Thriving Big Data Ecosystem






 









Industry’s Top Ecosystem of Apache Hadoop-based Solutions Signs 250 Partners in First Ten Months Since Commencement of Program
PALO ALTO, CA – June 5, 2012 – Cloudera, the category leader that is setting the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, today announced a significant milestone in the Cloudera Connect™ Partner Program, signing its 250th partner since the program commenced in August 2011. Membership in the Cloudera Connect Partner Program continues to grow rapidly across a broad range of independent hardware vendors (IHVs), independent software vendors (ISVs), technology companies, OEMs, VARs, systems integrators (SIs), services partners and training partners from the Unites States and worldwide. It is the largest and fastest growing Big Data ecosystem and is focused on both accelerating the building of new applications on the Apache Hadoop platform and promoting mainstream adoption of Cloudera’s solutions built on the Hadoop stack.
“Big Data will require a big ecosystem to make its way into the enterprise,” said Tony Baer, principal analyst at Ovum. “Enterprises demand a marketplace of tools, skills and services to take advantage of Hadoop. Cloudera is leveraging its early jumpstart in the Hadoop market with an effective partnering program that is showing true results.”
The Cloudera Connect partner program comprises an expansive ecosystem of Big Data in the development, sale, deployment and marketing of commercial solutions built on Cloudera’s Hadoop technology. A landmark for the industry, the Cloudera Connect Partner Program offers valuable content and resources such as Cloudera’s Apache Hadoop knowledge base, developer tools, technical support and training programs, as well as critical sales and marketing resources to accelerate solution integration with Cloudera’s technology. The program offers three multi-tiered partnership tracks – Certified Technology Partner, Authorized Reseller and Authorized Service Provider – each designed to speed the development and adoption of Apache Hadoop-based solutions.
“We are thrilled to welcome the 250th Cloudera Connect Partner to our industry leading program. Our vision for this program is to unite, educate and support a rich ecosystem of technology vendors, resellers and service providers to enable the development and adoption of business applications for Apache Hadoop,” said Tim Stevens, Vice President of Business and Corporate Development for Cloudera. “We’re enthusiastic about the wide adoption of Cloudera’s solutions in the marketplace and we look forward to ongoing collaboration with our partners and continued growth of this important Big Data ecosystem.
Cloudera Connect Partner Program: Benefits of Membership

Cloudera Certified Technologies have been validated to use supported APIs and to comply with current development guidelines for integration with Apache Hadoop. 
Partner Portal: Helps partners go from “zero to Hadoop” in minutes. Members receive access to valuable resources, including Cloudera’s Apache Hadoop knowledge base, free technical training resources and access to all Cloudera-issued sales enablement tools and marketing collateral.
Partner Solution Spotlight: Provides a multimedia showcase of Apache Hadoop-based offerings from vendors across the ecosystem, making it easy for prospective customers to identify relevant solutions.
Technical and Sales Resources: Online training, seminars, engineering support and more.
Cloudera Training Discounts: Partner organizations receive significant discounts on Cloudera University Hadoop training and certification programs.
Marketing Support: Access to marketing collateral, presentation materials and structured brand-use privileges help increase visibility, validation and value with publicity and joint marketing opportunities.
Lead Registration Program: A structured program designed to build a relationship of mutual profitability for partners who resell Cloudera solutions.
