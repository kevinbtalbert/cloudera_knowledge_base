Cloudera Honored by Morgan Stanley with Prestigious ‘CTO Award for Innovation’






 









PALO ALTO, CA –June 28, 2012 – Cloudera, the category leader that is setting the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, today announced that it has been awarded Morgan Stanley’s distinguished ‘CTO Award for Innovation’. Cloudera CEO Mike Olson was on-hand to accept the award, which was announced at Morgan Stanley’s 12th annual US CTO Summit on June 13th. The invitation-only event unites leading venture capitalists, key executives from established and emerging technology companies, and senior technologists from Morgan Stanley’s own IT organization for solution briefings, strategic discussions and focused networking. Each year, Morgan Stanley selects one technology vendor to receive its ‘CTO Award for Innovation,’ honoring technology solutions that have been deemed innovative and have made a significant impact on Morgan Stanley’s business.
“We are honored to be the recipients of this distinguished award from Morgan Stanley, which validates our team’s hard work in making Hadoop accessible so that all enterprises can harness the potential of Big Data,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. “Big Data is creating big challenges, but it is also offering enormous opportunities for enterprises looking to gain a competitive advantage. Our mission at Cloudera is to innovate relentlessly, so our customers can tap into those insights reliably and easily.”
Today, more than half of the Fortune 50 leverage Cloudera’s Hadoop management software and 100-percent open source distribution of Apache Hadoop. With tens of thousands of nodes in production,
Cloudera has established itself as the unequivocal category leader that is setting the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise. As a result of its ongoing innovation and strong business execution, Cloudera has more enterprise customers, users and nodes under management than all of the competitive Hadoop systems on the market today combined, and leads the industry in training, certification and contributions to open source projects across the entire Hadoop stack.
