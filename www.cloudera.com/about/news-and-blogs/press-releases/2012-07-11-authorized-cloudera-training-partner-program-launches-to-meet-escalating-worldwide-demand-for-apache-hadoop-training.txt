Authorized Cloudera Training Partner Program Launches to Meet Escalating Worldwide Demand for Apache Hadoop Training






 









Expands Cloudera University Training Reach Across 35 Countries With 15 International Training Partners, Including Global Knowledge, the Largest IT Training Provider in the World
PALO ALTO, CA–(Marketwire – Jul 11, 2012) - Cloudera, the category leader that sets the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, today announced a new training partner program that will enable the company to expand its global training footprint to help fulfill the growing need for IT professionals with Big Data skills. The Authorized Cloudera Training Partner (ACTP) program is a growing network of established training partners throughout North America, South America, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East that deliver Cloudera’s training courses for Apache Hadoop and support Cloudera’s global certification offerings. Through these partnerships, Cloudera now offers training in English, Japanese, German, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian and Dutch, with courses in Hebrew, Polish and Italian coming soon. To date, more than 12,500 professionals have already been trained through Cloudera University, and with the increased scale available through its global training channel, Cloudera expects to see that number double in 2013.
Global Knowledge, the leading provider of IT training worldwide, headlines the growing list of ACTP organizations, offering Cloudera’s comprehensive Apache Hadoop training curriculum to customers in both classroom and live online formats in 33 countries and growing.
“We are excited to join forces with Cloudera to support market demand for Cloudera’s training for Apache Hadoop,” said Brian K. Branson, Global Knowledge President and CEO. “As Big Data management technologies evolve, the need for skilled personnel is critical. With Cloudera’s Big Data solutions and Global Knowledge’s tremendous reach and scale, our affiliation is a natural fit to help companies around the globe stay competitive.”
“In order to meet the growing demand for CDH-based Hadoop Big Data solutions, Cloudera is excited to partner with the world’s leading IT training provider,” said Omer Trajman, Cloudera Vice President of Technology Solutions. “Because of their instructors’ strong IT backgrounds and Hadoop experience, as well as the company’s global footprint, Global Knowledge is a key member of our Authorized Cloudera Training Partner program as we expand across the globe and add breadth and depth to our training offerings.”
All ACTP members undergo the same rigorous certification process as internal Cloudera instructors and have access to subject matter experts within Cloudera. Individuals taking courses through ACTPs will experience the same quality as those who attend courses delivered directly by Cloudera. 
“One of our main goals as an organization is to realize growth by adding vendor partners that complement our existing solutions,” said Hees Ham, co-CEO of ExitCertified Corporation. “Apache Hadoop is an emerging technology that is seeing a lot of demand in the IT market space right now, so we were thrilled to be North America’s first Authorized Cloudera Training Partner.”
“We are seeing incredible interest across the globe from enterprise-level organizations trying to deploy Hadoop-based solutions. As such, professionals with Big Data skills continue to be sought after at an ever-increasing rate,” said Trajman. “Cloudera is dedicated to working closely with our Authorized Cloudera Training Partners to create an ecosystem of globally available, reliable training options that deliver the same high standard of training on Apache Hadoop that our students have come to expect from us.”

Additional Quotes from ACTP Partners
Muggie Van Staden, Managing Director, Obsidian (South Africa)
“Obsidian is excited to work together with Cloudera in bringing its training and certification around Apache Hadoop to the Southern African market. Obsidian always strives to provide the best training on enterprise open source solutions, and the Cloudera offering fits perfectly.”
Rob Dielmans, Business Development Manager, Xebia (France, Netherlands, Belgium)
“Our clients truly believe that Hadoop will be a game changer in their industry because it gives them the power to understand their customers and take advantage of new opportunities. The lack of expertise in Europe is the only thing hindering their rapid adoption of Hadoop, so becoming a Cloudera training partner was a logical step in removing this obstacle.”
Shashin Shah, Alliances, Director, OSSCube (India)
“The high quality training we have received from Cloudera has enabled us to setup a Big Data Centre of Excellence from which we share this knowledge with Apache Hadoop users throughout India. Cloudera’s training for this technology is allowing us to take new solutions to clients to solve their data problems in new, faster and innovative ways.”
Michael Jiang, Alliance Manager, BroadenGate (China)
“Through our affiliation with Cloudera, the industry leader in Apache Hadoop training and certification, we are able to help Chinese customers unlock the value hidden in their Big Data sets, and help them differentiate themselves from their competition.”
Sidney Minassian, Founder & CEO, Contexti (Australia)
“For Contexti, deciding to become a Cloudera Training Partner was a simple decision. We spoke to end customers from a number of training providers and found Cloudera’s graduates were raving fans of the content and the hands-on delivery format, and would recommend the course to their friends. We are excited to be offering Cloudera’s training in Australia and Asia.”
Sourygna Luangsay, IT Manager, Pragsis (Spain)
“The growing amount of information in the Spanish market requires new computing and business requirements that cannot be solved by existing technologies. These new needs have generated demand for novel technologies, such as Hadoop, which inevitably require specialized training programs in Big Data technologies. Making use of this technology, companies can generate never-imagined businesses and opportunities that provide a significant, competitive advantage over competitors. For that reason, Pragsis firmly believes Cloudera’s Hadoop training is needed to make the most of this powerful technology.”
Ong Hui Beng, Director, SoftSource (Singapore)
“Cloudera is well known as the leading provider of Apache Hadoop software, services, and training. SoftSource Solutions is pleased to be partnering Cloudera to promote high quality Hadoop training and certification in Singapore. The Cloudera-SoftSource training partnership will help increase the supply and professionalism of Hadoop practitioners, and Hadoop awareness in this region, ultimately leading to a win-win situation for both vendors and users of Hadoop in Big Data applications.”
Dario Buzzi, Managing Director and Sales Executive Director, GCI (Italy)
“In Italy we are working with major financial, retail, and pharmaceutical organizations to implement Big Data practices that will help improve their business. Including Cloudera’s training for Apache Hadoop in these engagements is critical for our customers, as it helps to create the in-house expertise necessary to manage and develop their Big Data projects.”
