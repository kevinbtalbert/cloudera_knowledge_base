Logica and Cloudera partner to help clients access the benefits of Big DataStrategic collaboration will deliver analytics and information management solutions with Apache Hadoop integration for enterprise clients






 









Strategic collaboration will deliver analytics and information management solutions with Apache Hadoop integration for enterprise clients
LONDON, UK and PALO ALTO, CA – JULY 23, 2012 – Logica, a global provider of business and technology services, and Cloudera, Inc., the category leader that is setting the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, have announced a Europe-wide strategic partnership enabling clients to realise the full potential of Big Data.
Intelligent exploitation of Big Data has become a strategic imperative for enterprises across industry sectors looking to compete effectively. Organisations that understand and embrace the use of their Big Data have the potential to pull ahead of their peers by improving operational efficiencies and increasing revenues. For example, McKinsey estimates that a retailer could increase their operating margin by more than 60 percent with a well implemented strategy.
This pan-European agreement will enable the two companies to jointly deliver cost-effective analytics and information management solutions that utlilise the power of Apache Hadoop on the Cloudera Enterprise platform. This will enable clients to gain completely new insights by intelligently associating enormous quantities of data, streamed from multiple disparate sources. Big Data is key to being competitive and to achieving higher growth for individual firms, and this partnership provides clients with the complementary expertise and enterprise-class production services necessary to design, implement and operate their strategies successfully.
Further, this technology will be embedded into Logica’s own industry-leading Applied Customer Insights (ACI) solution, which allows organisations to capture, interpret and act upon data acquired from the multiple places where their customers engage. By combining CDH (Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop) as a core element of ACI and with Cloudera Enterprise available as a way to optimise the Hadoop experience, Cloudera and Logica provide a uniquely powerful solution that offers customers increased performance and efficiency in large scale data management on a leading edge architecture with maximum affordability.
“Cloudera is pleased to partner with Logica, a leading global systems integrator and an innovator of cost effective information management solutions,” said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development at Cloudera. “Logica’s analytics expertise complements our proven Hadoop-based software and services, and their deep roots in Europe will enable us to rapidly expand our global footprint, extending our ability to support customers across the continent. We look forward to working closely with Logica to realise the potential of combining our industry leading solutions to leverage the power and opportunity of Big Data.”
“The market is demanding leading edge, scalable and robust Big Data solutions,” said Stéphane Jaubert, managing director at Logica. “Our partnership allows us to do this by effectively combining Cloudera’s unmatched technical capability with Logica’s extensive vertical business knowledge and broad geographical reach. Big Data is the hot topic of 2012, but without the ability to capture, interpret and act upon the data in an enterprise manner, it becomes meaningless. We see the Financial Services market as providing the biggest growth opportunity and are excited to work with Cloudera to help a wide audience reap the benefits Big Data promises.”
