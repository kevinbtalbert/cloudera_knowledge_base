Cloudera and HP Unleash the Power of Hadoop






 









Joint Solutions Simplify Hadoop Deployments, Accelerating Business Insight
PALO ALTO, CA — July 26, 2012 — Cloudera, a leading provider of enterprise Apache Hadoop software and services, and HP today announced an agreement that will enable clients to deploy, manage and scale Hadoop systems quickly to gain more effective insight from their business data.
Organizations are experiencing dramatic growth in the variety, velocity and volume of information generated by their businesses. To address the challenges of managing vast and diverse quantities of data, many organizations are implementing Hadoop, an open-source-distributed data-processing technology. Hadoop takes advantage of large clusters of industry-standard servers to create a single, highly available environment capable of storing and managing petabytes of information.
Under the terms of the joint development and licensing agreement, the two companies will deliver open standards-based reference architectures that simplify management and accelerate deployment of Hadoop Cluster environments. Clients can purchase the Cloudera Enterprise platform and future Cloudera products either directly from HP or bundled in HP AppSystem for Apache Hadoop.
“HP and Cloudera share the common goal of simplifying big data processing and analytics on Hadoop for businesses,” said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development, Cloudera. “With HP reselling the Cloudera Enterprise platform, together we provide end users with a comprehensive big data analytics solution for data integration, analysis and visualization, built natively on open source Apache Hadoop.”
Cloudera Enterprise comprises Cloudera’s Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH)—the most downloaded and used Hadoop Distribution in the world—as well as Cloudera Manager and Cloudera Production Support.
The new HP reference architecture for Apache Hadoop for Cloudera and HP AppSystem for Apache Hadoop—Cloudera are based on HP Converged Infrastructure. They include the Cloudera Enterprise platform and HP Insight Cluster Manager Utility (CMU) software.
The reseller agreement enables HP and Cloudera to preload the combined solutions at the factory, eliminating the complexities associated with deploying, implementing and managing a Hadoop cluster environment.
“Companies are increasingly turning to Apache Hadoop to help manage petabytes of information, but are finding they spend more time on operations and maintenance than on strategic data analysis,” said Paul Miller, vice president, Converged Application Systems, Enterprise Group, HP. “HP Converged Infrastructure provides a strong portfolio of comprehensive big data management tools that when combined with Cloudera’s solutions, bring the benefits of Hadoop to clients faster without the administrative burden.”
Cloudera and HP technologies enhance total cluster performance, reliability and high-availability capabilities with tools that easily move from test environments to full production. HP Insight CMU improves total cluster performance in real time with 3-D monitoring technology that quickly locates workload bottlenecks and delivers instant feedback. Cloudera Enterprise provides monitoring, configuration and management functionality that enables organizations to quickly determine the root cause of performance issues and implement corrective action as needed.
Pricing and availability
The HP reference architecture for Apache Hadoop for Cloudera is available now. Pricing varies according to location and implementation.
HP AppSystem for Apache Hadoop, preloaded with Cloudera software, is expected to be released in late 2012. Pricing will vary according to location and implementation.
HP’s premier Europe, Middle East and Africa client event, HP Discover, takes place Dec. 4-6 in Frankfurt, Germany.

The world’s largest technology company, HP brings together a portfolio that spans printing, personal computing, software, services and IT infrastructure to solve customer problems.
