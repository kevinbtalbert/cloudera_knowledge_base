Caserta Concepts Joins Cloudera Connect Partner Program






 









Data Warehouse Experts Team with Cloudera to Accelerate Adoption of Apache Hadoop-based Business Solutions.
New York, NY (PRWEB) August 06, 2012 Caserta Concepts, the industry leader in data warehousing analytics, today announced it has teamed with Cloudera, the leading provider of Apache Hadoop-based data management software, services and training, as a member of its Cloudera Connect Partner Program. The program, designed to propagate the innovative use of Apache Hadoop for a range of business applications is a comprehensive ecosystem of independent hardware vendors (IHVs), independent software vendors (ISVs), OEMs, VARs, systems integrators, (SIs), services partners and training partners. Caserta Concepts specializes in correlating traditional data with Big Data while Cloudera provides the application infrastructure for the development of industry-leading solutions.
“For clients who want to get an early competitive advantage leveraging Big Data, this partnership allows them to be even smarter about their customers, act more quickly on changes in their environment, and more accurately predict near-future demand,” said Joe Caserta, CEO and Founder of Caserta Concepts.
Caserta Concepts joins the world’s largest ecosystem of vendors and service providers driving innovation and adoption of solutions leveraging the Apache Hadoop platform. Cloudera Connect members receive unprecedented access to Cloudera’s expansive toolset of Hadoop training, knowledgebase and marketing resources.
While many clients are pursuing pure Hadoop solutions for standalone applications, many others are struggling to determine how Big Data can help improve operations with their existing customers. Caserta Concepts provide solutions that link existing enterprise data and Big Data.
“Cloudera and Caserta Concepts are empowering enterprises to explore the power of Big Data,” said Tim Stevens, Vice President of Business and Corporate Development at Cloudera. “This partnership helps clients use social data that’s linked to their existing customers to make quick, powerful and smart business decisions.”
Enterprises are now seeing the advantages of combining their own RDBMS-driven data with non-enterprise, unstructured and social data. For example, Caserta Concepts clients are mapping social data and sentiment to their own operational metrics to create new, real-time predictors of sales spikes and customer demand shifts. For these projects, Caserta Concepts creates a data warehouse architecture that uses Hadoop and Hive in concert with their clients’ RDBMS, ETL and Business Intelligence solutions – a new paradigm for information management.
About Caserta Concepts
Caserta Concepts is a specialized data warehousing consulting firm, with a network of over 200 expert MDM, data warehousing and analytics professionals, serving Fortune 1000 clients globally. Caserta Concepts collaborates with clients to access their data, generate new insights, and gain new competitive advantage. The company was created by internationally recognized data warehouse leader, Joe Caserta, in 2001.https://www.caserta.com
