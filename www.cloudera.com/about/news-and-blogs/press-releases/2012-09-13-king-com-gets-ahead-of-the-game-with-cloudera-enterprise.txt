King.com gets ahead of the game with Cloudera Enterprise






 









Gaming giant chooses Cloudera to get maximum insight from its big data
LONDON, UK and PALO ALTO, CA – SEP 13, 2012 – Cloudera, the leading provider of Hadoop-based data management software and services, today announced that King.com, one of Europe’s largest gaming companies, has implemented Cloudera Enterprise to get greater value from the massive amounts of data and information they generate from gamers across multiple platforms.
Headquartered in London and with offices in Stockholm, Bucharest, Malmo, Barcelona, Bydgoszcz, San Francisco and Hamburg, King.com is the largest European gaming company offering skill games online, social games on Facebook and also mobile games. Its award winning games, such as Bubble Witch Saga, boast over 40 million registered players. Founded in 2003, King.com’s games are all free to play; the company receives revenues through advertising and from in-game products such as boosters and extra lives. Over half of their traffic comes via Facebook today and the company has also embraced the smartphone market, with Bubble Witch Saga as their first major launch on the iOS platform. King.com has become the premiere destination for skill gaming on the internet, and the company has more than 150 games in their portfolio.
Data is one of King.com’s most business critical assets. The company relies on information from millions of gamers across multiple platforms to store game usage and advertising revenue associated with each game. Cloudera Enterprise provides King.com with valuable insight on game usage patterns and preferences, gaming behaviours such as when consumers advance or get stuck in certain game stages, as well as advanced gaming analytics. This insight in turn helps King.com to fine tune the players’ experience with existing games while fostering the development of new and better products and games. At the same time, King.com’s development teams and game designers utilize the in-depth analytics to understand everything from individuals’ gaming duration to most popular stages and hardest levels, which allows them to continuously enhance the gaming experience.
Thomas Hartwig, CTO of King.com, said: “With Hadoop we can manage vast amounts of data and create bespoke solutions for our analytics. Importantly, with the Cloudera Enterprise solution we have been able to plug in multiple data feeds such as: daily currency exchange rates from the European Central bank; multiple metadata feeds; and game, advertising and platform servers’ log files on an hourly basis. With over 3 billion games being played every month we needed a scalable, robust and future-proof solution. Cloudera has provided us with the ability to use Hadoop to manage the exponential growth in our business as well as the exponential increase in complexity of analysis.”
Amr Awadallah, CTO, at Cloudera, said: “King.com produces big data from its gaming community at a ferocious speed, and Cloudera provides King.com both the versatility to plug in multiple data feeds as well as the velocity to bespoke their data storage and processing business requirements. The insight that King.com is now able to quickly gain from customers gives the company an invaluable competitive edge, with the ability to respond to changing consumer patterns rapidly. It is this business agility our customers are constantly looking for.”
King.com first approached the Hadoop experts at Cloudera to assist in laying the foundation for a large-scale data system, after having evaluated a few alternatives and deciding that the incumbent MySQL environment had several limitations. In the near future, King.com will also be deploying the Cloudera Manager software tool. Cloudera Manager sets the standard for enterprise deployment by delivering granular visibility into and control over every part of Cloudera’s Distribution for Apache Hadoop (CDH) – empowering operators to improve cluster performance, enhance quality of service, increase compliance and reduce administrative costs. Cloudera Manager is available, along with CDH and Production Support, as part of the Cloudera Enterprise subscription.
About King.com
King.com is the largest skill gaming site in the world, where you can play free games online in competitive tournaments in categories such as puzzle, strategy, word, action, card and sports games. King.com was founded in 2003 with the goal of becoming the premiere destination for skill gaming on the internet. King.com currently has more than 150 popular games in its portfolio and is constantly developing new and exciting on line games.
