Cloudera and Industry Leaders Release Recommendations Report for Big Data in Government






 









TechAmerica Foundation’s Big Data Commission Publishes Comprehensive Guide to Best Practices for Big Data
PALO ALTO, CA – October 3, 2012 – Cloudera, the category leader that is setting the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, collaborated with leading experts from both industry and academia to issue the report “Demystifying Big Data: A Practical Guide To Transforming The Business of Government.” The report outlines a comprehensive roadmap to using Big Data in the federal government to better serve the American public.
As a member of TechAmerica Foundation’s Big Data Commission, Cloudera worked alongside industry leaders to demystify the term “Big Data” and articulate the business value of Big Data for government agencies. This comprehensive and first-of-its-kind report defines key terms; explains the underlying technology in simple terms; and identifies best practices and lessons learned from early efforts. The report also offers a set of policy recommendations and practical steps agencies can take to get started on Big Data initiatives.
“Government agencies at the Federal, State and Local level are confronting the same challenge that commercial organizations have been struggling with in recent years: how to best capture and utilize the increasing amount of data that is coming from more sources than ever before. Making sense of that increased volume of data and using it to drive informed policies and offer better services for citizens demands new tools and new approaches by government IT staff and analysts,” said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera and TechAmerica Commissioner. “For example, data captured from smart grids can be used to better understand energy production and demand to help drive policies that let utilities and consumers utilize energy more efficiently. We are proud to be part of the TechAmerica Big Data Commission as we work toward creating a better understanding of Big Data and how it can be used to improve policies and services.”
“The Big Data commission is another example of the power to create change when the technology industry and government work hand-in-hand,” said Jennifer Kerber, President of the TechAmerica Foundation. “Big Data has the power to transform how government delivers services to citizens, and it is one of the many new tools available to enhance our daily lives.”
Complementing the report’s Practical Roadmap and Key Policy Recommendations is the Business Value of Big Data, described as:

Improving decision-making and operational intelligence
Eliminating waste, fraud and abuse
Innovating new business models and stakeholder services
