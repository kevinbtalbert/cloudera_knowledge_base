Cloudera Appoints Jim Frankola as Chief Financial Officer






 









Technology Veteran CFO Brings Extensive Private and Public Company Experience to Shape Cloudera’s Rapid Expansion in the Big Data Market
PALO ALTO, CA – Oct 3, 2012 – Cloudera, the category leader that sets the standard for Hadoop in the enterprise, today announced that Jim Frankola joined the company as its Chief Financial Officer. Frankola will oversee the company’s finance, legal and IT operations, reporting directly to CEO Mike Olson.
Frankola will play a strategic role in helping guide the accelerated growth of Cloudera as it moves towards profitability and expansion into international markets.
“Cloudera’s momentum continues to build at an incredible pace as the transformation to the Data-driven Enterprise requires our Big Data products, services and expertise,” said Olson. “Jim not only brings great technology business experience but also proven success in taking rapid-growth companies to the next level. His strong track record in helping lead global businesses will play a vital role in our calculated expansion into key markets and new technology innovation.”
“I am excited to join Cloudera as the company prepares for its next stage of growth,” said Frankola. “Cloudera’s reputation and success in the Big Data market has been built on the strength of Cloudera Enterprise, the most widely deployed and trusted enterprise platform for Hadoop, as well as commitment to open source and focus on customer success. I look forward to building on the strong foundation set by this stellar team as the company scales.”
Frankola has over 25 years of experience in finance and operational leadership with global technology companies. Prior to joining Cloudera, Frankola served as Chief Financial Officer at Yodlee, the leading provider of cloud-based personal financial management solutions, with 600 customers and more than 40 million users. In this role, he helped the company accelerate its growth and profitability as a SaaS provider of the premier personal finance data platform. Prior to Yodlee, Frankola served as CFO of Ariba where he helped lead the company through several strategic initiatives including establishing Ariba as a leader in spend management solutions and transitioning the company’s business model from a traditional enterprise application vendor to a SaaS/cloud company.
Earlier in his career, Jim held various financial and executive positions at Avery Dennison Corporation and IBM. A certified public accountant, Frankola has a B.S. degree in accounting from Pennsylvania State University and an M.B.A. in international business and finance from New York University Leonard N. Stern School of Business.
