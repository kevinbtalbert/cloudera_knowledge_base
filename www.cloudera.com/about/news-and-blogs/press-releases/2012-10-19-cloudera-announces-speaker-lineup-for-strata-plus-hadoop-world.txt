Cloudera Announces Its Big Data Speaker Lineup for Strata + Hadoop World, the World's Largest Gathering of the Apache Hadoop Ecosystem






 









Cloudera CEO Mike Olson and Chief Architect Doug Cutting to Deliver Keynotes

PALO ALTO, CA -- (Marketwire - Oct 19, 2012) - Cloudera, the category leader that sets the standard for Hadoop in the enterprise, today announced the lineup of Cloudera speakers for Strata + Hadoop World. Cloudera and O'Reilly joined forces earlier this year to combine the two events and build upon the largest gathering of the Apache Hadoop community, end users and vendors in the world. This year's event, which marks the fourth annual Hadoop World, takes place in New York City from October 23 - 25, 2012. Themed "Tools and Techniques That Make Data Work," the conference brings together the leading minds in Big Data, including open source contributors, end users, vendors, solution providers and data scientists who will be exploring the frontiers of Big Data for business, science and beyond. The more than 2,500 attendees expected this year will have the opportunity to learn from Hadoop and Big Data focused discussions, networking events and training courses. Sixteen speakers from Cloudera will be sharing their Big Data expertise and experience at the event. In addition to the speaker lineup, Cloudera will be contributing to multiple community networking events at the conference.
Cloudera CEO Mike Olson will kick off the conference with the opening keynote on October 24 at 8:55am ET. Olson will discuss how Big Data, paired with the right tools and techniques, has the potential to help professionals in almost every discipline make better, more informed decisions for better, faster outcomes. He will also explore use cases from his own experiences at Cloudera and will show how building applications within a broader community and ecosystem has vast implications for the speed and depth of innovation.
"It's inspiring to witness how the Apache Hadoop community has matured and continues to evolve. The mainstream adoption of open source technology has helped establish a thriving new market category that gives organizations a competitive edge by letting them take advantage of all their data. I'm proud of the leadership role Cloudera has played in developing Apache Hadoop-based solutions to where they are today and our team's contributions to the open source community," said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. "This conference will really help business and technology leaders understand the use cases for Big Data."
Hadoop creator and Chief Architect at Cloudera, Doug Cutting, is the founder of several Apache open source projects in addition to Hadoop, including Lucene, Nutch and Avro. Cutting will be delivering his keynote at the conference on October 25 at 9:20am ET and will discuss the genesis of Hadoop and the changes it has made to date, emphasizing the latest interactive and real-time developments.
"I always look forward to Hadoop World because there is nothing like getting a group of people together who all stand at the forefront of innovation, with a common goal to learn and share ideas with each other. It's a great time to be involved in the community, as Hadoop sharpens its effectiveness on a grand scale and users are able to carve out expertise with the project across varying industries," said Cutting. "Momentum keeps building behind Hadoop and this conference is a testament of that."
The conference focuses on the future of data collection, as well as foundational skills and tools and technologies that are required to gain a competitive advantage with Big Data. Cloudera will be contributing to the three full days of the conference with keynotes, informational sessions, and participation in panel discussions.
