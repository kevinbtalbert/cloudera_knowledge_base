New Cloudera Vision Encourages Data-Driven Enterprises to Ask Bigger Questions of All Their Data






 









Cloudera Builds on Its Leadership as the Big Data Standard in the Enterprise With New Platform for Real-Time Hadoop and Expanded Ecosystem Across Customers, Partners and Community
NEW YORK, NY and PALO ALTO, CA -- (Marketwire - Oct 24, 2012) - Cloudera, the category leader that sets the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, today unveiled its company vision -- Ask Bigger Questions™ -- during CEO Mike Olson's keynote at Strata Conference + Hadoop World in New York City. Cloudera's vision for the next generation of data management describes a world where real-time interactivity with data at the speed of thought enables data-driven enterprises to Ask Bigger Questions and get bigger answers, translating into significant business competitive advantage. As part of the launch, Cloudera today unveiled its new corporate identity and introduced solutions and partnerships that extend the company's value for customers and the open source community.
Cloudera's vision for Big Data -- Ask Bigger Questions -- is realized with today's launch of Cloudera Enterprise RTQ (Real-time Query) powered by Impala. This latest innovation from Cloudera, the Platform for Big Data, takes the market-leading Hadoop platform decisively "beyond batch," making it the first Big Data management solution that allows batch and real-time operations to be performed on any type of data -- unstructured and structured -- within one massively scalable system. This new groundbreaking technology reinvents the economics and performance of Big Data management, and is reinforced by Cloudera's enterprise scale partner ecosystem and increasing adoption by Fortune 100 customers.
"We advise CIOs and IT architects on how to build out their Big Data management infrastructure and have seen strong demand building for real-time access to data from enterprise clients. Fortune 100 customers have perhaps the strongest need for real-time business insights that will enable them to modernize their business models by leveraging higher performance Big Data solutions," Donald Feinberg, Vice President and Distinguished Analyst, Gartner Intelligence in the Information Management group.
Inspired by its growing roster of real world use cases for Hadoop ecosystem technologies, Cloudera developed its Ask Bigger Questions vision to challenge companies across the globe to incorporate all their data into innovative new strategies to improve their businesses and become truly data driven.
Vision Becomes Reality with Cloudera's New Real-Time Platform for Big Data
Cloudera has a strong track record of innovation in designing data management solutions from the ground up for Big Data workloads at massive scale and in making Hadoop widely consumable in the enterprise. However, to gain competitive advantage from Hadoop at the speed of business, enterprises must also be able to explore and analyze critical data in seconds, which batch-oriented MapReduce in Hadoop does not support.
Today's announcement of Cloudera Enterprise RTQ (Real-time Query) brings the power of real-time to Hadoop. Powered by Impala, Cloudera Enterprise RTQ enables companies to perform real-time, interactive data analysis in seconds for true speed-of-thought analytics, while storing and managing data at a fraction of the cost of traditional data management systems. As a result, analysts can now get answers as fast as they can ask questions, and more users can now have real-time access to all relevant data. With Cloudera, companies can now avoid separate, costly data modeling and migration for analytics, and get high performance storage and analysis in a single platform for Big Data. With this innovation, Cloudera is reinventing the way enterprises can provision their Big Data management infrastructure and put the right workloads in the most appropriate systems.
"Big Data is transformative and is driving new insights that can rewrite the rules on how companies do business. Our customers use more data, analyzed in more powerful ways, to learn more about their market opportunities than they ever could before," said Cloudera CEO Mike Olson. "Driven by our vision to enable companies to Ask Bigger Questions, today we announced major advancements in the world of Hadoop -- our platform for Big Data with Cloudera Enterprise RTQ powered by Impala -- for real-time query on Hadoop. Cloudera Impala takes Hadoop beyond the batch processing limits of MapReduce. After four years of helping our customers to Ask Bigger Questions, we have made a major step forward in the enterprise integration of Hadoop, with literally hundreds of partners integrating to our platform with new tools and applications to unlock the value of Big Data."
Builds on Leadership as the Big Data Standard in the Enterprise
As a result of consistent market execution and adoption, Cloudera has more enterprise customers, users and nodes under management than all other Hadoop systems combined. Cloudera Enterprise continues to lead the market, increasing customer adoption by 30% in the last quarter and naming Walt Disney Company, Expedia, RIM, Yellow Pages, Monsanto, NetApp, Overstock.com, and RelayHealth (a McKesson subsidiary) amongst its Fortune 500 install base. More than half the Fortune 50 and hundreds of companies worldwide -- including eBay, Visa and General Electric -- use Cloudera solutions to better analyze data, optimize content and searches, and perform merchant analytics.
"Healthcare is a very competitive, tight margin industry with increasing needs for compliance on data of massive scale," said Marty Smith, Senior Director of Product Innovation, RelayHealth (McKesson). "RelayHealth processes millions of claims per day on Cloudera Enterprise, analyzing more than 1 million log files per day and integrating with multiple Oracle and IBM systems. As a result, we are able to assist our healthcare providers to get paid faster, improving their cost models and productivity."
Broadens Reach with Expanded Partner Ecosystem
The Cloudera Connect partner program is the largest and most established ecosystem of companies focused on the development, sale, deployment and marketing of commercial solutions built on CDH (Cloudera's Distribution Including Apache Hadoop). With more than 400 partners, over 50 certified technologies and 15 certified connectors, Cloudera is rapidly accelerating the widespread adoption of Hadoop worldwide. More than 150 partners have been added to the Cloudera Connect ecosystem within the past six months to ensure broad enterprise compatibility, making Cloudera the easiest and most pervasive open source platform for Big Data.
"Enterprises need answers fast enough to compete effectively in today's business landscape," said John Igoe, Executive Director of Open Source Cloud and Big Data Solutions, Dell. "Big Data requires big power, which is why we partnered with Cloudera, the industry leader in enterprise Hadoop, to provide the Dell | Cloudera Hadoop Solution. Enabling customers to derive insights from their data requires this kind of integrated, highly optimized solution for massive distributed processing, data mining and analysis."
"IT decision makers for Fortune 1000 enterprises face unique challenges extracting actionable insights from their massive data stores," said Paul Miller, VP Converged Application Systems, HP. "Through our collaboration with Cloudera, we are expanding Hadoop's reach to help organizations mine large volumes of data at scale, and support endeavors like Impala to increase the usability and mainstream adoption of Apache Hadoop."
"Oracle Big Data Appliance, which includes Cloudera's distribution of Hadoop, gives enterprise customers the ability to deal with the massive volumes of new data quickly and efficiently. Oracle's Big Data Platform integrates this new data with our customers' existing infrastructure, so they can gain a more comprehensive view of their own customers and business, and deliver deeper analytics and new insights," said George Lumpkin, Vice President at Oracle. "Together Oracle and Cloudera are fueling technology innovation that drives real business value for our mutual customers."
Deepens Ties with Real-Time Open Source Community 
Cloudera remains a leader in open source contribution across Hadoop and supplemental projects such as Hive, Flume, Search and Impala, and is the single biggest contributor to Hadoop-related projects with over 50 project committers, PMC members and code contributors to Apache. Recently, HBase creator Michael Stack and top committers Jean-Daniel Cryans, and Elliott Clark joined Cloudera, supporting their continued contributions on open source projects. Since its inception, Cloudera has fully supported and encouraged open source committers with dedicated work hours, resources and technical support.
Solving the Skills Gap: New Training and Certification Enable More People to Ask Bigger Questions
Companies are facing increasing challenges trying to find experts in data management who are trained in understanding and analyzing vast amounts of data. In an effort to close this skills gap, Cloudera continues to build Cloudera University into the leading source of training and certification for all areas of Hadoop. In May 2012, Cloudera University announced the first HBase certification program and is now offering a new course for training and certifying data scientists. Designed by Cloudera's founding data science team, Jeff Hammerbacher and Josh Wills, this new hands-on course will provide real world training for solving data science problems and building recommendation systems. The Cloudera Certified Apache Hadoop Professional Data Scientist certification program will be the first of its kind to test actual system skills by administering both a written and performance-based exam. To date, Cloudera has trained more than 15,000 people and has recently expanded its worldwide training and certification to include specific courses for data analysis and Cloudera Impala.
