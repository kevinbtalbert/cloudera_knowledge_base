Cloudera Raises $65M to Accelerate Enterprise Growth






 









New Funding Will Support Global Expansion, Product Innovation and Enterprise Adoption of Its Real-Time Platform for Big Data
PALO ALTO, CA -- (Marketwire - Dec 6, 2012) - Cloudera, the category leader that is setting the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, today announced it has closed $65 million in a new funding round led by Accel Partners, with support from Greylock Partners, Ignition Partners, In-Q-Tel, and Meritech Capital Partners. The investment will fund global sales growth and fuel continued development of its platform for Big Data in support of its growing enterprise customer base. The company will be expanding its international presence with the opening of a European headquarters in the UK, in the first quarter of 2013.
"As global business data growth reaches near exponential rates, enterprise organizations are grappling with the reality that they need a way to manage and make use of it," said Ping Li, partner at Accel Partners and head of the Accel Big Data Fund. "Four years ago, Cloudera set out to pioneer the business case for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise. The team succeeded in developing the market's leading platform for Big Data and has become the go-to technology for enterprise Hadoop Infrastructure, supported by its rich and diverse partner ecosystem. The company is accelerating on its position as the standard for Hadoop in the enterprise and is well positioned to expand its revenue and global customer footprint."
Over the past twelve months, Cloudera's business has experienced rapid growth on all fronts with sales, customers, employees and data under management all more than doubling. The company offers a packaged solution for enterprise customers to maximize their time-to-value with Cloudera Enterprise, which provides support and management to ensure production-ready deployment of CDH4, the most widely deployed and proven commercial distribution of Apache Hadoop. Cloudera's customer base includes more than half of the Fortune 50, and includes companies such as AOL, CBS, EBay, Expedia, Experian, JP Morgan Chase, Monsanto, Morgan Stanley, Network Appliance, Nokia and RIM.
With more than 400 partners, over 50 certified technologies and 15 certified connectors, Cloudera is rapidly accelerating the widespread adoption of Hadoop worldwide. More than 150 partners have been added to the Cloudera Connect ecosystem within the past six months, ensuring broad enterprise compatibility and making Cloudera the easiest and most pervasive open source platform for Big Data. Through Cloudera University, the company has trained more than 15,000 individuals.
"Big Data continues to fuel significant new business opportunities and revenue streams for our enterprise customers, spurring the need for new, large-scale data management solutions that can meet the needs of today's demanding enterprise workloads," said Mike Olson, CEO at Cloudera. "This new investment will speed the expansion of our sales and support operations to meet increasing enterprise demand for our real-time, Hadoop-based platform, as we scale to address the enormity of this global market opportunity. At the same time, we remain unwavering in our commitment to the delivery of groundbreaking innovation across the Cloudera software platform and the open source Apache Hadoop stack. The way forward is clear and our mission is simple: we will shape and define the next generation of Big Data management solutions for the enterprise."
