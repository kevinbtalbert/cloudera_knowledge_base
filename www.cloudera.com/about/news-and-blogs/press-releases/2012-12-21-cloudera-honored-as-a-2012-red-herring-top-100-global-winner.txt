Cloudera Honored as a 2012 Red Herring Top 100 Global Winner






 









Red Herring Names Cloudera One of the Year's Most Innovative, Private Technology Companies Worldwide
PALO ALTO, CA -- (Marketwire - Dec 21, 2012) -- Cloudera, the category leader that sets the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, today announced it has been honored as a winner of Red Herring's 2012 Top 100 Global award, a prestigious recognition that highlights the year's most innovative private technology companies and entrepreneurs from around the globe for technology advancements across multiple industries.
"Cloudera is very pleased to be selected as a Global Top 100 recipient," said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. "Winning this award builds on the momentum behind Cloudera's vision for the next generation of data management, where interactivity with data at the speed of thought enables enterprises to Ask Bigger Questions of their data in real-time. This recognition from Red Herring further underscores Cloudera's market-leading position as the standard for Hadoop in the enterprise."
Red Herring's Top 100 Global list has become a mark of distinction for identifying promising new companies and entrepreneurs. Red Herring editors were among the first to recognize that companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, Skype, Salesforce.com, YouTube, and eBay would change the way we live and work.
"Choosing the companies with the strongest potential was by no means a small feat," said Alex Vieux, publisher and CEO of Red Herring. "After rigorous contemplation and discussion, we narrowed our list down from hundreds of candidates from across the globe to the Top 100 Winners. We believe Cloudera embodies the vision, drive and innovation that define a successful entrepreneurial venture. Cloudera should be proud of its accomplishment, as the competition was the strongest it has ever been."
The Red Herring editorial team selected the companies demonstrating the most innovative technologies and business models originating from more than 1,000 companies from over 40 countries. Red Herring's editorial staff evaluated the companies on both quantitative and qualitative criteria, such as financial performance, technology innovation, management quality, strategy, and market penetration.
This assessment of potential is complemented by a review of the track record and standing of startups relative to their peers, allowing Red Herring to see past the "buzz" and make the list a valuable instrument of discovery and advocacy for the most promising new business models from around the world. The companies chosen represent winners of past Red Herring Asia, Europe and North America awards.
