Cloudera Accelerates Platform for Big Data With New Enterprise-Required Advancements






 









Unveils Cloudera Navigator and Cloudera Enterprise Backup and Disaster Recovery Technologies That Enable Hadoop to Be Deployed and Compliant in Mission-Critical Systems Environments
SANTA CLARA, CA and PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwire - Feb 26, 2013) - From the O'Reilly Strata Conference: Cloudera, the category leader that sets the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, today announced the next evolution of its Platform for Big Data, Cloudera Enterprise, designed to meet and exceed enterprise business continuity and compliance requirements and simplify integration with existing data management systems. These industry-first advancements -- built to accelerate mainstream enterprise adoption of Cloudera Enterprise into mission critical production environments -- include Cloudera Navigator, Cloudera Enterprise BDR (Backup and Disaster Recovery), along with version 4.5 of the company's market-leading management interface, Cloudera Manager.
With today's announcement, Cloudera extends its leadership as the enterprise standard for Hadoop, delivering a production-hardened, fully integrated solution for companies looking to ask bigger questions of and derive greater value from all their business data. The new technology represents a major leap forward in the maturation and completeness of the Hadoop platform for business use, augmenting Cloudera's industry-leading data management platform with new business continuity, compliance and centralized system management capabilities.
"Hadoop shows great promise for many IT applications, ranging from data warehousing to archiving to content management," said Philip Russom, research director for data management at The Data Warehousing Institute (TDWI). "Although Hadoop is a strong platform, its promise is inhibited by its sparse and immature tooling. Before it receives broad adoption from mainstream IT organizations, its tooling must progress substantially to enable the core functionality enterprise buyers require in information platforms, namely, functions for data security, access control, usage auditing, backup, disaster recovery, notification of job failures, software updates and upgrades, and much more. With its new products, Cloudera Navigator and Cloudera Enterprise BDR, as well as the latest version of Cloudera Manager, Cloudera addresses these and other administrative tool requirements in spades."
WHAT THE ENTERPRISE REQUIRES: A BIG DATA PLATFORM THAT SUPPORTS MISSION-CRITICAL STANDARDS
Cloudera Enterprise is increasingly deployed as an integrated data repository and processing system for structured and unstructured data, some of which is highly sensitive and subject to strict regulatory compliance mandates. For Hadoop to successfully integrate into enterprise data infrastructures, it must coexist with all existing systems, platforms, applications and processes to provide truly comprehensive data management. Until now, available Hadoop management tools have lacked these integration and control capabilities, and customers have been limited in terms of which data sets they can use and gain insight from.
The recent advancements from Cloudera signify the increased completeness of the Platform for Big Data with respect to compliance and policy based data management requirements. This insight has been gained through Cloudera's breadth of enterprise deployments at scale and deep understanding of what it takes to integrate Hadoop into existing environments successfully for more than simplistic single workloads.
"At Box, our vision is to make content management and collaboration both incredibly easy and incredibly secure, meaning we demand the highest levels of performance, security and auditing capabilities from our data management platforms," said Stefan Apitz, vice president of operations at Box. "We selected Cloudera because of its short deployment time and breadth of mission-critical features, which satisfy the strict security and reliability requirements of our business."
INTRODUCING CLOUDERA NAVIGATOR: A NEW DATA MANAGEMENT LAYER FOR CLOUDERA ENTERPRISE
Cloudera recognizes the need for improved visibility and control for data stored in Hadoop-based systems. To address enterprise requirements for end-to-end management across all data sets, the company today introduced Cloudera Navigator. A complementary application to Cloudera Manager, which focuses on system management and administration, Cloudera Navigator was designed to provide all of the capabilities required for administrators, data managers and analysts to secure, govern and explore the large amounts of diverse data that reside in Hadoop systems. To realize all the competitive advantages of Big Data for sensitive or highly secure data sets, the first release of Cloudera Navigator (v1.0) includes a suite of auditing capabilities that enable administrators to index and store a full history of HDFS, Hive and HBase data access. This portion of the application was developed specifically to address data security concerns most typically associated with the financial services, healthcare, government and other highly regulated sectors.
CLOUDERA ENTERPRISE BDR: PEACE OF MIND WITH CENTRALIZED BUSINESS CONTINUITY
Maintaining business continuity is a requirement for enterprises running mission-critical processes and applications on Hadoop-based systems. Cloudera Enterprise BDR now makes this possible through new robust, centralized backup and disaster recovery capabilities on Cloudera Enterprise, the Platform for Big Data. With Cloudera Enterprise BDR, organizations can configure and manage disaster recovery policies for data stored in Hadoop through an easy to navigate graphical interface. Importantly, Cloudera Enterprise BDR provides the IT team the ability to consistently meet and exceed Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) through process automation, alerting and exception handling.
CLOUDERA MANAGER 4.5: RAISING THE BAR FOR HOLISTIC MANAGEMENT OF BIG DATA
Cloudera set the industry standard with Cloudera Manager, the first end-to-end management application for Apache Hadoop. Now, the company is extending that lead with the release of Cloudera Manager 4.5, which delivers expanded capabilities designed to simplify the management and adoption of Hadoop. These key advancements enable customers to: perform rolling platform upgrades, easily correlate and visualize metrics through intuitive and interactive charts, manage heterogeneous clusters and better integrate with existing enterprise IT management tools via SNMP. For a complete overview of the Cloudera Manager 4.5 release, visit: www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products/cloudera-manager.html.
"Monsanto relies on our Big Data infrastructure to support our researchers' need for a single source of R&D data that allows them to innovate faster, helping farmers sustain our growing population with high quality agricultural products," said Erich Hochmuth, data and analytics architecture lead at Monsanto. "We're excited about the new capabilities offered through the Cloudera Enterprise suite of products, which will simplify Hadoop administration internally and help us to make Hadoop more pervasive across the organization."
"There is a natural evolutionary progression that every new technology must make to achieve the necessary attributes of a truly enterprise-class solution," said James Markarian, CTO at Informatica. "Informatica has done this for data integration on Hadoop and Cloudera has pioneered that evolution for Hadoop management. Their new feature set delivers auditability and disaster recovery capabilities that are typical of a more mature, enterprise-ready platform. These are the kinds of advancements that enterprises have been waiting for. We look forward to greater adoption of Informatica's Hadoop product offering integrated with Cloudera's platform across our joint customer base."
"The market has reached an important milestone: there is now a wave of mainstream enterprise interest in the integration of Apache Hadoop into existing IT environments. At Cloudera, our experience -- our large installed base includes more than half the Fortune 100 -- gives us a clear understanding of enterprise requirements. We've continued to innovate in the open source Big Data platform to meet them," said Mike Olson, CEO of Cloudera. "With the new enhancements announced today, we offer customers the most advanced, most mature business-ready solution capable of supporting critical enterprise data and systems management needs. Cloudera Enterprise, The Platform for Big Data, is the clear choice to support the next-generation enterprise data infrastructure."
