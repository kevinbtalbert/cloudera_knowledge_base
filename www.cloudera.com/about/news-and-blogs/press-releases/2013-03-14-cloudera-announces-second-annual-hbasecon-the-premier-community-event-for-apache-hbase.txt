Cloudera Announces Second Annual HBaseCon, the Premier Community Event for Apache HBase






 









Call for Speakers and Early Bird Registration Now Open
PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwire - Mar 14, 2013) - Cloudera, the category leader that sets the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, will be hosting HBaseCon 2013 in San Francisco on June 13, 2013 at the Marriott Marquis, San Francisco. HBaseCon 2013 will be supported by event sponsors Continuuity, MapR and WibiData; community sponsor Apache Software Foundation; and media sponsors O'Reilly Media and Manning Publications. HBaseCon is the premier industry conference for Apache HBase users, contributors, administrators and application developers. In addition to exploring numerous technical talks across four tracks, attendees can meet and network at this annual gathering of HBase committers and enthusiasts. The HBaseCon Program Committee includes HBase contributors representing companies from across the community, including Cloudera, Explorys, Facebook, Hortonworks, Intel, Twitter and Salesforce.
"HBase has become an integral part of the Apache Hadoop stack, helping to make real-time querying possible," said Michael Stack, Cloudera Engineer and HBase Project Chair at the Apache Software Foundation. "Last year's event was the first time the HBase community got together under one roof, and it was a great day full of in-depth, non-commercial presentations. This year, attendees can expect to get a deeper dive into the technology and learn more best practices and use cases for HBase in production from experts and contributors across the landscape of the platform."
Call for Speakers Now Open
The HBaseCon Program Committee invites all members of the HBase community to submit speaking abstracts for sessions pertaining to HBase internals and futures, best practices for running HBase in production, HBase use cases and applications and how to contribute to HBase. The call for speakers is open through April 1, 2013. For more information or to submit an abstract, visit: http://www.hbasecon.com/call-for-speakers/
"With a number of our employees committed to making contributions to the Apache HBase project, Cloudera is deeply invested in evolving the platform to make it broadly adoptable for real-time management of Big Data," said Doug Cutting, Chief Architect at Cloudera and Chairman of the Apache Software Foundation. "Last year's sold-out event drew 600 attendees and notable sponsors from across the industry. We are excited to again provide a forum in which HBase contributors, administrators and enthusiasts can connect, and we look forward to supporting another banner year for the event."
Registration and Sponsorship Information
HBaseCon will take place on June 13, 2013 at the Marriott Marquis in San Francisco, California. Early Bird registration for the event is now open until April 23. For more information, visit: http://www.hbasecon.com/, or register at:http://hbasecon2013.eventbrite.com.
For more information about becoming a sponsor at HBaseCon, visit: http://www.hbasecon.com/sponsors/. Sponsorship opportunities are open until May 15, 2013.
Discounts on Apache HBase Training and Materials for HBaseCon Attendees
HBaseCon attendees are able to purchase discounted Apache HBase training from Cloudera, which will take place on June 11 and 12 in San Francisco. Attendees are also eligible for deep discounts on the best-selling HBase books from O'Reilly and Manning Publications. For more information, visit: http://www.hbasecon.com/training/.
