Cloudera and T-Systems Announce Strategic Partnership






 









 
Strategic Collaboration to Deliver Cloud-Based Data Analytics Solution, Paving the Way for Standardized, Low-Cost "Analytics as a Service"
 
PALO ALTO, CA and BONN, GERMANY--(Marketwire - Mar 20, 2013) - Cloudera, the category leader that sets the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, and T-Systems, Europe's leading IT systems provider, today announced that they have reached a strategic agreement to deliver cloud-based data analytics solutions, based on Cloudera's Platform for Big Data. The companies, which represent two of the world's most trusted names in data management and IT solutions markets, will work together to develop and deliver production-ready solutions that will enable T-Systems customers to more quickly and easily derive value from their data.
Cloudera's Platform for Big Data, Cloudera Enterprise powered by Cloudera Impala RTQ for real time analytics, will provide the data management infrastructure layer, enabling native data integration, visualization and analysis at scale. T-Systems will integrate its existing cloud computing infrastructure with Cloudera's platform, to enable easily accessible and affordable analytics-as-a-service solutions with a high cloud standard. The joint solution is first made available to T-Systems' enterprise customers in Europe as of now, with additional markets to follow worldwide.
T-Systems has also unveiled technology demonstrations at CeBIT 2013 that show how big data is transforming products and services. The solutions demonstrate how real-time analysis is used in campaign management, financial monitoring, utility delivery, fleet management and networked vehicles. Campaign management lets you incorporate millions of tweets from around the world, for example, along with other social media data. Video and audio files can also be analyzed specifically for the occurrence of defined terms in a flash.
Through its collaboration with Cloudera, T-Systems will deliver on its strategic vision to develop big data analytics solutions as a key element of its IT solutions portfolio and set the standard for "Analytics as a Service" in the cloud, delivering highly scalable cost and time-efficient data analytics for its corporate customers.
"Our customers don't want to have to worry about the hardware and software for big data. They don't want technology, just a reliable service. We can offer precisely this -- which is what makes our new offer with Cloudera so special," says Christian Wirth, Vice President BI & Big Data at T-Systems.
"We are excited to be working with T-Systems, one of Europe's foremost IT service providers and a trusted global leader in cloud-based business solutions for the enterprise," said Tim Stevens, Vice President of Business and Corporate Development at Cloudera. "Leaders choose leaders to partner with and this partnership is further validation that Cloudera is the big data solutions leader that enterprises trust. T-Systems' unique cloud-based application of our Platform for Big Data will enable unparalleled scalability for data management and analytics and offer a great way for enterprises to more easily leverage the power of Hadoop."
