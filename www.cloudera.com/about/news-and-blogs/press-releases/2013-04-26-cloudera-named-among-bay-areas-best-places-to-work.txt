Cloudera Named Among Bay Area's "Best Places to Work"






 









 
Honored as a Top Employer by the San Francisco Business Times for Its Flexible Work Environment and Innovative Culture
 
 
PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Apr 26, 2013) - Cloudera, the category leader that sets the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, today announced that it has been named one of the Bay Area's "Best Places to Work" by the San Francisco (SF) Business Times, ranking among the area's top 25 of 125 mid-size companies. The designation marks the company's second consecutive win, based on an independent employee survey conducted by the SF Business Times, measuring worker satisfaction across a number of areas, including personal growth, workplace environment and managerial effectiveness.
Founded in 2008, Cloudera pioneered the business case for Apache Hadoop -- an open source framework that enables users to more efficiently store, process and analyze structured and unstructured datasets -- to tackle the formidable problem of exponential data growth. Through Hadoop, the company is helping to drive massive advancements in industries like healthcare, education, oil and gas exploration, advertising, financial services, telecommunications, high technology, government, to name only a few. Cloudera empowers organizations to ask sophisticated questions "at the speed of thought" and get actionable insights from formerly latent data stores for competitive advantage.
Cloudera has been rapidly scaling its workforce over the past year, attracting a world class team across three continents with its flexible and supportive work environment, excellent benefits and the promise of delivering bleeding edge innovation in the white hot Big Data solutions market.
"It's an honor and a pleasure to be recognized again as one of the Bay Area's best places to work," said Mike Olson, Cloudera's CEO. "Given the intense competition for talent in our market, it's crucial that Cloudera appeal to the best and the brightest. This recognition is most of all due to the quality of the people we've brought on. Great people want to work with great people, and we are fortunate to have built a world-class team here to unlock the value of Big Data for the enterprise. Their dedication and contributions across the business are what make Cloudera the company that it is."
The company is currently hiring and looking to fill a number of positions at both its Bay Area locations in Palo Alto and San Francisco, and its offices around the world. 
The 10th annual "Best Places to Work Awards" are created and presented by the SF Business Times and Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal. For a complete list of this year's finalists and winners, visit: http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/promo/BPTWCOMPANYLIST?ana=et_sfbt_bptwsolo.
