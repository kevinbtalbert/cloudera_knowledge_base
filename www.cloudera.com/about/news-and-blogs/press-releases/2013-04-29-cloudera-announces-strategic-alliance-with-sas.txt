Cloudera Announces Strategic Alliance With SAS






 









PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Apr 29, 2013) - Cloudera, the category leader that sets the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, today announced a new strategic business alliance with SAS to further integrate analytics with Hadoop environments for large enterprises. Customers are now empowered to quickly and easily analyze their data in Hadoop by connecting SAS directly to their Cloudera-powered Big Data repositories. Cloudera's Platform for Big Data offers the full power of Hadoop to SAS customers, enabling them to quickly explore and analyze all of their Hadoop-based data through familiar and easy-to-use SAS data management and analytics products. Users can now analyze all of their Hadoop-based structured and unstructured data and seize new opportunities to derive actionable insight. 

"Due to the continued growth of Big Data and increased adoption of Hadoop by SAS customers, Cloudera was an obvious alliance addition for SAS," said Scott VanValkenburgh, SAS Senior Director of Alliances. "Their platform is well-suited to address our customers' desire for SAS and Hadoop integration." 

Leveraging SAS data management tools with Hadoop's open platform and parallel architecture, business analysts can instantly query data in Hadoop without additional training. Through the partnership, SAS will contribute to Cloudera University's global training programs, which have trained more than 15,000 Hadoop developers, administrators and data scientists since inception. Additionally, the companies will conduct joint research and development projects to continue advancing Big Data analytics with Hadoop for the enterprise. 

"SAS and Cloudera share a common vision of delivering access to more data across the enterprise, and we look forward to the benefits our alliance relationship will bring to companies worldwide. By combining SAS Data Management, SAS High-Performance Analytics software and SAS Visual Analytics software with Hadoop, we make it possible for more users to uncover important insights that are trapped in large amounts of data," said Tim Stevens, vice president, business and corporate development at Cloudera. 

Cloudera and SAS to Present Together at SAS Global Forum 
Highlighting the new business advantages of the Cloudera and SAS alliance, the companies will be presenting during two panel sessions at the SAS Global Forum 2013, April 28 - May 1 in San Francisco, California.
