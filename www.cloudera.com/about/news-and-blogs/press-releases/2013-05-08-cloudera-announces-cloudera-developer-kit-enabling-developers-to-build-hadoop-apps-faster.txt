Cloudera Announces Cloudera Developer Kit, Enabling Developers to Build Hadoop Apps Faster






 









First-Ever Cloudera Developer Kit Includes APIs, Tools and Documentation to Simplify Most Common Tasks in Open Source Hadoop
PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - May 8, 2013) - Cloudera, the category leader that sets the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, today announced the release of the Cloudera Developer Kit (CDK), the first developer kit created for Cloudera's Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH). CDK helps developers to build apps in Hadoop environments faster and more easily than ever before.
Hadoop is being rapidly embraced by the enterprise for its unparalleled ability to capture and manage Big Data, but the process of building and managing Hadoop environments remains complicated and time-consuming for many developers without specialized training. The first of its kind, CDK removes barriers to entry and makes CDH easier and faster to use, empowering developers to leverage the power of Hadoop, helping organizations unlock the value of their data for actionable insights and competitive advantage.
CDK includes a collection of API libraries, tools, example code and documentation that help simplify the most common tasks when working with Apache Hadoop. Like CDH, CDK is 100% free, open source and licensed under the same permissive Apache Software License, allowing developers to use the code in any way they choose across existing commercial code bases or in any open source project. CDK is modular in its approach to provide ultimate flexibility, enabling developers to pick and choose the pieces they want to use, while freely substituting code of their own. For Java developers using tools like Maven, artifacts are available from the Cloudera Maven Repository for easy project integration.
"At Cloudera we are not just Hadoop providers; we're also consumers who know first-hand the challenges developers can face when working with Hadoop," said Eric Sammer, engineering manager, Cloudera. "The new Cloudera Development Kit is one of the many ways we're sharing our deep expertise with the community. First-time Hadoop programmers will find that CDK walks them through each step of the process, enabling them to get up and running on the platform quickly, while more-experienced developers will appreciate the flexibility of CDK to swap out different components for a completely customized experience. By making Hadoop more accessible, we are excited to help an even broader range of organizations get more value out of their data."
The first module included in CDK is the CDK Data module, a set of APIs that dramatically simplifies working with datasets in Hadoop file systems, such as HDFS and the local file system. Cloudera will continue to add new modules to CDK to extend its functionality and flexibility for developers. As CDK is a fully open source project, community contributions are also welcome.
Additional Information
