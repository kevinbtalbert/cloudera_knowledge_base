Splunk and Cloudera Ink Strategic Alliance to Bring Together Big Data Expertise






 









Market Leaders in Operational Intelligence and Hadoop Join Forces to Provide Answers to Big Data Challenges
SAN FRANCISCO – May 9, 2013 – Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ: SPLK), the leading software platform for real-time operational intelligence, and Cloudera, the category leader that sets the standard for Apache Hadoop in the enterprise, today announced a strategic alliance that delivers big data analytics across the enterprise. The relationship ensures best-in-class integration of Splunk® Enterprise to Cloudera Enterprise using Splunk Hadoop Connect, which provides bi-directional integration to easily and reliably move data between Splunk Enterprise and Hadoop.
“Splunk’s mission is to make data accessible, usable and valuable to everyone. By working together, Splunk and Cloudera deliver big data analytics that span the needs of any organization,” said Bill Gaylord, senior vice president of business development, Splunk. “The integration of Splunk Enterprise and CDH through Splunk Hadoop Connect provides customers a way to easily and reliably transfer data between the systems. This allows customers to easily use Splunk's best-in-class machine data ingestion and management to deliver data to Hadoop, or ingest data into Splunk from Hadoop, such as the output of Hadoop MapReduce jobs and easily analyze and visualize that data.”
“Cloudera and Splunk are an ideal combination to develop applications which accelerate the insight organizations get from big data,” said Tim Stevens, vice president of business and corporate development, Cloudera. “More customers are choosing CDH as their Hadoop distribution, and this relationship allows us to bring big data solutions to a much broader spectrum of end users.”
SNAP Interactive, Inc. (“SNAP”) (OTCBB: STVI), is a leading social application developer and a joint customer of Splunk and Cloudera. SNAP owns and operates AYI, one of the largest social dating applications on the Internet. With more than 20 million Facebook connected profiles and more than one billion interest data points to draw from, AYI users create a staggering amount of machine-generated big data.
“When your business is built on optimizing an interactive, multi-platform social experience for your customers, the ability to analyze massive amounts of data is essential to success,” said Nicholas DiSanto, Architecture Team Lead, SNAP Interactive. “For us, Splunk Enterprise and Cloudera are two technologies at the heart of our big data analytics. Splunk collects analytics data from all of our online systems, enabling both engineering and business users to perform ad hoc analysis and visualize important trends. This helps improve uptime, and also enables complex analysis of customer engagement to facilitate our data driven, scientific approach to making product decisions. Splunk Hadoop Connect seamlessly integrates with Cloudera CDH4.2 enabling data from Splunk to be reliably sent to Cloudera for specialized batch analytics that power many features on our site. Using Splunk and Cloudera has truly revolutionized how big data is used by our enterprise and I look forward to gaining more value from these two technologies working closely together.”
