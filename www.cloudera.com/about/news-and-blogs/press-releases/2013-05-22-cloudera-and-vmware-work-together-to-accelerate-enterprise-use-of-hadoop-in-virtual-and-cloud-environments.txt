Cloudera and VMware Work Together to Accelerate Enterprise Use of Hadoop in Virtual and Cloud Environments






 









Cloudera Enterprise is Now Certified to Run on VMware vSphere®
PALO ALTO, Calif., May 22, 2013 — Cloudera and VMware today announced that Cloudera Enterprise is now certified to run on VMware vSphere®. Through the VMware Ready™ program, VMware and Cloudera completed a detailed joint validation process, which enables enterprises to simplify and accelerate the use of Apache Hadoop within virtual and cloud environments.
“As Apache Hadoop gains traction within enterprises, VMware and Cloudera are collaborating to help customers benefit from virtualizing Cloudera Enterprise, Cloudera’s platform for big data,” said Fausto Ibarra, senior director, Product Management, VMware. “VMware continues to evolve vSphere to make sure customers can take advantage of the leading platform for all their applications and workloads, including Apache Hadoop.”
VMware vSphere Offers Common Platform for Enterprise Applications including Apache Hadoop
Enterprises seeking to gain business insights and to make better decisions based on the growing volume of data generated today are increasingly adopting Apache Hadoop as a core element of their infrastructure. Running Apache Hadoop on vSphere offers enhanced high availability, increased agility, lower TCO and better control of resources to increase hardware utilization. By virtualizing Apache Hadoop, IT departments are able to avoid the costs associated with building and operating separate physical clusters, and instead gain the benefits of pooling compute and storage resources on one common platform.
With data volumes growing rapidly, leading companies turn to Cloudera to solve their big data challenges. Newly certified for VMware vSphere, Cloudera Enterprise helps ensure that joint customers have a performant and reliable enterprise-grade solution for deploying, managing and running virtualized Apache Hadoop clusters. Joint customers can now run Cloudera Enterprise, comprising the 100 percent open source Cloudera Distribution including Apache Hadoop (CDH) and Cloudera Manager, on vSphere and receive commercial support.
“Cloudera and VMware both share the goal of bringing Hadoop to the enterprise,” said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development, Cloudera. “By completing the certification testing of Cloudera Enterprise on VMware vSphere®, VMware and Cloudera are committed to providing customers with the ability to run the most widely deployed distribution of Apache Hadoop on the leading virtualization and cloud platform today. This is consistent with our vision of enabling customers maximum flexibility to deploy Cloudera where and how they want. As Hadoop technology has continued to evolve and mature, Cloudera and VMware are giving customers the ability to rapidly deploy Hadoop and achieve new levels of flexibility and control.”
“As enterprise adoption of Hadoop moves from experimentation to strategic production deployments, more organizations will examine methods of increasing performance and improving reliability," said Matthew Aslett, research director, Data Management and Analytics, 451 Research. “Having successfully virtualized servers for other workloads it is inevitable that enterprises will explore what benefits virtualization can bring to Hadoop. The certification of Cloudera Enterprise on VMware vSphere® enables enterprises to examine the benefits of virtualization while paving the way for mixed workload and Hadoop-as-a-Service environments."
VMware has worked with the Apache Hadoop community, including Cloudera, to help enterprises take advantage of vSphere to deploy an Apache Hadoop cluster in minutes, including common Hadoop components like Apache HBase, Apache Hive and Apache Pig. Together with Cloudera, VMware offers enterprises flexibility in how they deploy, run and manage Apache Hadoop to solve their big data challenges.
