Cloudera Enhances QuickStart VM with New Search Features for Big Data






 









First Hadoop Platform VM to Market Integrates With Impala and Cloudera Search to Enable Real-Time, Natural-Language or SQL Queries for Data in Hadoop
PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Jun 20, 2013) - Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop, today announced new updates to its Cloudera QuickStart Virtual Machine (VM), a free no registration download that offers the Cloudera experience on a single machine. It enables users to easily sample the power of Hadoop for Big Data. The first Hadoop Platform VM to market, Cloudera's QuickStart VM, is now integrated with Cloudera Search and Cloudera Impala to provide real-time search capabilities and easier, faster access to data in Hadoop. Additional updates to QuickStart VM include: integration with the new 2.3 version of the Hadoop user interface (UI) project Hue, support for new CDH version 4.3 and Cloudera Manager (CM) version 4.6, and expanded tutorials, videos and user guides for enhanced Hadoop training.

Delivering a working Hadoop environment directly out-of-the-box, Cloudera's free QuickStart VM is the best way to learn and experiment with Hadoop. With the new integration of Cloudera Search, the QuickStart VM is easier to use than ever before. Powered by Apache Solr, Cloudera Search enables users to perform full-text, natural-language search queries directly on data stored in a Hadoop cluster. For the first time, casual users can query data in Hadoop just as easily as they would with any online search engine. Data analysts can also use the new Impala capabilities to immediately execute SQL queries directly against data in Hadoop, eliminating the cost and hassle of moving around large datasets.

In addition to the new search capabilities, QuickStart VM has been upgraded with the new version of Hue 2.3, the open-source Web UI that makes Hadoop easier to use. Originally created by Cloudera in 2009 and developed over the years by the Apache open source community, Hue provides a framework that helps developers to create interactive web applications for Hadoop. QuickStart VM also supports the newest versions of CDH 4.3 (Cloudera's Distribution Including Apache Hadoop) and CM 4.6 (Cloudera Manager). With new and improved tutorials, example videos and user guides included in the QuickStart VM, administrators and end users alike are able to learn and use Hadoop more quickly and easily than ever before.

"For years, the Hadoop-curious have downloaded our QuickStart VM as their first introduction to Hadoop. We are continually updating and improving the VM, and we are proud to have integrated Cloudera's new groundbreaking Hadoop query features, Impala and Search, into this latest version of QuickStart VM," said Amr Awadallah, chief technology officer at Cloudera. "QuickStart VM enables beginners to get up and running in Hadoop quickly, while more-experienced Hadoop users can enjoy experimenting with Cloudera's powerful new search and querying features. QuickStart VM is just one more way we are helping more organizations to leverage the power of Hadoop to get valuable business insights from all their data."

New features of Cloudera QuickStart VM:M

Real-time natural-language queries through Cloudera Search
Real-time SQL querying through Cloudera Impala
Support for Hue 2.3, CDH 4.3, and Cloudera Manager 4.6
Updated tutorials and example videos enable easier and faster ramp-up
Improved guided user experiences, tailored for administrators and end users/analysts

Availability 
Immediately available for VirtualBox, VMware and KVM, the new Cloudera QuickStart VM is offered for free download at cloudera.com/downloads.
