Cloudera Wins 2013 American Technology Award from TechAmerica Foundation






 









Cloudera Enterprise Takes Top Honors in Big Data Applications Category
Palo Alto, CA – June 24, 2013 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that it has been honored by TechAmerica Foundation as the winner of the 2013 American Technology Awards (ATAs) in the Big Data Applications category. The company’s Platform for Big Data, Cloudera Enterprise, was recognized for delivering a turnkey, end-to-end data management platform based on Apache Hadoop to support big data deployments. Winners of this year’s ATAs were selected based on a thorough evaluation by industry experts and technology leaders. The awards were presented at TechAmerica’s annual Technology and Government gala dinner in Washington, D.C. on June 20.
“The category for Big Data applications was highly competitive and full of wonderful products. The team at Cloudera deserves the credit and recognition of an American Technology Award for their outstanding work,” said Shawn Osborne, Chairman at TechAmerica Foundation. “We congratulate and thank them for their contributions to the growth and innovation of our vibrant industry.”
Cloudera Enterprise is the industry’s leading enterprise data management solution. Powered by Apache Hadoop, Cloudera Enterprise delivers a fully integrated and production-ready platform for big data deployments. Comprised of CDH – Cloudera’s 100% open source distribution of Apache Hadoop and related projects, best-in-class technical support, and Cloudera Manager – the first end-to-end management automation application for Apache Hadoop -- Cloudera Enterprise delivers the mission-critical characteristics and features that enterprises require.
Unlike any Hadoop solution on the market for data management and analysis, Cloudera Enterprise offers leading edge technology, technical support and professional training services to help speed the time to deployment and ROI for big data deployments. Sold as a subscription service, this turnkey solution enables enterprises to ask bigger questions and derive real business value from both structured and unstructured data, with real time processing and analysis across industry-standard hardware and in distributed computing environments.
“We are honored to be recognized by TechAmerica and exceedingly proud of the advancements Cloudera Enterprise is helping to make, both in the public and private sectors,” said Mike Olson, co-founder and chief strategy officer, Cloudera. “As organizations continue to grapple with unprecedented data growth, Cloudera remains committed to delivering the innovation required to address the opportunities and challenges of big data from a single, unified platform powered by Apache Hadoop.”
