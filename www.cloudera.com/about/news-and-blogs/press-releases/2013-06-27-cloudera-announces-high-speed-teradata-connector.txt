Cloudera Announces High-Speed Teradata Connector






 









Leading Enterprise Analytic Data Management Vendor Announces Availability of Cloudera Connector Powered by Teradata, Based on Apache Sqoop Technology
PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Jun 27, 2013) - Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced the release of a new connector based on Apache Sqoop. The Cloudera Connector Powered by Teradata is designed to seamlessly and efficiently transfer large volumes of data. Working in collaboration to develop, test and bring the connector to market, the two companies are ensuring joint customer organizations can achieve greater business value from their Cloudera and Teradata investments.
Based on Sqoop technology, which facilitates fast data import from SQL databases into a Hadoop cluster, Cloudera Connector Powered by Teradata further optimizes performance by leveraging technology provided by Teradata. Additionally, the connector has been tested jointly to ensure interoperability between the platforms, with product and engineering teams from both companies collaborating together to enhance integration and drive mutual customer success.
"Like many other long-time Teradata customers, we're deploying Hadoop to complement our Teradata environment because it offers a very economical option for long-term, petascale data management," said Ravi Hubbly, senior principal architect at Lockheed Martin. "If we can give our SQL and Teradata users access to the data in Hadoop through a high-speed Teradata-Hadoop connector, it will expand the usability of our Hadoop platform and allow our Teradata users to leverage the economic advantages Hadoop offers."
"As data continues to grow at unprecedented speed and organizations need to access and analyze the vast amounts of data held within their data warehouse and Hadoop platform, enterprises expect to have seamless access to the data, more quickly and efficiently," said Charles Zedlewski, vice president, Products, Cloudera. "In partnering with Teradata to bring Cloudera Connector Powered by Teradata to market, Cloudera is able to help companies complement their investment in data warehouses by providing flexibility to move data to and from Hadoop, leveraging the benefits both platforms have to offer." 
Additional information

Cloudera Connector Powered by Teradata is now available for free download and support is available for Cloudera Enterprise customers.
