Motorola Mobility Wins TDWI Best Practices Award for Big Data Deployment Powered by Cloudera






 









PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Jul 19, 2013) - Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that The Data Warehousing Institute (TDWI) has recognized its customer, Motorola Mobility, as a 2013 Best Practices Award winner in the Emerging Technologies and Methods category for its implementation of Cloudera's Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH). Motorola Mobility, a Google company, creates great mobile experiences for consumers. Whether it is calling, writing email, playing games, listening to music, watching a movie, taking pictures and videos, surfing the web, collaborating or sharing content -- Motorola Mobility is putting consumers at the center of it all. Motorola leverages CDH as part of its broader deployment of Cloudera Enterprise to derive deeper and more meaningful insights from its business data, enabling the company to respond with greater agility and efficiency to the ever-changing needs of customers in the hyper competitive global smartphone market.
TDWI's Best Practices Awards program identifies and honors companies that have demonstrated excellence in developing, deploying and maintaining BI and DW applications. The nominated solutions were evaluated based on business impact, maturity, innovation and relevance.
"The competition for this year's Best Practices Awards was at an all-time high. We saw innovative, forward-thinking solutions from many of the best and brightest in the BI/DW industry," said Richard Zbylut, president of TDWI. "This year's winners stand out on the leading edge and showcase an array of bold, new strategies destined to push and challenge the BI status quo. TDWI is honored to share that work with a larger audience."
Motorola Mobility is leading the extension of traditional enterprise data warehousing systems and tools to "big data" and analytics systems. Motorola introduced the concept of a "Unified Data Repository Platform" that is intended to break data silos in the enterprise and help drive a comprehensive global view of the business and its customers by harnessing the power of data. This platform is built using technologies that scale on demand and at price points and speeds which are orders of magnitude better than traditional technologies.
With the adoption of a cloud-based solution, Motorola uses the power of the open-source, distributed application framework Hadoop to run computations previously constrained by cost, scalability, speed, or resources. The company is now able to conduct large-scale, complex analyses across a mix of internal and external data sources so that the business can evaluate the performance of existing products, understand consumer perception of its products and features, get feedback on potential new product offering and identify and address quality issues before they impact customers.
Motorola's approach is beginning to have a meaningful impact on business KPIs. Customer satisfaction scores have risen based on call center insights, product returns (a metric of quality) are decreasing based on service center insights, while Motorola forums and other open forums are helping drive insights into customer sentiment. This in turn is helping internal business functions to respond effectively to the voice of the customer. The business is now better positioned to manage its product line, forecast demand and manage supply chain inventory with a greater accuracy and with shorter turnaround.
"We congratulate Motorola on this well-deserved recognition from TDWI," said Alan Saldich, VP of Marketing at Cloudera. "Their innovative application of CDH and Cloudera Enterprise is a prime example of how businesses are harnessing the power of Hadoop to turn previously untapped data stores into meaningful customer, business and operational insights that have a profound effect on their bottom line. We are committed to enabling companies, like Motorola, to leverage the power of data to drive their business forward at the speed of innovation."
