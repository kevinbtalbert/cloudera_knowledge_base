Cloudera Names Dick Williams to Board of Directors






 









Brings Strong Security Heritage to Leading Hadoop Vendor
PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Jul 25, 2013) - Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that Dick Williams, president and chief executive officer of Internet security firm Webroot, a global Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider of internet security products for consumers and businesses, has joined the company's board of directors. Currently an outside director of 3VR and LogRhythm, Williams brings more than four decades of executive and operational leadership experience working with high technology, software and digital media companies, to Cloudera's board.
"Cloudera is well-positioned to achieve its next phase of growth with an industry leader like Dick Williams joining its board of directors," said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer, Cloudera. "As Big Data projects go mainstream they will increasingly need to be compliant, secure and trusted sources of decision making. Dick brings a strong security skillset to both our board and company. Known for his consistent innovation and leadership track record at companies like Digital Research, IBM, Illustra Information Technologies and Wily Technology, Dick has the expertise and understanding to successfully support Cloudera's continued growth. We plan to leverage his experience to ensure our customer and partner ecosystems continue to maximize their investment in Cloudera technology. We welcome him onboard and look forward to our continued market leadership."
Williams has worked as CEO or chairman of several category-defining technology companies, funded by some of the most successful venture capital firms in the world. Most recently, Williams was chairman of Hyperic, a leader in open source systems management software for the ever-expanding web, SaaS and cloud applications and infrastructures, and chairman of Altor Networks, a provider of security for virtual data centers and the cloud.
Prior to that, Williams was CEO of Wily Technology, the leader in Web application management, which was acquired by CA. Earlier, he was CEO of Illustra Information Technologies, a pioneer of object relational database technology. Williams then co-founded and served as chairman of Quokka Sports, an immersive online sport media company, which completed its initial public offering in 1999.
Williams' executive leadership experience began at IBM, where he held a variety of sales, marketing, product and business management roles, including vice president for the company's Data Systems and General Products divisions, during a tenure that spanned more than 22 years. He then served as president and CEO of Digital Research, which he turned around and later sold to Novell. At Novell Williams served as executive vice president of sales and support, and general manager of Novell's Digital Research Systems Group. Williams holds a Bachelor of Science in Math and Physics from The University of North Dakota.
"With its market-leading Hadoop technology and services, Cloudera is committed to providing transformative value to enterprises with a number of ground-breaking developments made over the years," said Dick Williams. "The company is in no better position than now to seize the opportunity in front of it for continued success. I look forward to contributing to its future direction and growth alongside its strong executive team."
