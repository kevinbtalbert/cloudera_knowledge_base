'The Cloudera Sessions' Roadshow Helps Companies Navigate the Big Data Journey






 









Attendees Learn to Design a Blueprint for Successful Enterprise Analytic Data Management
PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Aug 28, 2013) -
What: Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, will be hosting the second leg of the 2013 The Cloudera Sessions roadshow. Following on from an earlier successful series of educational and practical one-day in person events, The Cloudera Sessions contains a unique combination of overview and deep-dive content on Apache Hadoop and enterprise data management. They are designed for business owners, IT management, their reports and developers with an interest in implementing or extending/building on a Big Data platform.
The Cloudera Sessions roadshow is designed to help organizations to identify where they are on their Big Data journey and to navigate how to stay the course in a low-risk, productive way. The Cloudera Sessions' attendees will benefit from hearing about Cloudera and its partners' experiences with real-world deployments, as well as those of Hadoop users who plan and manage them.
The main theme will center on operational efficiency. Other focus areas will incorporate data warehouse optimization, security and data analytics. New for this roadshow, Cloudera will offer a track for developers with The Hadoop App Development Lab.
Line of Business Owners will:

Learn how Big Data delivers business value - Gain advantage from ALL data while using existing infrastructure and practices, meeting all compliance requirements, and reducing costs.

IT Executives, managers, and staff will:

Design a blueprint for Enterprise Data Management - Pursue a practical, proven approach to the implementation of Hadoop for a full range of workloads while achieving gains in operational efficiency (e.g., to improve Data Warehouse ROI and more reliably meet SLAs.)

Developers will:

Learn how to build Hadoop applications - Explore the end-to-end architecture of a common data pipeline, and build a simple end-to-end Hadoop data app that can adapt to a company's own use cases, using the Cloudera Development Kit (CDK).


Why: Company leaders are relying on IT to leverage Big Data to transform their business and gain a competitive advantage. Organizations of all types and sizes are realizing that integrating the Apache Hadoop stack into their IT infrastructure solves very common, near-term data management challenges. Meanwhile, deploying Hadoop offers the long-term promise of rapid innovation via advanced analytics and the application of data science. But getting from Point A to Point Z with the least risk has been a challenge -- whether you're an implementer, operator, or business owner.
When: The series begins in San Francisco with five additional U.S. cities to follow:
11 September - San Francisco, California 
13 September - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 
18 September - Jersey City, New Jersey 
19 September - Miami, Florida 
26 September - Denver, Colorado 
17 October - Milwaukee, Wisconsin 

Where: Visit cloudera.com/clouderasessions for exact locations.
Who: Cloudera executive speakers include Amr Awadallah, chief technical officer; Kirk Dunn, chief operating officer; Josh Wills, senior director, Data Science and others.
Customer speakers include Comcast, eBay, Intelligent Software Solutions, LiveRamp and Nielsen. 
Featured partners include Appfluent, Cisco, Dataguise, IBM, OpenBI, NetApp, QlikTech, Syncsort, Talend and Zoomdata.
