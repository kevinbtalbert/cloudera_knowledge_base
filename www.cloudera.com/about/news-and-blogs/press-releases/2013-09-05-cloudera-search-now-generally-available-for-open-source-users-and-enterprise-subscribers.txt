Cloudera Search Now Generally Available for Open Source Users and Enterprise Subscribers






 









New Real-Time Search Subscription Add-On Allows Cloudera Customers to Get Maximum Value From the Industry's First Fully Integrated Search Solution for Hadoop
PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Sep 5, 2013) - Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop, today announced the general availability of Cloudera Search and the accompanying add-on RTS (Real-time Search) subscription. Cloudera Search is the industry's first fully integrated search engine for interactive exploration of data stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Apache HBase™. The RTS subscription enables customers to more effectively leverage Cloudera Search by providing technical support, legal indemnification and continual influence over the development of the open source project.
The Next Generation of Search for Enterprise Users of Hadoop
For years, databases attempted to provide search as a feature in their platforms but this approach was largely abandoned in favor of acquiring independent search products that require their own infrastructure, integration and expertise. Hadoop's flexibility makes it well suited for search, and consequently, a better general-purpose platform for data exploration than relational databases. Cloudera Search enables anyone within an organization to perform interactive, natural language keyword searches and faceted navigation without additional training or advanced programming knowledge, so both technical and non-technical business users can explore and analyze data in Hadoop.
Released as a public beta offering in June 2013, Cloudera Search was the first enterprise-ready search-on-Hadoop solution on the market. Since that time, the company has worked closely with enterprise customers, open source users and technology partners, rigorously testing and refining the platform in real world applications to deliver today's production-hardened and customer validated 1.0 release, designed from the ground-up for mission critical workloads.
Cloudera Search is specifically designed to support business users in quickly and efficiently locating relevant data stored in Hadoop for further processing and analysis and is fully integrated with the CDH platform. Key features include:

Scalable, Reliable Index Storage in HDFS: integrates index storage and serving directly into HDFS.
Batch Indexing via MapReduce: allows for scalable and robust index creation of data stored in HDFS and HBase that is comparable to MapReduce.
Real-time Indexing at Collection: makes events searchable as it they are stored in HDFS and HBase through near real-time indexing features, powered by Apache Flume™ and the Lily HBase Indexer.
Easy Interaction and Data Exploration via Cloudera Hue: offers plug-in application and easy-to-install capabilities for standard Hue servers to query data and view result files, enabling faceted exploration.
Simplified Field Extraction and Cross-Platform Data Processing:enables quick and easy field extraction of any data that is stored in HDFS using optimized Hadoop file formats, such as Apache Avro ™. Users can avoid the pain that many standalone search solutions impose, by promoting reusable configurations and processing activities with the new processing framework, Cloudera Morphlines
Unified Management and Monitoring with Cloudera Manager: provides a centralized management and monitoring experience that makes it as easy to deploy, configure, and monitor search services as it is to manage CDH deployments and other services on the Hadoop cluster.

Maximize the Value of Cloudera Search with an RTS Subscription
The RTS (Real-time Search) subscription is the best way to leverage the power of Cloudera Search, offering technical support, legal indemnification and continual influence over the development of the open source project. With an RTS subscription, customers can get up and running more quickly, resolve issues more effectively and ensure that the technology remains in alignment with the strategic objectives of their big data deployment.
"As enterprise Hadoop deployments continue to mature, becoming primary repositories for more and more types of data, the center of gravity for data management continues to make a meaningful shift toward Hadoop," said Charles Zedlewski, vice president, Products, Cloudera. "We've taken what was once a relatively complicated and involved freestanding system, requiring its own hardware and operational model, and turned it into a feature of a larger, more ubiquitous open source platform -- CDH. We believe this integrated approach represents a big step forward for users of both Solr and Hadoop. With Cloudera Search, Hadoop deployments can now be explored with the same ease of use and speed as a simple Google search engine query, empowering our customers to achieve rapid insights from a fully integrated platform."
"For too long, the power of data has been available only to technical users in the enterprise. To fully unlock the potential of Hadoop, data needs to be available and consumable by workers beyond IT and across the organization," said Justin Langseth, chief executive officer and founder, Zoomdata. "Through our integration with Impala and Cloudera Search, Zoomdata customers can turn big datasets and streams into compelling, interactive visualizations that makes information accessible to anyone. Our partnership with Cloudera gives our mutual customers the ability to see, analyze and explore their data in real time and put it to work, regardless of their technical skill level. Everyday business users now have the power to find information and perform analytics on billions of rows of raw data from almost on any device without the need for additional training."
