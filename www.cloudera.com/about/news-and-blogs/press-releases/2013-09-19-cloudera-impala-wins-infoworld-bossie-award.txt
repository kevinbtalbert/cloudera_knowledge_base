Cloudera Impala Wins InfoWorld Bossie Award






 









First Interactive SQL Querying Engine for Hadoop Named One of 2013's Best Open Source Big Data Tools
PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Sep 19, 2013) - Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that Cloudera Impala has been recognized by IDG's InfoWorld with a 2013 Bossie Award in the category of Best Open Source Big Data Tools. InfoWorld, a leading IT publication, selected Impala for its low-latency SQL queries across Hadoop with near-real-time insight into big data.
Cloudera Impala is the industry's first open source, massively parallel processing (MPP) query engine that runs natively on Apache Hadoop. First released to public beta in October 2012 and general availability in May 2013, the Apache-licensed project was first to take Hadoop decisively "beyond batch," enabling users to conduct real time processing and analysis of datasets stored in HDFS and Apache HBase. Impala was purpose-built from the ground up to perform sophisticated queries "at the speed of thought" on even massive structured and unstructured datasets for the fastest time to insight.
"Impala is one of the most exciting open source innovations since the advent of Apache Hadoop and we are proud to have been the catalyst for its invention. We share the honor of this recognition from InfoWorld with the community of open source developers that have contributed to its evolution," said Alan Saldich, Vice President of Marketing at Cloudera. "Open source technologies like Hadoop and Impala are fueling today's global business environment, offering new opportunities for business and customer insights that are fundamentally changing the way enterprises make decisions. With Impala, organizations now have business critical answers to sophisticated questions at their fingertips."
