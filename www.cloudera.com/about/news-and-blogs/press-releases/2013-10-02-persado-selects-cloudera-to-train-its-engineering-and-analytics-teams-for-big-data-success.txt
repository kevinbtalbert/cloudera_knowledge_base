Persado Selects Cloudera to Train Its Engineering and Analytics Teams for Big Data Success






 









Custom-Tailored Professional Training Program From Cloudera University Addresses Big Data Skills Gap to Give Global Marketing Engineering Firm a Competitive Edge
PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Oct 2, 2013) - Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that Persado, the global leader in Marketing Language Engineering, selected Cloudera University as its training vendor of choice to educate its technical teams on Hadoop and other advanced data analytics and management technologies. Leveraging the unparalleled expertise of Cloudera's education team, Persado engineers and data analysts successfully completed an intensive weeklong training and certification program on Apache Hadoop, Apache Hive, Apache Pig and Cloudera Impala. Cloudera customized a curriculum to give the Persado team the necessary tools and skills to support its marketing language engineering platform at scale and deliver quantifiably improved marketing campaigns on behalf of its rapidly growing global customer base.
Knowledge Is Power: Overcoming Internal Skills Gap Is the First Step to Hadoop Success
Business data holds limitless opportunities for increased insight into both consumer behavior and proclivities, which in turn promotes better brand engagement and increased conversions. No one knows this better than Persado, the pioneer and global leader in marketing language engineering. Persado ensures brands are delivering the most effective marketing message to their target audience at every digital interaction by utilizing a systematic methodology that employs math, computational linguistics and big data to provide brands with the absolute best click-through, response and conversion rates possible. Persado enables these brands to truly understand why their customers click, respond and buy.
To assure the highest quality experience for both clients and their end users, Persado's engineering team collaborates with renowned statisticians and data analysts to develop innovative ways of generating the precise marketing content that will deliver the highest engagement across any digital encounter.
Given the challenge of supporting ongoing data collection and querying at scale, Persado's data warehouse plays a critical role in its marketing language engineering value chain, assuring a steady and unobstructed multidirectional flow of information. Persado's data warehouse team ensures its infrastructure can support its data scientists' needs, delivering easy access to information and significantly less time to insight.
In 2010, the company made a strategic decision to migrate its legacy relational database management system (RDBMS) to a more flexible, scalable and cost-effective Big Data capable environment. As its analytics and reporting needs continued to become increasingly complex and time sensitive, Persado also needed to find a way to efficiently collect, aggregate and process its data from disparate sources like MongoDB, MySQL config servers and Apache logs. With its powerful data processing and analytics capabilities, Hadoop quickly emerged as the clear choice to quickly and efficiently extend Persado's existing data infrastructure.
As the deployment matured and Persado's analytics and reporting requirements became increasingly sophisticated, they looked to move the 'center of gravity' in their datacenter towards Hadoop, however, there were too few Big Data engineers on staff to sufficiently grow its capabilities and scale its systems. Persado's engineering leadership team determined that training its technical teams on the Hadoop technology stack would be the fastest path to ensuring they could support both the near- and long-term objectives of their Big Data deployment.
After evaluating several vendors, Persado selected Cloudera to develop an intensive weeklong program focused on Apache Hadoop, Apache Hive and Apache Pig to deliver onsite instruction at its corporate datacenter in Athens, Greece. The team's decision to work with Cloudera was based on various factors, chief among them being Cloudera's unrivaled domain expertise and the quality of its training and certification programs, its ability to mobilize and support private corporate training in Europe, its strong commitment to the Apache open source community and many contributions to advancing the Hadoop platform and its reputation for being a great organization with which to work.
"Working with Cloudera delivered significant benefits almost immediately, since no other company offers a full data analyst training program targeted at both developers and analysts working with Big Data in Hadoop, which was one of our biggest priorities," said Xinyu Huang, VP of Engineering at Persado. "Equally important to us was knowing that our staff was being trained on the world's most relevant, comprehensive, and production-tested open-source distribution of the Apache Hadoop stack."
Collaborating closely with Persado, Cloudera was able to develop a tailored curriculum that leveraged insights from the engineers who built the Hadoop platform to maximize the course's return. Cloudera's experienced instructor offered interactive training onsite throughout the week, helping to significantly shorten the Persado team's learning curve so that the participants were able to immediately apply their newfound skills in the context of their own data objectives and development use case.
"Cloudera has the most knowledgeable and largest number of full-time Hadoop trainers in mainland Europe, which helped us to save time, money and productivity," Huang continued. "They created an exceptional program for our team, incorporating best practices developed from our engineers and their own experiences in real world production deployments to offer invaluable insights into the use cases that are shaping the Hadoop market today."
With the new skills and expertise gained through its customized training program from Cloudera University, Persado's engineering and data analyst teams are now well equipped to maximize and extend the company's Hadoop deployment, enabling them to uncover deeper, more meaningful insights to drive greater value for their customers.
"Not only has Cloudera training prepared us for success today, but it has given us the tools to face and prevail over our Big Data challenges in the future," said Huang.
"Persado is leading the way in marketing innovation leveraging the power of Big Data," said Sarah Sproehnle, Vice President of Educational Services at Cloudera. "Hadoop training has empowered and prepared Persado's technical teams to support the unique needs of their data platform and maximize its potential. Their forward-thinking implementation of Hadoop was already helping to augment and extend the capabilities of their data warehouse, driving increased business intelligence and competitive advantage across their global organization. Now, having equipped Persado's staff with the knowledge and skills to better support its platform and address future growth at the speed of innovation, the sky's the limit in terms of business potential."
