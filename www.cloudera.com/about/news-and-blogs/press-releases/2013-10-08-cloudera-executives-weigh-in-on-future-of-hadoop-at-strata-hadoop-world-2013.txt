Cloudera Executives Weigh in on Future of Hadoop at Strata + Hadoop World 2013






 









Keynotes From Chief Strategy Officer Mike Olson and Chief Architect Doug Cutting at Premier Data Industry Event
PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Oct 8, 2013) - Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, unveiled its speaker lineup for Strata + Hadoop World 2013 today. More than a dozen Cloudera executives and engineers are slated to speak at the event. Speakers will share invaluable insights, use cases and best practices on topics ranging from technologies in the Hadoop stack, to the evolution of the data management industry, as Hadoop becomes the de facto next generation data management system.
Co-located with O'Reilly's Strata New York City conference for its second year, Strata + Hadoop World has grown to become the premier event in the data management industry, bringing together many of the brightest practitioners, end users, committers, commentators and innovators in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. This year's event is expected to draw record attendance, with well over 2,500 end users, business leaders, solution providers, and open source contributors for three days of tutorials, workshops and discussions about the tools and techniques that make data work.
Join Mike Olson for: Hadoop's Impact on the Future of Data Management
Kicking off the conference with the event's opening keynote on October 29 at 8:55am ET, Cloudera Chief Strategy Officer and Chairman, Mike Olson will discuss how Hadoop is shaping the trajectory of the data management industry, offering insights and predictions for how it will ultimately shape the enterprise datacenter.
"Hadoop's velocity -- its dramatic increase in capabilities over the last several years, and its pace of adoption by large enterprises for big data workloads -- has been nothing short of extraordinary. The speed of that change has shaken the very foundation of the technology industry, and it's clear that the revolution has only begun," said Olson. "At Cloudera, we're proud to be driving the product and the business innovation that will make Big Data dominant in the years to come. With our partners, we're empowering a fast-growing number of organizations to ask bigger questions. The second year of our joint conference with O'Reilly promises to be the most exciting, and best-attended, Hadoop World yet."
Join Doug Cutting for: The Future of Hadoop: What Happened and What's Possible? 
Hadoop Co-creator and Cloudera's Chief Architect, Doug Cutting will discuss the future of Hadoop during his keynote session on October 30 at 8:50am ET. In addition to founding Hadoop, Cutting is also a founder of several other Apache open source projects, including Lucene, Nutch and Avro.
"I look forward to Strata + Hadoop World each year and am continually inspired by the innovators it attracts, gathering together with the shared goal of learning and exchanging ideas to solve some of society and business's greatest challenges," said Cutting. "Data holds the answers to highly complex questions in health and earth sciences, business and beyond, if only we could recognize the patterns. Working together, the Hadoop ecosystem is putting this level of detailed analysis within reach. This is a community that is changing the world we live in."
