FICO Selects Cloudera Platform to Provide Big Data Backbone for FICO Analytic Cloud






 









Application developers, business users and FICO partners will be able to process, analyze and act on Big Data in a cloud environment
SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 16, 2013 -- /PRNewswire/ -- FICO (NYSE:FICO), a leading predictive analytics and decision management software company, and Cloudera, the leading provider of enterprise-grade Apache Hadoop data management software, support services and training, today announced a joint agreement to provide a Big Data platform for the FICO®Analytic Cloud, an environment for creating, customizing and deploying powerful, analytics-driven applications and services.
The FICO Analytic Cloud will run Cloudera Enterprise, which includes CDH, an enterprise-ready, 100 percent open-source Apache Hadoop distribution, and Cloudera Manager, an end-to-end management application for Hadoop. Pushing the limits of high performance, scalability and platform extensibility, these technologies will help spur Big Data innovation in the FICO Analytic Cloud by giving application developers, business users and FICO partners the ability to process, analyze and act on vast amounts of data. With one-stop access to best-in-class analytics, decision management tools and technology, FICO customers can now leverage the most widely deployed and feature-complete Big Data platform in the cloud.
"Now, the FICO Analytic Cloud will enable users to leverage Big Data to solve problems that were previously thought to be unsolvable," said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development, Cloudera. "FICO Analytic Cloud clients will be able to choose our industry-leading Big Data platform and have more options when deploying Big Data analytics. Like FICO, Cloudera is committed to developing a Big Data ecosystem that supports a broad set of applications and industries, and this agreement represents a big step forward for us both."
"With the FICO Analytic Cloud, we are knocking down the barriers to finding insights quickly in new and emerging types of data," said Stuart Wells, chief technology officer at FICO. "Using technologies like Hadoop and Cloudera, our clients, partners and developers will be able to rapidly consume, contribute to and collaborate on innovations large and small in a cloud environment."
Built on the industry's leading open-source technologies and leveraging the latest industry standards, the FICO® Analytic Cloud is designed to support data transportability, open modeling and analytics best practices. FICO will be rolling out components of the FICO Analytic Cloud throughout 2013 and 2014. The solution will be available next month at http://www.ficoanalyticcloud.com.
