Cloudera Partners With Comverse to Herald New Big Data Capabilities for Service Providers and Consumers






 









Comverse Begins Deploying IP Messaging & RCS Solutions With HBase, Powering Innovation and Cost Savings
PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Oct 22, 2013) - Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced a partnership with Comverse, ( NASDAQ : CNSI), the global leader in telecom business enablement, to drastically boost big data storage capabilities to support service innovation and slash costs. Comverse is currently deploying the big data solution in a next-generation messaging context for a North American communication service provider (CSP).
 
"Data storage technology has advanced to such a degree that it is rendering conventional data storage and management models increasingly obsolete," said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development, Cloudera. "The world's most advanced technology firms are moving to NoSQL databases, and we view the introduction of Hadoop big data capabilities into the telecommunications messaging environment through an industry powerhouse like Comverse as an exciting watershed event that will generate a wave of innovation benefiting operators and end-users alike. During my onsite review, I was impressed by Comverse's NoSQL expertise and their fine-tuned HBase implementation, optimized for high performance and throughput."
The new data storage technology is embedded within Comverse products, providing a centralized single HBase platform serving multiple capabilities, such as:

Message Store for Converged Messaging
Converged Address Book
Store & Forward
Archive Services

Lifetime of Messaging History with No Limits
"Comverse Digital Services captures the essence and energy of today's digital lifestyle with unlimited data storage and management, providing a truly differentiating customer experience for both consumers and enterprises," said Gabriel Matsliach, SVP, Chief Product Officer at Comverse. "Cloudera enables Comverse RCS & IP Messaging solutions to preserve a lifetime of messaging history without limits for even the largest tier-1 CSPs with tens of millions of subscribers: all dates (no expiration), all devices, and all forms of messaging: traditional & IP messaging, chat, multi-chat, file transfer, voicemail and more."
"With Cloudera, Comverse 4G communications solutions can support even the largest tier-1 CSPs with tens of millions of subscribers with robust access to hundreds of terabytes and petabytes of data, as well as cloud-based RCS & IP Messaging solutions for multiple CSPs. Beyond telco-grade availability with no single point of failure, infinite scalability, geo-redundancy and meaningful cost savings, Comverse is exploring additional directions, implementing advanced data analytics to allow CSPs to derive further benefit from their data through business analytics and other opportunities," added Matsliach.
Find out more about how Comverse Messaging solutions with HBase can catalyse new capabilities and profitability and give you a competitive edge in your market.
