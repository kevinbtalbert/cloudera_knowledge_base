Capgemini and Cloudera Enter Global Partnership to Help Enterprises Realize Big Data Value






 









Partnership Will Leverage Cloudera’s Platform for Big Data and Capgemini’s Business Information Management (BIM) Expertise to Offer Complete End-to-End Solution for Enterprise Analytic Data Management.
PALO ALTO, Calif. and PARIS, France, October 24, 2013 – Capgemini, one of the world’s foremost providers of consulting, technology and outsourcing services and Cloudera, the market leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, have today announced a global partnership. The partnership brings to market the combination of Cloudera’s comprehensive platform for big data management and analytics with Capgemini’s global capabilities and expertise in Business Information Management, to ensure enterprises worldwide can unlock the value of big data.
The partnership is leveraging the power of Cloudera Enterprise, Cloudera’s expert support, training and professional services and Capgemini’s business and technology consulting expertise, to deliver immediate value for the customer. Capgemini has worked with Cloudera’s teams for two years to acquire a deep knowledge of Cloudera’s solutions, and to ramp up the necessary skills throughout its Business Information Management (BIM) global practice, which has more than 8,000 consultants worldwide.
“Together with Cloudera, we help organizations optimize their current technology investments, exploit massive data volumes and new data types, achieving true insight and forward vision to improve operational efficiency, enhance profitability, and achieve competitive edge”, says Scott Schlesinger, senior vice president, head of Business Information Management North America.
The Cloudera Platform for Big Data enables enterprises to store, process, and analyze volumes of data that are an order of magnitude greater than traditional technologies, with a much broader variety of data types, allowing organizations to go beyond the limits of existing architectures. Capgemini supports Cloudera’s vision for enterprise analytic data management, through its “Big Data Service Center” offering - a comprehensive Big Data delivery framework leveraging Capgemini’s Rightshore® approach, bringing together big data strategy governance and organization, with an industrialized, high performance Big Data delivery and support capability.
“For Hadoop to gain widespread adoption in the enterprise, it must become a first class citizen, fitting cleanly into the IT ecosystem and technology environments that already exist,” said Tony Baer, principal analyst, Ovum.“Systems integrators are a core piece of the equation as they provide the skills, the customer knowledge, and delivery networks that are expected of any enterprise-grade platform. Cloudera’s new partnership with Capgemini is an important step toward globally scaling the skills and delivery system that are necessary for making Hadoop a good fit for the enterprise.”
“Data has moved to the center of successful organizations,” said Mike Olson, co-founder and chief strategy officer, Cloudera. “Most enterprises today are still making that transition. They are challenged with quantities of data, from a variety of sources, that overwhelm existing systems and demand a new approach for processing and analysis. Cloudera’s Platform for Big Data and market-leading expertise in big data, combined with Capgemini’s cross-industry business intelligence, delivers real success. Together we help our customers capture, store, process and analyze all their data, delivering results and insight to the right place at the right time.”
“As data sets become increasingly complex, it is essential for enterprises to ensure that business insights and the actions in response to them are being maximized and not missed,” concludes Lanny Cohen, Global CTO, Capgemini.“With our global partnership, customers will be able to leverage Cloudera’s expertise, integrated seamlessly into Capgemini’s BIM services, for end-to-end solutions that deliver effective and faster business results.”
