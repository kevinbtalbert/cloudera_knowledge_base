SAS, Cloudera team up on Hadoop to tame big data






 









Joint engineering for Hadoop eases use, adds functionality
HADOOP WORLD – NEW YORK (Oct. 28, 2013) – Organizations clamor to unleash competitive advantage from the skyrocketing volume, velocity and variety of big data. Integrating analytics, visualization and high speed scoring methods with Hadoop data will get them closer. Building on rapid customer adoption of SAS®/ACCESS Interface for Hadoop TM and SAS® Visual Analytics for big data discovery, SAS and Cloudera introduce SAS®/ACCESS Interface to Impala – Cloudera's new production-ready SQL-on-Hadoop solution.
"With the economic scalability to store and analyze data in Hadoop, SAS and Cloudera allow customers to reveal hidden insights that have loomed out of reach. Businesses can base more decisions on hard data instead of hunches, and look at complete data sets, not just samples," said Randy Guard, SAS Vice President of Product Management. "By providing a more visual and interactive Hadoop experience, SAS makes it easier to discover significant trends and insights. SAS' strategy is to help customers manage their entire analytics lifecycle, from data preparation and exploration, to modeling and deployment – on all the data."
And, with the recently released SAS Scoring Accelerator for Hadoop, Cloudera customers can now score analytic models directly in Hadoop with no data movement, in addition to traditional SAS in-database model scoring. This speeds ad-hoc modeling and scoring of new data sets (like click-stream, market-basket and customer affinity related data) and automates model deployment inside the cluster, significantly reducing costs associated with time-consuming model deployment and maintenance.
"SAS and Cloudera support the functions of IT focused on unifying and managing large volumes of data, and making it available for analytics. This new solution will accelerate the adoption of Hadoop into established enterprises, offering greater value for business users," said Dan Vesset, Program VP, Business Analytics at IDC. "Data scientists and business analysts can use the new offering to quickly explore and visualize data within Cloudera Hadoop clusters to determine what data is relevant for predictive modeling."
"Enterprises struggle to get more out of their most strategic asset – their data," said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development, Cloudera. "As leaders in data management, Cloudera continues to strengthen joint big-data and analytics offerings with SAS. We allow our enterprise customers to easily access and manipulate data in real-time, ensuring quicker decision making and faster time to value.
SAS/ACCESS Interface to Impala will be available in December. The announcement was made at Strata + Hadoop World, the premier event in the data management industry, bringing together many of the brightest practitioners, end users, committers, commentators and innovators in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.
