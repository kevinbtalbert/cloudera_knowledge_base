SoftLayer, an IBM Company, and Cloudera Launch Turnkey Big Data Solutions On Bare Metal Servers






 









Solutions bring Hadoop to the cloud on demand
New York and Dallas—October 28, 2013—SoftLayer, an IBM Company, and Cloudera, a leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced the availability of turnkey, multi-server SoftLayer infrastructure solutions running Cloudera platform. The on-demand solutions are built on bare metal servers engineered for Cloudera best practices and rapidly designed and deployed through SoftLayer’s easy-to-use solution designer tool. Customers may also extend their solutions’ capabilities and responsiveness by subscribing to Cloudera’s expert support at time of ordering.
“Cloudera customers are looking for the paramount solution for managing vast amounts of varied data. With automated deployment of robust bare metal infrastructure to support the program, Cloudera’s joint solution with SoftLayer will push big data solutions into an even higher level of performance and reliability,” said Tim Stevens, VP, Business and Corporate Development, Cloudera.
The robust capabilities and features of Cloudera (as well as Hadoop in general) require significant levels of computing resources, more than typically found in cloud services built on virtualized technologies. But the SoftLayer platform features bare metal cloud servers—which deliver higher performance profiles and advantages over virtual cloud servers—deployed on demand, billed on a pay as you go basis, and with full remote access and control. With SoftLayer, customers have the power and resiliency that Cloudera delivers, with the flexibility and convenience of cloud infrastructure.
"Running big data applications on bare metal servers gives users both the raw performance and consistency they need to analyze vast amounts of data in real-time,” says Marc Jones, VP of Product Innovation for SoftLayer. “The ability to provision a large scale Hadoop cluster in just a few hours sets this offering apart with speed and agility. We’re pushing the envelope of what’s possible on the cloud by giving enterprises the power and flexibility they need to tackle the toughest workloads.”
Cloudera provides scalable and powerful solutions for managing and analyzing vast amounts of varied data. At the core of its Cloudera Standard and Cloudera Enterprise editions is the power of open-source Apache Hadoop software, a leading big data application. Cloudera Standard is a free download that combines entirely open source and enterprise-ready CDH (Cloudera’s Distribution including Apache Hadoop) with Cloudera Manager which provides robust cluster management capabilities like automated deployment, centralized administration, monitoring and diagnostic tools.
Cloudera Navigator, an add-on to Cloudera Enterprise, provides data management, technical support, indemnity, and open source advocacy. Cloudera Enterprise includes everything in Cloudera Standard plus an additional set of Cloudera Manager features and support for the core projects in CDH, enabling customers to store, process, and analyze more data, types and formats than legacy technology while being very cost effective. Additional capabilities such as data management and disaster recovery can be added to Cloudera Enterprise through additional add-on subscriptions.
Features & Benefits

Easy to design and deploy Cloudera applications on-demand and in real-time through SoftLayer Web-based Solution Designer, portal and API
High performance and superior reliability using certified systems that are optimized for running Cloudera to analyze massive amounts of data including dedicated bare metal servers
Superior scalability of global cloud infrastructure with a wide range of dedicated servers and options to tailor memory and storage
Optimized infrastructure and best-practice deployments based on joint insights, expertise, and experience from SoftLayer and Cloudera

Availability & Pricing SoftLayer solutions with Cloudera are immediately available, with prices starting at $699 per-month. This price includes an Intel Xeon 5620-based server with 24GB of RAM and two 500GB SATA storage drives.
