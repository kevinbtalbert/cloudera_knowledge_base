Spring Certifies with Pivotal and Cloudera Simplifying the Creation of Real-World Big Data Applications






 









Spring for Apache Hadoop and Spring XD enable Java developers to build portable big data applications quickly, unifying many disparate approaches in a single solution
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and PALO ALTO, Calif., October 29, 2013 — At the Strata Conference + Hadoop World 2013, Pivotal announced that Spring for Apache Hadoop, which is bundled with Spring XD, has been certified with Pivotal™ HD and Cloudera CDH products. This certification enables Java developers to use modern and familiar tools to build big data applications that work across major Hadoop distributions without modification including Apache Hadoop 1.2.1 and 2.0.6 alpha, as well as Pivotal HD 1.0, Cloudera CDH 4.3.
Developing comprehensive big data applications can be difficult, as today's open source projects typically use separate, independent projects to integrate everything from stream analysis and batch workflow orchestration to data import and export. This leaves a Java developer to wrestle with different programming, configuration and extensibility models.
In addition to helping support portability across Hadoop runtime environments, Spring for Apache Hadoop (SHDP) aims to help simplify the development of Hadoop based applications by providing a consistent configuration and API across a wide range of Hadoop ecosystem projects such as Pig, Hive, and Cascading in addition to providing extensions to Spring Batch for orchestrating Hadoop based workflows.
SHDP, together with Spring Integration, Spring Batch and Spring Data are part of the Spring IO Platform as foundational libraries. Building on top of, and extending this foundation, the Spring IO platform provides a big data runtime named Spring XD (XD = eXtreme Data). Spring XD, available in an early milestone release, provides a single platform that comprehensively addresses common use cases in big data solutions – without the need to write code – just by using a domain specific language (DSL). These use cases include data ingestion from external sources, data transformation and real-time analytics, data import/export to/from HDFS, and workflow orchestration.
These foundational parts of Spring IO platform make Hadoop development more accessible to a wider range of Java developers - including the massive Spring developer community - and make the process even faster for Hadoop experts.
"The combination of Spring for Apache Hadoop and Spring XD represent a major advancement for the Big Data ecosystem,” said Peter Cooper-Ellis, vice president, Engineering for Cloudera." We're pleased to see the debut of a higher level, unified API for developers - which can only result in greater market adoption of Hadoop."
"Applications on Big Data are a critical emerging trend for enterprises to improve utility and increase value from their Big Data," said Adrian Colyer, chief technology officer, Applications at Pivotal "This Spring XD advancement works to unlock Hadoop Big Data for the leading distributions for the masses of enterprise Java developers using Spring."
Spring XD is open source and available at no charge under an Apache 2.0 license, and can be obtained from the Spring.io website.
