Cloudera Announces Winners in 2013 Data Impact Awards






 









Honors Innovative Uses of CDH Including Faster Time to Value, Cost Savings and Social Impact
PALO ALTO, CA – October 31, 2013: Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced the winners of the 2013 Data Impact Awards. The awards recognize and honor innovative use cases for CDH, Cloudera's Distribution Including Apache Hadoop, a significant component of Cloudera’s Platform for Big Data. The winners of the five categories were announced at an awards dinner and ceremony on Monday, 28th October at Strata + Hadoop World, New York.
“The winners of this year’s Data Impact Awards know the importance of deriving value from their data -- these data have the power to transform businesses and change the world,” said Alan Saldich, vice president, Marketing, Cloudera. “We acknowledge the role that each one of these organizations play in leading innovation in their categories and markets to affect business and social advantage.”
Our customers are the leaders and visionaries in their industries around the world; they are asking bigger questions that lead to real insight whether assessing fraud risk, looking for oil deposits in the Gulf of Mexico or saving millions of dollars on data warehouse expansion. They are using Cloudera as the foundation to do it and we are proud to recognize their great work.”
The 2013 Data Impact Award winners are:
Business Impact – AMD

AMD’s decision to move from a traditional relational database to a system that incorporates CDH4 on servers powered by AMD Opteron processors resulted in orders of magnitude performance improvement, storing more data, with less support, and delivering significant cost savings for the company. Query times were reduced by 300% from the previous system.

Integration with Existing IT – MasterCard

The company integrated their Hadoop environment with 10 different systems spanning the larger IT ecosystem to augment its enterprise data warehouse and to support all data management for Truaxis, a recent MasterCard acquisition providing loyalty rewards and personalized statement solutions.

Pervasive User Adoption – The Allstate Corporation

To spur adoption of their universal data archive which resides on CDH, Allstate sent 110 employees to Cloudera University training, which helped to identify power users who’d be able to guide the rest of the organization to use the new system. Hadoop was implemented as a complementary platform to legacy systems, and users were given the necessary tools to help them access data in Hadoop, such as Hive and Pig.

Community Contributions - Gravity

With several Scala engineers in house, the Gravity team decided a couple years ago to use the Scala programming language, not Java, with Hadoop and HBase. Scala doesn’t natively integrate, so the team wrote their own library -- called HPaste -- and contributed it back to the open source community to allow other engineers to take advantage of Scala’s unique features on top of HBase.

Social Impact - Explorys

Explorys claims the world’s largest clinical data set for reporting, business intelligence, population management, disease prevention and evidence-based treatments. The insight provided by Explorys’ platform after just one year allowed one healthcare provider, the largest health system in Ohio, to significantly improve quality measures relating to cancer screenings, pneumonia vaccinations, tobacco cessation, and diabetes control.
