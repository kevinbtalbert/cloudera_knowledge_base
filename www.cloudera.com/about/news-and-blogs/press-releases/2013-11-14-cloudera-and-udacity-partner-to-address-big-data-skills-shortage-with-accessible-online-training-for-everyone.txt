Cloudera and Udacity Partner to Address Big Data Skills Shortage with Accessible Online Training for Everyone






 









Now Offering an Open Hadoop and MapReduce Course Designed to Equip Students with Real-World Technical and Analytical Skills to Fast-Track a Career in the Emerging Data Economy
PALO ALTO, CA – November 14, 2013: Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, and Udacity, a provider of online higher education, today announced their strategic partnership to deliver Hadoop and Data Science training via Udacity’s accessible online education portal. Developed by Cloudera University’s expert faculty together with Udacity’s online instructional designers, the course curriculum is designed to equip students with the fundamental technical and analytical skills required to succeed in the emerging Big Data economy. The first course offered is Introduction to Hadoop and MapReduce.
Addressing the Big Data Skills Gap: Enterprise Demand for Qualified Data Professionals Continues to Rise
As the amount of data being generated and stored across all business sectors continues to increase, enterprise demand for skilled data workers is growing faster than there are qualified people to address it. Faced with a shortage of skilled data professionals, many organizations lack the expertise required to stay competitive and agile in today’s data-driven economy.
“The sheer enormity of data available today presents tremendous opportunities for organizations around the world,” said Steve Karam, data technologist at John Wiley and Sons. “As a data technologist in the digital media space, the need for a firm understanding of the capabilities of Big Data and how it can benefit my company and customers is undeniable. In order to realize the full potential of the rapid proliferation of data, skilled professionals are required to manage and exploit it. Cloudera’s partnership with Udacity will extend the reach of Big Data education, help push Hadoop towards the mainstream, and contribute to the long-term vitality of the global talent pool, which ultimately benefits companies like mine. As a prior Cloudera University student and a fan of Udacity’s teaching model, I believe their partnership provides the type of expertise and leadership that can have a measurable impact on the global technical workforce as Big Data becomes a required skillset.”
To help address this widening gap, Cloudera founded Cloudera University in 2009, offering a variety of training courses and certifications on Apache Hadoop and related technologies for developers, administrators, data analysts, and data scientists. Since its inception, Cloudera University has trained more than 15,000 individuals and certified more than 7,000 Big Data professionals. In April 2013, the company announced the Cloudera Academic Partnership (CAP) to extend its course curriculum, training program, and software platform to leading universities around the world.
Accessibility is Power: Democratizing Big Data Education Through Open, Online Training for All
Together, Udacity and Cloudera are putting massively open, high-quality Big Data training within reach of virtually anyone who has an Internet connection and a passion to learn the fundamentals of Hadoop, beginning with MapReduce. Udacity’s easy-to-use online platform puts the power of learning and Cloudera’s industry-leading curriculum at users’ fingertips, anytime and anywhere. Students are empowered to learn and complete coursework at their own pace and have access to Cloudera’s expert instruction to answer questions along the way. Upon completion of each course, students also have the option to take Cloudera’s full suite of multi-day, live professional training courses and earn accredited professional certifications for their achievements.
“We have been committed to Hadoop and data science education since the very beginning, and through Cloudera University, we have trained and certified tens of thousands of data professionals in countless countries around the world,” said Mike Olson, chief strategy officer and chairman of the Board, Cloudera. “We are immensely proud of that achievement, but we also recognize the physical limitations of the classroom model: we can only reach so many people in a few regions at a time. There are more people around the world who want to learn Hadoop than we can count and, more importantly, there are companies that need skilled Hadoop professionals to deploy an Enterprise Data Hub and integrate all their data capabilities in one place. Our partnership with Udacity helps us get there, since we’re able to co-develop a curriculum based on the core skills we know enterprises require, make it user-centric and open, and place it in a highly curatorial context of education resources specifically for mid-career technology professionals looking to expand their capabilities.”
“Recognizing the growing demand for skilled data professionals, more students are seeking instruction in Hadoop and data science in order to prepare themselves to take advantage of the rapidly expanding data economy. As the leader in Hadoop solutions, training, and services, Cloudera’s insights and technical guidance are in high demand, so we are pleased to be leveraging that experience and expertise as their partner in online open courseware,” said Sebastian Thrun, founder, Udacity. “By making Cloudera training on Hadoop and MapReduce accessible to everyone around the world via Udacity.com, we will now be able to reach previously untapped segments of the global workforce, thereby increasing the number of skilled professionals that can be hired into a Big Data job. We’re working with Cloudera to address the widening data skills gap and prepare the next generation of developers, administrators, data analysts, and data scientists for high-growth careers in the new data economy, beginning with Hadoop.”
“We believe in Udacity’s vision to democratize education by making professional training affordable and accessible to everyone, and believe this model will enable us to more effectively reach aspiring Big Data technologists around the world who want to expand their skills into Hadoop,” added Mike Olson. “Together, Cloudera and Udacity are leveling the playing field, empowering anyone with the desire to learn to get the necessary skills to succeed in the modern data economy, regardless of where they live or what their socio-economic background is.”
