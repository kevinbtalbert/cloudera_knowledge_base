Cloudera Announces Certification and Support of Enterprise Data Hub on Amazon Web Services Cloud






 









Cloudera uses Amazon Web Services to provide Data Management, Analytics and Support for Enterprise Customers
PALO ALTO, CA – December 19, 2013: Cloudera, a leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™ today announced certification and enterprise-grade support for Cloudera Enterprise deployments on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Combining the sophisticated simplicity of the Cloudera Enterprise data management platform, the powerful AWS infrastructure, and technical support, customers can now leverage the power and performance of a complete, robust enterprise data hub in the AWS cloud.  This offering delivers the capabilities that customers need to support big data deployments at scale.
Organizations currently employ a variety of systems to support their diverse data hub goals.  While these systems are suitable for traditional data and workloads, they are not equipped to handle today’s exponential growth in data volume and variety, or the range of users who seek insights from that data.  The objective is simple: acquire and combine any amount or type of data in its original full fidelity form, in a single secure and reliable location, for as long as business needs require, and deliver insights to all kinds of users, as fast as possible.  Cloudera delivers on that objective with the Cloudera Enterprise data management platform, and now makes it possible for organizations to deploy the Cloudera solution as an enterprise data hub in the AWS cloud.
"We anticipate increasing interest in running Hadoop in cloud environments, especially as enterprises continue to modernize their information management architectures and define their next-generation data management platforms," said Matt Aslett, research director, data management and analytics, 451 Research. " Cloudera’s use of Amazon Web Services should give potential users the confidence that they have the support of market leaders when it comes to both their Hadoop platform and their cloud infrastructure.”
Hadoop in the Cloud: The Next Frontier for Enterprise Data Management
As enterprises are looking to embrace Hadoop-powered big data deployments in cloud environments, they have been asking for the ability to seamlessly store, process and analyze data in the cloud.  Cloudera now offers a powerful, production quality big data cloud solution on the AWS platform, delivering on the promise of the enterprise data hub, regardless of where an organization’s data is stored.
"As the leading public and private cloud security provider that blocks malicious bots from attacking websites, Distil Networks has demanding requirements for collecting, analyzing and acting on information in real time," said Rami Essaid, co-founder and CEO of Distil Networks. "The power of Cloudera as our enterprise data hub, together with the flexibility and efficiency of AWS infrastructure, enables us to deliver on our mission of making the web more secure for our customers." 
Key Benefits of deploying Cloudera Enterprise on AWS Include:
● Flexible Deployment, Faster Time to Insight: Using AWS, customers have utmost flexibility in how they deploy Hadoop, and can now bypass prolonged infrastructure selection and procurement processes, to rapidly put Cloudera’s Platform for Big Data to work to start realizing tangible business value from their data immediately.
● Scalable Data Management: At many large organizations, it can take weeks or even months to add new nodes into a traditional data cluster. By deploying Cloudera Enterprise on AWS, enterprises can effectively shorten rest-to-growth cycles to scale their data hubs as their business grows.
● Improved Efficiency, Increased Cost Savings: Deploying on AWS eliminates the need for organizations to dedicate resources toward maintaining a traditional data center, enabling them to focus instead on core competencies. As annual data growth for the average enterprise continues to skyrocket, even relatively new data management systems may experience strain under the demands of modern high performance workloads. By moving their data management platform to the cloud, enterprises can now offset or avoid the need to make costly annual investments in their on-premises data infrastructure to support new enterprise data growth, applications and workloads.
“With Cloudera now offering its enterprise data hub on AWS, we are offering our customers more choice in their cloud deployments,” said Terry Wise, Director, Worldwide Partner Ecosystem, AWS. “Customers have access to a leading Hadoop implementation that delivers compelling analytics and data management capabilities at a fraction of the cost of traditional models. We’re excited that AWS and Cloudera can better support customers looking to capitalize on the benefits of the AWS cloud.”
“While on-premises data management deployments continue to be an option for some enterprises, others prefer the flexibility and economics of the cloud. A data management solution shouldn’t dictate where and how they store their data -- the solution should go to the data,” said Tim Stevens, vice president of corporate and business development at Cloudera. “Enterprises can deploy and operate a comprehensive, fully operational enterprise data hub in the cloud, which provides powerful, flexible, scalable and cost efficient data storage, processing and analytics.”
