Cloudera and Koverse Team to Deliver on the Enterprise Data Hub






 









Partnership helps organizations speed time to insight
PALO ALTO, Calif. and SEATTLE, WA – January 15, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™ and Koverse, the company that separates signal from noise for data-driven organizations, today announced a partnership that includes joint development, solution collaboration with customers and certification against Cloudera’s upcoming release – Cloudera Enterprise 5. Deploying Cloudera Enterprise 5 with the Koverse platform as a core element of an enterprise data hub brings customers analytic capabilities not possible with traditional, purpose built solutions.
An enterprise data hub is one place to store and work with all data, with the flexibility to run a variety of enterprise workloads -- including batch processing, interactive SQL, enterprise search and advanced analytics -- together with the integrations to existing systems, robust security, governance, data protection and management that enterprises require. The enterprise data hub is the emerging and necessary center of enterprise data management, complementing existing infrastructure.
The joint development work focuses on Apache Accumulo, the scalable, high performance distributed key/value store that is part of the Apache Software Foundation. Cloudera announced support for Accumulo in 2013 as part of their ongoing commitment to open source software. Koverse will assist Cloudera with their Accumulo support needs and help Cloudera accelerate contributions to the project by having Cloudera engineers work side-by-side with Accumulo Committers from Koverse.
“Accumulo support came in response to customer requirements,” said Mike Olson, founder, chairman and chief strategy officer at Cloudera. “Partnering with Koverse helps us ensure that we continue to meet the demands of federal and highly regulated industries’ customers. We have been impressed with Koverse’s technology and people, and their commitment to helping customers make better use of big data more quickly. This partnership makes sense and will be a great thing for our customers as the growing demand for unique capabilities available in Accumulo are important to our national security.”
Cloudera and Koverse will certify their products and provide confidence that the two companies’ technologies work together “out of the box.” The joint certification will speed the deployment of the enterprise data hubs and allow customers to streamline the work required to start using their big data to gain meaningful insights.
“We were happy to see Cloudera announce support for Accumulo last year. Both Cloudera and Koverse share a strong commitment to Accumulo and helping our customers take advantage of its capabilities to get more out of their big data,” said Paul Brown, CEO of Koverse. “Already our mutual customers are realizing the benefits of using Cloudera’s distribution including Apache Hadoop (CDH) along with the Koverse platform. Our partnership will ensure that we continue to help existing customers achieve big data success, and are able to repeat that success with new customers.”
The Koverse platform helps customers derive meaningful insight from their big data. It ingests and processes large amounts of data quickly, regardless of type or source. Customers are able to process new raw data and insights in less than one day, a significant improvement over traditional analytic solutions. The Koverse platform is multi-tenant, and leverages Accumulo’s security capabilities such that users with different access rights can work within the same system, eliminating the cost of implementing separate systems based on security context.
