Western Union Leveraging Cloudera Data Analytics Solutions to Enhance the Customer Experience






 









Leading Global Payments Company Utilizing Enterprise Data Hub for Actionable Insights that Create Foundation for Customized Product and Service Offerings
PALO ALTO, Calif. – February 18, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache HadoopTM, today announced The Western Union Company, a leader in global payment services, is working with Cloudera to centralize its global customer data in an enterprise data hub to drive pattern recognition and predictive modeling. Based on Business insights gleaned from this effort, Western Union is continuing to create a more personalized customer experience across multiple products and service delivery channels.
In 2013, more than 70 million consumers used Western Union services worldwide, and the company facilitated 29 transactions per second, on average, across 200 countries and territories. Utilizing Cloudera Enterprise, Western Union can more efficiently store, conduct and process real-time analysis on one of the world’s largest enterprise data sets.
Mike Olson, chairman, founder and chief strategy officer for Cloudera, commented, “It is business-critical for companies to collect, store and analyze their data in order to better serve their customers. Western Union’s Hadoop-powered enterprise data hub deployment is precisely the kind of use case that Cloudera is uniquely equipped to address. Through its use of Cloudera Enterprise, the company is utilizing its data to drive new levels of business and customer insight, extending those benefits across its global organization. Cloudera worked closely with Western Union to ensure that they were well equipped to maximize their data analytics deployment, and achieve business critical insights that support the company’s omni-channel evolution.”
Sanjay Saraf, senior vice president and chief technology officer for Western Union, commented, “Western Union produces transactional data at a considerable rate, which presents a significant opportunity in terms of modeling and analysis. Ultimately, the results of our data analytics effort will help Western Union continue to create a personalized customer experience, tailored to an individual’s unique needs, across many different cultures and walks of life from around the world. We have successfully launched our Hadoop powered enterprise data hub to analyze millions of records, and continue to implement best in class technologies that drive innovation and help us create deeper, more meaningful relationships with our customers.”
