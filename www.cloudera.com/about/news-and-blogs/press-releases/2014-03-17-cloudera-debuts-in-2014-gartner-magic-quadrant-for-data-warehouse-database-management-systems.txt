Cloudera Debuts in 2014 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Warehouse Database Management Systems






 









First and Only Pure-play Hadoop Vendor Denotes Importance of Open Source Hadoop to Complement Existing DBMS Technology
PALO ALTO, Calif. – March 17, 2014 –Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that for the first time it has been positioned in the 2014 Magic Quadrant for Data Warehouse Database Management Systems.
According to Gartner, “Offloading of historical data will demand lower-priced storage tiers, but will insist that historical data can be accessed for in-depth, longer-term analysis. This will be one role of the new technologies and will retard the demand for bigger data warehouses based solely on storage.” This statement is in line with what Cloudera is seeing and hearing from its own customer base - the need and desire to complement their existing data warehouse infrastructure with robust and cost-effective Hadoop-based technology that enables them to solve problems that weren’t addressable with a traditional EDW alone.
“Cloudera continues to transform the enterprise data management market,” said Mike Olson, founder, chairman of the Board and chief strategy officer, Cloudera. “We believe that our position in the 2014 Magic Quadrant for Data Warehouse Database Management Systems validates our ability to innovate and provide our customers with the technology and support that they need. The report highlights Cloudera’s growing role alongside existing data warehouse infrastructure.”
In 2013 Cloudera announced its vision behind an enterprise data hub (EDH,) namely one place to store all data for as long as desired in its original fidelity for as long as is necessary, delivering insights to all kinds of users, as fast as possible. Built with Apache Hadoop at its core, it is a new, more powerful and scalable data platform with the flexibility to run a variety of workloads — batch processing, interactive SQL, enterprise search, advanced analytics — together with robust security, governance, data protection and management that enterprises require.
According to the report, “The Niche providers in 2013 saw new entrants challenge them and, in some cases, moved swiftly past them. However, the overall broadening of vision in the market, with competing approaches, is actually creating openings for new vendors. Niche Players generally deliver a highly specialized product with limited market appeal. Frequently, a Niche Player provides an exceptional data warehouse DBMS product, but is isolated or limited to a specific end-user community, region or industry. Although (sometimes) the solution itself may have no limitations, adoption is limited.”
A New Way of Doing Things: Bringing Compute to Data with an Enterprise Data Hub
An enterprise data hub serves as an integral component of a new hybrid approach to data management, which pragmatically extends and complements the value of existing investments while enabling fundamentally new ways of delivering value from data.
An enterprise data hub can be used:

As an Active Archive - providing one place for all data of all types, cost-effectively retained in full fidelity for any period of time. As a staging area for new enterprise data, you could even call an EDH an automatic archive.


As one place to transform data from its raw format into structured formats for consumption by existing systems, while retaining the original data for future use and reuse. Nothing is lost.


By business users to get direct, agile access to specific data sets to explore and analyze in-place, reducing the BI backlog of business user requests and freeing capacity on existing systems.


To derive real benefit from bringing new analytic workloads to the EDH, reducing the need to invest in and move large volumes of data between platforms just to ask new questions. Native engines - Batch, Streaming, Interactive SQL, Search, Machine Learning, and more - are complemented by third-party products running directly in an enterprise data hub. Better analytical tools generate more value from more data, driving revenue and profit.
