Cloudera Certifies More than 100 Partner Products on Cloudera Enterprise 5






 









Focusing on its Next Generation Platform and Deepening Engineering Relationships to Ensure Customers Have the Broadest Choice for their Enterprise Data Hubs
PALO ALTO, Calif. – April 2, 2014 –Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that through the Cloudera Connect program, more than 100 partner products have certified on Cloudera Enterprise 5, the company’s next generation Hadoop powered platform that serves as an integral component of enterprise data hubs globally. Cloudera partners showed true commitment to the company’s technology innovation by certifying on Cloudera Enterprise 5 before it was GA. Now at the center of the most comprehensive partner ecosystem of applications, tools, frameworks and platforms, Cloudera Enterprise 5 is maximizing the opportunity for companies to gain value from all their data without limits, while working alongside existing technology and business investments.
The Cloudera Connect partner program is a vibrant ecosystem that continually adds new partner products, ensuring that customers always have the broadest choice of solutions that suit their business needs. The first 100+ certifications are part of a vibrant and robust certification program; many more can be expected over time and can be compared to an “App Store” of partner technologies running in conjunction with a Cloudera enterprise data hub. Cloudera plans to continue to drive additional certifications and value to its customers as the year goes on.
“We are impressed by the volume and depth of partners that have chosen to certify their products in advance of Cloudera Enterprise 5 becoming GA,” said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development, Cloudera. “The Cloudera platform was built to allow customers to store any amount and kind of data and to deploy that data against an analytic infrastructure or application when, how and where needed to achieve the most economical value to their business. We are investing deeply in extending our partner ecosystem and certifying partner products on Cloudera Enterprise 5, ensuring our customers have the broadest choice of big data tools and technologies for their existing and future enterprise data hubs.“
The Broadest Partner Ecosystem
These certified products significantly reduce risk and assure customers that taking advantage of the world’s most complete, tested and popular platform powered by Apache Hadoop is available to build a more secure, governed and open enterprise data hub. Certified products include:

Services that run natively in Cloudera Enterprise 5 through Parcel and Custom Service Descriptor integration, providing unified workload, system and data management, and enabling the same benefits of data-local processing such as Cloudera’s own Impala, Search, Apache Spark, Apache HBase or Apache MapReduce services.


Tools and Applications that run on Cloudera Enterprise 5’s engines and services, delivering powerful data integration, business intelligence, advanced analytics, enterprise applications, development frameworks and other capabilities enabling new business insights from enterprise data.


Extensions for Management and Security that enable seamless integration with existing security, management and governance systems, including wide scale IT systems management, active data replication, backup, data encryption, masking and tokenization.


Hardware and Platform Services providing customers with a wide variety of deployment options and performance optimizations, in their own data centers, in private cloud and virtualized environments, in third party hosted cloud environments, and through managed services providers.

Cloudera is changing the economics of data by constructing the best, broadest and most deeply integrated and centralized platform on which enterprises can store, process and analyze data in full fidelity while fully complementing existing storage strategies and analytic infrastructure investments. A Cloudera enterprise data hub delivers a complete data management platform - one place to to store and work with all data, with the flexibility to run a variety of enterprise workloads, including batch processing, interactive SQL querying, enterprise search and advanced analytics, together with robust security, governance, data protection and management that enterprises require. When coupled with a company’s existing enterprise data management systems, and running in conjunction with one or more of the partner products in the Cloudera partner ecosystem, the combination provides an unbeatable value for customers.
Attached is a list of partners who have certified at least one product in advance of Cloudera Enterprise 5 GA.
