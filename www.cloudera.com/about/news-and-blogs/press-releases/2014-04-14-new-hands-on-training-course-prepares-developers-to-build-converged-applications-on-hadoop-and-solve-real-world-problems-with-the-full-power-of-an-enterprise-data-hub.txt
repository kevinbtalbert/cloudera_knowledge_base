Cloudera Connect Partner Program Provides Deeper Level of Engagement to Increase Partner Success






 









Industry's Largest Big Data Partner Ecosystem Provides Customers with the Broadest Choice of Partner Solutions and Products to Maximize the Value of their Enterprise Data
PALO ALTO, Calif. – April 14, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that it has added resources, training, certification and communications to its Cloudera Connect Partner Program. These enhancements allow Cloudera partners access to new enablement programs and offer the opportunity to gain greater access to Cloudera customers, boosting their brand recognition as big data management providers and increasing new revenue streams – all with the support and expertise needed to help customers maximize the value of their enterprise data. By the same token, Cloudera will be able to rapidly identify and refer the most appropriate partners to customers in order for those companies to build world-class big data management systems powered by Cloudera.
"Enterprise data stores hold the answers to market success and competitive advantage,, the most complex business problems and effective decision-making by a global workforce. Unfortunately, most enterprises haven't yet found a way to unlock the full value of their data to find those answers," said Benjamin S. Woo, managing director, Neuralytix. "Organizations that have access to a wide choice of solutions and products will have the ability to create systems that can manage and make the most of big data. The vendors that can put the widest range of choices front and center for their customers are going to gain a tremendous competitive advantage."
The Cloudera Connect Partner Program affords a wide variety of opportunities to partner with Cloudera and deliver integrated Big Data solutions to the market. With the largest and most vibrant partner ecosystem in the market, Cloudera ensures that organizations can deploy an enterprise data hub where and how they need to, build and deploy solutions efficiently, and run a wide variety of applications, tools, frameworks and platforms within their Cloudera deployment. The Cloudera technology certification program allows partners to work directly with Cloudera to integrate, test and certify their products against Cloudera Enterprise, providing customers with confidence that their choice of third-party products and applications will work seamlessly with the most complete and popular platform powered by Apache Hadoop.
Program enhancements will provide partners at all levels - which include software and hardware vendors (ISVs and IHVs), service providers, value added resellers (VARs), training partners and systems integrators (SIs) - with improved access to the full power of Cloudera Enterprise.
Enhancements to the Cloudera Connect Partner Program include:

Partner Enablement: By expanding resources available in the partner portal, partners and Cloudera will improve direct communications and have access to a single location for comprehensive sales content such as training resources, marketing content, use cases, case studies, pre-sale best practices content, battle cards, webinars, partner information, and product roadmap updates.
Communications: A new and consistent partner newsletter will provide regular, critical information, specific details on partner requirements and benefits, and information about new opportunities.
Training: Online access to Cloudera University, certifications and requirements, and more training resources will significantly enhance partners' ability to support Cloudera customers' data management objectives.

"In a world where data continues to grow, becomes more valuable but increasingly unmanageable, our partners are looking for ways to make their products and services big data relevant," said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development, Cloudera. "Many do not, however, have the expertise, resources or brand recognition needed to achieve this goal. Partners that join our 900+ ecosystem are able to take advantage of deep collaboration, certification and association with the world's leading enterprise analytic data management provider. This allows them to rise above the crowd and gain an audience with leading enterprise customers."
