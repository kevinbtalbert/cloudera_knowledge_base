New ‘Powered by Cloudera’ OEM Program to Deliver More Purpose-Built Big Data Solutions to Market






 









Cloudera Architected Solutions Expand Company's Footprint Across Enterprise Markets and Solves Growing Data Management Challenges
PALO ALTO, Calif. – April 14, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today introduced the ‘Powered by Cloudera’ OEM Program, which enables enterprise vendors to integrate, leverage or embed Cloudera Enterprise directly into their applications to solve growing data management challenges. With Cloudera Enterprise architected directly into an application, vendors can improve an application’s performance and its capabilities, thereby generating more value for customers and increasing profitability for their lines of business.
“Working with Cloudera, organizations will be able to benefit from our depth and breadth of experience in data management and big data analytics to extend the value of their applications and make them much more capable and agile to handle today’s workloads,” said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development, Cloudera. “Hadoop has created a shift in the competitive dynamic of the market and demand is growing rapidly for production deployments. An OEM model further cements Cloudera as the enterprise solution of choice for companies that want and need to put an enterprise data hub at the center of their data center.”
Cloudera has been actively working with application vendors over the past year to embed Cloudera Enterprise into customer offerings including Alcatel-Lucent, Amdocs, Biodatomics, Computer Associates, Comverse, NICE Software, and others. By formalizing Cloudera’s OEM program, the company is expanding routes to additional markets for itself and its partners.
Companies that directly benefit from embedding Cloudera Enterprise into their products or services include software, technology and device manufacturers that are experiencing data management challenges when designing and maintaining their existing applications. Over time, enterprise application vendors have built solutions aimed at solving specific business problems. However, with many new streams of data being generated rapidly, and in high volume, performance and access to that data has been dramatically impacted. Cloudera Enterprise enables organizations to become increasingly information-driven to uncover new insights by stripping away limits for storing, managing, accessing and analyzing data in its full fidelity, for as long as desired or required. Together with robust security, governance and data management that enterprises require, Cloudera is transforming the cost to maintain an application into a renewed asset.
As a member of the ‘Powered by Cloudera’ OEM Program, enterprise vendors can dramatically:

Increase the value of their application – Extend the strategic relevance of an applications by collecting and storing more data and more types of data in full fidelity and removing data silos
Provide a single platform to access all your data - Enable any type of access and analysis (batch processing, SQL, streaming, machine learning, etc.) through the support of multi-genre workloads
Reduce cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) – Reduce design and management costs with 10-100 times performance improvement
Eliminate integration and design complexity – Focus on the business, not the design, integration, and maintenance of the platform infrastructure
Lower the risk of application obsolescence - Allow their applications design to last longer with massively scalable architecture with support for multiple types of workloads

Cloudera OEM certified partners gain access to the complete functionality of the Cloudera Enterprise solution and early access to development software. OEM partners also receive training and support from the best experts in the Hadoop and data management industry from Cloudera including its solution architects, partner engineers and product evangelists – throughout the entire product lifecycle.
