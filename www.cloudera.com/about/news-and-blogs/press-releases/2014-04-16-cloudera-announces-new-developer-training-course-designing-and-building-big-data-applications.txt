Cloudera Announces New Developer Training Course: Designing and Building Big Data Applications






 









New Hands-On Training Course Prepares Developers to Build Converged Applications on Hadoop and Solve Real-World Problems With the Full Power of an Enterprise Data Hub
PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Apr 16, 2014) - Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced the industry's first hands-on Big Data training course that teaches developers to build end-to-end applications for a Hadoop-based enterprise data hub (EDH). The new four-day course, called Designing and Building Big Data Applications, prepares data professionals to use an EDH's full capabilities to build custom, converged applications that enable their organizations to achieve greater value from data and solve real-world problems.
Enterprises are increasingly moving beyond the fundamentals of batch processing to analyze all their data and address larger, more business-relevant challenges. An enterprise data hub offers a much broader set of tools enabled by Hadoop -- one place to capture and store all data while keeping the information readily accessible for analytic workloads, connected applications, and existing infrastructure. Creating an enterprise data hub is only the first step; from there, companies can develop custom applications to utilize the full capabilities of the Hadoop stack and drive deeper analytical insights along a consolidated 360-degree view of the organization, customer, and market.
Full-scale Big Data engineering requires developers who can work with multiple tools at once and drive projects that transform their businesses. Cloudera's new course responds to the demand for developers to create end-to-end applications that drive the full analytics lifecycle from data capture to transformation to visualization. Designing and Building Big Data Applications prepares developers to use the entire toolkit of processing engines, ecosystem projects, and customizable functions to build complete solutions with an enterprise data hub.
Through instructor-led discussion and interactive, hands-on exercises, developers will learn to build applications that integrate the full Big Data value chain, including ingesting data, determining the appropriate file format for storage, processing the stored data, and presenting the results to the end-user in an easily digestible form:

Creating a data set with the Kite SDK
Developing custom Flume components for data ingestion
Managing a multi-stage workflow with Oozie
Analyzing data with Crunch
Writing user-defined functions for Hive and Impala
Transforming data with Morphlines
Indexing data with Cloudera Search

"Our goal at Cloudera is to build a proven community of talent -- those who are intimately connected to the Hadoop ecosystem and the enterprise data hub. Data professionals are being asked to not just know how the tools work but to deliver real solutions for their organizations, stakeholders, and customers," said Sarah Sproehnle, vice president, Education Services, Cloudera. "Developers that choose Cloudera for their training stand out among their peers with a true talent advantage. Getting trained not only on the fundamentals of MapReduce, but also on the full scope of tools that enable converged analytics represents a highly valuable strategic component for pushing forward the technical benefits of Hadoop and the business benefits of Big Data. Furthermore, being able to validate those skills with a Cloudera Certified Developer for Apache Hadoop (CCDH) credential is arguably the most valuable step a data professional can take to get noticed by hiring managers today and in the future, particularly as this space matures," said Sproehnle.
Cloudera offers a wide variety of courses to prepare developers to work with all aspects of Big Data. Designing and Building Big Data Applications goes beyond the basics to help developers build custom solutions on the platform. To learn more about this new course offering:

What developers say about Designing and Building Big Data Applications:
"Cloudera's Designing and Building Big Data Applications course came at just the right time. I've been looking for a complete, case-based approach to expanding my skills beyond batch processing with MapReduce. This training will help me develop the kinds of solutions my clients need to integrate their Big Data analytics workloads and deploy a single program to a business end-user. I had previously attended Cloudera's Developer and Administrator Trainings for Apache Hadoop and had certainly benefitted from learning the best practices for managing and processing large data sets. But I needed to understand how the richer set of tools in an enterprise data hub come together to enable a full Hadoop solution with real-time capabilities, user-defined functions, and interactive search. The Big Data Applications course exceeded my expectations, and I have already started working on a new application employing many of the tools I learned in the classroom."
-- Majid Alfifi, co-founder, Tawassum IT
"As a data science practitioner in PwC's Analytics practice, I often encounter major challenges ingesting, managing, and analyzing terabytes of our clients' customer data. Cloudera's Designing and Building Big Data Applications class provided a comprehensive end-to-end tutorial on how to build a full-stack Hadoop-based Big Data application of exactly the kind that is required of my organization on a regular basis. Not only was the content of the class highly relevant to PwC's business and technical needs but the quality of teaching and the candid perspective provided by the instructors was really impressive. Having been to a number of week-long technical trainings on various data management solutions, I can say with confidence that this was by far the most well executed. I feel confident that I can build my own Big Data application with an enterprise data hub using the tools I learned in the classroom, and I look forward to doing so soon."
-- Spencer Allee, strategy consultant, PriceWaterhouseCoopers
