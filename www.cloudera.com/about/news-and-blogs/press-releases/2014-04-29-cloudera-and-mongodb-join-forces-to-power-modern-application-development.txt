Cloudera and MongoDB Join Forces to Power Modern Application Development






 









Strategic Partnership Enables Customers to Easily Develop, Operate and Manage Big Data Infrastructure; MongoDB Connector for Hadoop Certified on Cloudera Enterprise 5; Additional Technology Integrations Underway
PALO ALTO, CA and NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Apr 29, 2014) - Cloudera , the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop ™, and MongoDB, the database for modern applications, today announced a strategic partnership that will transform how organizations approach big data.
Today, 80 percent of enterprise data is unstructured and growing at twice the rate of structured data. Enterprises sometimes try to use legacy data infrastructure like relational databases or data warehouses to manage this data but either fail or spend inordinate amounts of time and money forcing legacy technology to handle modern workloads. Compounding the problem, organizations are often confused by the dizzying array of new data infrastructure technologies and how best to use them.
Working together, Cloudera and MongoDB -- the two biggest technologies in the big data space -- will help enterprises define long-term, successful big data strategies and manage modern data. More than a simple technology integration, the partnership brings the two companies' leadership to bear in enabling enterprises to fundamentally rethink how data can be shared and put to work across the enterprise. The combination of Cloudera Enterprise and MongoDB will enable customers to easily develop, operate and manage big data infrastructure that powers modern applications.
Cloudera's Chairman of the Board and Chief Strategy Officer Mike Olson, will present the companies' shared vision during his keynote at MongoDB World on June 24 in New York City.
"Volume, variety and velocity all strain traditional operational databases, calling for a fundamental reconsideration of how companies store and process data," said Olson. "A Hadoop-powered enterprise data hub is an alternative center for data storage and analytics, and together with MongoDB, we empower companies to keep all of their data in full fidelity and at minimal cost, in order to power the data needs of all connected applications and IT infrastructure."
The emergence of NoSQL databases as the new default operational data store and of the enterprise data hub (EDH) for processing and analytic workloads creates significant opportunity for customers. MongoDB and Cloudera Enterprise were built to handle both complex and simple structured data, giving users the ability to capture, serve and analyze all of their data. The current MongoDB Connector for Hadoop , a plugin for Hadoop that provides the ability to use MongoDB as an input source and/or an output destination for Hadoop data, is certified on Cloudera Enterprise 5 and is available for use by joint customers today. MongoDB and Cloudera are working closely together on the next version of the MongoDB Connector for Hadoop to further simplify data management between MongoDB and Hadoop.
"To stay competitive, organizations need to stop looking backwards to relational databases and look forward to scalable and agile technologies to keep up with modern application demands," said Max Schireson, CEO at MongoDB. "Cloudera and MongoDB have consistently focused on customer success with innovative solutions that make modern data infrastructure easy to develop and operate. This partnership will extend that promise, leading customers on a path to thrive in this new era of modern applications."
