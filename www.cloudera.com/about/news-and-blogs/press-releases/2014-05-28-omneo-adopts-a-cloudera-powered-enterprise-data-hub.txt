Omneo Adopts a Cloudera Powered Enterprise Data Hub






 









PALO ALTO, Calif. – May 28, 2014 – Cloudera's Platform for Big Data™ based on Apache Hadoop™ is now sitting at the core of a new enterprise data hub (EDH) for Omneo, a division of Camstar Systems Inc. Omneo has used Cloudera Enterprise to build a new cloud-based solution that gives product brand owners a 360-degree view of their supply chain in seconds, helping them resolve issues before they impact the customer experience and bottom line. Two of Omneo's global product brand owners report that insights gleaned from the new solution expect to drive annual operational savings of $15 million to $25 million each, thanks to the ability to discover and address any issues the moment they arise.
"Electronics manufacturers are under pressure to uphold strict quality assurance standards throughout their supply chains," says Mike Olson, chief strategy officer and founder, Cloudera. "But with hundreds of components and millions of products flowing among suppliers, distribution channels and consumers, issues can inevitably surface that brand owners must mitigate as quickly as possible before they cause larger problems downstream. While data surrounding supply chain processes exists, it is often disparate and disorganized, impeding agile decision-making. Cloudera Enterprise is enabling Omneo to turn this challenge on its head."
Omneo's clients have indirect access to the EDH via its web portal with a highly configurable user interface. Omneo ingests machine-generated and existing system data into the portal, including data from clients' factories, their suppliers, field services, after-market repairs, and re-manufacturing. All of that data in its raw form is loaded into Cloudera, where Omneo transforms, contextualizes, stores, and analyzes it using tools that support various workloads including:

MapReduce for transforming and manipulating data into any structure needed.
HBase, which provides an easy way to access specific records in real time.
Cloudera Search, which natively integrates Apache Solr with CDH and enables Omneo to rapidly index all of its raw data using simple keyword searches.

"Cloudera has filled all of our requirements for a big data solution," said Karim Lokas, Senior Vice President of Strategy, Product, & Marketing for Omneo. "The platform will scale with us as our customer needs evolve. It's flexible to accommodate all our clients and their myriad data sets, and we found Cloudera to be the most cost-effective solution, with a 75 percent lower cost per terabyte than IBM Netezza and 90 percent lower cost per terabyte than our incumbent relational database management system. With Cloudera's platform, we can now bring together data from every point in the supply chain, creating a single, unified platform that delivers rapid search, analytics, and data mining. Our customers can now see their data in seconds instead of weeks, and we can remain continually in touch with their supply chain and product quality requirements."
About Omneo
Omneo offers a Supply Chain Product Quality Management solution harmonizing big data in the cloud. Omneo enables brand owners to transform terabytes of product quality data scattered around their entire value chain into actionable insights. Offering rapid value realization, Omneo helps its customers establish a highly reliable and contextual supply chain product quality data foundation. This foundation enables brand owners to empower their teams and supply chain partners to quickly and accurately search, analyze, and mine their complete big data in order to continuously improve product quality and reliability.
