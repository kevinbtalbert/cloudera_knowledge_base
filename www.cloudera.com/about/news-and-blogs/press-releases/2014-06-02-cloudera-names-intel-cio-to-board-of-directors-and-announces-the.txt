Cloudera Names Intel CIO to Board of Directors and Announces the Closing of its Financing






 









Kimberly S. Stevenson Joins Existing Data Luminaries to Continue Path of Big Data Innovation
 
PALO ALTO, Calif. – June 2, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that Cloudera has closed its most recent $900 million round of funding. Cloudera also announced the appointment of Kim Stevenson to the Cloudera Board of Directors. As a Corporate Vice President and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Intel Corporation, she is responsible for the corporate-wide use of information technology (IT). Intel's IT organization delivers leading technology solutions and services that enable Intel's business strategies for growth and efficiency. The IT organization is comprised of over 6,000 IT professionals worldwide.
Earlier this year Cloudera and Intel announced a broad strategic technology and business collaboration to converge Hadoop product roadmaps and go-to-market strategies, focusing on leading data center architecture based on Intel® Xeon® processor technology*. The collaboration included an investment of $740 million for continued innovation in open source Apache Hadoop solutions, benefiting customers across all industries and functions delivering increased business value from their data assets.
Funding for Growth
Cloudera closed $900M of financing which includes $530 million of primary capital and $370 million of shares purchased from existing Cloudera investors. In total Cloudera has raised $670 million of primary capital since its inception. These investments validate the significant opportunity for Hadoop and the accelerating mainstream adoption of the technology, along with the leadership position of Cloudera.
Leading Executive Joins Board of Data Luminaries
"We are honored and thrilled to welcome Kim Stevenson to the Cloudera Board," said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer, Cloudera. "Kim’s experience and strategic role as CIO of Intel are particularly valuable as she represents the voice of the customer and has a deep understanding of how data and insight can transform businesses.  We look forward to Kim's addition to the team building a world class organization."
Prior to her role as CIO, Stevenson was vice president and general manager of Intel's Global IT Operations and Services. In this role she led both the strategic and tactical support of Intel's world-wide infrastructure components, including Data Centers, Network and Telecommunications, Enterprise Application Support, Client computing and a 24x7 internal Service Desk.
"Together, Cloudera and Intel have committed to bring innovation to enterprise data management," said Stevenson. "We are enabling the next generation of enterprise data through enterprise data hubs - a single central system to store and analyze all data - with leading technology to both drive IT efficiency and enable the monetization of big data. I look forward to working with the Cloudera board and management team to pursue this substantial growth opportunity."
Stevenson brings a broad range of technology and marketing experience from earlier positions at EDS, HP, and IBM.
Stevenson obtained a bachelor's degree from Northeastern University and a master's degree in business administration from Cornell University where she is an appointed member of the Cornell University Johnson School Advisory Board. She also serves on the board of directors of Riverbed Technology.
