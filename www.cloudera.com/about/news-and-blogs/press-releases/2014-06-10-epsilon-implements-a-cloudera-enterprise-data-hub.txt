Epsilon Implements a Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub to Gain Meaningful Insights for Clients Into Customers’ Brand Engagement






 









Leading Global Marketer Offers a Complete View of an Individual Faster and More Efficiently
PALO ALTO, Calif. – June 10, 2014 –Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered byApache Hadoop™, today announced that Epsilon, the global leader in creating customer connections that build brand and business equity, is powering Agility Harmony with a Cloudera enterprise data hub. Agility Harmony is Epsilon’s next-generation digital messaging platform designed to enable marketers to create meaningful connections with customers by leveraging data stored and processed through Cloudera Enterprise. With the proliferation of channels and changing consumer behavior, it can be challenging and overwhelming for brands to gain a complete view of the individual customer. Through this partnership with Cloudera, Epsilon is able to provide marketers with that complete picture that will fuel relevant one-to-one communications across channels.
Epsilon provides complex modeling and analytic workloads with the data they manage to support programs on behalf of leading global brands across industry verticals such as retail, consumer packaged goods, automotive, financial services, healthcare and more. Epsilon needed a way to process unstructured data at scale and speed, an increasingly difficult task for relational databases. Now with Hadoop, Epsilon is able to use growing amounts of unstructured data to help clients – all optimized in real-time.
“We were drawn to partnering with Cloudera because they share our focus on innovation and they offer scaling capabilities while maintaining reliability,” said Bob Zurek, senior vice president, Products, Epsilon. “Leveraging Cloudera has helped us in a number of ways and we are confident in their commitment and support. Data security, reliability, and attentiveness are critically important to Epsilon and our clients.”
Benefits of an Enterprise Data Hub
In an industry continually looking to manage costs, data storage is one of the first areas that companies consider reducing spend. With the volume of data increasing rapidly, costs associated with storing that data have grown exponentially. Hadoop is inherently more cost effective than legacy systems and approaches. Epsilon’s relationship with Cloudera provides the company with the ability to seek and find insights in the most cost effective manner for clients.
“Epsilon is at the forefront of the digital marketing industry and by working with Cloudera they have been able to propel their business even further and provide insights for their clients that were not possible before,” said Alan Saldich, vice president, Marketing, Cloudera. “An enterprise data hub alongside an enterprise data warehouse opens doors and provides opportunities that may have been too costly or time-consuming before.”
A Cloudera-powered enterprise data hub delivers the most secure, managed, governed, and open data management platform to give customers a choice for storing, accessing and analyzing any amount and any kind of data in one centralized repository. Cloudera has all of the key attributes necessary for customers to make data the true focal point of any business.
Epsilon is using Sentry in its enterprise data hub as well as Impala and Cloudera Manager. Key partners that helped to ensure Epsilon’s success include SAS and Tableau.
