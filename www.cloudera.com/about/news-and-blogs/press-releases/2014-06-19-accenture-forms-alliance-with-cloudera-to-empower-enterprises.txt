Accenture Forms Alliance with Cloudera to Empower Enterprises with a Data as a Platform Offering






 









New alliance aims to provide enhanced data analytics for more informed real-time decision making
NEW YORK and PALO ALTO, Calif.; June 19, 2014 – Accenture (NYSE: ACN) has entered into an alliance agreement with Cloudera, a leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache™ Hadoop®, to give clients access to Cloudera's enterprise data hub. This big data platform will help clients to better utilize their big data and compete in today's increasingly digital world.
Cloudera's enterprise data hub is a central place for clients to store and analyze data, with the flexibility to run a variety of enterprise workloads - including batch processing, interactive SQL, enterprise search and advanced analytics. Through the new agreement, Accenture and Cloudera will accelerate the speed in which enterprises in all industries can intake, access and analyze data to enable real-time decision-making and data-driven outcomes.
To gain a competitive advantage from its enterprise data, an organization must be able to quickly and efficiently operate with all available structured and unstructured data, ranging from text data created five years ago to social media data created five seconds ago. As companies are rapidly transitioning into becoming true digital businesses, they are looking to remodel their technology infrastructures. Many will look to include Hadoop solutions such as Cloudera's enterprise data hub that puts data at the heart of their data platform; this approach helps enterprises to pursue an enhanced speed to insight with manageability, governance and data protection that they require.
"Accenture has a strong focus on big data and open source technologies like the Hadoop ecosystem, which includes data mobilization, data management and data access at a large scale," said Narendra Mulani, senior managing director, Accenture Analytics, part of Accenture Digital.

"This alliance benefits our mutual clients by combining Cloudera's enterprise class software with Accenture's deep industry expertise and global scale."
Accenture and Cloudera are jointly supporting clients across a range of industries, offering them big data expertise, Hadoop training, and data acceleration capabilities for real-time decision-making and a return on analytics investments.
