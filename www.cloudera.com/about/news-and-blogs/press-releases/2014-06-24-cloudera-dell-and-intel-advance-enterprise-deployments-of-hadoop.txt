Cloudera, Dell and Intel Advance Enterprise Deployments of Apache Hadoop with Deeper Engineering Partnership






 









New Dell In-Memory Appliances for Cloudera Enterprise is Performance Optimized for Real-Time Analytics
PALO ALTO, Calif. – June 24, 2014 – Building on their deep engineering partnership, Cloudera, Dell and Intel today announced the intent to launch a dedicated Dell In-Memory Appliance for Cloudera Enterprise. This technical achievement represents a unique collaboration of partners within the big data ecosystem, integrating hardware and software to help enterprises capitalize on high-performance data analysis by incorporating real-time data streams into their applications. This is the first of a family of highly optimized appliances that Dell, Intel and Cloudera will collaborate on which will be known as Dell Engineered Systems for Cloudera Enterprise.
Dell, Cloudera and Intel recognize the complexity of building a modern data center and combined their areas of expertise to design an integrated solution that no one vendor could provide on its own.
“Dell’s unwavering commitment to the customer is what led us to align our technology with Cloudera,” said Sam Greenblatt, CTO and vice president of engineered solutions, Dell. “They have the most mature and the only enterprise-grade Hadoop-based platform in the industry, and their partnership with Intel brings a level of performance and security to the industry that hasn’t been met anywhere else. This reliability is important to companies of all sizes looking to bring high-performance data analysis into their businesses and incorporate real-time data streams into their applications.”
Driven by collaboration with the open source community and efforts across Dell, Intel and Cloudera, the Dell appliance is a best of breed big data solution stack. Designed from the silicon up, this appliance can enable certain applications to run up to 100x faster, is easy to use and deploy, and is compatible with existing solutions.
“Data systems of the ‘80s and ‘90s were never designed for what is known as big data. It’s not that the world was never data-driven before – it’s that we are amassing more data today than systems are able to consume,” said Mike Olson, co-founder and chief strategy officer, Cloudera. “Traditional systems isolate data and create silos that make exploration and collaboration hard. By putting that data into a modern enterprise data hub, customers can combine it and analyze it in powerful new ways. The collaboration among Dell, Intel and Cloudera to build this new engineered system makes it easier than ever before for enterprises to deploy an enterprise data hub that’s fast, scalable and affordable.”
The Dell In-Memory Appliances for Cloudera Enterprise include Cloudera Enterprise with Apache Spark for faster processing of highly complex data streams, ScaleMP’s Versatile SMP (vSMP) architecture to aggregate multiple servers into a single virtual machine for the creation of large memory pools for in-memory processing. The solution is built on the Intel® Xeon® processor-based Dell R920 hardware systems for scalability and performance. The solution easily scales from a single system to an unlimited number of nodes, and is compatible with existing data center infrastructure. “The innovative use of memory as well as CPU in large distributed systems is essential to the performance and scalability required by real-time analytics of streaming data,” said Ron Kasabian, vice president and general manager of Big Data Solutions at Intel, “The Intel® Xeon® processor family powers a new generation of big data solutions such as the Dell Engineered Systems that are specifically optimized for in-memory computing and delivering memory scalability. Intel continues to invest in enhancing machine learning and graph analytics frameworks on the open source Apache* Hadoop data platform, including Apache* Spark, and to optimize them for Intel Xeon processors.”
Cloudera Enterprise – a Cloudera enterprise data hub, with CDH – is 100 percent Apache Hadoop open source at its core. It includes centralized management, enterprise-level security and governance, real-time analytics with Apache Spark and is fully compatible with existing data center environments and tools. Apache Spark, the key component of real-time analytics, is an open source, parallel data processing framework that complements Apache Hadoop to make it easy to develop fast, unified big data applications combining batch, streaming, and interactive analytics on all your data.
The Dell In-Memory Appliances for Cloudera Enterprise will be available in pre-sized, pre-configured options so that enterprise customers can choose and quickly deploy the version that is right for their applications. Value-added consulting services for custom configurations are also available through Dell.
