Call for Nominations Now Open for Cloudera’s Second Annual Data Impact Awards






 









CDH Users Recognized for Innovative Achievements with the World's Most Widely Deployed Distribution of Apache Hadoop and Related Open Source Projects
 
 
PALO ALTO, Calif. - June 25, 2014. Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today opened submissions for the second annual Data Impact Awards. The program was launched last year to recognize the innovative ways that CDH users have implemented the open source software. The awards honor exemplary CDH deployments from organizations that are solving critical business and industry challenges and will celebrate the innovative applications of Hadoop that are driving major advancements across industry verticals.
 
As Hadoop becomes increasingly enterprise-ready, organizations are implementing Cloudera technology at the core of their enterprise data hubs, serving as a centralized place to store, analyze, and manage data.
 
The 2014 Data Impact Awards will recognize CDH achievements in six categories:
●      Business Impact
●      Social Impact
●      Community Contribution(s)
●      Pervasive Integration
●      Advanced Analytics
●      Security and Compliance
 
Nominations Now Open
Nominations are now open to any organization that leverages CDH in a production environment. Cloudera Connect partners and other vendor organizations are also encouraged to nominate their customers. All nominations will be evaluated by a panel of guest judges -- comprised of industry analysts, journalists, and thought leaders -- based on four criteria: creativity, results, maturity, and relevance. There is no cost to enter.
 
How to Enter
●      Complete a short submission.
●      Deadline to submit is September 12, 2014 at 11:59pm PT.
●      Winners will be announced at the Strata + Hadoop World Conference in New York City, at an awards gala on Wednesday, October 15, 2014.
 
“An enterprise data hub is emerging for many of our users and customers as a new center of enterprise data management," said Alan Saldich, vice president, Marketing, Cloudera. “We’ve seen some outstanding use cases over the years and we are continually amazed at what our customers are doing with the technology solve their business and social problems. Last year the Data Impact Awards recognized an impressive list of finalists and winners, so we’re really excited to see what new and innovative solutions our customers and users have come up with.”
