Vivint Standardizes on a Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub for Securing Automation of the Internet of Things






 









100,000+ Data Points from Smart Sensors Embedded in Devices Now Visible with Cloudera

PALO ALTO, Calif. – July 15, 2014  Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that its Platform for Big Data, Cloudera Enterprise, is now sitting squarely at the center of home automation and the Internet of Things (IoT) for Vivint, the largest home automation services provider in North America. For the first time, Vivint is able to apply a new lens to data generated from intelligent devices and systems embedded with sensors in and around homes. Vivint, together with Cloudera, can now offer more value and identify actionable insights to enrich their customers’ lives.
“Vivint has been at the forefront of the connected home for decades, and now with the emergence of IoT, we are truly able to innovate by collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data from sensors embedded in our devices,” said Brandon Bunker, Senior Director, Customer Analytics and Insights, Vivint. “We’ve taken that one step further with Cloudera and can now look across many data streams simultaneously for behaviors, geo-location, and actionable events in order to better understand and enrich our customers’ lives. This platform has differentiated our business and given us a tremendous competitive advantage.”
Vivint has acquired more than 800,000 customers using a variety of third-party smart-enabled devices—roughly 20-30 sensors per home. Many of those devices come in the form of thermostats, smart appliances, video cameras, window and door sensors, and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Without a central internal repository to gather and analyze the data generated from each sensor, Vivint was previously limited in its ability to innovate and to add higher intelligence to its security offerings. For example, knowing when a home is occupied or vacant is important to security—but when tied into the heating, ventilation and cooling (HVAC) system, you can add a layer of energy cost savings by cooling or heating a home based on occupancy. Similarly, by adding geo-location into the equation, you can begin to adjust temperature changes to a home based on the proximity to an owner’s arrival, for instance, when the owner has a connected vehicle.
HVAC systems are the single largest contributor to a home’s energy bill and carbon emissions, accounting for more than 40 percent of residential energy consumption in the U.S. Studies have shown that consumers could see 20 to 30 percent energy savings by turning off HVAC systems when residents are away or sleeping.
Vivint knew it wanted a partner with the broadest big data ecosystem, to ensure support as more and more devices are connected to the Internet each day. Having the assurance that Cloudera was open where it needed to be and that it worked with hundreds of companies was a key consideration in the company’s selection process.
“Hadoop is capable of producing value quickly, and for us the ability to look across data and track inferences brings immediate value to our customers, ” said Bunker. “We knew that we needed to be on a platform that allows us to move quickly and differentiate from the competition, but that was also able to maintain the security of our customers’ data. Cloudera’s ability to layer on top of its open source work to ensure our customers’ data security gave us the confidence to move forward.”
“Data lives at the center of IoT,” said Alan Saldich, Vice President, Marketing, Cloudera. “When we consider all the net new data generated by devices embedded with sensors and geo-location services that hasn’t been touched before, we open ourselves to new possibilities—to realize not just new revenue streams for business but to solve much bigger problems because we can dive into those points of convergence in our world. That’s the reason we are here at Cloudera. To see that vision taking shape at Vivint, and to enrich people’s lives—not just through energy savings and security, but also to build a home life-saving program. That’s powerful.”
A Cloudera-powered enterprise data hub delivers the most secure, managed, governed, and open data management platform to give customers a choice over legacy data management for storing, accessing, and analyzing any amount and any kind of data in one centralized repository. Cloudera has all of the key attributes necessary for customers to make data the true focal point of any business.
