Cloudera Honored in Two Categories by Best in Biz Awards 2014 International






 









Recognized for Executive Team of the Year and Company of the Year for Advances in Big Data Innovation
PALO ALTO, Calif. – July 28, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced it has been named a gold winner for Executive Team of the Year and a bronze winner in the medium-size company category for Company of the Year by Best in Biz Awards 2014 International, an independent business awards program judged by members of the press and industry analysts. 
 
Cloudera has continued to break new ground in enterprise data management by dramatically improving the ability to interact with all data and deliver ‘speed of thought’ insights while furthering the progression of Hadoop in enterprise environments. The company’s efforts to add the industry’s first fine-grained authorization framework for Hadoop, opened Hadoop to a more diverse set of users. Now Cloudera is delivering encryption and key management to build the industry’s most robust end-to-end security offering for Hadoop environments, making Hadoop even more suitable to new industries, organizations and enterprise use cases. 
Cloudera’s experienced executive team steered the company toward a strategic relationship with Intel to invest more deeply in implementing Hadoop, to expand its global presence and increase contributions to the open source community. The partnership accelerated Cloudera’s technology leadership and its ability to dramatically hasten real-world value from Hadoop for its customers. 
“We are honored to receive recognition as a leadership team– the recognition belongs to the collective company which is continually focused on transforming all businesses to derive value from data, especially data that has the power to transform and change the world. Our entire company believes strongly in our mission and it’s due to the collective nature that has allowed us to achieve this level of successful thus far,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer, Cloudera
More than 200 public and private companies representing all sectors of the economy from more than 30 countries competed in Best in Biz Awards’ second annual International program. Winners were determined based on scoring from a panel of 27 judges drawn from top-tier news, business, finance, and technology publications and media outlets from 17 countries, with all continents represented.
