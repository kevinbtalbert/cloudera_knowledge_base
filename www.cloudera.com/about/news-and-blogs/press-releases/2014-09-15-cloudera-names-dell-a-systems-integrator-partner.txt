Cloudera Names Dell a Systems Integrator Partner






 









Dell and Cloudera Deliver End-to-End Solutions for Customers’ Big Data Needs
PLANO, Texas and SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., September 15, 2014 – Dell Services and Cloudera, a leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that Dell Services has been named a Cloudera systems integrator partner for Hadoop implementations. This expands upon the existing relationship that Cloudera has with the Dell Enterprise Solutions Group to provide reference architectures and standard configurations for the Cloudera enterprise suite. By joining the Cloudera systems integrator program, Dell, already a recognized leader in big data, is now able to help customers implement Cloudera enterprise solutions based on their specific workloads, along with end-to-end solutions that can include hardware, software and services.
Organizations across multiple vertical markets are actively using big data to enhance the customer experience, improve processes and reduce costs. Gartner points out that 55 percent of organizations surveyed are implementing big data to enhance customer experience, 49 percent are using it to improve process efficiency, and 42 percent for new products and business models.  However, analyzing big data content is one of the biggest challenges organizations face today, since they must manage increasing amounts of raw data from diverse sources such as sensors, machines, social media, server logs and many more. 
 
As a Cloudera systems integrator partner, Dell Services can deliver a complete Apache Hadoop solution, ranging from architectural design to data integration, analytics development, implementation and support. Dell now offers a variety of industry-focused joint solutions including Cloudera Enterprise-based services, including:
• Enterprise Data Hub for Cloudera Enterprise – Implementation of an enterprise data hub to support downstream applications and analytics
• Online Archiving with Cloudera Enterprise – Provides an archiving solution for enterprise data warehouses (EDWs) using Hadoop to avoid expensive upgrades and improve data warehouse performance
• Capacity Buyback with Cloudera Enterprise - Improves data and report availability by offloading processes that consume significant amounts of EDW platform resources
• Managed Services for Cloudera Enterprise - Application Management, Incident Management, and Big Data / Hadoop support for new and existing Hadoop environments
• Engineering Intelligence & Analytics with Cloudera Enterprise – Integrates sensor/machine data to allow for proactive predictive failure analysis, improve maintenance scheduling, and ensure real-time insights into performance of entire machine ecosystem
“The extension of our strategic alliance with Dell to include expert services will now help Dell build a comprehensive open source Hadoop portfolio to develop more wide-ranging solutions for enterprises,” said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development, Cloudera. “We can now work as an extended team with Dell to help its customers compete in an increasingly digital, data-driven environment.”
 
In joining the Cloudera systems integrator program[PC1] , a team of Dell consultants were put through a rigorous Cloudera training curriculum that included individual certification, followed by the shadowing of the Cloudera professional services team to demonstrate capability and skill.

“Dell is a recognized leader for analytics, both as a practitioner as well as a service provider for our customers across different industries. The rise of unstructured data has provided a unique opportunity to gather more precise customer insights and discover patterns to detect fraud and anomalies in the high velocity world of data amongst others. Our strategic alliance with Cloudera will enable us to help our customers across industries succeed in a digital era and make them better positioned to serve their customers, mitigate risks and increase productivity,” said Raman Sapra, global head of Digital Business Services, Dell.
The work with Cloudera further strengthens Dell’s Digital Business Services portfolio, which helps customers embrace digital through analytics analytics, mobile, social media and cloud technologies to improve customer engagement.
This certification builds on a long-standing relationship between Dell and Cloudera and is in addition to the Dell™ Apache™ Hadoop® Solutions that provide super-fast analysis, data mining and processing capabilities. Dell has tracked 30 billion security events analyzed every day using Dell Hadoop solutions and Dell and Cloudera also recently announced Dell In-Memory Appliances for Cloudera Enterprise aimed at accelerating Hadoop deployments. The Dell - Cloudera Apache Hadoop Solution, accelerated by Intel, was jointly designed by Dell and Cloudera, and embodies all the hardware, software, resources and services needed to run Hadoop in a production environment in order to reduce production time.
At Hadoop World on October 15-17, 2014, Cloudera and Dell will present a panel discussion called, “Important Advances in Hadoop” (Thursday, October 16 at 5:15pm; Room 1D03/D04). Attendees can also stop by the Dell Services booth (booth #102) to learn more.
