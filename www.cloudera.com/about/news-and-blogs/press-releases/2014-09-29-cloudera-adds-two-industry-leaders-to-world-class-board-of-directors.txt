Cloudera Adds Two Industry Leaders to Complete its World-Class Board of Directors






 









Names Martin Cole, Former Group Chief Executive of Technology at Accenture and Steve Sordello, CFO of LinkedIn for Deep Technology Expertise, Financial Discipline and Global Operational Experience
PALO ALTO, Calif., September 29, 2014 –  Cloudera, a leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced it has completed the process of building its Board of Directors with the appointment of Martin I. Cole and Steve Sordello, filling out an already world-class board that is unmatched in terms of its breadth, depth, experience and operational expertise.
Mr. Cole recently retired from Accenture as Group Chief Executive of Technology, where he had responsibility for the full range of Accenture’s technology consulting and outsourcing solutions, as well as the company’s delivery capabilities including its Global Delivery Network. He led technology innovation for Accenture as well as Accenture’s software business. Mr. Cole’s direct experience in the development of emerging technologies in cloud, analytics, social, digital, and mobile will lend synergy and a dynamic perspective to Cloudera as he will focus on extending Cloudera’s vertical applications and leverage its Systems Integration and partner ecosystem to transform nascent markets.
Mr. Sordello, Chief Financial Officer of LinkedIn, will serve as Cloudera’s Audit Committee Chair. Mr. Sordello brings extensive financial discipline and operational expertise to Cloudera’s Board having served in leading public and private sector companies—including directing LinkedIn’s successful IPO. With experience in building long-term, high-performing organizations with complex business operations, Mr. Sordello will be a guiding force in the company’s future growth.
“We are extremely pleased to welcome Marty and Steve to the Cloudera Board,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer, Cloudera. “Both gentlemen are highly accomplished professionals who bring deep expertise to our bench. Marty’s insights regarding emerging technologies and how they shape global industries will be invaluable, as will Steve’s ability to align our operational and fiscal goals against a compelling and strong rate of growth. Both of them will serve our company well and we look forward to their contributions to our organization.”
As the former Group Chief Executive of Technology at Accenture, Mr. Cole led the global technology consulting and outsourcing practice, Accenture’s largest group. While at Accenture, he served in various senior leadership roles including overseeing the Technology Labs, the Accenture software business and development of emerging technologies. He also led the company’s Mobile initiative and was responsible for Accenture’s services to government and other public sector entities in the defense, education, public health, human services, immigration, justice and public safety, revenue and postal sectors. Mr. Cole joined Accenture in 1980 and served in a variety of leadership positions over his 34-year career. A published author, Mr. Cole received his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College and a Master of Public Affairs degree from the University of Texas at Austin.
As the Chief Financial Officer of LinkedIn, Mr. Sordello is responsible for all financial operations of the company, including developing and implementing financial strategies that support LinkedIn’s business objectives. Mr. Sordello joined LinkedIn in 2007 and led the company to one of the industry’s most successful technology IPOs in recent years. Prior to LinkedIn, he held Chief Financial Officer positions with TiVo and Ask Jeeves, and guided both companies to profitability. Mr. Sordello brings direct experience in building high-performing organizations and has raised nearly $3 billion in capital and completed multiple private and public company acquisitions. He is a member of the Board of Trustees of Santa Clara University, where he also received a Bachelor of Arts in business and a Master of Business Administration.
Mr. Cole’s and Mr. Sordello’s experience and noted success complement the existing Cloudera Board, which most recently welcomed Kim Stevenson, Intel CIO. It is unlike any other, with a bench of well-balanced, strong leaders and technology visionaries.
