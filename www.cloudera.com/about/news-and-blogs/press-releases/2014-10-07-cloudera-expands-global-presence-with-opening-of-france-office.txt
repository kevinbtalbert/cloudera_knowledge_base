Cloudera Expands Global Presence with Opening of France Office






 









Romain Picard appointed as Head of Cloudera France and EMEA South with operations operated from the Paris Location to address Growing Customer Demand and Broadens Ecosystem of Partners
PARIS, France, October 7, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced the opening of a new office in Paris, France. The new site will help accelerate Cloudera’s presence in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) South and address existing and growing customer demand for Hadoop. With the establishment of a physical presence and talented employee base in the region, Cloudera will be well equipped to build long-term customer relationships and to expand its ecosystem of partners in France, as well as extend its presence in Greece, Iberia, Israel, Italy, Maghreb, Turkey and Middle East.
As the industry leader in the Hadoop market, Cloudera aims to be the go to source in EMEA South when companies think about Big Data and how to leverage it within the Enterprise. With the market’s largest ecosystem of partners including global companies like Accenture, Capgemini, Cisco, Dell, HP Intel as well as local partners like Excelerate Systems, OCTO Technology, Target Reply, XpandIT and a growing list of others. These partners support Cloudera’s platform across the region for implementing enterprise data hubs, for customers like SFR and Solocal Group, who now have access to the most advanced technology and services possible.
"Data volume growth is not an isolated event. Big Data is a growing global phenomenon with the potential to transform industries that have been untouched for decades," said Romain Picard, EMEA Regional Director at Cloudera. "Old fashioned, non-flexible enterprise architectures can’t support the unprecedented amount of data that is being generated from a multitude of new data streams, nor does it allow for the opportunity to tap into insights derived from these sources. Growing Cloudera’s presence in the EMEA region will help organisations usher in new opportunities with Big Data discoveries. EMEA South is a key market with key international companies that would benefit from a mutual engagement."
"Cloudera is aggressively expanding our global presence across every vertical and geography as enterprises are turning to Apache Hadoop and the Cloudera enterprise data hub to become truly information-driven," said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. "We are seeing tremendous traction across EMEA and we want to be in a position to address the unique needs of our customers in market.   Having a physical presence in France gives us the visibility to act rapidly to changes in the local economy and cultural dynamics to ensure that success."
The new office will be comprised of a variety of functions including Sales, customer support, R&D, and training.
