O’Reilly and Cloudera Announce Expanded Partnership






 









Strata + Hadoop World Goes Global
SEBASTOPOL and PALO ALTO, Calif., October 7, 2014—O'Reilly Media and Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that they have deepened and expanded their Strata + Hadoop World partnership to include multiple events worldwide.
Next week's Strata + Hadoop World New York is sold out, even after the event moved to the Javits Convention Center to accommodate its growing audience. Recent O'Reilly job-market research bears out the explosion in demand for data skills—data science job posts are up 89% year-over-year, with data engineering jobs up 38%.
"When O'Reilly launched the Strata Conference in 2011, data science was just beginning to be widely adopted. By the next year, when we partnered with Cloudera on Strata + Hadoop World New York, data was clearly recognized as an essential business discipline. It's a fast-moving field, so companies look to the conference to stay current on best practices and tools," said Gina Blaber, Vice President of Conferences at O'Reilly Media. "We're delighted to work with Cloudera to expand Strata + Hadoop World. Existing Strata events will now be known as Strata + Hadoop World, with new joint events already scheduled in North America and Europe for 2014 and 2015. We are also exploring additional events in Asia and beyond to serve the international data community."
Doug Cutting, Cloudera's Chief Architect and founder of Apache Hadoop, joins Roger Magoulas and Alistair Croll as chairs of Strata + Hadoop World to help shape the content for upcoming events. "Together, O'Reilly and Cloudera bring a breadth of data knowledge and expertise to Strata + Hadoop World. This partnership means we can share Cloudera's sophisticated data tools with a wider audience. We look forward to working with O'Reilly to maintain Strata + Hadoop World as premier global events for Apache Hadoop - the place to go to hear from the technical and business leaders of this critical open source software and the ecosystem that is growing up fast around it," said Cutting.
Upcoming Strata + Hadoop World events include:

New York, October 15-17, 2014
Barcelona, November 19-21, 2014
San Jose, February 18-20, 2015
London, May 5-7, 2015. This is new to the roster and planned to be the biggest Hadoop event in Europe.

As of Strata + Hadoop World San Jose in February 2015, the events will incorporate a special area within the Expo Hall, the Cloudera Partner Pavilion. Cloudera's partner ecosystem includes over 1,200 organizations, and the Partner Pavilion will showcase some of these companies' solutions built on Cloudera technology.
