Cloudera Impala Wins InfoWorld Bossie Award for Second Year in a Row in the “Best Open Source Big Data Tools” Category






 









InfoWorld Reports That "Cloudera Impala Leads the Pack for Interactive SQL Queries on Hadoop"
PALO ALTO, Calif., October 9, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that Cloudera Impala has been recognized by IDG's InfoWorld 2014 Bossie Awards in the Best Open Source Big Data Tools category for the second year in a row. Impala was selected due to its speed, maturity, and overall robust ecosystem, which includes Apache Sentry for role-based authorization and integrations with the most popular business intelligence tools.
"Open source technologies continue to be the driving force behind software innovation for business advancement. Impala's adoption rate is a strong example of how quickly industries are moving and taking advantage of new tools. Companies need to be agile and provide rapid answers, meaning data query and analysis shouldn't be a bottleneck," said Alan Saldich, vice president, Marketing at Cloudera. "Thanks to Impala's ability to provide sophisticated, real-time queries and insights, companies are no longer left in the dark wondering what secrets their structured or unstructured datasets might reveal."
Impala is the industry's first open source, massively parallel processing (MPP) query engine that runs natively in Apache Hadoop. With over a million downloads and in use by hundreds of Cloudera customers, Impala has quickly become a pillar resource for the Hadoop community. As stated by James Brock, senior contributing editor of the InfoWorld Test Center, Impala outpaces other interactive SQL engines for Hadoop in performance and real-time queries making it the "strongest choice for real-time data analysis with SQL applications built on Hadoop."
Impala 2.0 is expected to ship in Fall 2014 and is one of the most significant updates since its release in 2013.
