Cloudera and EMC Launch Joint Solution for Seamless Integration Between EMC Isilon and Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub






 









New Components and Capabilities Offer Customers Ability to Use, Access and Analyze Data in an Agile Environment
SEATTLE, Washington and PALO ALTO, Calif., October 13, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, together with EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC), today announced joint delivery of a new data management platform designed to unlock silos of enterprise application data for business analytics. Combining the latest Cloudera Enterprise with EMC® Isilon® scale-out storage, the solution enables customers to use, access and analyze data in an agile environment.
"The economics of Hadoop for capturing data from anywhere, in any format, for future analysis dramatically changed the conversation around data storage," said Sam Grocott, Senior Vice President of Marketing, Emerging Technologies Division, EMC. "Scale-out storage is a critical strategy for managing Big Data, and this integration with Cloudera ups the ante further by harnessing the analytic and processing power of Hadoop."
As Hadoop deployments shift from proof-of-concept experiments to enterprise-grade, mission-critical production implementations, workloads increasingly leverage the analytic power and flexibility of Open Source ecosystem components such as Apache HBase, Apache Hive, Apache Pig, Impala, Apache Solr and Apache Spark to deliver valuable new business insights.
"This joint collaboration with EMC opens up tremendous new analytic capabilities for Isilon customers to analyze their data easily and effectively," said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development of Cloudera. "The wealth of new components and capabilities now available to them will further hasten the use of Hadoop in enterprise environments. We have been working closely to help customers preserve the value of their investments, and we are very pleased to have EMC advancing this effort with us."
For Isilon customers, setting up an alternative HDFS-based Hadoop cluster using Direct Attached Storage (DAS) requires copying data from the existing NAS-based data store into a separate Hadoop distribution—which is cost prohibitive and time consuming. Now, with the joint solution from EMC and Cloudera, EMC Isilon scale-out NAS customers will be able to run Cloudera Enterprise on their data without the time-consuming process of offloading it to a separate DAS device.
Organizations must be able to quickly and efficiently convert all structured and unstructured data, ranging from years-old text data to seconds-old social media data, into targeted operational solutions. Cloudera's enterprise data hub delivers this today, with the security, governance, and management capability that enterprises expect from their data management solutions. It is a central place for clients to store and analyze data, with the flexibility to run a variety of enterprise workloads, including batch processing, interactive SQL, enterprise search and advanced analytics.
The combined Cloudera and EMC release is jointly certified and supported. For more information about the companies’ collaboration and strategy behind this effort, visit our partner webpage and the solution overview.
