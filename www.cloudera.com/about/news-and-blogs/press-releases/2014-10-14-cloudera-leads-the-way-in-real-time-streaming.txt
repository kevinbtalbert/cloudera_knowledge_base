Cloudera Leads the Way in Real-Time Streaming with End-to-End Architecture Innovation and Trusted Partner Certification






 









Leadership in Powerful Streaming Technologies, Continued Community Innovation, and New Partner Accelerator Program Help Customers Harness Real-Time Data
PALO ALTO, Calif., October 14, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that, as the leading provider of an integrated, comprehensive real-time streaming solution, they will continue to drive innovation with the introduction of the Cloudera Accelerator Program and Cloudera Labs.
With Hadoop deployments shifting from proof-of-concept experiments to enterprise-grade, mission-critical production implementations, they take on new workloads that require the power and flexibility of proven frameworks and tools. Cloudera’s enterprise data hub is built with these carefully curated components, integrated into one enterprise-grade platform. Apache Spark is one of the most popular components, due to its ease of use and extensibility across multiple use cases. With the ability to handle batch processing, iterative algorithms, and real-time stream processing all within the same processing environment, this general-purpose framework opens up the potential of Hadoop through improved accessibility and processing speed. Spark has been broadly embraced by the open source community, Big Data vendors, and data-intensive enterprises and Cloudera has been working in partnership with Databricks, IBM, Intel, and MapR to further extend support for Spark as the standard data processing engine for the Hadoop ecosystem.
For real-time stream processing, a rapidly growing use case for enterprises, speed, resiliency, and integration are key. Spark delivers on all those and is a core part of a streaming architecture, working together with ingestion tools like Apache Flume and real-time data serving frameworks like Impala. Cloudera was the first to integrate and support Spark in their platform and has dedicated the resources to enhance Spark, especially around enterprise-grade capabilities.
To further advance real-time and streaming architectures, Cloudera has launched the Cloudera Accelerator Program. The Accelerator Program drives innovation across the Hadoop ecosystem and ensures customers always have access to the leading, integrated technologies. Cloudera will work with partners to certify innovative applications being built on proven frameworks, such as Spark and Impala, and will provide the resources and support needed to bring these differentiated solutions to market more quickly so customers can solve new and challenging use cases. The Cloudera Accelerator Program has already accepted many key partners looking to validate and support their exciting applications. 
“Cloudera saw the value in Spark early, and we were the first to adopt Spark as part of our Hadoop platform—making it an integrated and supported component,” said Doug Cutting, chief architect, Cloudera. “We are continuously driving the roadmap for Spark and adding enterprise capabilities. As a result, our customers now have more diverse streaming use cases in production than all our competitors combined. With the Cloudera Accelerator Program, our customers will continue to have access to cutting-edge Spark applications to further expand the reach of their enterprise data hubs.”
Cloudera recognized the business importance of real-time processing early; they were the first to commercially offer Apache HBase, created both Apache Flume and Impala, and were the first to offer and support Spark. Cloudera is dedicated to ensuring a first-class experience with real-time processing, especially as new tools and applications are developed.
Kafka via Cloudera Labs
To further drive innovation around Hadoop, Cloudera is also announcing the launch of Cloudera Labs. Cloudera Labs is a virtual center for fostering innovations in incubation within Cloudera’s engineering teams and fast-tracking promising open source initiatives on the leading edge of adoption. Cloudera Labs aims to bring more use cases, productivity, and value to developers by seeking and exploring new solutions to their problems.
One of the most promising projects under way across the Hadoop ecosystem is Apache Kafka, a highly scalable, fault-tolerant publish-subscribe messaging system. Kafka, founded and in production at LinkedIn, can broker terabytes of data from thousands of users across a single cluster serving as the backbone for any large organization. Kafka is already well-integrated with systems like Spark and other components of an enterprise data hub. As a Labs initiative, Cloudera will explore Kafka further in support of applications that would immediately benefit from such elasticity, scale, and performance using a distributed messaging system. For those interesting in experimenting with Kafka, a downloadable binary is now available.
