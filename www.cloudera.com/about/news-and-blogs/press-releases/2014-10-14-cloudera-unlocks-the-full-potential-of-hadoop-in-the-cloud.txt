Cloudera Unlocks the Full Potential of Hadoop in the Cloud






 









Cloudera Director Delivers the First Portable Cloud Experience for Hadoop
PALO ALTO, Calif., October 14, 2014 –  Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today unveiled Cloudera Director, a new product that extends Cloudera’s enterprise data hub architecture to the cloud, without compromising on security, management, and governance. With Cloudera Director, customers now have a reliable, self-service experience for deploying and managing Cloudera’s open, neutral Hadoop platform in the cloud for a variety of use cases.
Increasingly, customers are taking advantage of the agility and cost efficiencies that cloud-based infrastructures can provide. Whether its a desire for increased IT agility, faster time to value from critical workloads, or temporary ad-hoc processing - such as development testing, pilot and proof-of-concept (POC) projects, or time-based processing - many organizations now opt to move select data and workloads to cloud environments.
“With Hadoop, the reach of the technology is expanding rapidly and we are seeing many more customers select cloud environments as their infrastructure of choice for critical big data workloads,” said Charles Zedlewski, vice president, Products, Cloudera. “Cloudera is setting the standard for Hadoop in the cloud by delivering a first-class experience - complete with our feature-rich platform and enterprise-grade capabilities - and leveraging our partner ecosystem for an optimized and portable cloud solution.”
As customers consider deploying Hadoop workloads in the cloud, they are often forced to compromise on key requirements - such as the security, management, governance, and open standards - that have become critical for on-premises environments. However, with an enterprise data hub built with Cloudera Enterprise and deployed through Cloudera Director, customers can unlock the full potential of Hadoop in the cloud. Cloudera delivers the powerful combination of a cloud-centric administrative framework together with its leading open and portable enterprise Hadoop platform. Cloudera Director opens up Hadoop deployments in the cloud through a simple, self-service interface, and, in its first release, is fully supported on Amazon Web Services.
“Several of our existing key customers are standardizing on Amazon Web Services as their cloud infrastructure of choice,” said Charles Zedlewski. “With Cloudera Director, we are delivering a carefully curated, unified platform for Hadoop that’s secure, compliance-ready, and open to provide choice and flexibility with cloud deployments.”
Cloudera delivers the leading Big Data platform with the combination of continued innovation around industry-leading technologies - including theImpala 2.0 analytic database announced today at Strata+Hadoop World; the most complete end-to-end real-time stream processing solution; and compliance-ready security and governance - world-class support and training, and the most robust partner ecosystem, to ensure customer’s can take advantage of pervasive analytics across the enterprise. Cloudera Director enables organizations to continue to leverage this same leadership in cloud environments, just as thousands of organizations do today on-premises. Additionally, Cloudera's extensive relationships with leading cloud providers ensures an open, neutral platform for seamless, optimized deployments with maximum flexibility and faster time-to-value.
Key Benefits of Cloudera Director:

 
Self-service provisioning through a simple interface for end-users to quickly deploy, elastically scale, and terminate clusters reliably in cloud environments
 
Flexible, open platform with foundational support for hybrid deployments across multiple cloud environments to eliminate lock-in
 
Reduced IT support costs through comprehensive health dashboards and instance tracking for account billing
