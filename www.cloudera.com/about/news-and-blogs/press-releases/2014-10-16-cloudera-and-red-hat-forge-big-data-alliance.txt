Cloudera and Red Hat Forge Big Data Alliance






 









Companies collaborate on deep product integration and joint go-to-market programs to help customers realize the full potential of enterprise-ready Hadoop workloads
PALO ALTO, Calif., and RALEIGH, N.C. – October 16, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache™ Hadoop®, and Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE:RHT), the world’s leading provider of open source solutions, today announced an alliance to deliver joint enterprise software solutions including data integration and application development tools, and data platforms. By integrating a broad range of products and technologies, Cloudera and Red Hat will help customers harness the fast changing big data lifecycle with open, secure and agile solutions.
As part of the alliance, the two companies plan to deliver joint solutions to enterprise customers with cooperative documentation, marketing and support. In today’s enterprise, the new data lifecycle is driven by vast amounts of unstructured and structured data, iterative analytic models and rapidly evolving technology landscape. Together, Cloudera and Red Hat will help enterprise customers deploy big data solutions that best suit their needs – on premises or in a hybrid or private cloud.
The combined Cloudera and Red Hat solutions offer an open and agile technology stack for enterprises to modernize their traditional data management architecture and deploy Hadoop as the core of their big data infrastructure. The companies plan to work together on the following initiatives:

Cloud-ready data platforms to accelerate the transition to the open hybrid cloud with Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform and Sahara integrated with Cloudera Director and Cloudera Enterprise, all managed by Red Hat CloudForms.

Enterprise-ready data platforms that are secure, scalable and easy to manage with the integration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, OpenJDK support and Red Hat Storage Server with Cloudera Enterprise, Cloudera Manager and Cloudera Navigator.

Agile data integration and application development tools with Red Hat JBoss Middleware and OpenShift by Red Hat integrated with Cloudera Enterprise that leverages the Cloudera Kite libraries, Cloudera Impala and Apache Hive connectors.


Supporting Quotes
Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development, Cloudera

“Through rapid mainstream adoption, Hadoop has become the core of an enterprise data hub that requires a flexible deployment model, robust security, governance and agile development tools to be successful. Our alliance with Red Hat allows for Hadoop workloads to be deployed and managed with the same confidence as other mission-critical workloads to deliver the next wave of big data-based innovation for the enterprise.”
Scott Musson, vice president, Global Strategic Alliances, Red Hat
“Red Hat believes the data lifecycle in the enterprise is changing rapidly and requires an open, agile approach to innovation in the data center. Hadoop and OpenStack are key components to this disruption. Red Hat customers are looking for choices in open software solutions for big data and hybrid cloud to help them easily and quickly transform their infrastructure and applications. With today’s announcement, Red Hat and Cloudera intend to give customers an open and modular technology stack to quickly derive new insights from their data, optimize their existing investment in platform infrastructure and lower the overall cost of managing data platforms.”
