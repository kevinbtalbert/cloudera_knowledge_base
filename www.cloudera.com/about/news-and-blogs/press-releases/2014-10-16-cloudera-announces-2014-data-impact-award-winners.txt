Cloudera Announces 2014 Data Impact Award Winners






 









Recognizes Achievements with CDH Across Seven Categories Including Advanced
Analytics, Security and Compliance, and Social Impact
PALO ALTO, Calif. – October 16, 2014— Strata + Hadoop World 2014:Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced the winners of the 2014 Data Impact Awards. The awards honor creative, mature, and results-oriented use cases for CDH, the world’s most popular open source Hadoop-based distribution and a key component of the Cloudera Enterprise platform. The winners of all seven categories were announced at an awards dinner and ceremony on Wednesday, 15th October in New York City, in tandem with the Strata + Hadoop World conference.
“The 2014 Data Impact Awards saw twice the volume of nominations over last year’s program, representing increased maturity and sophistication of Hadoop-powered projects across all industries and geographies,” said Alan Saldich, vice president, Marketing, Cloudera. “This year’s winners are driving their industries to put Big Data to work in a way that delivers tangible benefits to both business and society. They’re transforming the way decisions are made, and we’re delighted to showcase their achievements.” 
The winners of the 2014 Data Impact Awards are:
Business Impact – Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)

FINRA, an independent regulator dedicated to investor protection and market integrity, deployed Hadoop as part of its technology platform redevelopment initiative. The Cloudera environment supports the validation, integration, and analytics of data feeds from securities firms and various exchanges, and executes surveillance patterns analytics that identify instances of non-compliance or market manipulation.

FINRA’s program to implement market regulation applications using Big Data technologies is expected to provide a net cost benefit of $10 to $20 million annually. 

Social Impact – Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta

The leading pediatric health care facility implemented Hadoop in support of two key use cases that would benefit from more historical, granular, and multi-structured data storage and analytics: a bedside alarm study, capturing the steady stream of machine data from bedside monitors beyond a three-day window, and an asthma research and discovery project, combining 20 years’ air quality data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with the hospital’s asthma research.

Both studies resulted in improved patient outcomes. The bedside alarm study drove a retraining of hospital staff to equip them to better assess and understand neonatal pain, agitation, and sedation scale (N-PASS) scores, putting information in the hands of clinicians so they can improve pain management in premature babies. The asthma R&D project resulted in reduced patient visits to the emergency room.

Community Contribution(s) – Cloudwick

Cloudwick’s client engagement with a large computer storage and data management company drove the proliferation of best practices on how to migrate a petabyte-scale CDH cluster across data centers.

These best practices have been shared broadly with Hadoop users across the globe, including at the Cloudwick-initiated Hyderabad Hadoop User Group (the tenth largest Hadoop User Group in the world, boasting more than 2,900 members). 

Pervasive Integration -- Large American retailer

A large American retailer has deployed an enterprise data hub on Cloudera, serving as its core data processing component within the enterprise data warehouse. The Hadoop environment is directly connected to a variety of systems spanning the IT infrastructure, including historical, transactional, operational, and analytical systems, and data stores for unstructured and metadata.

The enterprise data hub is driving pervasive analytics throughout the organization, offering a single source of data to users through a variety of tools including Apache Hive, Apache Mahout, Apache Spark, Impala, Cloudera Search, and Hue.

Advanced Analytics -- A TIBCO Spotfire advanced analytics solution purpose-built for a client

TIBCO built extensions of its Spotfire product for one client to support production line event analysis, improving product quality and supply chain efficiency. The client’s global manufacturing sites are peppered with sensors collecting programmable logical controller (PLC) data in sub second intervals. This data is fed into Hadoop, and with data visualization and modeling tools co-developed with TIBCO Spotfire, analysts are building mathematical models that predict when a manufacturing line stoppage might occur. 

In evaluating the predictive accuracy of the models used in this environment, the client saw the potential to reduce defects by 50% through improved control settings and changes made to the engineering process, and its analysts can focus on problem solving rather than coding and software “gymnastics”. Providing this structured analysis method will ultimately enable data-driven change of the manufacturing process yielding millions of dollars in cost savings benefit.

Security and Compliance -- MasterCard

MasterCard needed to be sure the company’s Hadoop environment complied with stringent security requirements. All applications, databases or file systems that have the potential to handle personal account-related data must undergo full PCI certification.

Earlier this summer, an external auditor certified that MasterCard’s Cloudera environment fully conforms to the PCI DSS V 2.0 security standard. Achieving this milestone provides MasterCard the opportunity to host PCI datasets on this platform and potentially integrate with other internal systems.  

Government, Nonprofit, and NGO - Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)

FINRA’s Big Data environment supports the organization’s mission of investor protection and market integrity by: allowing resources to focus on strategic projects instead of IT tasks; creating a more interactive, high performance analytics experience to improve analysts’ results; saving costs and improving FINRA’s ability to accomplish core objectives; leveraging rapid innovation cycles afforded by the open source nature of Apache Hadoop; removing data storage capacity limitations; and maintaining a more accurate picture of the market through elastic provisioning of analytics resources that support execution of a larger number of surveillance patterns.

The Data Impact Award winners were decided upon by thought leaders from across the enterprise data management industry. The 2014 judges include:

Merv Adrian, Research Vice President, Gartner
Tony Baer, Principal Analyst, Software - Enterprise Solutions, Ovum
Drew Conway, Head of Data, Project Florida
Pat Fiorenza, Senior Research Analyst, GovLoop
Bob Gourley, Editor, CTOvision.com and Founder and CTO, Crucial Point LLC
Steffin Harris, Principal, North American Big Data Lead, Capgemini
Ben Lorica, Chief Data Scientist, O’Reilly
Hilary Mason, Founder, Fast Forward Labs
Joe McKendrick, independent analyst
Raghu Nambiar, Senior Director, Product Management, UCS Server Division, Cisco
Jake Porway, Founder and Executive Director, DataKind
Kim Stevenson, Chief Information Officer, Intel
Dan Vesset, Program Vice President, Business Analytics and Big Data, IDC
