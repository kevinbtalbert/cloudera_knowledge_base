Informatica and Cloudera Partner to Support Datakind and "Data-For-Good" Movement






 









Leaders in Big Data Management to Jointly Fund DataKind Projects  
 
New York – Hadoop World - Oct. 16, 2014 – Informatica Corporation (Nasdaq:INFA), the world’s number one independent provider of data integration software, and Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop, today announced they are partnering to support DataKind in growing the “Data-for-Good” Movement. As DataKind sponsors, Informatica and Cloudera will jointly fund DataKind programs and projects aimed at improving the use of data in the social sector. 
 
DataKind is a nonprofit that tackles the world’s toughest challenges through data science by bringing together pro bono data scientists with leading mission-driven organizations including NGOs, multilateral organizations and government agencies. Mission-driven organizations are surrounded by data available from cell phones, satellite imagery, and digital transactions, but lack access to the professional resources they need to fully harness the data revolution. DataKind has successfully completed more than 45 pro bono data science projects since its inception in 2011, some of which were discussed by DataKind co-founder Drew Conway in his keynote address on Data for the Greater Good at Informatica World 2014.
 
“We are thrilled to welcome Cloudera and Informatica, two pioneers in the movement to harness the power of data, as supporters of DataKind’s activities for social good,” said Jake Porway, DataKind founder and executive director. “Data scientists are experts at using data to find answers to intriguing questions and many welcome the opportunity to use those skills to make the world a better place. DataKind helps them do that by connecting them to data projects for organizations working on some of the most challenging problems of our time - including poverty eradication, education reform and vaccine delivery. With Cloudera and Informatica’s support, DataKind will be able to engage even more volunteers and organizations on these high-impact engagements.”         
 
Sponsorship funds from Informatica and Cloudera will support DataKind’s pro bono data science projects for organizations like past partners Amnesty International or the World Bank. In one recent project, DataKind worked with MIX Markets to combine data about microfinance results from dozens of institutions, creating a richer view of the microfinance landscape than had ever been seen.  In another, DataKind conducted a data-mining project for the Grameen Foundation that resulted in improvements to their data collection procedures and alterations to their program strategy. DataKind has also done projects that used machine learning on satellite data to map rural poverty and natural language processing on text messages to improve counseling for at-risk teens.
 
“At Cloudera, we're really excited to be working with DataKind and Informatica. We've seen first-hand how data, and data science skills, can transform the commercial sector,” said Mike Olson, Cloudera Chief Strategy Officer and DataKind Board member. “DataKind's mission to bring that combination to the social sector, and to work with great NGOs and non-profits, aims to deliver better outcomes to those organizations. The work that DataKind is doing actually makes the world a better place. It's wonderful for us to put our resources, our skills and our people to work for the greater good.”
 
“As DataKind gains traction for its projects around the world, Informatica envisions helping it expand not only through our sponsorship, but also through the volunteer efforts of our own data professionals,” said Jo Stoner, chief human resources officer and executive vice president, Informatica. “Informatica has a culture of giving back to our communities and our employees are encouraged to engage in social programs. DataKind provides a terrific channel through which they can help NGOs and other social sector organizations realize the full potential of data for the good of all.”
