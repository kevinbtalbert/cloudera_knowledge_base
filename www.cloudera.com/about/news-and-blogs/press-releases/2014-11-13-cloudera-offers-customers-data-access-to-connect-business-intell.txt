New Cloudera Connector enables customers to connect data with Business Intelligence and Analytics from SAP






 









New Connector Allows Customers to Access a Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub From SAP HANA® Platform and SAP® BusinessObjects™ Business Intelligence Solutions
 
PALO ALTO, Calif., November 13, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that through its partnership with SAP, it is now offering enterprises compelling solutions to the challenges of Big Data, enterprise data management and analytics. Cloudera is now providing connectors from its enterprise data hub (EDH) that integrate with the SAP HANA® platform and SAP® BusinessObjects™ business intelligence (BI) solutions to help further facilitate access to, and unification of, multiple data sources.
 
"Customers recognize the challenges and opportunities associated with capturing and generating value from the unprecedented volume of structured and unstructured data that’s flowing into the enterprise,” said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development at Cloudera. “An enterprise data hub provides organizations the ability to integrate Hadoop into their existing BI and analytics environments to enable them to innovate and derive critical business insights without compromise. Through our connectors for SAP HANA and SAP BusinessObjects BI solutions, we will help enable customers to leverage data in ways they never thought to before.”
 
Today Cloudera customers can connect SAP HANA and SAP BusinessObjects BI solutions with their enterprise data hub to help achieve the following:
 
●      Data Exploration: Analysts using SAP BusinessObjects BI solutions can model and explore data in Hadoop using a connector to the enterprise data hub. This allows them to explore the data to identify data of value that can be moved to SAP HANA for real-time analysis and direct user manipulation.
●      Advanced and Streaming Analytics: Using SAP HANA with Cloudera’s enterprise data hub offering delivers powerful capabilities for advanced analytics. Users can tap into the infinite store of Hadoop and the instant insights of SAP HANA. Customers can enrich their enterprise data with contextual data in Hadoop while leveraging the textual, spatial, graph, predictive and business rules engines and capabilities of SAP HANA. Data in Hadoop can be accessed in place using the smart-data access capability of SAP HANA or cleansed and moved into SAP HANA via ETL. Furthermore, SAP IQ software provides Hadoop connectors and real-time signals from streaming events that can be incorporated using the SAP Event Stream Processor, providing a comprehensive, Big-Data solution set.
 
“Enterprise analytics is no longer defined by the boundaries of the enterprise data warehouse. Cloudera’s integration with SAP HANA and SAP BusinessObjects BI solutions provides customers the flexibility to target and process queries at the data where it resides,” said Tony Baer, Principal Analyst, Software - Enterprise Solutions, Ovum.
