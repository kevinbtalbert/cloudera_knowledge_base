Cloudera Ranked 36th out of 500 Fastest Growing Companies in North America in Deloitte’s 2014 Technology Fast 500™






 









PALO ALTO, Calif., – November 13, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced it was named to Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500™, a ranking of the 500 fastest growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and clean technology companies in North America. Cloudera was ranked 36th on the list with over 4,439% growth over the past five years.
 
“Having an enterprise data hub has become a pivotal component for companies to capture, store, process and analyze data, and to integrate with critical systems – databases, data warehouses, applications and tools. Cloudera is the company leading that charge and it’s evident in our growth across our customer base, increased partnerships and overall demand for extending Hadoop into the enterprise,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. “As Big Data continues to grow exponentially in amount and value, Cloudera’s potential and impact grows simultaneously.” 
 
“The companies ranked on the 2014 Deloitte Technology Fast 500 continue to set the bar for their industry higher each year,” said Eric Openshaw, vice chairman, Deloitte LLP and U.S. technology, media and telecommunications leader. “There are so many exciting products and smart thought leaders driving this list. We congratulate the Fast 500 companies and look forward to seeing them continue their momentum into 2015.”
 
Since its inception, Cloudera has been committed to the Hadoop community and contributing powerful advances to the ecosystem of solutions. Cloudera recently announced Cloudera Labs, a virtual center for fostering innovations in incubation within Cloudera’s engineering R&D, and fast-tracking promising open source initiatives on the leading edge of adoption. Cloudera Labs is aimed at providing developers an outlet to explore new solutions and address problems by experimenting with and developing new technologies that will enrich the Hadoop community and advance it further as the enterprise solution for Big Data.
 
The company also recently announced product innovation with Cloudera Enterprise 5.2, Impala 2.0, Cloudera Director and partnerships with leading vendors, including EMC Isilon, Microsoft, NEC, Red Hat and Teradata.
 
“For 20 years, the Deloitte Fast 500 rankings have honored the innovation that is part of these companies’ DNA,” added Jim Atwell, national managing partner of the emerging growth company practice, Deloitte & Touche LLP. “We’re glad to be serving these high-growth companies, and helping the technology sector recognize the great strides and transformation these companies are making in their respective areas.”
 
Overall, 2014 Technology Fast 500™ companies achieved revenue growth ranging from 135 percent to 123,678 percent from 2009 to 2013, with an average growth of 1,640 percent. Cloudera is just scraping the surface of what the company wants to become and achieve.
 
 
About Deloitte’s 2014 Technology Fast 500™
Technology Fast 500, conducted by Deloitte LLP, provides a ranking of the fastest growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and clean technology companies – both public and private – in North America. Technology Fast 500 award winners are selected based on percentage fiscal year revenue growth from 2009 to 2013.
 
In order to be eligible for Technology Fast 500 recognition, companies must own proprietary intellectual property or technology that is sold to customers in products that contribute to a majority of the company's operating revenues. Companies must have base-year operating revenues of at least $50,000 USD or CD, and current-year operating revenues of at least $5 million USD or CD.
