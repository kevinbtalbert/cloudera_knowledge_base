Tubular Labs Selects Cloudera to Deliver Real-Time YouTube Insights






 









Executes Queries in Under Two Seconds with Implementation of Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub
PALO ALTO, Calif, – November 17, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced Tubular Labs, a video intelligence and marketing analytics company, has selected Cloudera to accelerate its delivery of real-time insights for tracking and synthesizing billions of YouTube video views. Tubular Labs looks across views and related events including social interactions via tweets, comments, and likes to reveal information relative to online engagement. With its Cloudera-powered enterprise data hub (EDH), Tubular Labs is able to deliver a real-time platform with an interactive user interface (UI) that can ensure the best customer experience in a matter of seconds.
 
A YouTube-certified company and partner, Tubular Labs uses APIs to receive billions of social actions from YouTube, as well as from Twitter, web crawls, and dozens of other publicly available data sources. The real-time insights delivered by Tubular Labs’ platform, through Cloudera Impala, reveal who is watching the videos, when they are watching, and how they are sharing them – enabling more than 3,000 content creators and brand marketers to grow and engage relevant audiences.
 
Tubular Labs searched for a non-traditional database system that could provide the performance at scale it needed to ingest data from multiple sources, while accumulating hundreds of millions of data points each day. Cloudera’s enterprise data hub was chosen for its ability to support the required analytic flexibility, performance, and scale that was necessary for Tubular Labs to enable complex queries over large volumes of data. Cloudera Impala was one of the only choices that met each of these requirements, while delivering query results in under two seconds.
 
“What’s trending changes every day. To provide our customers with the most up-to-date information on what is shaping the conversation, we need to offer intelligent insights rapidly,” said Rob Gabel, CEO of Tubular Labs. “Tubular provides its customers with information that allows them to be relevant to their YouTube followers and maintain a competitive edge. The implementation of Cloudera’s enterprise data hub has given us the ability to provide faster and more resourceful information, with the responsive interface our customers have been looking for. From Cloudera Impala to Cloudera Support and Manager, we have been very pleased with the results.”
 
“It is crucial for today’s businesses to offer their customers instant and effective results, in order to stay on top in a competitive market,” said Mike Olson, chief strategy officer for Cloudera. “Through its use of Cloudera Enterprise, Tubular Labs delivers a valuable experience to clients via interactive analysis and real-time insights on Big Data. Cloudera is dedicated to working with Tubular Labs to ensure their data is consistently providing the fastest and most significant results for its customers.”
