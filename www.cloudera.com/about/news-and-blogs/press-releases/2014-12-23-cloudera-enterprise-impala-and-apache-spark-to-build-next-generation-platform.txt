Cloudera Enterprise, Impala and Apache Spark to Build Next Generation Big Data Platform for Avvo






 









Avvo’s Enterprise Data Hub Manages Inquiries from 7 Million Visitors on the Web’s Largest Legal Marketplace

PALO ALTO, Calif., – December 23, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that Avvo the web’s largest legal marketplace for consumers and attorneys, has implemented a Cloudera enterprise data hub to power its online big data platform for sourcing legal advice. Using the fully integrated capabilities of Impala and Apache Spark, Avvo is able to immediately respond to legal queries from more than 7 million monthly visitors with lawyer-provided advice generated by its database of more than six million questions and answers.
 
“With millions of people searching for legal help on Avvo, it’s important to be able to deliver the right content to meet their individual needs in real-time,” said Sendi Widjaja, co-founder and chief technology officer of Avvo. “The scalability of Cloudera Enterprise, along with its ease of data access and analytical power, allows us to rapidly transform responses to legal questions posed to more than 190,000 qualified lawyers into readily available advice for our mobile and website visitors.”
 
With powerful processing and analytic capabilities of an enterprise data hub, Avvo can drive innovations with its data at faster rates and with deeper insights. Internally, Avvo leverages the technology to pinpoint areas for improvement – such as churn analysis to analyze factors that cause customer attrition, and lead scoring to track prospects’ behavior and web activity to determine their level of interest in Avvo products. 
 
“By unlocking the full potential of its data, Avvo can continue to provide the easiest possible user experience to help millions of people successfully navigate complicated legal matters by sourcing and providing answers to important, and often personal, questions,” said Mike Olson, founder, chairman of the Board and chief strategy officer, Cloudera. “The Avvo platform has transformed a traditional professional services business by making legal consulting more accessible, and its move in driving new value through data cements Avvo as a forward-looking, highly competitive company.”
 
Cloudera delivers the most secure, managed, governed, and open data management platform with its enterprise data hub. It offers all the key attributes necessary for customers to make data a driver of decision making. Cloudera Impala, the only native open source analytic database for Hadoop, paired with Cloudera’s support for Apache Spark, an open source data analytics framework, provide Avvo with faster time to insight for business intelligence and real-time analytics. Avvo now has a deeper understanding of how users are interacting with its services, and can use that information to power improvements and innovations.
 
As a key part of an enterprise data hub, Impala makes analytics across any kind of data accessible for analysts and casual users alike. Organizations of all sizes have adopted Impala, and have seen improvements to speed and accuracy of services thanks to its highly interactive data discovery solutions for large sets data. Impala empowers companies to leverage analytics in all decision-making processes, therefore providing a key resource in harnessing value from the global rush of data.
 
Cloudera’s support for Spark with Cloudera Enterprise helps deliver faster time to insight on more data, enabling businesses to increase their competitive edge and reduce costs. It can power a robust end-to-end analytic workflow, comprising batch data processing, interactive query, deep data mining, and real-time applications on Hadoop.
