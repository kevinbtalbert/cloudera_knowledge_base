Press Release
Cloudera and Cask Announce Strategic Partnership














Cloudera Invests in Cask to Accelerate  Development of Hadoop-based Applications on Enterprise Data Hubs
PALO ALTO, Calif., February 11, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, and Cask, the pioneer empowering developers for Hadoop, announced today that they have entered into a strategic business and deep technology collaboration agreement, including an equity investment from Cloudera. Together the two open source leaders will drive a roadmap of joint product innovation between Cloudera Enterprise and the Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP). They will also collaborate to encourage and enable developers to more rapidly and easily build applications on Hadoop, and jointly work with customers to deliver high value solutions for Hadoop. In addition to the technology and business collaboration, Cloudera will join Cask’s Strategic Advisory Board. The strategic collaboration and the equity investment are subject to standard closing conditions, including customary regulatory approvals.
Increasingly, organizations are looking to create better business value by turning data analytics directly into action using Hadoop. Cask and Cloudera refer to this approach as operational analytics, and the applications that incorporate data analytics as data applications. The primary goal of the partnership is to help customers overcome the challenges in building data applications, and to accelerate the value creation from operational analytics.
“Over the years, Hadoop has spawned a rich ecosystem of data ingest, analysis, processing, security, and compliance services that make up a true enterprise data hub,” said Mike Olson, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Cloudera. “We’re seeing an explosion of applications and tools built natively on that platform to help non-technical users get real value from big data. Cask gives developers much better ways to build and deliver those applications. Big data applications will be a major driver of market growth over the next several years, and Cask is in exactly the right place to accelerate that growth.”
“Cloudera has a leading analytic data management platform and the most experience delivering Hadoop-based solutions,” said Jonathan Gray, co-founder and chief executive of Cask. “We are thrilled to have them as a key strategic partner to collaborate on our roadmap and to engage developers and customers. Additionally, Cloudera’s participation on our Strategic Advisory Board will help shape our company’s future.”
The first results of the partnership will be immediately available to customers. Cask has released version 2.7 of CDAP with optimizations for Cloudera Enterprise built-in. Specifically, Cloudera customers will be able to install, launch, and monitor CDAP directly from Cloudera Manager. In addition, CDAP includes capabilities to more easily ingest real-time or batch data into Impala for high performance SQL queries. These innovations are just a start – Cask and Cloudera are committed to improving the experience for developers to deliver data applications for operational analytics. As Andrew Brust, research director for Big Data and Analytics at Gigaom Research, noted in his report Outlook: Big data and analytics in 2015, "Developers are the key to carrying functionality over the last mile to real-life end users.”
