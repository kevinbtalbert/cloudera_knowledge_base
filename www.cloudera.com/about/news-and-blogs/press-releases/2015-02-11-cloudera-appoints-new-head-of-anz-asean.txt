Press Release
Cloudera Appoints New Head of ANZ/ASEAN to address Growing Customer Demand and Broaden Ecosystem of Partners














Richard Jones, Former Informatica Executive to Lead Fastest Growing Data-driven Region
SYDNEY, Australia, February 11, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced the appointment of Richard Jones to vice president of ANZ / ASEAN. The ANZ / ASEAN region is made up of Australia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and New Zealand. Based in Singapore, Jones’ appointment further supports Cloudera’s commitment to customers and partners in the region, as well as the enormous opportunities to share Cloudera’s Big Data technology to a burgeoning technology class. According to Jones, “Cloudera’s technology is poised to help transform how South Asian organizations maximize the value of one of their most important assets - their data.”
“Cloudera will continue to expand its reach across the globe, and South Asia is currently the fastest growing data-driven economy in the world,” continued Jones. "The breadth of diversity and varying levels of maturity in this region allow Cloudera to bring its years of experience, knowledge and market leadership to bear. We’ll help organizations to build enterprise data hubs to become truly information-driven.”
In his new role, Richard will help Cloudera’s South Asia customers to accelerate their journey to build and rely on an enterprise data hub as the core of their data management strategies. Enterprise data hubs are one place to securely store, govern, and analyze all of one’s data. As part of this role, Richard will lead a team of sales and technical support staff, expand Cloudera’s South Asia presence, drive customer satisfaction, and pursue innovative new ways to use and apply Cloudera technology.
“Cloudera is the industry leader in the Hadoop market, and as it continues to grow in the region it aims to be the go-to-source when companies think about Big Data and how to use it within the enterprise,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer, Cloudera. “The need to use more data for competitive advantage is driving organizations to look at new approaches to managing the data dilemma.”
Richard previously worked at Informatica where he was most recently Vice President of Sales & Operations Asia Pacific and Japan. Prior to Informatica, Richard spent time as an independent consultant and at Business Objects in sales and sales management roles.
