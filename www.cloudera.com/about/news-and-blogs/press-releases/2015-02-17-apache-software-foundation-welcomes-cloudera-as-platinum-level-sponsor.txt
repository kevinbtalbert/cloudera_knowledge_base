Press Release
The Apache Software Foundation Welcomes Cloudera as a Platinum-level Sponsor














Sponsorship boosts operational support for Apache projects and community
Forest Hill, MD – February 17, 2015 – The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Cloudera has renewed its sponsorship of the ASF with an upgrade to the Platinum level.
"We are grateful for Cloudera's continued generous support, which, in turn, helps advance the efforts of the Apache community at-large," said ASF President Ross Gardler. "Sponsoring the ASF helps provide critical infrastructure and support services that keep the Foundation running on a day-to-day basis."
As a United States 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charitable organization, the ASF relies on individual donors and corporate sponsors to help bolster existing projects, incubate new initiatives, and promote meritocratic, community-driven development "The Apache Way".
An ASF Sponsor since 2011, Cloudera is recognized as a champion and active contributor to numerous Apache projects, including Apache Avro, Apache Hadoop, Apache HBase, Apache Hive, Apache Pig, Apache Spark and Apache ZooKeeper.
“Open source software has proven a powerful engine for innovation,” said Mike Olson, founder and chief strategy officer, Cloudera. “It harnesses the talent and creativity of the global community of developers. Participation in that community is critical. Cloudera has long been a proud member of the Apache community and contributor to the ASF. Developers on the Cloudera payroll have created and contributed to ASF projects, working closely with their peers in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.
“Our platinum sponsorship of the ASF complements our active contribution of code. The organization provides essential governance and community support on which our business relies. This donation, and our ongoing commitment, allow the ASF to deepen its investment in community, collaboration and innovation.”
Cloudera joins Platinum level Sponsors Citrix, Facebook, Google, Matt Mullenweg, Microsoft, and Yahoo!; Gold Sponsors Comcast, HP, Hortonworks, and IBM; Silver Sponsors Budget Direct, Cerner, InMotion Hosting, iSIGMA, Pivotal, Produban, and WANdisco; and Bronze Sponsors Accor, Basis Technology, Bluehost, Cloudsoft Corporation, Samsung, Talend, and Twitter.
