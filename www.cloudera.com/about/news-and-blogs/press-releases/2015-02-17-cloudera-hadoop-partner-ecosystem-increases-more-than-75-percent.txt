Press Release
Cloudera Hadoop Partner Ecosystem Increases by more than 75% in the Past Year














The Largest Partner Program around Apache Hadoop, Cloudera Connect, Grows Even Larger as Partners and Customers Realize Tremendous Value
PALO ALTO, Calif., – February 17, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that its partner ecosystem grew more than 75 percent over the past year to include over 1,450 partners. Cloudera forged deeper and expanded strategic partnerships to facilitate access to, and unify, multiple data sources, to more easily access and build applications on top of Hadoop, deploy its distribution of Hadoop in cloud environments, and to offer joint go-to-market strategies. In the past year Cloudera announced new and expanded strategic partnerships with Accenture, Capgemini, Dell, EMC Isilon, Informatica, Intel, Microsoft, MongoDB, NEC, Red Hat, SAP, TCS and Teradata to improve access to, and expand the use of data for realizing more meaningful insights within an enterprise data hub.
These partnerships build on previously announced alliances with Amazon, CenturyLink Technology Solutions, HP, IBM Softlayer, Oracle, SAS, Splunk, T-Systems, and VMware.
Cloudera’s total ISV application and tools partners, companies that build applications that run on the platform, increased more than 60 percent to 267. System Integrators (SI) and solutions partners jumped 50 percent to 851. Cloudera is working with SI partners on 18 industry solutions built on Cloudera, with more than 20 others in development. OEM application partners grew during the past year to 29—delivering full product solutions in several key verticals such as financial services, telecommunications, manufacturing, healthcare, retail, and technology.
Last Spring, Cloudera kicked off a vibrant and robust partner product certification program, announcing at the time that Cloudera Enterprise 5 was generally available and that the company had already certified more than 100 products on its platform, ensuring that customers always have the broadest choice of solutions to suit their business needs. Today that number is over 200. With security a growing concern for any business, over 70 partner product certifications on Cloudera Enterprise 5 with security have been completed. Across all Cloudera Enterprise products total partner certifications number 323, an increase of over 180 percent over the past year.
“We are extremely excited about the depth and breadth of our partner ecosystem,” said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development, Cloudera. “We’re working with 13 of the 14 Leaders, Challengers and Visionaries in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for BI and Analytics Platforms for 2014, 12 of whom are certified on Impala. Our partners play a key role in the direction of our business and they serve as the voice of the customer in many respects. We invest heavily in our partners – and we will continue to do so going forward.”
In 2014, Cloudera also launched the Cloudera Accelerator Program to drive innovation across the Hadoop ecosystem and ensure customers always have access to the leading, production-ready applications built on the most popular tools in Hadoop, such as Apache Spark and Impala. To date, more than 40 leading companies are part of the Accelerator Program including:
Actuate, Adateo, Alteryx, Alpine Data Labs, Aquafold, Atigeo, AtScale, BPM-Conseil, Datawatch, Denodo Technologies, Digital Reasoning, Diyotta, ElasticSearch, IBM Cognos, Information Builders, KNIME, Logi Analytics, Looker, Microstrategy, Pentaho, Platfora, Predixion Software, Qlik, Quantcell Research, RapidMiner, Revolution Analytics, SAS, Skytree, Snaplogic, Syncsort, Tableau, Talend, Targit, Tibco, Tresata, Trifacta, Zoomdata, 0xdata
As 2015 begins there are already a number of new partnerships in the works, including the recently announced partnership with Cask where the two companies will collaborate to encourage and enable developers to more rapidly and easily build applications on Hadoop, jointly working with customers to deliver high value solutions. Cloudera expects more announcements like this as companies join the Cloudera Connect Partner Program to ensure that developers and its customers have access to the best technology, support and expertise that exists in the Hadoop ecosystem.
