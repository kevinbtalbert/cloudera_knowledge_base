Cloudera’s Leadership in the Apache Hadoop Community Drives Accelerated Enterprise Adoption and Strong Business Results in Fiscal 2015






 









100% Y/Y Software Revenue Growth Leads to Fiscal 2015 Revenue Surpassing $100 Million; Cloudera Is Now the Second Largest Independent Open Source Software Company in History 
PALO ALTO, Calif., – February 17, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache HadoopTM, today shared its views on the state of the Hadoop market and ecosystem. At recent industry events, Chief Executive Officer, Tom Reilly, and Chief Strategy Officer and Co-founder, Mike Olson, discussed the Hadoop industry’s momentum, advances in ecosystem development and customer success in extracting value from Big Data. In particular, the executives outlined community initiatives in 2015 to ensure performance, security, and manageability of Apache Hadoop for increased enterprise use.
Furthermore, Reilly reviewed Cloudera’s strong business results for fiscal 2015(1), reflecting enterprises around the globe benefitting across a multitude of use cases from the power of Hadoop and embracing it as central to their data management strategies. As the market share leader in enterprise Hadoop, Cloudera is regarded by many industry experts as the benchmark for Hadoop adoption and commercial success. As such, Cloudera is excited to report strong performance based on the hard work of the Apache community, Cloudera’s ecosystem of partners, a growing customer base, and Cloudera’s very dedicated global team.
“Fiscal 2015 marked an extraordinary year for Cloudera and the industry. We made strides across all areas of our business, and drove accelerated adoption of Hadoop within the enterprise through our commitment to and collaboration with the Apache Hadoop community,” said Reilly. “We are proud to employ and collaborate with Apache Hadoop innovators to deliver cutting edge technology that is disrupting the status quo while enabling data-driven business transformation for our customers. We expanded around the globe, and went much deeper into vertical markets to deliver the most secure and robust platform for Big Data and to unlock new use cases -- which leads to tremendous business value for our customers. We are excited about our success, and commend the broader community on the growth of Hadoop and the impact it is delivering.” 
Cloudera is pleased to share its fiscal 2015 business results(2) as an indicator of Hadoop’s strong momentum:

Annual recurring subscription software revenue(3) growth accelerated year over year to approximately 100%
Preliminary unaudited total revenue surpassed $100 million
Total enterprise subscription software customers(4) grew by more than 85% to approximately 525; approximately 250 new logo customers were added
The Cloudera partner ecosystem, the largest in the industry, expanded beyond 1,450 companies, including new or enhanced partnerships with EMC Isilon, Microsoft, Red Hat, SAP, TCS and Teradata

“Accelerating growth in the Hadoop market and in our own business can be directly attributed to the introduction of the enterprise data hub, now representing more than 60% of new business for Cloudera,” said Olson. “In fact, our customers adopting an EDH are renewing and expanding their use of Hadoop at a faster rate than ever as they see increased value from Big Data.”
An enterprise data hub (EDH) is a ‘reference architecture’ that defines a new data management platform built around Hadoop. The power of an EDH stems from its integration with existing systems -- databases, enterprise data warehouses, data integration tools, and analytic applications. In this regard, an EDH complements existing systems, allowing enterprises to optimize where workloads occur and enabling access and analysis of all an enterprise’s data.
Advances with the Open Source Ecosystem and Community
“In 2014, the community focused especially hard on security and enabling real-time, interactive and streaming applications to function elegantly with Hadoop, such that enterprises can execute multi-workload, multi-application analytics seamlessly and securely,” said Olson. “Cloudera is proud to have contributed to these advancements and we are dedicated to continued innovation and leadership in Hadoop open source software development, working with the Apache Software Foundation to foster the Hadoop ecosystem.” Having grown the company to more than 800 employees, Cloudera now has more committer seats across all the Hadoop ecosystem projects than any other vendor, and continues to attract the industry’s leading open source developers.
To illustrate, Olson described some of the community’s recent efforts. In order to elevate the importance of security, Cloudera continued to innovate on Apache Sentry, and through its acquisition of Gazzang and its partnership with Intel, led the optimization of Hadoop for chip-level encryption, making it possible for all data in Hadoop to be encrypted with very little performance degradation. This innovation enabled MasterCard to meet Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards and achieve PCI compliance on Cloudera’s enterprise data hub, the first Hadoop installation to earn this certification.
Similarly, Cloudera led the introduction of a new version of Impala, a 100% open source interactive SQL engine that allows end users to query data stored in Hadoop using industry standard applications. As an example, Olson commented on a leader in healthcare IT, Cerner, and its recent announcement that it had implemented an EDH to create a holistic understanding of the healthcare system to improve patient outcomes. Cerner indicated that insight from its Hadoop-powered Big Data initiatives had saved hundreds of lives. “We are honored to have contributed to the type of data-driven social impact that is resulting from the efforts of Cerner and others,” he said. 
Since 2005, Cloudera employees have founded or co-founded 20 Hadoop ecosystem projects(5) and plays a large ongoing role in many others, including Spark and YARN. 
Partner Program Grows by 640, Surpassing 1,450
Cloudera expanded its partner program, Cloudera Connect, by 78% during the year, ensuring that its customers have access to complete, integrated solutions that interoperate with their existing data management infrastructure. In fiscal 2015, Cloudera announced partnerships with Accenture, Capgemini, Dell, EMC Isilon, Informatica, Intel, Microsoft, MongoDB, NEC, Red Hat, SAP, Teradata, and others to accelerate the deployment of Hadoop. Further detail on the growth of the Cloudera Connect program may be found here.
“It was an incredible year for Cloudera, the Apache Hadoop community, our partners and, most importantly, our customers who are experiencing benefit and gaining tremendous business value from their big data initiatives. We look forward to driving further innovation and collaboration with the community in the year ahead,” said Reilly.
