Cloudera and Deloitte Announce Strategic Alliance to Advance Analytic Performance of Customers






 









Alliance Launches Two Cloudera-Based Industry Solutions
PALO ALTO, Calif., – February 19, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced a formal alliance with Deloitte, a recognized leader in analytic services, to jointly enhance the ability of Deloitte clients to derive actionable insights from their data. The alliance will leverage the Cloudera enterprise data hub to accelerate customer time-to-value using Deloitte’s analytics services, industry-specific solutions and extensive portfolio of intellectual property accelerators.
“For most organizations, the analysis of stored structured data is not new,” said Ashish Verma, director, Deloitte Consulting LLP, and information management service line big data and architecture, and innovation leader.
“The arrival of inexpensive computation, storage, and bandwidth capacity — coupled with scalable cluster distribution for multi-dimensional data sets — has significantly altered the scale of what is now possible.”
“Through our relationship with Cloudera, our clients are now better positioned to produce enhanced insights to drive more informed and differentiating business decisions,” added Marc Zimmerman, director, Deloitte Consulting LLP, and Cloudera alliance and global financial services industry analytics leader.
Cloudera Enterprise is a fully supported, enterprise-ready Big Data platform comprised of CDH, the most widely deployed Hadoop distribution in the market, and unique software not available from the open source community. As a result of Cloudera’s powerful data management technology, analysts across all industries are able to leverage a complete range of available data and data types, and iterate faster to create better models for making more informed business decisions with actionable results. Cloudera Support features the industry’s only predictive and proactive support capabilities, focused on securing more uptime, rapid issue resolution and prevention, and better performance for mission-critical applications. Furthermore, with the release of Deloitte’s Analytics Trends 2015, Cloudera helps Deloitte increase its expertise along the trend lines of security, open-source and the Analytics of Things.
Cloudera provides value to clients by removing the need to define the structure of the data before consuming it. Cloudera’s integrated Hadoop platform solutions support both structured and unstructured data formats, enabling the analytical models of clients to search rich content such as audio recordings, social media communications and scanned images together with more traditional historical data records, dramatically empowering the analytic process. Unlocking data means unlocking value that clients were previously unable to access.
Deloitte has released its first two industry solutions that leverage Cloudera Enterprise:

Insurance Claims Subrogation — Advanced quantitative modeling and sentiment analytics from Deloitte combined with CDH will enable a highly effective process for identifying claims that should be investigated for subrogation. By isolating those claims that statistically present the best opportunities for recovery, Deloitte enables clients to improve financial performance with the least amount of time and cost.


Customer Next Best Offer — The solution will leverage Cloudera technology to perform pattern analysis to gain insights about customer behaviors that enable clients to serve the right offer, at the right time, to the right customer. This solution can improve prospects for business growth through increased offer conversion rates and timely presentation of cross-sell and upsell opportunities. The solution will have applications across a wide variety of industries, including consumer products, industrial products, finance, and telecommunications.
“It is crucial for today’s businesses to uncover insights that allow for the strongest action to be taken with the fastest path to success,” said Tim Stevens, vice president of business and corporate development at Cloudera. “Demand for big data tools and support services continues to grow with unprecedented speed as companies of all types and sizes recognize the value that Hadoop offers – whether for its value in solving data storage needs, data access, data security, or for its analytical power. With Cloudera’s enterprise data hub, Deloitte will enable its clients to decrease their costs and find opportunities to drive new revenue from new and existing opportunities. Additionally, Deloitte and Cloudera place a lot of value in having a robust partner ecosystem; this emphasis should open up further opportunities to provide value to our joint clients in the future.”
