Cloudera Named a Challenger in Gartner 2015 Data Warehouse and Data Management Solutions for Analytics Magic Quadrant






 









Positioned in Report For Two Consecutive Years
Open Source Continues to Have Importance in Enterprise Data Management Strategies
PALO ALTO, Calif. – February 26, 2014 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that is has been named a Challenger in the 2015 Magic Quadrant for Data Warehouse and Data Management Solutions for Analytics. Cloudera is the only open source pure-play Hadoop vendor included and positioned in the report for two consecutive years.
According to Gartner, “In 2015, organizations require solutions capable of managing and processing external data in combination with their traditional internal sources, and may even include data from the Internet of Things. This is creating new demands on the data warehouse market — for broader data management solutions for analytics, with features and functionality that represent a significant augmentation to existing enterprise data warehouse strategies.”
Cloudera, provider of the world’s first and most popular commercial Hadoop distribution, has led the way in defining a new analytic architecture - an enterprise data hub - to complement and extend existing investments. Powered by Apache Hadoop, an enterprise data hub combines unlimited storage with diverse access to data, through batch or stream processing, interactive SQL, search, or advanced analytics, while meeting mission-critical requirements for security, governance, and administration.
“Cloudera is continually recognized for its innovation and functionality - most recently we announced improvements in and brought to market Impala, Cloudera Director, Cloudera Navigator, Cloudera Search and Sentry,” said Mike Olson, founder and chief strategy officer, Cloudera. “As big data has assumed a central role for enterprises, we’ve driven more capabilities -- real-time streaming, compliance-ready data protection, powerful new analytics and more -- into our platform. Cloudera’s able to attack more business-critical problems for our customers, and that’s accelerated adoption. We believe that our position in the Gartner MQ reflects not just the maturation of our product, but the increasing sophistication of the enterprises we work with.”
Cloudera benefits from strong security and governance capabilities, as well as a broad set of deeply integrated BI, analytics, and data integration partners. This enables Cloudera to be easily deployed alongside traditional data management systems while meeting stringent enterprise requirements, and supporting existing investments in business user tools. The company has also partnered with leading players in this market such as Oracle, Microsoft, Teradata, and SAP to deliver certified connectors and joint reference architectures.
Gartner recognizes that: “The data warehouse market now includes management of all types of data for analytics under an integrated approach” and that “[t]he definition of the data warehouse is expanding. The term data warehouse does not mean "relational, integrated repository." The data warehouse is what we built to do that, but the new SLAs indicate that sometimes data should be pre-integrated, and sometimes not. This new market demands a much broader data management solution for analytics.”
The complete report, including the quadrant graphic, is available on the Cloudera website.
