Meinestadt.de Selects Cloudera to Build Its Data Discovery Platform and Improve User Experience Across Web Services






 









Cloudera Enterprise Chosen by Leading German Classifieds Portal to Work in Tandem with Existing Oracle Data Warehouse
PALO ALTO, Calif., – March 5, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop, today announced meinestadt.de, a leading German classifieds and local information portal, has selected Cloudera to build out its data discovery platform to help improve the user experience across the company’s web services. Cloudera’s Hadoop-based platform for Big Data, Cloudera Enterprise, will enable meinestadt.de to glean new insights from the millions of customer interactions that filter through its web services each day. To boost the company’s storage capabilities, Cloudera Enterprise will work in tandem with meinestadt.de’s existing Oracle data warehouse to collect its data, making it more secure, resilient, and flexible to react to change.
Meinestadt.de’s web portal and apps form a uniquely localized classifieds platform for German cities and municipalities with comprehensive information on jobs, real estate, cars, events, ticketing, and dating, as well as a wide range of local advertising. With over 7.17 million unique users and 131 million page views per month, meinestadt.de is focused on maturing its Big Data strategy based on Hadoop to optimize user interactions and provide its product teams with the ability to shape future product development and strategies.
After reviewing multiple Hadoop distributions, meinestadt.de decided to implement Cloudera Enterprise as a proof of concept. Cloudera’s cutting-edge research methods, solid reputation in European markets, and Big Data expertise were key in making that decision.
“Cloudera fit our requirements in choosing a Big Data solution,” said Dr. Katja Mueller, head of Business Intelligence at meinestadt.de. “The company is at the forefront of real-time stream data processing through Apache Spark, a process we intend to implement in the short term. This will allow us to deliver an individualized experience to every user on our site, a top priority.”
“Meinestadt.de collects large amounts of data, in a wide range of formats, from lots of sources,” said Mike Olson, founder and chief strategy officer, Cloudera. “Capturing it, organizing it, making it searchable and delivering real-time answers to users on the web is a tremendous challenge. Cloudera is proud to help meinestadt.de deliver accurate, useful information to its users in real-time. By adopting a true enterprise data hub, meinestadt.de has a platform that integrates with today’s technology and delivers the flexibility and scale that can handle the demands of the future. We’re very pleased to be working with the company to get users the information that they need.”
