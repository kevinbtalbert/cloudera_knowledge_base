Vishal Rao Joins Cloudera to Lead Worldwide Sales, Services and Business Development






 









Seasoned Sales Veteran Appointed to Drive Customer Growth, Deliver Customer Value, and Scale The Business
PALO ALTO, Calif., March 16, 2015 - Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced the appointment of Vishal Rao as Senior Vice President, Field Operations. Rao joins Cloudera to run global Sales, Services, and Business Development.
Prior to Cloudera, Rao spent five years at Splunk (SPLK), the leading software platform for machine data that enables customers to gain real-time operational intelligence, most recently as Worldwide VP of Field Sales. While there he led the team that drove revenues to over $450 million.
"Vishal joins Cloudera with a record of stellar success, most recently he significantly grew and scaled one of the industry's leading big data companies -- in record time," said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer. "This appointment adds to our deep bench of industry-recognized business and technology leaders that are driving innovations in Hadoop. Cloudera's mission to drive big value with big data for our customers matches Vishal's strategic understanding of our customers' needs and the solutions required to meet them. He will be a great asset to the company as we set off on this next phase of growth."
Cloudera recently shared revenue numbers and market momentum for its fiscal year 2015. The numbers affirm Cloudera's leadership position amongst its peers, and Cloudera plans to maintain this lead by recognizing and acting upon trends in the market. The company recognized that 2013 was the year of Hadoop, POCs, and departmental projects; 2014 was the year that Hadoop transformed to a platform - an enterprise data hub - which is best suited for multiple applications running on the same system; and this year, 2015 is the year that high value business applications are being delivered atop the enterprise data hub. Cloudera plans to help fuel this growth by developing partnerships in key verticals with other software and hardware vendors to ensure customers have the best enterprise data management solutions available to them.
Rao, who has also held a number of sales leadership positions at BMC Software and IBM, will play a crucial role in making this happen, by building an enterprise-class Field organization. His experience scaling organizations and supporting that scale will be invaluable as Cloudera continues to grow.
Rao commented, "Cloudera is transforming the way that organizations use data to make business decisions. As the leader in enterprise Hadoop, Cloudera is at the nexus of a number of trends that are producing inordinate amounts of data - analytics, cloud, the Internet of Things, mobility and more. The Cloudera solution, the enterprise data hub, is a central place to store, access, secure, govern and analyze all of one's data. I'm excited about the company - the technology, the people - and for the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to accelerating our customers' journeys to success."
Mr. Rao holds a Bachelors in International Business and Marketing from Richmond, the American International University in London.
