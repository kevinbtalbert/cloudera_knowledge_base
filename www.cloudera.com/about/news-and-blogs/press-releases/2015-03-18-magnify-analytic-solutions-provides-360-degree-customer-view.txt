Magnify Analytic Solutions Provides Fortune 100 Customers with a 360° Customer View Using a Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub






 









Through Technology-Driven Data Analysis, Magnify Offers Clients a Range of Informed Business Services with Faster Time to Value and at Lower TCO
PALO ALTO, Calif., – March 18, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that Magnify Analytic Solutions – a wholly-owned division of Detroit, Michigan-based Marketing Associates, has deployed a Cloudera enterprise data hub (EDH) to meet the growing demands of its Fortune 100 customer base. Through technology-driven data analysis, Magnify has increased its ability to deliver a 360-degree customer view that informs the business decisions of its blue-chip portfolio of clients including BMW Financial Services, Comcast, Ford Motor Company, Jaguar Cars, TD Bank, and Whirlpool.
Magnify has historically relied on its legacy RDBMS environment to process large datasets for customers to support a variety of deliverables such as business to consumer (B2C) online marketing contests and product giveaways, executing 150 of these campaigns in the last year, and driving hundreds of thousands of conversions. A single campaign can generate as many as 200,000 hits in the first minute, presenting a Big Data challenge.
“Web event data must be effectively collected, processed and analyzed within seconds of launching to derive consumer insights in order for a campaign to be worthwhile,” said Andy Frey, chief information officer for Magnify. “From a cost standpoint, it’s equally imperative to control how much processing power will be required and for how long. When campaigns launch simultaneously, the volume of combined responses can literally shut down a data center.”
As Magnify looked to expand its central data repository to take on more data types from more data sources, it quickly saw the need for a Big Data platform that would complement the RDBMS environment. The Big Data infrastructure needed to provide elastic flexibility and scalability to handle massive, short-term spikes in demand coupled with the ability to manage and manipulate huge data volumes from many sources.
“Our legacy systems relied on data being organized and restructured over time to support the programs we were building,” said Frey. “Query times began to slow because data wasn’t optimized to accommodate our evolving use cases. We sought a solution that could satisfy these new demands while integrating with our existing environment. We really liked what Hadoop had to offer and quickly realized that an enterprise data hub would open new opportunities to leverage data for our clients while providing the agility we needed.”
“Today’s technology infrastructure must be agile, adaptable, and cost effective to run in order to accelerate and accommodate new production environments,” said Alan Saldich, vice president of Marketing, Cloudera. “We can effectively add a whole new dimension to data discovery, and at the same time optimize query performance, with Hadoop — it’s the underlying engine for all things Big Data.”
In evaluating the various Hadoop distributions, Cloudera Manager became a major differentiator. Its ease-of-use dramatically reduced the team’s learning curve in adopting Hadoop. Cost was also a significant factor. The team modeled a full-scale implementation of a production environment for one of its Fortune 100 clients and included licensing expenses, accounting for future growth.
“We determined that by purchasing Cloudera Enterprise, Data Hub Edition and everything else we needed for our development, production, and QA environments, we would be readily equipped to address our needs today and to easily scale our infrastructure for the future, at a lower total cost of ownership than the current infrastructure alone,” said Frey.
Other key considerations included:
● Reduced security risk – With most of Magnify’s clients being in the Fortune 100, this was a key requirement. Cloudera is the only enterprise data management provider that protects all data and metadata in motion and at rest across the entire Hadoop stack and within the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Cloudera’s deep involvement in Project Rhino with Apache Sentry™, its acquisition of Gazzang, and the launch of the Cloudera Center for Security Excellence makes the company the leader in data protection–providing comprehensive security, governance, and compliance for Big Data.


● Faster time to value – Magnify wanted to ‘get it right the first time’ and Cloudera Professional Services’ expertise enabled Magnify to achieve this. The knowledge accumulated in the implementation process is now a valuable in-house asset.


● Improved query performance – By deploying Impala, the leading analytic open source database for Hadoop that allows for self-service data discovery, Magnify is offering clients a web-based solution through which they interact directly with Hadoop.
Today, data moves between the enterprise data hub and Magnify’s relational data warehouse using Apache Sqoop or Apache Flume. Magnify users have the option to interact with the data hub using a variety of tools, preferences and skill sets, including Apache Hive, Apache Pig, Cloudera Search, Impala, SAS (which leverages the SAS/ACCESS Interface to Impala), and Tableau. Magnify can now deliver the flexibility, agility, and fast time to value for customers’ brand campaigns all with the security their clients require.
