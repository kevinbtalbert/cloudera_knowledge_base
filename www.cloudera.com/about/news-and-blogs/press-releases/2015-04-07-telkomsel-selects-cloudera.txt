Telkomsel Selects Cloudera to Speed Customer Adoption of Broadband Services






 









Leading Indonesian Telecommunications Company Implements Cloudera Enterprise for Data Discovery and Analytics
PALO ALTO, Calif., – April 7, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that Telkomsel has selected Cloudera as its big data platform provider to support the company’s evolution from a voice- and SMS-based business to one that offers higher value broadband services to customers. Recognized as the biggest mobile operator in Indonesia with over 140 million subscribers, Telkomsel has seen increasing data volumes in its legacy data warehouse, particularly as a result of the telecommunications industry’s technological convergence which is driving consumers to perform a wider range of tasks using their mobile devices. This data deluge promises valuable customer and network insights if it can effectively be captured and managed.
Telkomsel turned to Hadoop to deliver on this promise, initially implementing Cloudera Enterprise to offload extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations from the data warehouse for more cost-effective data processing and faster time to realize insights across its business. The company is now implementing data discovery and analytics use cases on the Cloudera platform to, for example, gain deeper customer insights that will support many users’ adoption of smartphones and broadband services.
When Telkomsel began searching for a strategic big data partner, the company recognized the flexibility of running an open source Hadoop distribution on industry standard servers, which could drive a dramatic change in the character and the quantity of data available to analyze. Cloudera was ultimately chosen for the stability and maturity of its Hadoop distribution, its widespread market share, and range of relevant use cases and reference customers, in addition to its high quality of customer support and flexibility of subscription options.
“One of the first use cases we looked at was storing xDR data for longer data retention. With 100 percent data growth annually, Hadoop is the best option to offload the data from the EDW,” said Metra C. Utama, vice president of IT Planning at Telkomsel. “We’re looking forward to the next phase of adoption of our Cloudera environment, which will drive new analytical insights. The level of ongoing support and day-to-day interaction we have with the Cloudera team will expedite the advancement of our platform, and we look forward to the additional benefits this will offer our business.”
The company is running Cloudera in an on-premise environment, and is exploring the use of Hadoop components including Apache Hive, Apache Spark, and Impala. Telkomsel performs data ingestion using Apache Sqoop, Apache Flume, and Apache Kafka to move data from its sources to the EDW.
“The ability to improve overall business strategy or revenue through advanced analytics is paramount for any business to maintain a competitive edge,” said Amy O’Connor, big data evangelist and telecommunications subject matter expert at Cloudera. “Like so many other leading mobile operators around the globe, the data volumes that Telkomsel seeks to gather and process for better, faster decision-making are growing exponentially. We are pleased to provide Telkomsel with a platform that meets their needs for increased analytic visibility.”
