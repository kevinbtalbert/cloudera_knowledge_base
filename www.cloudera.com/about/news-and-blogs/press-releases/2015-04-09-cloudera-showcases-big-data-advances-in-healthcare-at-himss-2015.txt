Cloudera Showcases Big Data Advances in Healthcare and Life Sciences at HIMSS 2015






 









Enterprise Data Hub Success Stories Highlighted in Conference Sessions and at Cloudera Booth
MEDIA ALERT: PALO ALTO, Calif., April 9, 2015 –
Who: Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that it will be speaking and exhibiting at the HIMSS15 (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society) annual conference and exhibition. Cloudera will present alongside speakers from Cerner, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, and Kaiser Permanente.  
What: The 2015 Annual HIMSS Conference & Exhibition, April 12-16 in Chicago, Illinois brings together 38,000+ healthcare IT professionals, clinicians, executives, and vendors from around the world. Exceptional education, world-class speakers, cutting-edge health IT products and powerful networking are hallmarks of this industry-leading conference. This year’s agenda features more than 300 education programs including keynotes, thought leader sessions, roundtable discussions and e-sessions, plus preconference symposia and workshops.
The HIMSS15 exhibit floor, with more than 1,200 leading health IT vendors, includes the Clinical and Business Intelligence Knowledge Center, which will host sessions demonstrating how clinical and business intelligence can enable interoperability, patient safety, and quality outcomes.
Cloudera Sessions:

Using Big Data to Improve Outcomes in the NICU
Session ID: KC14

Speakers: Shawn Dolley, Health and Life Science Big Data Expert, Cloudera; Mike Thompson, Vice President, Enterprise Intelligence and Data Architecture, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta

Date: April 14, 2015

Time: 1:00-1:30 p.m. CT

Location: Booth 5484 | Clinical & Business Knowledge Center

Mike Thompson is the vice president of enterprise intelligence and data architecture at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. Before implementing the current big data platform at Children’s, the patients’ ICU vital sign sensor data (heart rate, oxygen levels and other vital information) was only stored for 24 hours in an electronic medical record before being purged. Today, Mike and his team have implemented a platform that allows them to store continuous vital sign data for each patient, merge it with other unstructured information (e.g., ambient sound levels, light volume), and make it available to clinicians to conduct post-hoc analysis. Hear Mike talk about how the big data platform -- which includes Cloudera -- has influenced how treatment is now performed. Mike will also discuss a handful of future innovative research projects on his roadmap.



Better Care with Big Data
 Session ID: 306

Speakers: Ryan Goldman, director of product marketing, Cloudera and Dr. John Mattison, chief medical information officer, Kaiser Permanente, will lead the session, with participation from Ryan Brush, senior director and distinguished engineer, Cerner; Sabrina Dahlgren, director, decision support, Kaiser Permanente; and Mike Thompson, vice president, enterprise intelligence and data architecture, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta

Date: April 15, 2015

Time: 10:00-11:00 a.m. CT

Location: Room S403

Recent technology evolutions in the medical field translate to a wealth of data constantly streaming, in a variety of formats and from many sources, that present significant opportunities to improve our understanding of factors that impact patient care.

Objectives:

Discuss the ways different healthcare organizations -- including payers, providers, and pharmaceutical companies -- are addressing big data challenges using Hadoop.

Discuss legacy technologies and their inability to keep pace with today's demands for better, more personalized and data-driven care.

Exchange best practices for adopting new technologies, including Hadoop.

Share common pitfalls and lessons learned along the big data journey.

Illustrate a vision for the future of healthcare leveraging big data, where providers and patients are engaged in regular communications and healthcare is delivered in a more proactive, less reactive, fashion.




When and Where: HIMSS15 takes place April 12-16 in Chicago at the McCormick Place Convention Center. Cloudera's booth 5484, kiosk 19 is located in the Clinical & Business Knowledge Center.
