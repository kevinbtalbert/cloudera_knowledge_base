Cloudera Opens Budapest Office to Expand European Presence






 









New Location Dedicated to Engineering and Support Addresses the Region’s Growing Demand of Hadoop-based Solutions
PALO ALTO, Calif., – April 14, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, announced today the opening of its new office located in Budapest, Hungary. As a certified entity in Hungary, the new site will serve as an engineering and support office and will work to accelerate Cloudera’s presence in Eastern Europe, addressing the growing demand for Hadoop-based solutions. Cloudera plans to initially fill 30 positions at this location in 2015 and intends to continue to grow the office year over year based on overall business growth. The new site is located in the heart of Budapest’s fifth district.
“After opening our EMEA headquarters in the United Kingdom, the demand for Hadoop began to further accelerate. Expanding into Eastern Europe was a goal that we are proud to have reached,” said Amr Awadallah, chief technology officer and acting vice president of Engineering, Cloudera. “After an exhaustive location search, we chose Budapest based on the high caliber of talent within this region. We are excited to open an Eastern European office and continue expanding our EMEA go-to-market strategy. Our new office in Hungary gives us a firm foundation to serve and support our enterprise customers and more deeply collaborate with our valued partners in Central and Eastern Europe.”
Interest in Hadoop by enterprises located across Central and Eastern Europe is increasing steadily. Over the past year, Cloudera has seen widespread adoption of its category-leading Hadoop-based software, training and support services. The Budapest office will offer on-the-ground resources to deliver technical support, training and solution development for its enterprise customers and partners in the region.
Cloudera is scheduled to attend and hold the following events in Budapest:

April 22-24: Gold sponsor of Craft, a software craftsmanship conference
May 10: Cloudera Meet and Greet and Informational Session on Open Support Positions

In addition, the company plans to bring many of its engineers from around the world to speak at conferences to mix with the rising Budapest technology community.
