Odyssey Consultants Delivers More Powerful Analytics Using Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub






 









European Information Security Solutions and Managed Security Service Provider Boosts Functionality of ClearSkies SecaaS SIEM Platform
PARIS, France – April 15, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache™ Hadoop®, today announced that Odyssey Consultants, a leading information security solutions and managed security service provider with offices in Cyprus, Greece, Serbia, and Dubai, has successfully implemented a Cloudera-powered enterprise data hub (EDH).  The EDH deployed makes possible the expansion of Odyssey Consultants’ ClearSkies security as a service (SecaaS) security information and event management (SIEM) platform by massively enhancing its statistical and user behavioral analytics capabilities, which are becoming vital for any organization that is serious about its information security capability.
Odyssey Consultants will rely on its EDH to process the ever-increasing volumes of data collected by its home-grown ClearSkies platform, a full featured, powerful yet flexible SecaaS SIEM solution that addresses the need of organizations to manage the wealth of information generated by their networks, systems, and applications. ClearSkies enables organizations to reliably collect logs from this multitude of network components, systems, and applications and provides them with the necessary tools to effectively and cost-efficiently enhance their information security and regulatory compliance operations.
The ever-increasing complexity of information technology infrastructures within organizations during the last few years has driven an explosive increase of log data, creating a need for new technologies such as Hadoop to analyze massive data sets; Odyssey’s progressive vision on the future of SIEM technologies relies on Hadoop at its core. Therefore, Odyssey is pioneering the SIEM solutions industry by integrating big data analytics into the ClearSkies platform, massively enhancing its capability to analyze large volumes and different types of log data in an efficient, effective, and timely manner. 
“Building an EDH on the Cloudera platform enables us to store and analyze large and heterogeneous data sets, at an unprecedented scale and speed,” said Eleftherios Antoniades, director of solutions and services at Odyssey Consultants. “The performance and capacity of ClearSkies now scales as the cluster expands. Cloudera Search’s strong performance provides faster security investigation and remediation that is so crucial in a SIEM solution and improves the ability to detect things like changes in users’ behavior. The Cloudera EDH allows us to acquire and combine any amount or type of data in its original fidelity and will ultimately support machine learning and real-time analysis, all within a single, enterprise-grade platform.”
“Irrespective of size, complexity, or vertical industry, operating in today’s technology-driven environment means all businesses face the same challenges of handling greater volumes and varieties of data,” said Eddie Garcia, chief security architect at Cloudera. “We are experiencing a growing interest towards heightened enterprise security where Hadoop, in combination with a SIEM, is greatly improving the posture of the security operations center (SOC) by speeding investigation and remediation along with predictive analytics. Through Cloudera’s enterprise data hub, Odyssey can gain better insight from the data, achieving real-time statistical and behavioral analysis of both streaming and/or data-at-rest events.”
