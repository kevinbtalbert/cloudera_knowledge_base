Nominations Now Open for Cloudera’s Third Annual Data Impact Awards






 









The World’s Most Innovative Implementations of Cloudera’s Market-leading Hadoop Distribution Will Be Recognized for Their Achievements
PALO ALTO, Calif., – April 30, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today opened submissions for the third annual Data Impact Awards. The program celebrates organizations’ exceptional achievements using CDH to address critical challenges and deliver a positive impact in IT, business, and society, across a range of geographies and industry verticals.
More than any other time in history, the rapid proliferation of data is dramatically shifting how organizations make decisions that shape the future of every major industry. Opportunities to discover new solutions that solve the world’s biggest challenges are being made possible by the ability to store, manage, and analyze data without limits.
The 2015 Data Impact Awards will recognize CDH achievements in nine categories:
●      Business Impact
●      Operational Efficiency ROI
●      Data Driven Transformation
●      Path to Production
●      Social Impact
●      Government, Nonprofit, & NGO
●      Data Discovery & Analytics
●      Operational Analytics
●      Security & Compliance
Nominations Now Open
Nominations are now open to any organization that leverages CDH in a production environment. All nominations will be evaluated by a panel of guest judges -- comprised of industry analysts, journalists, and thought leaders -- based on four criteria: creativity, results, maturity, and relevance. There is no cost to enter.
How to Enter
●      Learn more about the program or submit a nomination: www.cloudera.com/data-impact
●      Deadline to submit is August 28, 2015
●      Winners will be announced the week of September 28, 2015, in tandem with the Strata + Hadoop World New York conference
“Last year’s winners showcased the significant strides Hadoop has made in becoming more enterprise-ready with use cases that sparked global change in industries such as banking, healthcare, and government,” said Alan Saldich, vice president, Marketing, Cloudera. “We are excited to see how this year’s nominees are taking their CDH deployments to the next level to affect change across business, society, and for the foreseeable future.”
