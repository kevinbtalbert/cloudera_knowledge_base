Cloudera Announces Support for New Capgemini Reference Architecture for SAP HANA® and Cloudera Enterprise






 









Leading Vendors Enable Customers to Build Enterprise Data Hubs for Improved Data Insights
PALO ALTO, Calif., May 4, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced support for Capgemini’s new reference architecture for the SAP HANA® platform and Cloudera Enterprise, which offers enterprises a comprehensive framework to transform landscapes into next-generation data management and analytics platforms.
Cloudera provides one centralized platform to manage all data in an agile and cost-efficient way so it can be integrated flexibly with existing infrastructure and tools. With Capgemini’s reference architecture, customers are able to generate insights from all their data no matter the structure including traditional ERP feeds, CRM systems, sensor systems, clickstreams and cloud-based social media sources.
In conjunction with the reference architecture connectors between Cloudera Enterprise and SAP HANA and SAP® BusinessObjects™ business intelligence (BI) solutions, Capgemini has collaborated with SAP, Cloudera and Intel to design and validate a consistent reference architecture that integrates the real-time capabilities of the SAP HANA platform with the broad insights generated by Cloudera Enterprise.
“By bringing the power of Cloudera’s enterprise data hub offering to the ecosystem in support of SAP HANA, we can enable Capgemini’s clients to expand the amount of data they have within their environment in a cost-efficient manner,” said Tim Stevens, vice president, Corporate and Business Development, Cloudera. “This will enable exploration for new integrated use cases based on both structured and unstructured data. The result will be that customers gain the ability to drive deeper analytic insight from more complete, longer-term datasets. This reference architecture ushers in a framework for integration of the two complementary technologies and outlines a cost-effective path forward to realize benefits on specific use cases.”
Reference Architectures Help Customers Become More Agile
Through this reference architecture, organizations can modernize their existing SAP application-based landscape. This will enable customers to take advantage of their data wherever it is stored, to generate critical business insights. Customers will be able to enhance their implementations of SAP HANA with more history or more datasets while simplifying their analytical landscape. For example:

Communication service providers can build a smarter network optimization strategy with the real-time view of their high value customers’ network usage.
Retailers can to improve their customer loyalty and better predict sales and inventory by adopting an accurate next best action strategy, embracing the entire view of their customers’ interactions with their brands, on their digital channels as well as in their stores.
Manufacturers can optimize production and logistics by collecting and analyzing machine data in real time throughout the value chain.
Life sciences companies can personalize healthcare and minimize unnecessary emergency department visits.

In these industries, but also in Financial Services, Aerospace & Defense or Automotive, Capgemini with SAP, Intel and Cloudera are proposing to run “Big Data Innovation Workshops” with their customers to identify and prioritize the most relevant use cases for their specific needs.
“With Cloudera, SAP and Intel, we are offering tremendous value to customers by bringing these technologies together,” said Anne-Laure Thieullent, Global Big Data Solutions Director, Capgemini Insights & Data. “Hadoop reinforces the disruptive value proposition of SAP HANA by enabling SAP customers to perform analytic analysis on all their information, allowing them to get a complete view of their business and their customers. Based on this new reference architecture, Capgemini is developing industry-specific solutions, with an initial focus on retail and manufacturing solutions.”
This architecture constitutes a new data platform capable of handling data of various types where it is located, optimizing business intelligence via Impala, and virtualization through SAP HANA smart data access, and real-time integration with business processes running on top of SAP HANA.
Supporting Quotes
“With this unified reference architecture for SAP HANA with Hadoop, SAP customers are able to turn instant insight on massive amounts of data into reality.”
-- Matthew Zenus, vice president, SAP HANA Platform Solutions Group, SAP
“Intel works closely with strategic partners like SAP, Cloudera and Capgemini to help provide the most optimal solutions. We have worked over the years with both Cloudera and SAP to help ensure analytic solutions are tuned and optimized to run well on Intel Xeon platforms. Cloudera’s announcement today with Capgemini can build on that, and help make SAP HANA even more accessible to customers looking to use Apache Hadoop.”
-- Jason Waxman, vice president and general manager, Cloud Infrastructure Group, Intel
