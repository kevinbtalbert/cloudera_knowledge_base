Cloudera and Intel Accelerate Enterprise Hadoop Adoption Through First Year of Industry Partnership






 









Companies Provide Details of New Product Enhancements and Ecosystem Collaboration
PALO ALTO, Calif., – May 5, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, together with Intel Corporation, today announced details on how their partnership has accelerated innovation in big data over the past year. Through product enhancements and collaborative efforts across the ecosystem, their work has resulted in technical advances in security, optimization of core Hadoop technology in four releases of the Cloudera distribution, and greater manageability. In addition, their joint partner engagements have reduced barriers faced by enterprise use of big data analytics, leading to several new solutions, appliances, and cloud deployments.
Cloudera and Intel unveiled details about product enhancements that deliver a 2.5X improvement[1] in encryption off-load performance, enabling an entire Hadoop data set to be encrypted with a system overhead that ranges from only 1% to 4% depending on the workload[2]. Optimizing Cloudera’s distribution, including Apache Hadoop with the latest Intel® Xeon® processor with embedded Intel® AES New Instructions (Intel® AES-NI) has enabled more robust protection of critical enterprise data. As a result, full database encryption is now possible with minimal impact to system performance so that processing resources can run Hadoop jobs at a faster rate, and perform additional Hadoop jobs to accelerate business insights.
Following Intel’s $740M investment in Cloudera last year, Cloudera’s annual recurring subscription software revenue grew 100 percent year-over-year and enterprise subscription software customers grew by more than 85 percent. To accelerate regional growth in 2015, Cloudera has expanded its global reach by opening new offices in key growth areas such as China, where Cloudera has opened its first offices.
Various efforts are underway between the companies to accelerate the delivery of new solutions to enable faster adoption of Hadoop in the enterprise.  Intel’s software development team has collaborated with Cloudera’s engineering team on four of its releases. This includes the addition of unique functionality that was provided by Intel Distribution for Apache Hadoop into Cloudera’s distribution, and software optimizations that take full advantage of current and future Intel® Architecture Processor capabilities. Intel and Cloudera are also working with a variety of key partners in a joint ecosystem to accelerate the delivery of new capabilities, enable key enterprise software integrations between Cloudera Hadoop and data center management tools and create seamless data pipeline connections with leading in-memory analytics providers. 
“Partnering with Intel over the last year has allowed us to accelerate Hadoop innovation by committing to strengthen open source Hadoop projects in areas such as performance, security, and manageability,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer, Cloudera. “It is our mutual goal to ensure big data is at its full potential and that our customers can deploy an enterprise data hub where and how they need to access existing assets and investments and, ultimately, ensure that they can be successful in becoming an information-driven enterprise. Our partnership has allowed us to dramatically expand Hadoop adoption in the enterprise while keeping the platform open, enabling more enterprises to benefit from big data analytics.”
“By bringing Intel’s strengths in data center technologies to our joint efforts with Cloudera to enhance performance, scalability and security in Apache Hadoop, we are delivering faster innovation in data management,” said Diane Bryant, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group. “By uniting our technical efforts and fostering a robust partner ecosystem, we are accelerating the deployment of big data solutions, making it easier for companies of all sizes to obtain clear business value from data.”
Customer Momentum
Together, Cloudera and Intel have created a faster path for enterprises across the financial services, telecommunications, healthcare, retail and technology industries to better manage data, derive insights faster and deliver transformative business outcomes.

Caesars Entertainment: A casino-entertainment company that uses data to improve the customer experience across its establishments, Caesars has implemented a new Hadoop environment using the Cloudera distribution running on the Intel Xeon processor E5 family, with Intel® Ethernet Converged Network Adapters. The solution helped Caesars reduce processing time for key jobs from six hours to 45 minutes and expand their data analysis to include both unstructured and semi-structured data. Now Caesars can run faster and more accurate analysis to gain maximum value from all of its data sources. Caesars is using the insight to improve customer segmentation for more effective marketing campaigns and to improve security for meeting Payment Card Industry (PCI) and other standards.
Cerner Corporation: A global leader in health care technology, Cerner has built a comprehensive view of the health of populations on an enterprise data hub (EDH) powered by Cloudera’s distribution, including Apache Hadoop running on Intel Xeon processor-based servers. The EDH securely brings together data from a vast number of sources to build a more complete picture of a person’s health and predict potential risks with better efficacy. For example, Cloudera solutions are designed to help Cerner systems determine the likelihood that a person has a potentially fatal bloodstream infection with much greater accuracy than what was previously possible.
eHarmony: A relationship-minded online dating site which delivers new matches to millions of people every day, eHarmony recently upgraded its robust cloud environment to use the Intel Xeon processor E5 family and Cloudera’s distribution, including Apache Hadoop to analyze a tremendous volume and variety of data. The cloud environment accommodates more complex analyses to create more personalized results and improve the chances of relationship success.
MasterCard: MasterCard is the first company to implement Cloudera’s distribution, including Apache Hadoop since the distribution received full Payment Card Industry (PCI) certification. By implementing the certified version of Cloudera’s distribution on Intel-based servers, MasterCard is able to integrate Hadoop data sets with other environments that are already PCI-certified.
