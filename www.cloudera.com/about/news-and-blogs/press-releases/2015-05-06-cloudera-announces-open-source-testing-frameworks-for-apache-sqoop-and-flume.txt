Cloudera Announces Open Source Compatibility Testing Frameworks for Apache Sqoop and Apache Flume






 









Open Source Initiative Will Accelerate Data Flow Into Hadoop to Enable Future Discoveries
PALO ALTO, Calif., – May 6, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced it is leading an initiative to create open source API compatibility testing frameworks for accelerating the adoption of Apache Sqoop and Apache Flume. The initiative will take the form of new Apache sub-projects for compatibility and are free and open to anyone–vendors, users, or contributors–with an interest in seeing open, multi-vendor standards even more widely adopted, to enable more next-generation, analytic workloads.
“Today, developers who build applications that include Apache Sqoop and Apache Flume don’t have access to open source tools for validating compatibility of their implementations. This introduces risk, cost, and time into application development,” said Mike Olson, chief strategy officer of Cloudera. “Our intent for these testing frameworks is to streamline the process of building next-generation products and apps for ingesting and analyzing data, and to assure the market that any product that correctly passes these tests is compatible with the releases from the Apache Software Foundation.”
As the market share leader in enterprise Hadoop, and regarded by many industry experts as the benchmark for Hadoop adoption and commercial success, Cloudera is proud to contribute to advances in the open source community and to working with the Apache Software Foundation to seek even more elegant and impactful ways to foster the Hadoop ecosystem. The API compatibility testing framework initiative reflects Cloudera’s commitment to accelerating the adoption of open source standards upon which the big data platforms of tomorrow are being built today.
Data analysis is only half the battle; getting the data into a Hadoop cluster is the first step in any big data deployment. Apache Flume and Apache Sqoop are key in the movement of massive data.
Apache Sqoop has demonstrated value for efficiently transferring bulk data between Hadoop and structured data stores, such as relational databases. As companies look to tap into all of their data assets, for example to obtain a 360-degree customer view, they must do so quickly and efficiently in order to get real-time, meaningful insights to dramatically impact and influence future customer engagement.
Apache Flume has proven very effective for collecting, aggregating, and moving large volumes of streaming event data into Hadoop clusters. However, as data volumes grow from machine-generated data and streamed in from IoT devices connecting at infrastructure endpoints, the rapid ability to move that data becomes more critical and time sensitive. The ability to put in place open source standards for data collection, data flow, and aggregating data stores now makes future discoveries possible.
