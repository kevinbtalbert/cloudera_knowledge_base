Cloudera-Powered Meridian™ Platform Advances PCTEL’s Data Analytics Capability






 









Streamlines Operational Analytics for Network Data History
PALO ALTO, Calif., - May 14, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that PCTEL, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCTI), a leader in performance critical telecommunications solutions, selected Cloudera as its platform provider. The new platform will deliver next generation network analytics solutions to the telecommunications sector. The implementation of a Cloudera enterprise data hub will enable PCTEL to scale its monitoring, testing, engineering, optimization, and commissioning solutions. The Hadoop-based platform will accelerate the acquisition of data-based analytic insights and associated network performance recommendations.
Cloudera's active involvement and influence within the Hadoop ecosystem, demonstrated support capabilities, and product roadmap were key factors in PCTEL's selection of the Cloudera platform. The implementation of Cloudera Enterprise, utilizing components including Apache Spark, Cloudera Navigator, and Impala will provide PCTEL with a data discovery and analytics environment. The new architecture extends PCTEL's Meridian capability to support historical investigations of performance trends.
"Running Impala and Spark on our Cloudera enterprise data hub has improved the way we interact with and manage the hundreds of millions of pieces of data we receive rapid-fire from thousands of cell sites," said John Thakkar, vice president and chief technology officer of Network Analytics at PCTEL. "We can now see the full scope of our customers' data and gain deeper insights, allowing us to provide more customized 4G LTE wireless optimization products and services, and pave the way for 5G."
"The telecommunications industry is in the midst of an evolution, whereby multiple lines of business and mission-critical applications are adopting enterprise data hubs powered by Hadoop to accommodate massive volumes of data in motion from the web, sensors, and mobile devices," said Amy O'Connor, big data evangelist and telecommunications subject matter expert at Cloudera. "We are proud to support PCTEL on its journey to change the way wireless networks are designed, deployed, and managed, providing an enterprise data hub that streamlines data collection, storage, processing, and exploration in a unified environment."
