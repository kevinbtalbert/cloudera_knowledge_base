Tata Sky Selects Cloudera to Gain Deeper Insights from Customer Data






 









Enterprise Data Hub Facilitates Customer Analysis at Unprecedented Scale and Flexibility for Indian Media and Communications Leader
CHENNAI, India – May 21, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that Tata Sky has selected Cloudera to support its big data initiative – to gain deeper customer insights from data gathered on subscribers across the country. Tata Sky is a joint venture between Tata Sons and 21st Century Fox and is one of the largest & leading satellite television providers in India. Cloudera will provide Tata Sky with an enterprise data hub (EDH) to process and scale its analysis of customer data.
Tata Sky has revolutionized Indian home entertainment by empowering television viewers with choice, control, and convenience through a wide array of programming choices and interactive features. Tata Sky will use its Cloudera enterprise data hub to better understand the viewing habits of customers and to create opportunities that enhance and change the viewer’s experience.
“Tata Sky being the fastest growing direct-to-home (DTH) providers in India today, needs an infrastructure that will help us scale our data collection, processing, and analysis efforts so we can continue improving the customer experience,” said Ravishankar N, Chief Information Officer at Tata Sky. “Implementing an enterprise data hub from Cloudera will allow us to capitalize on the data we collect and cement our position as India’s preferred DTH provider.”
“This significant customer win demonstrates our growing traction in India, while further cementing Cloudera’s platform as the platform of choice for communications providers looking to gain a 360-degree view of their businesses  in order to further improve customer satisfaction and drive profit maximization,” said Amy O’Connor, big data evangelist and telecommunications subject matter expert at Cloudera. “We’re excited to see the business impacts that Tata Sky will realize from using Cloudera’s platform and the new avenues that the company will explore with our technology.”
