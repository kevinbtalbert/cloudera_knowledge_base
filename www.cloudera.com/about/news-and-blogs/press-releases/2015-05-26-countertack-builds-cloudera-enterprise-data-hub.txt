CounterTack Builds Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub to Improve Real-Time  Security Incident Response Against the Growing Magnitude of Cyber Threats






 









Decreases Attacker ‘Dwell Time’ from 240 Days on Average to Just Minutes
 to Detect, Analyze and Remediate
PALO ALTO, Calif., – May 26, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that CounterTack has selected Cloudera to build out its enterprise data hub to help protect organizations from cyber criminals, specifically those that attempt to stage attacks on unsuspecting users on corporate endpoints across enterprise networks.
CounterTack’s Sentinel is an enterprise-class, on-premise, big data endpoint detection and response platform (EDR). Cloudera Enterprise gives it the ability to support enterprise deployments of over 100,000 endpoints, while effectively analyzing system-level information across distributed, heterogeneous computing environments with real-time processing in minutes versus up to 240 days—the current industry standard for how long attackers typically dwell in enterprise systems undetected before an effective response can be executed.
CounterTack analyzes information collected from devices including workstations, laptops, servers and mobile devices throughout an enterprise to identify patterns or anomalies that might be associated with malicious behavior. As the number of devices touching and connecting to a corporate network grows, fueled in large part by the Internet of Things (IoT), the ability to monitor and protect corporate assets from new or previously unseen security threats becomes even more imperative. To effectively counter new threats, companies must be able to detect, analyze, and respond to malicious code injection, purpose-built malware and non-malware behaviors that may be associated with unsuspecting users’ devices at the network endpoint.
“As the volume and sophistication of endpoint attacks are expanding exponentially it is critical for organizations to implement a secure endpoint threat detection and response platform that is combined with reliable advanced analytics,” said Eddie Garcia, chief security architect, Cloudera. “By integrating with Cloudera Enterprise, CounterTack’s platform is taking advantage of crucial, high-performance, real-time analysis in demanding enterprise environments while also gleaning important insights to help protect its customers from malicious attacks. We are thrilled that CounterTack chose Cloudera as its trusted partner.”
Big data technology gives CounterTack the ability to scale and properly service large corporate customers was essential for CounterTack to meet the demand of enterprise security teams. Limitations of scale from other point solutions led the company to adopt Cloudera’s enterprise data hub infrastructure in order to provide near real-time analysis in the most demanding environments where every minute counts. The company chose Cloudera based on its industry-leading Hadoop distribution expertise, ease of management through Cloudera Manager, and production-ready capabilities including leading performance, compliance-ready security and governance. CounterTack has successfully utilized Cloudera to create a massively scalable system that has the ability to collect and analyze endpoint data to provide security teams with pertinent information to identify and mitigate threats.
“The Cloudera Enterprise ecosystem immediately solved our ability to effectively scale our business, and allowed us to innovate much faster, focus on our core strengths, and ensure that our customers’ data is governed and secure,” said Mike Davis, chief technology officer, CounterTack. “On a consistent basis, we run across enthusiastic Cloudera customers during our own sales activities. Having Cloudera Enterprise at the core of our offering has proven to be a big plus in the eyes of our prospects. There is an overlap of interest in utilizing the data we capture in their own operations as well. When we saw our security-minded customers were already relying on Cloudera, it gave us the flexibility to focus on our domain expertise which is detecting unknown threats in the enterprise.”
Cloudera Enterprise is a fully supported enterprise-ready distribution of the open source Hadoop platform and is the most widely deployed Hadoop distribution on the market today.
