Google Compute Lead Daniel Sturman Joins Cloudera as Vice President of Engineering






 









Appointed to direct development efforts at Hadoop Market Leader Cloudera,   including their work to accelerate hybrid cloud adoption and deepen industry solutions with partners
PALO ALTO, Calif., June 8, 2015 - Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced Daniel Sturman’s appointment as Vice President, Engineering. A key engineering leader for some of the world’s biggest and “baddest” computer systems, Daniel Sturman moves over from Google to join Cloudera’s senior executive team to lead all development within the company, with the Apache Software community, and with Cloudera’s 1600+ global partners.
Prior to joining Cloudera, Daniel spent the past eight years at Google where he ensured that the underlying compute infrastructure for all Google workloads was reliable, predictable, and efficient both on-premise and in the cloud. As vice president, Engineering, Daniel’s responsibility for Google’s Cloud Platform products, including Google Compute Engine, Google App Engine, Kubernetes and Google Container Engine, helped propel the company into the cloud industry.  
Before Google, Daniel headed all new development for IBM’s DB2 relational database products and identified key emerging technology trends in IBM’s Software Group. His experience in addressing the demanding database requirements of the world’s largest enterprises will help Cloudera continue to provide the highest quality solutions and services for any enterprise seeking to advance their business through big data.
“Daniel brings to Cloudera an ideal blend of database and distributed compute platform experience,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer, Cloudera. “The original design concepts for Apache Hadoop and many of the ensuing innovative analytic projects originate from Google. We are excited to have a Google technology leader who understands modern architectures and the art of turning data into insight take our platform to the next level. His background leading teams in running one of the world’s largest fleets of computers, his understanding of open source, distributed computing, and cloud platforms, coupled with his successful track record of delivering enterprise grade software will bring immense value to Cloudera as we continue our high growth, and deploy transformative big data applications in both traditional enterprises and the cloud.”
“We’re standing on the brink of something incredible in how the world extracts value from data.  To fill a role that is of unique importance to a market leader for such a transformation, such as, Cloudera, is something I’ve always imagined I would do,” said Daniel Sturman. “I am extremely excited to work with Cloudera’s amazing team of creative engineers, with the global community of open source developers working on the Apache Hadoop project, and with Cloudera’s strong partners.   Cloudera is rapidly growing into an influential technology leader across the globe with solutions that enable entire industries to shift towards data-driven decision making and an enviable ecosystem of partners, including Intel, that are helping companies and governments deploy enterprise data hubs where and how they need to. I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with the company’s talented engineers, especially on high value business solutions, and contribute to a thriving open source community.”
