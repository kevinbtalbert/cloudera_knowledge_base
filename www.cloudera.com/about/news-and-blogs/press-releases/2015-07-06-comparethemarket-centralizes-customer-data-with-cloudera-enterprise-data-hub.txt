comparethemarket.com Centralizes Customer Data with a Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub






 









Hadoop Software Boosts CRM Functionality and Keeps Customers More Regularly Engaged
LONDON, United Kingdom – July 6, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that comparethemarket.com, one of the UK’s leading price comparison websites, is using an enterprise data hub (EDH) to derive more value from its customer data. “When we started evaluating big data technologies, one of our key goals was to create a more personalised user experience to help make comparethemarket.com the site that customers would want to return to time and time again,” said James Lomas, IT Director, comparethemarket.com.
Since launching in 2006, comparethemarket.com has grown into one of the most recognised household names in the UK, supporting comparisons across some 28 products. Through the introduction of its “Your Account” functionality, comparethemarket.com has made it possible for customers to get a great deal in a couple of clicks or taps.
“We want to make it really easy for people to save time and money across: car, travel, home, life insurance and their energy bills, and data is key in achieving this,” said Lomas.
“How to get all the disparate data into one manageable location and then gain value from the data are two very common problems,” commented Lomas, “We also wanted to radically speed up the time in which we could translate our learnings into benefits for our customers.”
After a period of due diligence and evaluations of the leading commercial Hadoop providers, it was decided that Cloudera was best suited to meet comparethemarket.com’s big data requirements due to two key factors:

Technically, with its EDH offering, Cloudera provides an enterprise-ready suite of tools that would efficiently and effectively help comparethemarket.com build a centralized data management platform.
Culturally, Cloudera was a strong fit, through its dedication to open standards, leadership of the open source community, and experience helping enterprises succeed with Hadoop.

“With a Cloudera enterprise data hub, comparethemarket.com can now analyse and use the vast amounts of data it creates across all channels to deliver a comprehensive customer view across multiple channels in near real time,” said Doug Cutting, chief architect at Cloudera. “This translates to a more immersive, relevant, and engaging experience than ever before for its customers -- which results in more repeat visits and increased customer loyalty.”
CDH clusters were installed in June 2014 and have been running Cloudera Manager for the last 10 months. Since then, Hadoop has become an integral part of the ongoing business strategy and key projects run by comparethemarket.com.
