The Fastest and Easiest Way to Get Started with Apache Hadoop
Integrated Partner Tutorials with Tableau and Zoomdata Allow Users to Test and Extend the Full Platform in an AWS Environment
PALO ALTO, Calif., – July 23, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced Cloudera Live, the fastest way to try Hadoop, is available on Amazon Web Services (AWS), including integrated tutorials from some of the leading data analytic tool providers – Tableau and Zoomdata.
Cloudera Live allows organizations to quickly start testing Hadoop and Cloudera Enterprise in a multi-node, cloud environment with pre-loaded data and tutorials and optional partner deployments. Using interactive demos and tutorials, users can learn the basics of Hadoop, experiment with the full production-ready capabilities of Cloudera Enterprise, and test familiar third-party tools. Users will now have a choice between deploying Cloudera Live with AWS or, as previously available, GoGrid.
With many enterprises looking to implement with Hadoop and even more users looking to learn it, an easy-to-deploy testing environment is critical to quickly learn new skills and test the capabilities of the platform and ecosystem integrations.
“Learning the basics of Hadoop is key to getting more value from your data, faster. By giving users choices about how and where to deploy Cloudera Live’s testing environment, they can explore and experiment using the partner tools they already use today, for an accelerated path to success,” said Charles Zedlewski, vice president, Products, Cloudera. “Cloudera Live provides a hands-on Hadoop experience that guides users on how to quickly gain value from Cloudera Enterprise.”
Cloudera has tapped its extensive partner ecosystem to extend the capabilities of Hadoop and Cloudera Enterprise through popular visual data analytics and data integration offerings – Tableau and Zoomdata. These solutions offer powerful visualizations for data wrangling and analytics - opening up the platform and data to more users for greater enterprise value. The ability to test these integrations can help to ensure a seamless transition from trial to production.
