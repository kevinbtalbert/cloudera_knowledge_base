Cloudera Becomes an EMC Select Partner, Advancing Hadoop in Enterprise Environments and Bringing the Enterprise Data Hub to EMC Data Lake Customers






 









Cloudera Enterprise with EMC Isilon Enables Customers to Quickly Implement an In-Place Data Analytics Approach Without Incurring Additional Operational Costs
PALO ALTO, Calif., – July 30, 2015  Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that Cloudera has joined EMC Technology Connect, EMC’s business partner validated products program, as a Select partner. Customers can now license Cloudera Enterprise, the leading distribution of Apache Hadoop, directly from EMC and their reseller partners globally—giving them a direct path to quickly implement an in-place data analytics approach and avoid the time-consuming replication of data across separate silos, all with enterprise-grade Hadoop capabilities available with Cloudera Enterprise.
“While most companies begin using Hadoop to capture and transform data from a multitude of sources, its scope and mission have rapidly expanded to be a power-house for analytic workloads,” said Sam Grocott, senior vice president of marketing, Emerging Technologies Division, EMC Corporation. “Thousands of EMC® Isilon® customers already have a data lake. Now with the jointly certified Cloudera-on-Isilon solution they have an engine to do even more complex data analysis. With Cloudera’s distribution for Hadoop, we’re giving customers a reliable foundation for critical business processes, that delivers a key foundational element of EMC’s Big Data strategy.”
In just a few short years Hadoop’s scope and mission have rapidly expanded. Customers no longer view Hadoop just as inexpensive storage that supports a massively parallel batch-processing framework, but as a foundation for critical business processing and sophisticated real-time analytics on an enterprise-wide basis. With certification and support of Impala, organizations can query data files that reside directly on Isilon storage to generate business insight. Financial services companies, for example, build critical risk models with Hadoop; healthcare companies rely on Hadoop to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care; and consumer companies rely on Hadoop to power applications woven into everyday lives.
As big data technologies evolve to address these real-time analytic requirements, customers expect more secure, performant platforms that seamlessly integrate data from all aspects of their enterprise to deliver new insights. The computing foundation that supports Cloudera’s enterprise data hub and EMC Isilon’s Big Data shared storage is comprised of technology created by Intel. Together Intel, Cloudera, and EMC bring to the market an enterprise focused Hadoop solution with technologies like accelerated Erasure Coding, which ensure data integrity and availability. As a result customers are provided a reliable, scalable, and efficient solution that enables them to adopt new big data workloads in the enterprise with confidence.  
“Enterprise customers value trusted platforms that more securely and efficiently manage their big data infrastructure,” said Ron Kasabian, vice president, Data Center Group and general manager, Big Data Solutions at Intel Corporation. “Intel’s collaboration with EMC and Cloudera means organizations benefit from the data protection capabilities Isilon provides through multiple technologies. These include Intel® Storage Acceleration Libraries utilized by EMC, extends to the security and governance that comes from Cloudera Enterprise, and is anchored by Intel's pervasive encryption capabilities.”
Cloudera’s enterprise data hub has been squarely focused on providing  maturity through security with end-to-end encryption, advanced and granular access controls, manageability via deployment, monitoring, diagnostics, backup and replication, and governance. By extending the capability to resell the Cloudera Enterprise solution through the EMC sales ecosystem, more value is delivered to customers.
"This extended collaboration with EMC opens up tremendous new analytic capabilities for Isilon customers," said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development of Cloudera. “The leading storage solution providers, such as EMC, are increasingly active within the Hadoop community, working to bring the power of Hadoop analytics to their non-HDFS data lake customers. With EMC’s sales force now officially re-selling Cloudera, we are in the best position to further help customers preserve the value of their investments."
The Cloudera and EMC offering is jointly certified and supported.
