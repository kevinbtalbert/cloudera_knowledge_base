Cloudera Becomes Founding Member of Lockheed Martin Healthcare Technology Alliance






 









Alliance Brings Together Leaders from Healthcare, Medical Technology and Academia to Advance Public Health
PALO ALTO, Calif., – August 3, 2015 - Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced it has joined a new healthcare technology alliance formed by Lockheed Martin. This alliance seeks to combine the expertise of leading health IT providers, medical technology companies, and academic institutions to advance public health. The members of the Lockheed Martin Healthcare Technology Alliance will collaborate on technology solutions that help improve care in rapidly evolving and growing areas of health technology, such as those that: 
●      Secure patient medical information;
●      Leverage advances in genomic research; and
●      Apply big data solutions to improve public health.
Other founding members include: Cisco, Illumina, Intel and Montgomery College. 
“As big data technologies evolve to address real-time analytic requirements, healthcare customers expect more secure, performant platforms that seamlessly integrate data from all aspects of their enterprise to deliver new insights,” said Mercedes Westcott, vice president of public sector for Cloudera. “Healthcare companies already rely on Hadoop to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care. Becoming part of this alliance allows Cloudera to collaborate on innovative big data approaches to a myriad of health issues.”
Through partnerships among industry, academia and government, the Lockheed Martin Healthcare Technology Alliance can capture the emerging technologies in big data analytics, telehealth, genomics and data security that will revolutionize the way the healthcare industry securely computes, catalogs and stores data to provide patients with better access to care. By investing in and demonstrating these capabilities’ proof of concepts, the Alliance will enable the rapid implementation of secure solutions for healthcare customers.
“Federal health IT is a dynamic and growing sector,” said Horace Blackman, vice president of Health & Life Sciences at Lockheed Martin. “Through collaboration between health IT industry and academic partners, this team will develop and refine technologies that will help guide decisions for care, diagnosis and treatment of disease while protecting critical health information.”
