Cloudera Recognized in Two Categories by 2015 DBTA Readers' Choice Awards






 









Named Best Hadoop Solution and Best Big Data Solution byDatabase Trends and Applications Readers
PALO ALTO, Calif., August 5, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced it has been named Best Hadoop Solution and Best Big Data Solution by Database Trends and Applications magazine 2015 Readers’ Choice Awards, for the second year in a row. Database Trends and Applications’ readership of more than 100,000 data professionals cast their votes across more than 29 categories, selecting the nominees and winners. As organizations become increasingly data-driven, new methods for working with data are critical to business growth. Cloudera’s enterprise data hub (EDH) solution offers the combination of a scalable and cost-effective platform for managing any type or amount of data, for as long as needed, joined with the benefits of expert support, robust security, governance, data protection and management that enterprises require. The Cloudera platform includes the leading open source analytic tools including Impala and Apache Spark, simple administration from Cloudera Manager, and compliance-ready security and governance through Cloudera Navigator.
"It is an honor to be recognized by DBTA readers as the best Hadoop solution and the best big data solution. That readership understands the evolving database market and knows the vendors and products that enterprise users depend upon," said Mike Olson, founder and chief strategy officer, Cloudera. "The maturing market for big data means that solutions, including applications and services, are driving new opportunities for Cloudera and others. Our extensive partner network -- now more than 1,700 companies strong -- allow us to deliver those solutions. Being singled out as best-in-class by DBTA readers confirms that our ecosystem and partner strategy is the right one."
With a focus on open source innovation, Cloudera continues to lead the industry in contribution to the Hadoop ecosystem. Cloudera is committed to closing the "big data skills gap," training more than 40,000 Hadoop professionals worldwide to maximize value from their data. Recently, Cloudera announced new initiatives to enable data scientists to take advantage of big data and Hadoop, such as advancing data analysis on a 100% Python stack (Ibis) and hosting a new conference (Wrangle) focused exclusively on real-world applications of data science.
