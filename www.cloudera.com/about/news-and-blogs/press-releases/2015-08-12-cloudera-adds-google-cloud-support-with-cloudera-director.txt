Cloudera Adds Google Cloud Platform Support with Release of Cloudera Director 1.5






 















Cloudera Director 1.5 Eases Multi-Cloud Deployments for Hadoop
PALO ALTO, Calif., – August 12, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced the release of Cloudera Director 1.5, the integrated solution for deploying and managing enterprise-grade Hadoop in cloud environments. This latest release enables deployment flexibility by providing users the choice of preferred cloud environment. This is made possible through an open API for cloud integrations, with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) being the first to integrate with the API. The release also continues to add production-grade features to the solution, especially around security and availability.
As part of this release, Google developed GCP integration with Cloudera Director, allowing GCP customers to easily get started with Cloudera’s Hadoop-based platform. Cloudera Director 1.5 also supports Amazon Web Services (AWS), and the open source plugin framework enables users to integrate with other cloud vendors of choice. The AWS and GCP integrations have been open sourced by Cloudera and Google respectively, can be used as reference guides and also welcome extensions and improvements. Both are available on Github.
In addition to adding multi-cloud flexibility, Cloudera Director 1.5 has continued to improve its production-grade features, including enabling high availability for clusters and Kerberos integration for security. The user interface has also been updated to make it more powerful for managing advanced use cases.
"Often, when organizations move to cloud environments, they are forced to make tradeoffs around flexibility and a mature, production-ready Hadoop platform. With Cloudera, and products like Cloudera Director, customers get the best of both," said Charles Zedlewski, vice president, Products, Cloudera. "Whether they need to run on-premises, in the cloud, or a hybrid environment, Cloudera ensures that they have the same reliable experience, with all the necessary features for even the most critical production workloads. We are thrilled to add Google Cloud Platform as a deployment option for our users, giving them direct access to the cutting edge datacenter design of Google Compute."
Originally released in October 2014, Cloudera Director features an intuitive interface for users to easily take advantage of cloud elasticity - with the ability to spin up, spin down, and scale clusters - as well as provide reliable management and monitoring of deployments.
With Cloudera Director, users get the full enterprise-grade capabilities available with Cloudera Enterprise, including compliance-ready security, comprehensive data management and governance, and easy administration of their cluster and environment of choice. The Hadoop-based platform also includes the most powerful analytic tools, including Apache Spark and Impala, for the fastest time-to-value. Cloudera Director is currently used in production by many large-scale customers across a variety of industries.
