BT Calls on Cloudera to Accelerate Data Velocity and Fast-track New Customer Offerings






 









Employs Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub and Hadoop to Expedite Processing of Data Volumes
LONDON, United Kingdom – 20 August, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that British Telecom (BT), one of the largest telecommunications providers in the world, has implemented a Cloudera-powered enterprise data hub (EDH) to accelerate date velocity and bring more value to its customers.
In its legacy environment, BT’s business customer records were spread across multiple databases, which needed to be reconciled and updated every day in order to provide business units with the most relevant and up-to-date information about customers. By bringing its data management into multi-tenant production environments within Hadoop, BT is now able to have a unified view of its customers and significantly reduce data processing timeframes.
In just one year of working with Cloudera, BT has been able to process five times more customer data and achieve a velocity increase of a factor of 15. According to Phillip Radley, chief data architect at BT, “The data cycle now takes eight hours instead of 24, and we process five times the amount of data.”
Moreover, BT has been able to achieve an ROI between 200 and 250 percent from its Hadoop implementation. Now that the enterprise data hub is implemented, BT can undertake new projects quickly and at a much lower incremental cost.
Radley said, “We worked with Cloudera and went from PowerPoint to production in nine months, which is pretty good by our standards! This sets a new precedent and allows us to bring exciting new offerings to our customers, faster than we could before. We were able to save time and money on head hunting for Hadoop experts by training the skilled teams we already had. The Cloudera University training course was not only high quality, but the trainers were able to understand what we were trying to accomplish and helped ramp up the team quickly.”
“It’s amazing that BT accomplished what they have without needing to hire additional Hadoop experts; with some fairly limited professional services and training, we upskilled their Linux admins and helped them quickly become operational. We’re excited to take on future projects with BT,” said Amy O’Connor, big data evangelist and telecommunications subject matter expert at Cloudera.
BT has been utilizing the Cloudera enterprise data hub in its efforts to improve the roll out and performance of superfast broadband coverage in the UK. Consolidating DSL performance data with copper network test data has allowed the company to more accurately predict when dispatching an engineer to diagnose the access network will be effective. This saves significant numbers of wasted engineer visits and improves the overall customer experience.
Reaching almost £18 billion in revenue last year, BT is one of the largest telecommunications providers in the world, serving more than 18 million consumers and nearly three million businesses in the UK.
