Press Release
Leaders in Data Governance and Management Join Cloudera to Provide a Unified Foundation for Open Metadata and End-to-End Visibility for Governance



 









Cloudera Navigator, the Leading Hadoop Governance Solution, Joins Impala and Apache Spark as Part of the Cloudera Accelerator Program
PALO ALTO, Calif., – August 27, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced that Cloudera Navigator has joined the Cloudera Accelerator Program, a partner program designed to expedite the development and certification of partner applications on pervasive Hadoop technologies. Cloudera Navigator, the most popular data management and governance solution for Hadoop, has become the de facto standard in the industry for partners and users alike. This collaboration between leading data management and governance providers will ensure seamless interoperability and provide a unified foundation for enterprise-wide governance and data management.
As the industry’s first and only fully-integrated data management and governance solution for Hadoop, Cloudera Navigator makes it easy to automatically discover, manage, protect, and govern even the largest and most sophisticated Hadoop deployments. Over 200 customers across numerous industries, including Caesars Entertainment Corporation, Early Warning, Marks and Spencer, Monsanto, PRGX, Symphony Health, and Western Union, rely on Cloudera Navigator to manage and govern their data in order to effortlessly meet the most stringent governance and compliance standards.
“Governance and data management were critical requirements for our big data strategy, especially to adhere to regulatory requirements. When evaluating Hadoop platforms, Cloudera Navigator stood out as a mature and usable solution to give us the insight and visibility into data that we required,” said Rizwan Patel, director of big data, service-oriented architecture (SOA), and capacity planning at Caesars Entertainment. “Cloudera Enterprise allows us to run faster and more accurate analytics across all of our data easily, and Cloudera Navigator lets us easily understand our data, how it’s being used, and how it’s changing -- while also providing the auditing and lineage necessary for meeting industry standards.”
“When it comes to analyzing structured and unstructured data to identify and recover overpayments and to bring data analytics to our clients, we need to process, model, and present large amounts of data very quickly, while also ensuring the accuracy and reliability of results,” said Tushar Sachdev, CIO and senior vice president, PRGX. “Cloudera Navigator makes that possible. When our team identified a data delivery issue and we needed to track down the problem, Cloudera Navigator allowed us to trace the issue back to the source data set from the client in a matter of hours as opposed to weeks. It was amazing.”  
Cloudera Navigator, as part of Cloudera Enterprise, provides the only comprehensive data governance solution for Hadoop -- with full audit history to track all access attempts; intuitive data lineage to quickly verify and validate data origins; and consolidated metadata for consistent, unified data access and discovery. In addition, as the only Hadoop distribution to have achieved Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, Cloudera Navigator plays a critical role in helping organizations easily comply with industry regulatory requirements.
With the addition of Cloudera Navigator to the Cloudera Accelerator Program, Cloudera is collaborating with industry-leading data management and governance solution providers to bridge the gap between Hadoop and other enterprise systems -- by ensuring seamless interoperability of metadata, lineage, and audit activity across the robust ecosystem. Leading data management and analytics companies including Adaptive, Cask, Cisco, Collibra, Data Advantage Group, Dataguise, Dell, HP, Informatica, SAS, Syncsort, Talend, Trifacta, and Waterline Data have joined the Accelerator Program to certify their technologies with Cloudera Navigator. Moreover, members of the Accelerator Program will work with Cloudera to drive community innovations that ensure all metadata across the ecosystem is automatically shared, exchanged, and interoperable. (Learn more: visit the quote sheet.)
“As data is constantly changing, it is imperative to see what is happening, both in the past and present, across all applications” said Tim Stevens, vice president of business and corporate development, Cloudera. “By collaborating closely with a growing ecosystem of technology partners, Cloudera makes sure that customer stakeholders have one consistent, accurate view of the entire data lifecycle, ensuring critical compliance practices are being met.”
The Cloudera Accelerator Program, launched in Fall 2014, ensures customers always have access to the top production-ready applications built on the most powerful, popular tools in Hadoop. To date, the Cloudera Accelerator Program includes 40 partners that are already building out applications on Impala and Apache Spark, bringing to market technology advances that benefit customers across a vast number of industries. Now as part of the Cloudera Accelerator Program, partners can integrate and validate their work with Cloudera Navigator and Cloudera Enterprise.
In addition to certifications through the Cloudera Accelerator Program, these leaders in data management, together with Cloudera, are working to bring unified and standardized metadata across the entire business for complete visibility. With a goal of complete and open interoperability across all facets of data management, this group is developing further innovations between Cloudera Navigator and other popular tools for full, community-driven data management and governance -- allowing end users to take full advantage of big data as it flows and changes, automatically and while effortlessly meeting regulatory requirements.
