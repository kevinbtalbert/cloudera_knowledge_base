Cloudera Launches New Expanded Center for Security Excellence; Department of Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Michael McCaul to Keynote







 









Facility Demonstrates Company’s Commitments to Strengthening Hadoop and Data Security, Driving Industry-Wide Cybersecurity Capabilities and Furthering Technology Sector Growth in Austin
PALO ALTO, Calif., and AUSTIN, TX. — September 21, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, announced today that it is opening a new and expanded Center for Security Excellence. U.S. Representative Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the Congressional Committee on Homeland Security, will deliver the keynote alongside Cloudera CEO, Tom Reilly during the opening of the new Cloudera Center for Security Excellence offices in Austin, Texas. The facility, developed as part of Cloudera’s acquisition of Gazzang in June 2014, is the seat of Cloudera’s cybersecurity initiatives. It provides customers and organizations considering investments in Hadoop architectures and related technologies with a deep understanding of how to implement effective security and compliance across their big data environments as well as how to use big data technologies to protect their organizations from internal and external threats.
As part of his keynote, chairman, Rep. McCaul will discuss the importance of private- and public-sector cybersecurity cooperation and the vital role technology growth plays in today’s economy. His top priorities include securing the border, preventing terrorist attacks, and fighting cybercrime in order to fulfill the committee’s mission to protect the Homeland. "Public and private collaboration is needed in today’s cyber landscape to protect our IT infrastructure and most valuable data against foreign and domestic attacks," said Rep. McCaul. "The opening of this center comes at a crucial moment in our nation’s sprint to improve cybersecurity; one that will ultimately be defined by how well we respond to the threats we face on a daily basis."
The Center also further establishes Austin as one of the fastest growing technology hubs, expands Cloudera’s presence in the region, and brings a significant number of technology jobs to the city. In addition to improving security for the industry overall, the facility will remain the driving force behind:

Comprehensive data and cluster security technologies - including "follow the data" authorization and encryption policies riding on Cloudera’s data lineage tracking capabilities.
Security testing and certification - including continuous vulnerability assessment, performance optimization, and developing regulatory compliance playbooks.
Security ecosystem partner enablement - developing security integration APIs and certifying partner products.

"Cloudera has been fully committed to security since its beginnings, and we have always fulfilled on our promise to deliver technology our customers can use with the utmost assurance," said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer, Cloudera. "This grand opening is another milestone in the advancement of security for big data and represents our always-expanding business presence across the nation."
Agenda for the Grand Opening of Cloudera Center of Security Excellence:

1-1:15 PM CT — Facility Tours
1:20-1:25 PM CT – Cloudera CEO Tom Reilly to Introduce Rep. McCaul
1:25-1:40 PM CT – Rep. McCaul keynote
1:45 PM CT – Ribbon Cutting Ceremony

Media interested in attending should arrive at the center, 515 Congress, Suite 1212, Austin, Texas, 78701, by 12:30 PM CT and check in with event staff.
