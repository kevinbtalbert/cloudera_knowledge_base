Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub Edition Provides Enterprise-Ready Hadoop for the Microsoft Azure Marketplace







 









Microsoft Azure Customers Can Now Quickly and Easily Deploy the Most Popular Hadoop Platform
PALO ALTO, Calif., September 24, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced  that Microsoft Azure customers can now deploy Cloudera Enterprise, Data Hub Edition in the Azure Marketplace. Azure customers will have access to the full breadth and scope of Cloudera’s enterprise Hadoop offering, which includes core Hadoop components for unified storage and parallel processing and premium offerings for data discovery and advanced analytics that serve a variety of use cases. Cloudera Enterprise, Data Hub Edition integrates with the Azure suite of BI tools including Microsoft Power BI so business analysts can discover, analyze, visualize, and model data in ways that yield unprecedented benefits. Prior to today’s announcement, Cloudera Enterprise, Basic Edition and CDH, the world’s most widely used distribution of Apache Hadoop, had been the only Cloudera solutions available in the Azure Marketplace.
The proliferation of connected and instrumented devices, coupled with demand for scalable storage and compute, is driving data into the cloud at an unprecedented rate. This requires an architecture that enables companies to capture, process, discover, and serve data to analysts in real time. By deploying on an enterprise cloud environment like Azure, customers can dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes to purchase, rack, and configure the hardware necessary to run a Hadoop cluster.
"Since our initial alliance announcement with Microsoft in October 2014, we have focused on product usability and scalability for enterprise-size deployments on Azure," said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development, Cloudera. "We have a number of customers in manufacturing, transportation, business services and health care already deployed on Azure, which is a testament to the strength of our collaborative sales and go-to-market alignment."
“ESG research shows businesses are increasingly shifting big data workloads to public cloud and hybrid environments, both for the fluidity this offers and to co-locate with cloud-based applications,” said Nik Rouda, senior analyst, ESG. “Cloudera is embracing this movement, now with full functionality of their enterprise Hadoop platform available in Microsoft Azure, and is bringing along all their manageability and security goodness. This will help organizations to host, analyze, and fully leverage their data wherever it lives.”
Cloudera Enterprise customers can run high-performance queries on their Azure data using Impala, Apache Spark, Cloudera Search, and a variety of other frameworks. Impala works with Microsoft Power BI, enabling users to visualize to results of those queries. Now, direct via the Azure Marketplace, customers with a Cloudera Enterprise license can:

Deploy Cloudera Enterprise (Basic, Flex, or EDH Edition) via simple UI
Gain self-service business intelligence from Microsoft Power BI
Import data directly from SQL Server into Cloudera
Quickly scale their Hadoop cluster according to business need

“We are seeing great traction in the Marketplace for Cloudera Enterprise on Azure, with customers running analytics to improve product yields, enhance operational efficiency, and gain deeper customer insights,” said Jason Zander, Corporate Vice President of Azure at Microsoft.  “The amount of data generated in the cloud is skyrocketing and customers are seeing success from myriad mission-critical usage cases driven by the analytic opportunities of the data. This fuels growing demand on Azure for platforms like Cloudera Enterprise.”
Cloudera Enterprise combines the leading distribution of Hadoop (CDH) with cluster-wide systems management and comprehensive data security and governance. In addition, it provides data encryption at multiple points within the cluster, and key management that integrates with enterprise hardware security modules (HSM). While data security and governance enable organizations to store and run analytics against sensitive, production data in the cloud, it’s the discovery and analytics frameworks integrated into Cloudera Enterprise that help companies extract value from their data.
Cloudera Enterprise is available on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace at this link: https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/cloudera.clouderaedh/
