CSC and Cloudera Team to Achieve PCI and HIPAA Certification on Big Data Platform as a Service (BDPaaS) Offering







 









PCI/HIPAA-compliance-ready BDPaaS offering now available
PALO ALTO, Calif., and FALLS CHURCH, Va., September 29, 2015—Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered byApache HadoopTM, today announced that it has partnered with CSC (NYSE: CSC), a global leader in next-generation IT services and solutions, with support from Intel, to achieve the industry’s most stringent security certifications for CSC’s Big Data Platform as a Service (BDPaaS) offering: PCI and HIPAA. With this achievement, BDPaaS becomes the first Hadoop-based managed service to receive PCI and HIPAA certifications.
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is an industry-wide framework for protecting consumer credit card data, and its security compliance standards are generally considered the market’s most stringent. Beyond payment cards, PCI-level security is essential for many industries -- including banking, retail and healthcare -- where strict requirements dictate processes for handling sensitive information such as financial data and personally identifiable information. 
In achieving PCI DSS certification for its BDPaaS offering, CSC becomes the first and only global technology services firm to provide a compliance-ready Hadoop platform as a service. This means Cloudera and CSC are now able to offer a PCI-ready environment for clients looking to host sensitive data within CSC’s fully managed BDPaaS offering, which speeds and simplifies development, testing and deployment of big data applications. 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) ensures that all healthcare-related information conforms to a high standard of data security.  The nature of healthcare data is very sensitive, and requires stringent security to ensure data theft does not occur.  By achieving HIPAA compliance, BDPaaS provides assurance to patients and healthcare providers that the platform is safe for their data, allowing them to focus on their core mission of healthcare.
"Cloudera was critical to our PCI/HIPAA compliant solution,” said Eddie Satterly, chief technology officer for CSC’s Emerging Business Group.  “The unique technologies of Cloudera Navigator, Cloudera Sentry, and other security capabilities essential to the successful audit of the solution."
For its part, Cloudera is “very excited to be bringing the HIPAA/PCI-ready service offering to market,” said Tim Stevens, vice president, Corporate and Business, Cloudera. “CSC has shown its leadership and deep understanding of Cloudera’s technology in reaching this high security bar.  This offering presents an interesting option for those customers who need HIPAA or PCI-level security but would like a managed data platform.”
The PCI DSS and HIPAA-certified solutions are designed using Intel x86 technology with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform within a CSC datacenter.
CompliancePoint served as the third-party evaluator to CSC and Cloudera for PCI and HIPAA compliance, and the Duluth, Georgia-based information security service company will also be available for audit services for any customers of BDPaaS.
