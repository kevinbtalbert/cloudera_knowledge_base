DMM.com Relies on Cloudera Enterprise to Build Spark-Powered Advanced Recommendation Engine on its e-Commerce Platform






 









Japanese Online Retailer Provides Product Recommendations Based on Customer Buying Histories, Streaming Social Data, and Past Browsing of Goods
PALO ALTO, Calif., October 13, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, announced that Japanese online retailer DMM.com has deployed Cloudera Enterprise to enhance its e-Commerce platform. DMM.com has added an advanced recommendation system powered by Apache Spark for its customers, and is the first Cloudera customer in Asia to do so. DMM.com and its subsidiaries offer a wide range of services, including online shopping, on-demand video, rental services, and online securities trading.
DMM.com Labo, the company’s IT subsidiary, provides system development, operation services, network infrastructure, and marketing services for the company. It is tasked to help DMM.com provide services and products that exceed customer expectations and that are ahead of market trends. To attain this goal, DMM.com Labo selected Cloudera Enterprise as the company’s big data platform.
The newly developed recommendation engine provides product recommendations to customers, based on buying histories, as well as streaming social data, and past browsing of goods.
“We are very excited to help DMM.com become the first Cloudera customer in Asia to provide advanced recommendation features built on Apache Spark,” said Kenzaburo Tamura, Japan country manager at Cloudera. “We will continue to provide ongoing support to help improve their customer experience and to support the company’s focus on creating new, exciting, and innovative features.”
