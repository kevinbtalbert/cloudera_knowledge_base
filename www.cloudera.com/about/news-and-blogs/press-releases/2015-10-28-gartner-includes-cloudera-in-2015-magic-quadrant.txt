Gartner Includes Cloudera in 2015 Magic Quadrant for Operational Database Management Systems






 









Evaluation based on Completeness of Vision and Ability to Execute
PALO ALTO, Calif. – October 28, 2015 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache™ Hadoop(R) and the latest open source technologies, announced today that Gartner has positioned it in the October 2015 Magic Quadrant for Operational Database Management Systems. This is the second year that Cloudera has been included.
According to Gartner, “The OLTP DBMS market, from which the operational DBMS market evolved, was very mature in the early years of the 21st century. However, as Internet usage and availability grew, so did the applications necessary to support the associated growth in infrastructure. Consequently, over the past five years, many new vendors have entered this market with products to support the specialized applications required by a new and global business arena. Many drivers of innovation are widely influential. New forms of data have become available from connected (IoT) devices, such as smart meter data and machine or device data; we call this ‘observation data.’ Pervasive use of personal devices and social media has also become a source of social- and business-related data; we call this ‘interaction data.’ Best-fit engineering adoption is driving the use of alternative data stores to manage these new forms of data: while 91% of the organizations surveyed said they use RDBMSs, 45% are using key-value stores, 38% document-style DBMSs, 22% table-style DBMSs and 16% graph-style DBMSs. The new forms of data must now be used not only for analytics, but also within transactions.”
In 2014, Cloudera predicted the ‘disappearance’ of Hadoop, espousing the importance of applications built on top of Hadoop to further the growth and maturation of the market. As platform companies have become foundational to business users’ success without them being aware of the underlying technology, so too has Hadoop assumed a supporting role to the applications and analytics it enables. Today, the platform tools with apps are part of a burgeoning market driving the technology to ubiquity and unlocking huge new value for customers.

In a recent Cloudera webinar, Dr. Ralph Kimball, data warehousing / business intelligence thought leader and evangelist for dimensional modeling, reiterated why Hadoop and the applications it empowers are having such an impact on traditional data warehousing environments: By modernizing the “back room” of data collection and preparation, it can rapidly open the door to more data, more users, and more diverse analytic perspectives than ever before possible. Hadoop’s modular, scalable architecture presents several attractive benefits, including:

Processing Performance - Meet SLAs with highly parallel distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Spark™.
Data Moving Performance - Ingest data for processing with tools such as Apache Sqoop™ from the most aggressive operational data sources at full speed.
Scalability - Grow data far beyond previous limits with predictable and linear response.
Diversity - Explore any kind of structured or unstructured data without having to physically transform the data in advance, through Hadoop’s signature “schema-on-read” capability.
Low Cost - Offload processing workloads, or archival data from an existing data warehouse, mainframe, or other legacy system.
Flexibility - Go beyond SQL, using multiple programming languages and alternative techniques, such as full-text search using Apache Solr.

The report’s authors note, “At one time, Gartner viewed the online transaction processing (OLTP) DBMS market as very mature, with few new entrants to challenge the status quo. However, in recent years, the market has changed rapidly, which prompted our redefinition of it in 2013 as the operational DBMS market. The introduction of NoSQL DBMSs and Hadoop supporting the use of additional data types and ‘unstructured data’ in transactions, and the pervasive implementation of in-memory computing, have been transformational. Many organizations are beginning to use these new DBMS engines to incorporate analytics directly into transactional streams for HTAP and to deploy other new use cases, such as global scalability for Web applications and emerging IoT applications involving event processing.”
“The emergence of packaged apps aimed at particular business problems, such as value-at-risk or next-best-action, allows traditional enterprises to buy advanced analytics and incorporate them into operations,” said Mike Olson, co-founder and chief strategy officer, Cloudera. “We're seeing that now in our customer deployments. The new availability of these techniques will unlock value in data that was previously unavailable, which will lead to fast adoption. This is a major new capability, and is the key reason we expect the data and analytics market to grow so quickly.”
