Second Year in a Row Cloudera Appears on Deloitte’s 2015 Technology Fast 500™ for Fastest Growing Companies in North America






 









Leading Data Management and Analytics Platform Provider Ranked 142; Experienced Three-Year Growth of 609%
PALO ALTO, Calif., – November 16, 2015 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache™ Hadoop® and the latest open source technologies, announced today it ranked 142 on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500™, a ranking of the 500 fastest growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences, and energy tech companies in North America. Cloudera grew 609 percent over this three-year period.
“The past few years have been tremendous for Cloudera – not just for overall company growth but also moving the needle with our partners, customers, products, and the open source community,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. “What matters most is the impact our customers are experiencing, and able to realize through the use of our technology. Our growth simultaneously increases as the value of big data becomes more apparent.”
“Amid a fierce business climate, there seems to be no shortage of new and established companies that are unlocking a seemingly unlimited potential for growth and advancement through technology’s continued disruption and proliferation across industries,” said Sandra Shirai, principal, Deloitte Consulting LLP and U.S. technology, media and telecommunications leader. “It is inspiring to witness the innovative ways that companies are incorporating emerging technologies for business gains, be it cognitive computing, or the Internet of Things. We congratulate all those ranked on this year’s Fast 500 and look forward to seeing their continued growth into 2016.”
Since its inception, Cloudera has been committed to the Hadoop community and contributing powerful advances to the ecosystem of solutions. Recently the company launched Kudu to enable faster analytics from the storage layer of Hadoop and RecordService to enhance Hadoop security by centrally enforcing role-based access control policies across the platform. Cloudera also offers the most extensive training for the developer community and has expanded its Spark curriculum to empower users to integrate Spark within Hadoop environments.
“Through the efforts and utilization of new and emerging technologies from these companies, we are witnessing greater business demands across all industries,” added Jim Atwell, national managing partner of the emerging company practice, Deloitte & Touche LLP. “We look forward to the opportunity to serve these companies as they strive to grow to the next level –  be it towards introducing new solutions or entering new markets – and with it make important and long lasting impressions on the technology market as a whole.” 
About Deloitte’s 2015 Technology Fast 500™
