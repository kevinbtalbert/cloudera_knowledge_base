Press Release
Cloudera Navigator Optimizer Provides Active Data Optimization for Hadoop Workloads



 









Cloudera 5.5 Features Cloudera Navigator Optimizer to Enable Instant Insights and Optimization Guidance for the Best Results with Hadoop - Now Available as Limited Beta; New Platform Release Also Improves Performance, Security, and Functionality of Data Discovery and Analytics on Hadoop
PALO ALTO, Calif., – November 19, 2015 –Cloudera, provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, announced today the availability of Cloudera Enterprise 5.5. This release continues to improve the performance, security, and functionality of analytics on Hadoop and includes the limited beta release of Cloudera Navigator Optimizer for improved workload performance and efficiency.
“Inefficiently allocated data workloads are all too common across enterprises—causing costly delays, errors, and complexity. Customers need visibility into their workloads and guidance to ensure the best results with Hadoop,” said Charles Zedlewski, vice president, Products at Cloudera. “The beta release of Cloudera Navigator Optimizer, as part of Cloudera Enterprise 5.5, provides customers with a path to success by providing visibility into their workloads, and helps customers understand the ones that are the best suited for deployment on Hadoop to reduce development time and improve performance.”
Within any business, there can be countless workloads being run at any given time, across multiple systems, that change based on time of day and business need. Across many of these workloads, similar pain points have emerged, like breakdowns in ETL pipelines, long wait times for BI reports, increasing system pressure from ad hoc queries, and unnecessary query complexity ­– all resulting in lost time and money. When adopting new systems based on Hadoop, it’s critical that customers understand their workloads, so they can address these inefficiencies and run the right workloads in the right systems for the best results.
Cloudera Navigator Optimizer instantly analyzes existing workloads, providing visibility into which ones are the most critical, which data is accessed most, and how is it being used. It then automatically turns this information into a full optimization strategy for fast success with Hadoop. Through an intuitive dashboard, customers get prioritization guidance on where to focus development efforts to achieve the biggest impact, centered around identifying duplication, exposing complexity, and leveraging compatibilities with ecosystem tools such as Impala and Apache Hive™.
Powered by Xplain.io’s Big Data Integration Service (BDIS), acquired by Cloudera in February 2015, Cloudera Navigator Optimizer is providing insights and optimizations for customers including global healthcare and financial services firms – analyzing millions of queries and resulting in millions of dollars saved.
"Cloudera Enterprise has become an increasingly critical part of our data management infrastructure at Visa, and Cloudera Navigator Optimizer is proving value by helping us determine which workloads are best suited to run on Hadoop so we can optimize the efficiency of our entire IT stack," said Hemanth Thota, architect, data design and integration, Data Platform, Visa.
In addition to Cloudera Navigator Optimizer, Cloudera Enterprise 5.5 includes a number of other capabilities to empower analytics on Hadoop, including:

Analytics on Complex Data Structures - Impala now supports nested data types, including JSON, for expanded data discovery and business intelligence.
Secure Analytics Across the Entire Business - Impala now includes column-level security for fine-grained access controls for all users. Cloudera Enterprise now also includes credential management, including password redaction, for further protection.
Automated Data Stewardship and Extensible Governance - Cloudera Navigator automatically enforces full data lifecycle workflows, including retention and archiving, so the right data is always available for consumption. Additionally, building on the Cloudera Navigator Accelerator Program, the new Cloudera Navigator SDK opens up lineage and metadata capabilities to the leading partner tools, for augmented visibility no matter what tools are used to integrate, wrangle, or analyze data.

“One of the most common questions is, 'how can Hadoop complement and optimize data warehouse environments?’ as shown in ESG research,” says Nik Rouda, senior analyst at ESG Research. “Cloudera Navigator Optimizer, built on the innovations of Xplain.io, looks incredibly useful in answering this question. It will help identify the best candidates for workloads that could be shifted to Hadoop, as well as any inefficiencies or redundancies in queries. The cost delta between traditional data warehouse environments and Hadoop is enormous, and this enables companies to realize those gains for better performance and efficiency.”
