Membership in Cloudera’s Academic Partnership Program Expands to Over 100 Universities






 









CAP Membership Climbs 500 Percent Since 2013 and Paves the Way for the Next Generation of Data Engineers and Data Scientists
PALO ALTO, Calif., – December 1, 2015 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache HadoopTM, today announced that over 100 leading universities from around the world have joined the Cloudera Academic Partnership (CAP) program, a 500 percent increase since its launch in April 2013. Now, computer science students from the US, Israel, India, South Korea, Mexico, Denmark, Brazil and Germany and beyond are empowered with the most advanced Apache Hadoop curriculum and training available to immediately enter the new data economy with a clear advantage. CAP participation enables university labs and analytics departments to utilize the most advanced state-of-the-art tools for data and infrastructure management to conduct cutting-edge research that directly benefits both the students and the institution.
The need to leverage big data for insights is universal. Today data drives the modern world, and organizations across a wide range of verticals, including agriculture, financial services, healthcare, government, retail and telecommunications are using Hadoop to extract value from big data to change the world and benefit people’s lives. With more than 1,900 companies already partnering with Cloudera to leverage the power of Apache Hadoop, it is evident that the industry has reached an inflection point regarding demand for this particular skill set.
The Cloudera Academic Partnership program was founded in 2012 in order to introduce university-level students to the Hadoop ecosystem and prepare them for careers in big data. It gives computer science and business analytics departments in accredited, nonprofit universities around the world access to free curricula and tools that otherwise would be expensive and time-consuming to develop or acquire on their own. The end result is a new generation of Hadoop-aware IT professionals who will fill the skills gap for employers. Leading universities including Harvard University, Stanford University, Pisa University, and the University of Southern California, have all partnered with Cloudera to provide a cutting-edge big data curriculum for their students. Momentum for the program includes:

We’ve grown by 500% since the end of 2013

University membership from over 17 countries, including Israel, India, South Korea, Brazil, and Germany.


“Two years ago, we set out to create the first university partnership centered around Hadoop education, a response to continued interest from our customers to help them find professionals that had the required skills to implement Hadoop initiatives,” said Mark Morrissey, senior director, Cloudera Education. “With over 50 colleges, universities and trade schools from 17 countries now a part of the program, we’re proud to lead the way in helping higher education train the next generation of data engineers and build a skilled workforce ready for the new data economy.”
CAP Member Quotes
“We’ve seen an incredible increase in demand for data professionals over the past few years, and interest for Apache Hadoop training has been at the forefront of this movement, as a result of the increasing adoption of the Hadoop platform across all industries.”
-- Maurizio Davini, chief technology officer, IT Center at University of Pisa
“We reviewed many of the companies that provide Hadoop academic support programs and we were most impressed with the Cloudera program. Our initial analysis proved to be accurate. All components of the program, including the classroom support materials, books and training discounts, as well as the access to company experts, have helped us develop an important new course on the emerging field of Big Data in our Computer Science curriculum.”
-- Roland DePratti, Adjunct Professor, Eastern Connecticut State University
“Our students have been asking for Spark curriculum for the last few quarters. We're excited Cloudera added the new Spark program to their CAP offerings and will be teaching the new course in the winter quarter of 2016.”
-- Daniel Templeton, Computer Science Visiting Lecturer, Stanford University and Cloudera employee
“As a researcher, my main goal in offering a Hadoop-based program is that I keep my students on the forefront of technology, but this can be challenging in such an ultra-fast-progressing field. The Cloudera Academic Partner program team has been up to that challenge and even provided me updated content, with all the latest developments in the field, by the time I delivered my second offering. Having access to the well-crafted programming of the CAP labs gave me the chance to implement my dream teaching model. As a result, our university saw demand for our program triple after the first offering of the CAP-based course.”
-- Dr. Sameh El-Ansary, Assistant Professor of CIT, Nile University
How the CAP Program Works
The CAP program provides a complete, free, industry-standard Hadoop curriculum to incorporate into partner universities’ computer science and business analytics courses. Professors and students affiliated with CAP program institutions can freely download a wide selection of Cloudera's supplementary training materials and receive discounts on all Cloudera Certification exams. Professors also qualify for deep discounts on Cloudera University professional training delivered by Cloudera's team of expert Hadoop instructors, and benefit from up-to-date classroom tools, instructor forums, dedicated program support, and the world's largest Hadoop knowledgebase.
Cloudera Education Software License Program
Accredited, non-profit academic institutions can also take advantage of the more robust features of Cloudera's software suite through a special University License. CAP members have free access to Cloudera Enterprise: Data Hub Edition for 12 months to support data-intensive testing, development, and research. In conjunction with Cloudera's industry-leading open-source platform, the University License provides CAP participants with the tools needed to achieve major breakthroughs in big data.
Foundation for CAP Program Curriculum: Cloudera University
The CAP program curriculum was developed from the industry-leading training courses and technical certifications offered by Cloudera University, which focuses on Apache Hadoop, its ecosystem and data science. Cloudera University offers the world's most complete and comprehensive Hadoop education programs for data professionals. To date, Cloudera has trained more than 40,000 participants and certified more than 10,000 Hadoop professionals. Over 65% of the Fortune 100 and all 20 of the top 20 global technology firms have leveraged Cloudera's expertise to train employees on Apache Hadoop.
