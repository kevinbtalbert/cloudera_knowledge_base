True Harnesses Cloudera Enterprise to Improve Customer Experience Management






 









Leading Thai Communications Conglomerate Builds 360-Degree View of Customers Across Five Business Units
Singapore, 2 December, 2015 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, announced today that True Corporation Public Company Limited, Thailand’s leading communications conglomerate, has adopted Cloudera Enterprise to build an integrated 360-degree customer view across its five business units, leveraging Cloudera Navigator for complete data governance.
Communications service providers (CSPs) are among the world’s biggest aggregators of consumer information, generating unprecedented amounts of valuable data including market profiles, device data, network data, usage patterns, location data, content preferences, clickstream data, and more. Many CSPs, like True, are utilizing Cloudera Enterprise to easily bring together and capitalize on all of this in a unified, governed, and cost-effective environment that drives down operational costs, delivers a more compelling and personalized customer experience, reduces churn, and/or generates new revenue streams.
True offers integrated communications services to more than one million customers across the country via its five business units:

True Online -- delivering internet and data services
True Move -- offering wireless voice, prepaid, and mobile phones and equipment
True Visions -- serving TV satellite and network cable subscriptions
True Money -- providing prepaid cards and payment services for utilities, goods, and services
True Life -- serving digital content via online portals, communities, games, and shopping

“We are unique in Thailand because of how many different services we provide and how many touch points we have with our customers,” said Pichit Thanyodom, chief information officer for True Move. “We are always looking at ways to improve our customers’ experience and better match our products to what customers want. Our goal is to help customers get the best possible benefits from our services, and for the services we offer to be the best possible fit to customers' needs."
By bringing data from all lines of business into a unified and governed enterprise data hub, True has access to a 360-degree, omni-channel view that serves new insights about customer behaviors, interests, and preferences. Cloudera Enterprise provides the computing capacity for True to regularly analyze over 200TB of customer data and perform micro-segmentation. True is able to zoom in on the data to extract information such as individual customers’ buying behaviors and preferences in order to deliver personalized offers and campaigns.
Earlier this year, True identified the ‘big data’ trend as an opportunity to re-platform its IT environment, and decided to implement a flexible, open standards solution that could be easily and continuously improved as big data technologies evolved. The team looked for a technology partner who would not only provide a modern data management platform, but would also deliver innovative ideas and solutions.
“There were initially some concerns that the Hadoop platform might be difficult to use,” said Dr. Rujikorn Pavasuthipaisit, head of Strategic Project Development and Research, True, “but Cloudera offers products that make Hadoop use and management fast, easy, and secure. Our data scientists have smoothly transitioned to the Cloudera platform, which came with a suite of analytics software and applications that allow our data scientists to generate insights from the data and realize returns from the investment quickly.”
“Cloudera committed from the beginning that they would make key skills available to us locally, and demonstrated that they could be flexible and creative with us,” said Thanyodom. “Most importantly, they also suggested great new ideas about how we could better serve our customers and continue to enhance our services."
"We’re better equipped to analyze the trends and patterns emerging from our wide range of services across the markets we serve,” said Thanyodom. “We have a better understanding of what our customers appreciate and what they want more of. We can also more closely monitor our own performance in serving our customers, and identify the root causes that sometimes prevent us from meeting their expectations. We want True to be the company that provides the best experience and the best products, and Cloudera is a critical part of our IT solution that will help us meet that goal.”
“CSPs, like True, have an enormous opportunity to leverage a ton of data from all kinds of sources," said Amy O'Connor, industry leader for Telecommunications at Cloudera. "Cloudera's goal is to partner with our customers, providing an industry-leading platform and expertise, to help them discover new ways to engage customers, innovate products and services, and mitigate risk."
“Going forward, we see Cloudera Enterprise playing an even larger role in True’s analytics environment,” said Pavasuthipaisit. “We are in the midst of implementing the ‘360-degree customer view’ on Cloudera. In 2016, we will also build in-database and in-memory analytics capabilities on the platform, and will integrate Cloudera with our campaign management system to execute real-time, trigger-based campaigns and to sharpen our data monetization strategy.”
