Cloudera Announces Beta Release of Cloudera Desktop






 









Cloudera’s First Commercial Product Delivers Job and Cluster Management Tools Built on an Extensible User Interface Platform for Apache Hadoop
NEW YORK, NY–(Marketwire – October 2, 2009) – Hadoop World — Cloudera, the commercial Hadoop™ company, today announced the release of Cloudera Desktop, a unified graphical user interface for Hadoop applications. The initial release of Cloudera Desktop includes tools for job and cluster management.
Cloudera Desktop makes Hadoop easier to use and manage. Business analysts, developers and administrators can use the Cloudera Desktop user interface to create and submit jobs, to monitor cluster health and to browse the data stored on a Hadoop cluster. Experienced users can choose between the command-line tools provided by the open source project or the Cloudera Desktop GUI.
“Apache Hadoop is an enormously powerful data storage and processing platform,” said Jeff Hammerbacher, VP, Products at Cloudera. “We see lots of sophisticated applications running in production already. However, customers tell us that working with their clusters, and building applications for their business teams to use, is hard. Cloudera Desktop is aimed at solving that problem. We expect it to drive new use of Hadoop by lowering the barrier for new users, and making current users more productive.”
Cloudera Desktop runs inside a Web browser, and works on Windows, Macintosh and Linux systems. The initial release of the platform delivers four applications:
– The file browser, for copying and browsing the data files stored on a
cluster;
– The job designer, for creating, running and saving jobs for later
reuse or customization;
– The job browser, for keeping track of job status and progress; and
– The cluster health dashboard, for monitoring the health of a Hadoop
cluster and alerting operators in case of problems.
The Cloudera Desktop API allows Cloudera and others to build Hadoop applications with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. Future releases of the product will include additional applications. Cloudera is working with select partners to stabilize the API before publishing it for general use.
“The open source Hadoop project has proven itself on some of the most difficult data management workloads in the world,” said Stephen O’Grady, Principal Analyst at RedMonk. “One of the significant barriers to broader adoption has been ease of use. With stable APIs and a traditional graphical interface for those with no exposure to Hadoop, Cloudera Desktop is aimed squarely at that opportunity.”
