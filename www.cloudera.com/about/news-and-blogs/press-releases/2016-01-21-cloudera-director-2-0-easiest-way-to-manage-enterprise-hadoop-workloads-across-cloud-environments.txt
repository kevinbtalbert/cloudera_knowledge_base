Cloudera Announces Cloudera Director 2.0 for the Easiest Way to Manage Enterprise Hadoop Workloads Across Cloud Environments 






 









Latest Release Features Automated Job Submissions for Transient Workloads and Improved Troubleshooting Across Deployments
 
PALO ALTO, Calif., Jan. 21, 2016 — Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced the latest version of Cloudera Director 2.0, the easiest way to deploy and manage enterprise Hadoop in cloud environments. As the only Hadoop distribution to support hybrid cloud environments, Cloudera has been leading the cloud movement for Hadoop so customers can capitalize on the flexibility provided by the cloud while taking advantage of the platform capabilities of Hadoop. This release marks a critical milestone for this movement with new automations to reduce operating costs, deliver critical enterprise-grade capabilities, and provide troubleshooting necessary for production. Customers can also take advantage of customized configurations to quickly get started with common workloads.
 
Due to the rising popularity of streaming data and the Internet of things, more data is being generated and stored in the cloud. Paired with the resourcing flexibility of cloud environments, it has become an appealing environment to support many common Hadoop workloads. Cloudera was the first Hadoop vendor to help customers embrace these trends, and has since developed new technologies through Cloudera Director to support hybrid operations, new optimizations in the platform to seamlessly integrate with object stores, and integrations and partnerships with the major cloud environments -- Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure -- for a reliable experience regardless of environment.
 
Cloudera has worked with customers in all industries, at massive scale, to successfully leverage Hadoop across all the major cloud environments. To get more value from streaming data and power predictive maintenance models, a large European airport1 uses Cloudera Enterprise on Azure to monitor and report on the health of escalators, conveyor belts, and other critical machines around the airport. Companies such as Adecco2, Airbnb3, FINRA4, and many more have also embraced cloud environments for enterprise data hub deployments.
 
“Across all industries and use cases, our customers are interested in running Hadoop in cloud environments, benefiting from the fast resourcing and flexibility it provides,” said Charles Zedlewski, vice president of Products at Cloudera. “To further support our customers, Cloudera Director 2.0 makes it easier and more cost-effective for customers to tap into these benefits, while reliably managing cloud deployments both at scale and in production.”
 
Based on our work with customers and cloud partners, Cloudera Director 2.0 builds on this leadership and innovation by drastically simplifying the experience of running common Hadoop workloads in the cloud: ETL and Modeling, Business Intelligence (BI) and Analytics, and Application Delivery -- resulting in cost savings, easier management at scale, and enterprise functionality. New features focus on:

Lower operating costs for the infrastructure that supports ETL or other transient workloads

Automatic job submissions that spin up and terminate clusters on a per job basis, without manual cluster lifecycle management

Support for AWS Spot instances and GCP Preemptible instances

Support for Apache Hive and Apache Spark on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) (released with Cloudera 5.5) for powerful, consistent processing wherever the data resides





Quick scalability for BI/Analytics workloads to support low-latency, high-concurrency access

Cluster cloning and cluster repair to grow computing resources and repair issues without disrupting the business

Support for secure, multi-tenant access to users analyzing data in Amazon S3 or other Hadoop storage options with RecordService (available in beta)





Enterprise capabilities for long-running application delivery workloads

Automatically enable high availability and Kerberos as part of the bootstrap workflow

Seamlessly connect to the rest of the business with external database connectors and integration with Cloudera Enterprise backup and disaster recovery
 




For all workloads, there are customizable templates and configurations to easily manage and repeat deployments. Cloudera provides an aggregated view of all clusters, across all environments, down to the instance-level for metadata filtering, transparent monitoring, and improved troubleshooting.
“Recent ESG research shows that the number one spending priority amongst those responsible for their companies' strategic big data investments is leveraging cloud-based analytics offerings,” said Nik Rouda, senior analyst at ESG. “Cloudera Director 2.0 is very well aligned to this imperative, enabling businesses to manage Hadoop deployments across both cloud and on-premises environments, providing a robust and mature solution.”
The latest release of Cloudera Director 2.0 works seamlessly across major cloud platforms, including AWS and GCP, and includes the Open Cloud Connector to easily integrate with other preferred public or private clouds. Users looking to deploy on Microsoft Azure can also seamlessly provision Cloudera Enterprise via the Azure Marketplace.
Cloudera is working closely with its vast partner network of more than 2,000 companies to ensure the same optimized and certified tools and experience, no matter the deployment environment. Data integration solutions from software partners such as Informatica and Pentaho and BI tools from Qlik and Zoomdata are often deployed in on-premises and cloud environments and integrated with Cloudera Enterprise.
“Informatica big data management solutions strive to provide the simplest and fastest big data integration capabilities combined with in-depth visibility into data lineage inside Hadoop. This helps customers comply with external and internal requirements,” said Amit Walia, executive vice president and chief product officer, Informatica. “Informatica is committed to our strong partnership with Cloudera to further simplify and automate the deployment of Informatica’s big data management solutions on top of Cloudera Enterprise in cloud, on-premises, and in hybrid architectures so customers can quickly and flexibly make their big data ready for business.”
“Pentaho shares Cloudera’s vision of delivering a consistent data management experience for customers regardless of where they choose to run their data-driven apps,” said Donna Prlich, senior vice president of Product Marketing and Solutions at Pentaho, a Hitachi Data Systems Company. “Whether in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment, Pentaho and Cloudera make it easier for customers to gain valuable insights from their data, faster.”
“IT professionals and business leaders are looking to derive tangible value from their big data implementations, by providing an analytics layer that can both access data and make it relevant and accessible to users across their organization. With Hadoop, the reach of the technology is expanding rapidly, and we are seeing many more Qlik customers select cloud environments as their infrastructure of choice for critical big data workloads,” said Mike Foster, vice president of Strategic Partners at Qlik. “Cloudera Director 2.0 brings significant performance advances to accessing data in Hadoop, which combined with Qlik’s associative experience, will enable our customers to continue discovering business value from their data, regardless of the variety or volume.”
"More and more of our enterprise customers are leveraging Hadoop through Cloudera Enterprise in production cloud and hybrid environments, where their data is both on-premises and in the cloud," said Nick Halsey, CMO of Zoomdata. "Through Zoomdata's AnyCloud initiative, we have optimized our big data visual analytics solution for Cloudera Enterprise in cloud environments. Our Fusion capability, in conjunction with Cloudera Director, is ideal for hybrid deployments so that customers can easily access disparate data sources in real-time at scale, whether they are located on premises or in the cloud.”
Availability and Additional Information
Cloudera Director is available as a free download for use with CDH and Cloudera Enterprise.
Reference Guides are available for deployment on AWS, GCP, and Microsoft Azure.
