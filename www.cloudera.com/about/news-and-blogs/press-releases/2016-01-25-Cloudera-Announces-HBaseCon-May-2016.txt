HBaseCon, now in its fifth year, is the world’s biggest gathering of Apache HBase committers/contributors, administrators, and developers. Its goal is to continually inform the user community about best practices for running web-scale, HBase-based systems in production.

When and Where: HBaseCon will be held in San Francisco on Tuesday, May 24, 2016, at The Village, Market Street.
More details:

Call for Speakers (Now Open): To submit speaking abstracts for sessions pertaining to HBase internals and futures, best practices for running HBase in production, and HBase use cases and applications, visit hbasecon.com. The Call for Speakers is open through February 28, 2016. 
Registration and Sponsor Information: Early Bird registration for the event is now open for a limited time at a cost of $375. Sponsorships are available at Gold and Silver levels, with several add-on options. To register or for more information about becoming a sponsor, visit: https://hbasecon.com.
