Cloudera Named A Leader in Big Data Hadoop Distributions, Q1 2016 Report by Independent Research Firm






 









Report States: “Hadoop Becomes The New Core of The Analytical Enterprise”
PALO ALTO, Calif. – January 25, 2016: Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced that it is positioned as a leader in The Forrester Wave™: Big Data Hadoop Distributions, Q1 2016 report. Forrester used a 35-criteria evaluation system covering: Current Offering, Strategy, and Market Presence for the five Hadoop distribution vendors in the report; Cloudera received the highest score for Current Offering and Market Presence and the second highest for Strategy. Download the full report here.
 
According to the Wave report authored by Forrester analysts Mike Gualtieri and Noel Yuhanna, “Hadoop is data’s darling for a reason — it thoroughly disrupts the economics of data, analytics, and data-driven applications. Enterprise adoption is mandatory for firms that wish to double-down on advanced analytics and create insights-driven applications to help them succeed in the age of the customer.
 
Enterprise Hadoop is a market that is not even 10 years old, but Forrester estimates that 100% of all large enterprises will adopt it (Hadoop and related technologies such as Spark) for big data analytics within the next two years.”
 
Additionally, Forrester adds that “Leaders Differentiate On Their Approach To Innovation”: specifically they note the following for Cloudera: ”Cloudera thinks big and acts fast. Cloudera’s scope and pace of innovation is astounding, but not surprising for the first commercial Hadoop startup, founded in 2008. Cloudera started the SQL-for-Hadoop craze with Impala. It offered the first visual cluster management tool and continues to put significant effort into key features such as security, high availability, governance, and administration. The vendor is anything but shy when it comes to making strategic acquisitions and partnerships to fill enterprise gaps in security, data management, and analytics. Cloudera’s customers value the commercial add-on tools like Cloudera Manager, Cloudera Navigator, and Impala, as well as the company’s overall vision for an enterprise big data platform.”
 
“As we celebrate the ten year anniversary of the founding of the Hadoop project by our Chief Architect, Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella, Cloudera continues to lead the transition toward Hadoop becoming the modern data management and analytic platform for all enterprises,” said Mike Olson, co-founder, chairman of the Board and chief strategy officer, Cloudera. “For us being named a leader in The Forrester Wave™: Big Data Hadoop Distributions report validates our vision and demonstrates our ability to innovate and provide our customers with the technology and support that they need. The report cites Cloudera’s pace of innovation, which, in our opinion, generates continuous value for our customers and the open source community.”
 
In the past 10 years the Hadoop community, including significant contributions from Cloudera, has created and matured over 40 projects that now exist as part of the Hadoop ecosystem.
 
Cloudera’s success is measured by its customers’ success. The company has seen financial services institutions become more compliant with government and industry regulations; it’s helped a client significantly reduce human trafficking; it’s seen unwell babies’ lives greatly improved; and it’s seen major telecom carriers and credit card issuers stop massive amounts of fraud.
 
Overall, Cloudera has progressed well alongside the community. In tandem they have reached milestones that could not have been foreseen 10 years ago. The community continues to advance the possibilities and value of data, one of the greatest resources for any organization. As the community and Cloudera celebrate the expansion and continued evolution of the Hadoop ecosystem, it is committed to putting its customers' needs first while working towards a brighter tomorrow, and sustaining its unique momentum.
