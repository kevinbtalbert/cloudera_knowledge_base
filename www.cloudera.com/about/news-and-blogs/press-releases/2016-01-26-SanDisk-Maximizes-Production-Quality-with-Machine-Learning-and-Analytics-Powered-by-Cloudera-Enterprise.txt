SanDisk Maximizes Production Quality with Machine Learning and Analytics Powered by Cloudera Enterprise






 









Global Leader in Flash Storage Implements Unified, Secure Big Data Platform to Reduce Drive Errors and Predict Failures
PALO ALTO, Calif. – January 26, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, announced today that SanDisk, a global leader in flash storage, has deployed Cloudera Enterprise as an enterprise data hub to store, process, analyze, and test all of its product quality data. With Cloudera, SanDisk is for the first time incorporating end-to-end analytics and machine learning into its manufacturing operations, reducing drive errors, predicting failures, and ultimately ensuring superior reliability, quality, and performance of its products.
SanDisk is one of the world’s leading producers of data storage products based on flash memory. The inherent nature of the technology manufacturing industry in tandem with its market growth translates into constantly increasing volumes of manufacturing data that SanDisk must write, cleanse, process, and log at every stage of the manufacturing process.
By implementing an enterprise data hub with Cloudera, SanDisk can collect, analyze, and test all data generated throughout the manufacturing pipeline -- from design to product assembly, and from groups spanning the company whose data traditionally resided in relational databases, NoSQL databases, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and more, in a single, secure location. The Cloudera platform, including components like Impala, Apache Spark, and Apache Hive, allows users to search, query, and analyze their data, while also enabling machine learning across the vast dataset. Cloudera Navigator and Apache Sentry are critical components of the platform, ensuring real-time data encryption, fine-grained authorization policies, and role-based access controls to protect SanDisk’s intellectual property.  
“With the creation and adoption of the Hadoop data platform and an Enterprise Data Centric Architecture, SanDisk and Cloudera are leading, driving, and enabling net new capabilities, to perform advanced analytics, machine learning, and pattern matching at scale on SanDisk data at different stages of the manufacturing process,” said Janet George, fellow/chief data scientist at SanDisk.
“Manufacturers have always been challenged to ensure that their products consistently meet the highest quality of standards, no matter the industry or scale,” said Dave Shuman, industry leader, Retail and Manufacturing, Cloudera. “In the technology landscape that SanDisk operates, this is especially complex; SanDisk has to manage petabytes of data and billions of sensors streaming in from machine processes. SanDisk is a perfect example of how big data is the future of manufacturing analytics, applying its modern data management platform to make real-time improvements and modifications to the manufacturing process that maximize efficiencies and output.”
