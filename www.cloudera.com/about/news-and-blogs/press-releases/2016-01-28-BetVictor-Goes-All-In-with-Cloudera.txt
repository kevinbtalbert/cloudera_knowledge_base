BetVictor Goes All In with Cloudera






 









European Bookmaker Uses Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub to Cash In on Customer Behaviour and Betting Habits
 
LONDON, United Kingdom – 28 January, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced that online bookmaker and e-Gaming company BetVictor has implemented Cloudera Enterprise to gain greater insight into customer behaviour and habits. The company selected Cloudera for its ability to deliver a Hadoop-based platform that is fast, easy to use, and secure.
BetVictor has built an enterprise data hub with Cloudera, using Impala for interactive queries and Cloudera Manager to streamline system operations, as well as Sentry for security. The team enrolled in Cloudera University training to ensure fast adoption and time-to-value from the platform, and users are eager to leverage Cloudera’s expertise as they implement Apache Spark in the near term.
Established in 1946, Gibraltar-based BetVictor is one of Europe’s leading online gaming companies with customers from over 150 different countries. The recent and continued expansion of the business has been largely through its online betting platforms, which now include two high-quality in-house developed native applications and an outstanding web product. BetVictor employs over 400 people with offices also in London and Budapest.
“The traditional market has changed more over the last decade than it did in the previous century, thanks to online and mobile consumer trends. Staying ahead of the curve is more challenging now than ever before,” said Kris Marshall, head of business intelligence and analytics at BetVictor. “The mobile and digital marketplace in which we operate today, while undoubtedly more complicated, also presents some huge opportunities to engage and maximize the value we provide to our customer base.”
The betting industry has always been inherently data driven, but with today’s dominance of social and mobile activity, BetVictor’s success largely relies on its ability to crunch big data at real-time speeds. The massive volumes of structured (transactional), semi-structured (clickstream), and unstructured (social media sentiment) data represent a huge opportunity to deliver quantitative value and competitive advantage to the companies that can decipher and quickly operationalize the insights from it.
Marshall added, “Centralising all our data in an enterprise data hub built using Cloudera Enterprise has helped us make better use of our varied datasets, using various tools including Talend to drive data integration and both SAS and Tableau to identify behavioural patterns and facilitate more accurate customer profiles. This allows us to provide more relevant and personalised offers to our 500,000-plus worldwide customers, improving their overall betting experience and driving increased revenues for BetVictor.”
“While BetVictor’s business model has evolved dramatically over the past 65 years, the company’s continued success reflects its ongoing commitment to technological innovation and customer satisfaction,” said Alan Saldich, vice president of Marketing at Cloudera. “We are humbled by the opportunity to partner with BetVictor on this data-driven journey, and ‘bet’ their customers will be happy with the results.”
