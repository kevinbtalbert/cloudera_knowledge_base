Press Release
Cloudera and Argyle Data Unite to Battle Fraud for Communications Service Providers














Real-Time Fraud Analytics Platform Based on Hadoop and Powered by Machine Learning Offers Up to 350 Percent Better Fraud Discovery
 
PALO ALTO, Calif., Feb. 16, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, has teamed with Argyle Data to deliver a real-time fraud analytics platform that is tailored to help communications service providers (CSPs) reduce risk and revenue loss from the growing volume of mobile fraud.

The jointly developed fraud analytics platform gives CSPs the ability to fight global telecommunications fraud and detect previously undiscoverable revenue threats, delivering up to 350 percent improvement over rules-based offerings based on measurements in test labs and live operator environments. Using a native Hadoop architecture, combined with real-time data ingestion, analytics, and machine learning, the fraud analytics platform saves operators millions of dollars in fraud and revenue threats, reduces data leakage, and protects CSPs from irreparable brand damage.

Mobile and fixed-line carriers lose approximately two percent of their revenues, or USD $38 billion, to fraud every year, according to the 2015 Global Fraud Loss Surveypublished by the Communications Fraud Control Association (CFCA)[1]. Criminals are increasingly adopting hyperscale techniques to perpetrate fraud quickly and more efficiently than ever before, exacting damage in 24 hours or less and going undetected for days or months, well before anyone knows an attack is happening.

To detect and out-innovate advanced cyberfraud attackers, leading CSPs are turning to Hadoop and machine-learning-based fraud analytics platforms that provide real-time analysis of massive amounts of data through an enterprise data hub (EDH). Proven to operate at scale at some of the world’s largest CSPs, the Cloudera and Argyle Data joint solution works effectively where traditional systems fall short.

“Together, we’ve been able to provide the first native Hadoop architecture for fraud protection, giving a level of detection never seen before in the telecom market,” said Amy O’Connor, industry leader for Telecommunications at Cloudera. “The solution is a huge leap forward for our customers in protecting their networks from attacks that are not only becoming more frequent, but harder to detect as they’re happening.”

“International Revenue Share Fraud (IRSF) has grown by 600 percent in the last two years, and subscription fraud, with variations such as never-pay, is driving up to 30 percent of overall fraud,” said Dr. Ian Howells, chief marketing officer at Argyle Data. “To discover modern fraud and revenue threat attacks, requires an enterprise data hub spanning network, CRM, billing, and profile data that can be analyzed in real time using machine learning. This prevents modern cybercriminals from flying between systems, under the rules radar, and going undetected. CSPs are now able to use the power of Cloudera and machine learning to discover both existing fraud more quickly and new previously undetectable revenue threats.”

The Cloudera-Argyle Data joint fraud analytics platform provides threat detection in near real time, applying machine learning capabilities to discover threats that would typically take hours or days in just minutes, and resulting in 20 to 30 times fewer false positives than existing solutions. The platform’s graph-based visual analytics allow users to discover crime rings and flows that are otherwise undetectable. Furthermore, the interactive dashboards make fraud, profit, or SLA threats obvious and easy to digest.

“We at Cloudera are seeing many opportunities to collaborate with our ecosystem partners to build and deliver compelling business solutions on top of our Hadoop-based platform,” said Vijay Raja, solutions marketing manager for Cloudera. “This solution exemplifies our ability to solve real business problems using big data. Our work with Argyle Data is a testament to the value big data and real-time analytics can have, delivering broader benefits and a higher value proposition over legacy fraud solutions.”
