Congressman Will Hurd and U.S. Chief Data Scientist DJ Patil Among the Notable List of 2016 Cloudera Government Forum Speakers






 









Fifth Annual Conference Adds “Technology Day” to Program, Catering to Technical Users
MCLEAN, Va. – February 17, 2016 – MEDIA ALERT
What: In its fifth year, the 2016 Cloudera Government Forum will bring together public and private sector practitioners to discuss the state of data analytics and share case studies of how agencies are leveraging their data to enable improved decision-making, cost savings, efficiency, and constituent services.
 
The inaugural Cloudera Technology Day will follow the 2016 Cloudera Government Forum, delivering a technical program for industry and government professionals in the mid-Atlantic region who are using, or aspire to use, Apache Hadoop-based modern data infrastructure.
 
Who: Congressman William (Will) Hurd (R-TX) will open the 2016 Cloudera Government Forum with his perspectives on Defending Vulnerable Populations in the Digital World. DJ Patil, chief data scientist and deputy chief technology officer for data policy, Office of Science and Technology Policy, The White House, will also present his vision for an effective, data-enabled government. In addition, the event will feature presentations by experienced data management and analytics professionals, including:
 
●      Andrew Hallman, director, Directorate for Digital Innovation, Central Intelligence Agency
●      Brooke Istook, director, Strategy and Operations, Thorn
●      Mike Olson, co-founder and chief strategy officer, Cloudera
●      Beth Simone Noveck, co-founder and director, The GovLab
●      Kim Stevenson, corporate vice president and chief information officer, Intel
●      Lori Walsh, assistant director, Division of Enforcement, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
 
Cloudera Technology Day will feature an opening session by Doug Cutting, Cloudera chief architect and founder of several leading open source projects, including Hadoop, Apache Avro, and Apache Lucene. This intensive one-day program will also include briefings from other Cloudera technical experts, including:
 
●      Eddie Garcia, chief security architect
●      Todd Lipcon, software engineer and Kudu founder
●      Eva Andreasson, director product management
●      Juliet Hougland, senior data scientist
 
When and Where: The 2016 Cloudera Government Forum will take place on Tuesday, March 15, 2016. The Cloudera Technology Day will take place on Wednesday, March 16, 2016. Both events will be held at the Arena Stage – Mead Center for American Theater, 1102 6th St., SW, Washington, DC 20024.
 
Why: Data management and analytics have come of age. Once the concern of a few who managed information on behalf of entire organizations, today government professionals—from the front office to the front line—create, consume and demand access to a full range of data sources and types to accomplish their missions. And few enterprises exceed the public sector’s capacity to collect, store, generate, and analyze enormous volumes and variety of data, from satellite and sensor telemetry to financial market and healthcare transactions.
 
In parallel, exciting new computing strategies have emerged to help government professionals take a deeper and wider view into their information assets, while protecting this data and promoting cost-efficiency. Using innovative technologies, data scientists, cybersecurity professionals, fraud investigators, financial analysts, and healthcare professionals are able to rely on a foundation that puts data at the center of their missions. Today, government organizations are empowered by analytics that help them better understand enterprise operations, predict outcomes, eliminate waste, detect misuse of resources, and defend against unauthorized data access.
