Press Release
E8 Security Chooses Cloudera Enterprise to Build Next Generation, Machine Learning Based Security Analytics Solution for Defending Against Cyber Threats














By Combining the Power of Behavioral Analytics and Big Data, E8 Security Powered by Cloudera Closes Both Insight and Action Gaps
PALO ALTO, Calif., February 24, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, announced today it is partnering with E8 Security, a pioneer in behavioral intelligence and cybersecurity, to deliver scalable, self-learning security analytics for detecting and prioritizing enterprise cybersecurity threats. The E8 Security solution, built on Cloudera Enterprise, brings powerful new ways to detect threats hidden in enterprise environments, prioritize alerts based on risk, and enable security teams to rapidly respond to threats. E8 Security powered by Cloudera Enterprise completely automates the analysis of vast data with machine-learning and multi-dimensional algorithms for modern security analytics. Cloudera Enterprise extends the effectiveness of E8 Security by enabling access and management of large sets of previously siloed data to discover unknown threats that legacy systems can’t detect.
The backbone of E8 Security’s performance is the use of sophisticated machine-learning and multi-dimensional modeling to constantly adapt to emerging threats, breakdown data silos and integrate with existing technology investments in real-time. Its platform immediately reduces business risk, increases operational efficiency,  and has been proven to improve return on existing security investments.
“The old ways of manual analysis can’t keep up with the growing volume and variety of security-relevant data available, which prevents organizations from making smart decisions and taking timely actions that can reduce risk,” said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development at Cloudera.  “E8 Security and Cloudera aim to address this gap head on with a solution built for automated detection and rapid response.”
 Cloudera Enterprise arms E8 Security platform users with:

The ability to quickly access and analyze data across the entire security environment using a flexible and scalable interface with Apache Impala
Optimized data processing with Apache Spark
An efficient and easily configurable centralized console for monitoring and reporting security threats

“By extracting actionable intelligence from evolving security data, E8 Security and Cloudera are empowering enterprise security teams to make more informed moves against hidden threats for faster resolutions,” said Matt Rodgers, Head of Product at E8 Security. “Together, we are taking a distinct approach in the way security analysts detect and protect against unknown threats at never before seen scale. It is a game changer for saving enterprises from harmful threats and keeping businesses running efficiently.”
