Securonix and Cloudera Partner to Combat Cyber Threats with Real-Time Analytics Purpose-Built for Security Monitoring






 









New Joint Solution Delivers Data-Driven Approach to Detecting Complex Internal and External Threats
 
PALO ALTO, Calif., February 24, 2016 — Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced a partnership with Securonix, the leader in enterprise security analytics that predict, prevent, detect, and respond to enterprise cyber security threats. Securonix integrated their solution with the trusted data management, visibility, and storage capabilities of Cloudera Enterprise, specifically leveraging Apache Spark, Kafka, Impala, and Solr. The Securonix-Cloudera joint solution provides new threat detection capabilities that address the increasing complexities and sophistication of breaches, malware, and internal and external threats. It uses real-time analytics to mine large volumes of data to automatically identify threats and enable enterprises to quickly reduce risks with fewer resources and lower costs.
 
“Traditional security event monitoring products are known for overwhelming security teams with high volumes of alerts and poor threat detection capabilities. Together Securonix and Cloudera deliver the real-time analytics today’s businesses need without the requirement of hiring an army of data scientists,” said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development at Cloudera. “With threats becoming more complex than ever, enterprises need an effective, modern security solution that can scale.”
 
One-third of Fortune 500 companies and one in three Fortune 100 financial services companies use Securonix’s leading security monitoring and automated signature-less threat detection platform. Securonix applies behavior-based anomaly detection and innovative user and entity behavior analytics to cyber security.
 
Securonix chose Cloudera’s enterprise solution to go beyond two-tier analytics to provide n-tier and on-demand analytics for enterprises.
 
The Securonix-Cloudera joint solution provides:
 

360 Degree Visibility – Analyzes events, identity, access, and transaction data to detect advanced threats and risk-ranks events for proactive security management
Advanced Security Analytics – Leverages existing event data, provides aggregation and enrichment with other relevant sources of information including identity, access, third-party intelligence, and geo-location information
Forensic Security Event Enrichment and Analysis – Enables historical analytics as well as advanced storage of all relevant information associated with security event data, plus point-in-time non-repudiation of the complete enriched event
Enterprise Security – Delivers strong authentication and authorization with Kerberos and Cloudera Sentry as well as masking and encryption capabilities to protect privacy and sensitive data

 
The Securonix-Cloudera joint solution is the future of big data security analytics. It solves critical security problems within organizations with advanced security analytics capabilities for use cases spanning insider threat detection, data exfiltration, endpoint protection, privileged account misuse, patient record protection, internal and external fraud and zero day attacks. By harnessing the power of big data environments, Securonix and Cloudera are breaking new ground in detecting the most complex, unknown, and impactful internal and external threats.
 
“Independently, Cloudera and Securonix innovate best-of-breed technologies respectively in the big data and cyber security markets. Together, we are truly breaking new ground,” said Tanuj Gulati, Chief Technology Officer of Securonix. “We’re defining what big data security analytics can do.”
