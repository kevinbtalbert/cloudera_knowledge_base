Press Release
Prevalent Adoption of Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub in Healthcare and Life Sciences Reflects Industry Transformation














Healthcare Organizations Increasingly Rely on Modern Data Platform to Propel Advances in Precision Medicine and to Improve Patient Outcomes
PALO ALTO, Calif., February 25, 2016 — Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced that its healthcare client base grew by 72 percent during 2015, underscoring the transformation taking place in the $3 trillion industry. As the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) 2016 theme implies -- “transforming health through IT” -- healthcare organizations are increasingly focused on taking advantage of big data to personalize the patient experience and improve clinical outcomes. Cloudera’s commitment to this effort was exemplified this morning, when the company announced its contributions to President Obama’s Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI).
By implementing Cloudera Enterprise, healthcare organizations are better equipped to deliver precision medicine with a modern data platform that facilitates information sharing across silos while remaining HIPAA-compliant, accelerates multi-omic research and drug discovery, and puts real-time data into the hands of clinicians. Healthcare and life science organizations around the world are adopting Cloudera Enterprise to support their data transformation efforts, including the Broad Institute, Cerner, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, Monsanto, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Premera Blue Cross, Premier, and RelayHealth (a McKesson company).
“Cloudera is uniquely positioned to deliver a unified view of data that advances precision medicine and improved patient outcomes,” said Shawn Dolley, industry leader, Healthcare and Life Science, Cloudera. “Our Hadoop-based platform with native HIPAA compliance, security, and governance functionality makes it easier to merge large datasets at the patient level, with no limits to variety or scale. We’re happy to see the success healthcare organizations are achieving, supporting the entire continuum of use cases -- precision medicine research, patient wearables, population outcomes, clinical prediction, and real-time bedside care -- to solve the world’s biggest healthcare problems through data.”

Visit Cloudera, Booth #14074, at HIMSS16, February 29 through March 4, 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada to learn more about big data transformation in healthcare.
Attend Session KC14: Precision Medicine Unifying Research and Clinical Silos, presented by Shawn Dolley, industry leader, Healthcare and Life Science, Cloudera.

Many research and children's hospitals have long experienced co-existence of researchers/PI's, often at a medical school/research institute, and their own clinical leaders/MDs. For too long, the innovations and insights from researchers have not made their way to the clinic, and the clinical and now genomic data have not made their way to research. Precision medicine and Big Data are driving these groups, and IT, together. We discuss best practices to speed research, change care, remove silos.

This session will take place from 11:30AM to 12:00PM PT on March 2, 2016 in Booths 14060-14087 at the Sands Expo Convention Center, Las Vegas, Nevada.
