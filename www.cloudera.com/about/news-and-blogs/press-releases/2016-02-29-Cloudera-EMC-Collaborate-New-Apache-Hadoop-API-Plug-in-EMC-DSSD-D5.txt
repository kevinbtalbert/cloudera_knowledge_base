Cloudera and EMC Collaborate on New Apache Hadoop API Plug-in for EMC DSSD D5






 









Purpose Built for Big Data, the First Solution for Rack-Scale Flash is Performance-Optimized for New Analytical Applications on Hadoop
 
PALO ALTO, Calif., February 29, 2016 — Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced it has expanded its technology relationship with EMC and has collaborated on a new API plug-in to enable high performance storage innovations to the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.
 
Announced today, EMC’s new DSSD D5 provides a new shared flash storage platform that provides another powerful alternative for new workloads on Apache Hadoop, the de facto framework for processing and analyzing large data sets in distributed computing environments. Cloudera’s entire application suite has been certified against DSSD D5. For customers that require the combination of secure processing and analytics on fast, persistent memory, EMC’s DSSD D5 appliance running with Cloudera Enterprise will realize an order of magnitude better performance across multiple workloads for example, random-access Apache HBase workloads.
 
In order for companies to differentiate themselves, break new ground and transform into a digital enterprise they must be able to access, store and analyze data in real-time. To do so, companies have been turning to Hadoop to execute sophisticated real-time analytics on an enterprise-wide basis.
 
“When we began working with EMC on Isilon, and when that grew to include DSSD, it was because we believed a big data architecture needed to support both local and remote storage well,” said Mike Olson, founder and chief strategy officer at Cloudera. “That work is now paying off, and I’m really excited to see what new use cases our customers and partners can realize.”
 
As the first-ever system to offer direct memory access (DMA) to flash in HDFS and its novel low-latency multi-host fabric connectivity, the DSSD D5 is ideal for running demanding real-time analytics on streaming data for applications that power sectors like the industrial internet, connected vehicles, and financial services. DSSD D5 also maximizes efficient use of flash and EMC’s unique solution with Cloudera reduces the number of copies required to one while still providing enterprise-class data availability. 
 
“Analytics capabilities aren’t nice to have—they’re absolutely critical to businesses for enhancing the customer experience, driving revenue and staying ahead of the competition,” said Jeremy Burton, President of Products and Marketing, EMC Corporation. “Our relationship with Cloudera is enabling our joint customers to extract more value from their Hadoop environments with the highest-performance flash platform of all time – it has the potential to be a true game changer.”
