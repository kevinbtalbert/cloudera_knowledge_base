Cloudera Named a Visionary in 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Warehouse Data Management Solutions for Analytics






 









“Disruption is accelerating in this market, with more demand for broad solutions that address multiple types of data and offer distributed processing and repository options”
 
PALO ALTO, Calif. – March 7, 2016: Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced that it has this year been positioned from the Challengers to the Visionaries quadrant of the 2016 Magic Quadrant for Data Warehouse and Data Management Solutions for Analytics.
The enterprise data warehouse (EDW) has long been labeled the lifeblood of organizational analytics -- in some cases fueling entire businesses. This model proved adequate for many years until the rise of a web-driven digital culture put increased demands on data collection and distributed analysis. As some organizations struggled to scale to meet the demands of more data for business decision making, others saw the need to complement their existing data warehouse infrastructure with robust, easy to use and secure Hadoop-based technologies that enable them to address challenges that demand more than a traditional EDW alone. Built with Apache Hadoop at its core, Cloudera Enterprise is a powerful and scalable data platform with the flexibility to run a variety of workloads — batch processing, interactive SQL, enterprise search, advanced analytics — together with robust security, governance, data protection and management that enterprises require.
Dr. Ralph Kimball, data warehousing / business intelligence expert and evangelist for dimensional modeling, sums up why Hadoop and the applications it empowers are having such an impact on traditional data warehousing environments: “By modernizing the “back room” of data collection and preparation, it can rapidly open the door to more data, more users, and more diverse analytic perspectives than ever before possible.”
According to Gartner, “Organizations now require data management solutions for analytics that are capable of managing and processing internal and external data of diverse types in diverse formats, in combination with data from traditional internal sources. Data may even include interaction and observational data — from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, for example. This requirement is placing new demands on software in this market as customers are looking for features and functions that represent a significant augmentation of existing enterprise data warehouse strategies.”
Additionally the report says, “This market remains, [therefore,] in a state of significant flux. Disruption to this market is likely to continue throughout 2016 and into 2017, which will erode the installed bases of the large traditional vendors. When such disruption occurs, the entire market usually moves away from a single mature trajectory and splits in two in terms of vision and execution. The result is that over the next two years, until the end of 2017, this market is likely to be much more volatile, with changes in leadership a possibility.
“Vendors are continuing to innovate and support new the use cases demanded by the IoT and digital business. For these, timeliness of access and analysis of data becomes more important than the volume and variety aspects of big data.”
The ten years since Hadoop was created have seen a maturation of Hadoop and the market it serves, and last year has been one of rapid product innovation and community partnership for Cloudera. Solid developments that aim to address the needs of a next-generation enterprise analytics environment included product advancements and new open source projects like RecordService, Apache Kudu, and Cloudera Navigator Optimizer -- all recent projects that address large scale analytic database functionality. Cloudera donated Kudu and Apache Impala to the Apache Software Foundation in order that others could benefit and contribute to the direction and improvements of the technology.
“The mass of software that we mean when we talk about Hadoop today has little in common with the code that Yahoo! rolled into production in 2006. New projects have emerged in the last ten years to broaden its utility but one thing won’t change in the near future - there’s going to be a lot of data,” said Mike Olson, founder, chairman of the Board and chief strategy officer, Cloudera. “We believe that our position in the 2016 Magic Quadrant for Data Warehouse Data Management Solutions validates our ability to innovate and provide our customers with the technology and support that they need to manage their data.
“Hadoop is a key part of the visionary roadmap and it’s clear that the demands of big data are steering the future of EDW solutions.”
