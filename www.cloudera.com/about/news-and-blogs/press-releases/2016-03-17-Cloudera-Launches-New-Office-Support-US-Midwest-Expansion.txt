MEDIA ALERT: PALO ALTO, Calif. and CHICAGO, IL – March 17, 2016 --
What: Today, Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, announced that it is opening a new and expanded office location in Chicago, Illinois. The facility will serve as the seat for Cloudera’s U.S. Midwest operations. Apache Hadoop founder and co-creator, Doug Cutting, will deliver a keynote during the grand opening celebration, which will also include an observance of Hadoop’s 10th anniversary.

Opened to provide a local presence for the growing number of Cloudera customers in the Midwest region, the office further establishes Chicago as a growing technology hub, expanding Cloudera's presence in the region, and brings additional technology jobs to the city. Addressing the needs of local companies and organizations, Cloudera will help them on their paths to success, whether they’re just getting started with open source technologies or are well on their way to realizing the value of their data.
