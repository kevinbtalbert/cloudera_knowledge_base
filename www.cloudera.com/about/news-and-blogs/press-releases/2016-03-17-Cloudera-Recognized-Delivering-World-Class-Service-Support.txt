Cloudera Recognized for Delivering World Class Service and Support






 









Company Earns Certification Under the Prestigious Service Capability & Performance (SCP) Standards
 
PALO ALTO, Calif., March 21, 2016 — Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced that it has achieved certification in accordance with the prestigious Service Capability & Performance (SCP) Standards for delivering world-class customer support. Cloudera achieved certification after an extensive audit of its Global Support operations, which spanned a twelve month period of preparation and dedicated project management. The SCP Standards quantify the effectiveness of service and support operations based upon a stringent set of over 100 major performance factors. The criteria determines the overall effectiveness of a support organization and represents the highest standards for best practices in the industry.
“In achieving certification, Cloudera demonstrated strong process discipline, an advanced portfolio of predictive and proactive services, and an outstanding commitment to customer success. This achievement clearly shows that we have a well established, mature set of best practices that meet the highest level of service and support in our industry,” said Angus Klein, vice president, Support at Cloudera. “We are the only Hadoop vendor with this kind of certification and it shows how Cloudera is dedicated to customer service excellence. We believe our customers deserve nothing less although we don’t believe that we can rest on our laurels. The process provides a guide rail for Cloudera management to recognize when we are off target and provides a framework to keep us on a path to delivering enterprise grade service that our valued customers deserve.”
For the past eighteen years, the SCP Standards have helped leading technology companies qualify the quality and effectiveness of their global service operations. The internationally recognized standards define best practices for delivering world-class service, quantify performance levels and establish a framework for continuous improvement of business processes. Certified companies must demonstrate their performance and commitment to excellence through annual recertification audits.
“Cloudera’s certification against the SCP Standards demonstrates their advanced capabilities to support their customers and a dedication to service excellence,” said Greg Coleman, vice president of strategic programs for Service Strategies. “It became abundantly clear to Service Strategies during the past year that Cloudera is intent on building a long-term sustainable business in their emerging market, which sends a clear signal to their customers that they will continue to be a strong, customer-focused company in the long run.”
Cloudera is committed to participating in an annual, comprehensive recertification audit of SCP Standards in order to adhere to standards of excellence. By opening the company up to an external audit Cloudera creates a critical feedback mechanism to constantly improve how it operates as it expands its global footprint. Cloudera is pioneering a unique business model, and as it continues to grow plans are in place to improve across the board by building processes tailored to support the company’s mission, values and interconnected workflows within the organization, keeping customer service and support front and center.
The SCP Standards focus on optimizing performance in a wide range of business process areas in order to deliver the best overall service experience. These comprehensive programs are a catalyst for driving consistency across an entire organization, and as well as improving service touchpoints they increase efficiency and productivity, enhance operational and financial performance, and create a competitive advantage. Cloudera joins the community of outstanding enterprise technology companies already certified against the SCP Standards such as Epicor Software, EMC, NetApp, Teradata, Wind River Systems, and many others that have successfully deployed the SCP Standards. Currently, over two hundred service organizations around the world are using SCP Standards to improve their business operations.
