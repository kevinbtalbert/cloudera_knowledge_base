Cloudera CEO and Intel Chief Cloud Security Architect Explain Why Organizations Are Turning to Apache Hadoop for Cybersecurity in Strata + Hadoop World Keynote






 









Open Network Insight (ONI) Project Using Big Data Analytics to Provide Visibility into Security Threats
 
MEDIA ALERT – STRATA + HADOOP WORLD SAN JOSE, Calif., – March 30, 2016 – During Strata + Hadoop World, Cloudera CEO Tom Reilly and Open Network Insight Committer and Intel Chief Cloud Security Architect Alan Ross will team up to provide a keynote explaining why organizations are turning to Apache Hadoop and the open source ecosystem for cybersecurity solutions. Attendees will learn how Hadoop-based technologies remove traditional analytics and data constraints to gain visibility and detection capabilities for the latest breed of sophisticated attacks.
 
As part of its commitment to strengthen cybersecurity capabilities across all industries, Cloudera continues to educate the market on how to take advantage of Hadoop and open source to build advanced threat detection and analytics solutions. The company recently announced its participation in the Open Network Insight (ONI) project (https://open-network-insight.org/), an open source, community-developed network data model that uses big data analytics to deliver visibility into advanced threats and attacks. ONI is set to power the next generation of cybersecurity applications with an open network data model that is supported by Cloudera’s rich partner ecosystem and strong community of growing committers.
 
Strata + Hadoop World, one of the data industry’s largest global conferences, is being held this week at the San Jose Convention Center, 150 W San Carlos St, San Jose, CA 95113. The keynote takes place on Thursday, March 31 from 8:50-9:00 a.m. PST in the Grand Ballroom.
