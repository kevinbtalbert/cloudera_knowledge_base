Press Release
Malaysian University Tunku Abdul Rahman joins Cloudera Academic Partnership to empower students with big data analytics skillsets



 









Students can access the latest Apache Hadoop curriculum and gain employment opportunities through Cloudera partnerships
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, March 30, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced that Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) has joined the Cloudera Academic Partnership (CAP) program. The partnership will allow UTAR students access to a curriculum, software and skills training for the Hadoop platform.
Globally, industries are facing a talent crunch for data professionals. In Malaysia, the number of IT graduates produced each year, which numbers about 30,000, is not enough to cater to the growth of the industry, according to the country’s National ICT (Information and Communications Technology) Association (PIKOM)[1]. The Association also believes that the current workforce requires upgrading and upscaling.
Cloudera’s Senior Director of marketing for APAC, Daniel Ng said: “A rapidly evolving data landscape is giving rise to a strong demand for skilled professionals that are able to deploy and manage big data initiatives on the Apache Hadoop data platform. CAP is one of the ways that Cloudera is leading the way in putting more data-skilled talents into the workforce.”
“The CAP program not only equips students with valuable skillsets, but it also benefits public and private sector organizations as they can harness these data talents to drive innovation and gain competitive advantage. We are currently also working with partners across industries to form an ecosystem to groom more data professionals. More will be announced regarding this initiative in the coming weeks,” added Ng.
Ir Dr. Karl Ng, Director of Innovation Capital at Multimedia Development Corporation (MDeC) said: “Data professionals are very much in demand right now and they are in short supply. Malaysia is poised to become one of South East Asia’s leading BDA hubs and with Cloudera’s CAP program, we hope to close the talent gap as well as spread the awareness on the need for more data professionals including data scientists.”

He added, “MDeC is set to embark on a major regional big data platform where the agency brings together innovative talent development models and showcases the latest Big Data Analytics (BDA) technologies. MDeC believes that talents from the CAP programme will be able to fill the demand for skilful data scientists when the platform is launched.”
UTAR is the first university in Malaysia to join the CAP program, which already counts over 100 academic institutions across the globe as members.
Ir Prof Academician Dato' Dr Chuah Hean Teik, President/CEO, UTAR, commented: “As a global university of educational excellence, we are committed to promote the use of ICT and IT-intensive learning through innovative courses and learning support systems. Cloudera’s CAP program allows us to put together a strong curriculum that encourages the intellectual and personal development of students. The program also allows our students to gain valuable skills that are in demand across sectors in the industry.”
 
How does Cloudera CAP work?
Through the CAP program, Cloudera provides partner institutions with a complete, free, industry-standard Hadoop curriculum that can be incorporated into computer science and business analytics courses. Teaching staff and students affiliated with CAP program institutions can freely download a wide selection of Cloudera supplementary training material and receive discounts on all Cloudera Certification examinations. Teaching staff also qualify for deep discounts on Cloudera University professional training delivered by Cloudera's team of expert Hadoop instructors, and benefit from up-to-date classroom tools, instructor forums, dedicated program support, and the world's largest Hadoop knowledgebase.
 
Cloudera Education Software License Program
Accredited, non-profit academic institutions can also take advantage of the more robust features of Cloudera's software suite through a special University License. CAP members have free access to Cloudera Enterprise: Data Hub Edition for 12 months to support data-intensive testing, development, and research. In conjunction with Cloudera's industry-leading open-source platform, the University License provides CAP participants with the tools needed to achieve major breakthroughs in big data.
 
Foundation for CAP Program Curriculum: Cloudera University
The CAP program curriculum was developed from the industry-leading training courses and technical certifications offered by Cloudera University, which focuses on Apache Hadoop, its ecosystem and data science. Cloudera University offers the world's most complete and comprehensive Hadoop education programs for data professionals.
To date, Cloudera has trained more than 40,000 participants and certified more than 10,000 Hadoop professionals. Over 65% of the Fortune 100 and all 20 of the top 20 global technology firms have leveraged Cloudera's expertise to train employees on Apache Hadoop.
