Cloudera Proposes to Donate Bikeshed to The Apache Software Foundation






 









PALO ALTO, Calif., April 01, 2016 -- Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache™ Hadoop® and the latest open source technologies, announced today that it will submit a proposal for the Bikeshed project to join the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). By donating this critical project to the ASF, Cloudera aims to accelerate the growth and diversity of all developer communities.
Since the beginning of software design, there has been a need for individuals to offer strong opinions on key features related to the project. These discussions revolve around naming objects, and logo designs, although the Bikeshed project hopes to grow to encompass naming modules, website colors, error messages and renaming objects. Bikeshed exists to provide structure and rigor around these crucially trivial discussions, whether they be in-person, in a JIRA or on the mailing list. Typically, as projects grow in complexity, the amount of meaningful feedback on larger features is minimal, however everyone seems to have an opinion on relatively meaningless design decisions. Little or no knowledge of systems is required.
Extended discussion, thought, and scrutiny, paid to details which have small impact on the project as a whole, is something that all engineers can understand. The timing is right to introduce this framework, or template, or whatever it turns out to be, to the community at large. We believe the ASF is the correct venue to foster the continued operation of this project, in spite of any internal Bikeshed stagnation.
"Bikeshedding is far too important to the software industry for us to be casual about it. Bringing the global community together to collaborate on this project guarantees that we'll bikeshed better than we've ever bikeshedded before. I look forward to your thoughts on this press release quote," said Mike Olson, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Cloudera.
