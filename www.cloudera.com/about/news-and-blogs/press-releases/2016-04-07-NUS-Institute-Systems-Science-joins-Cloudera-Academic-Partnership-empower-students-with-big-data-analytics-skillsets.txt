Press Release
NUS Institute of Systems Science Joins Cloudera Academic Partnership to Empower Students with Big Data Analytics Skillsets



 









Students can access the latest Apache Hadoop curriculum and gain employment opportunities through Cloudera partnerships
SINGAPORE, April 6, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced that the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Institute of Systems Science (NUS-ISS) has joined the Cloudera Academic Partnership (CAP) program. The partnership provides access to curriculum, software and skills training for the Hadoop platform.
Globally, industries are facing a data professional talent crunch. In Singapore, the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) has projected that the country will face a shortage of nearly 30,000 information technology professionals by 2017, particularly in the fields of cybersecurity, data analytics and applications development[1].
Cloudera Senior Director, APAC, Daniel Ng said: “A rapidly evolving data landscape is giving rise to a strong demand for skilled professionals that are able to deploy and manage big data initiatives on the Hadoop platform. CAP is one of the ways that Cloudera is leading the way in putting more data-skilled talents into the workforce.”
“The CAP program not only equips students with valuable skillsets, but it also benefits public and private sector organisations as they can harness these data talents to drive innovation and gain competitive advantage. We are currently also working with partners across industries to form an ecosystem to groom more data professionals. More will be announced regarding this initiative in the coming weeks.”
Dr Leong Mun Kew, Deputy Director of NUS-ISS said, “At NUS-ISS, we provide our students with a high quality practice-oriented curriculum and ensure that they are equipped with skills they will need as they pursue a career in the industry. Cloudera’s CAP program allows us to put together a distinctive programme that can keep our students on the forefront of technology in a cost effective manner within a short timeframe.”
 
How does Cloudera CAP work?
Through the CAP program, Cloudera provides partner institutions with a complete, free, industry-standard Hadoop curriculum that can be incorporated into computer science and business analytics courses. Teaching staff and students affiliated with CAP program institutions can freely download a wide selection of Cloudera supplementary training material and receive discounts on all Cloudera Certification examinations. Teaching staff also qualify for deep discounts on Cloudera University professional training delivered by Cloudera's team of expert Hadoop instructors, and benefit from up-to-date classroom tools, instructor forums, dedicated program support, and the world's largest Hadoop knowledgebase.
 
Cloudera Education Software License Program
Accredited, non-profit academic institutions can also take advantage of the more robust features of Cloudera's software suite through a special University License. CAP members have free access to Cloudera Enterprise: Data Hub Edition for 12 months to support data-intensive testing, development, and research. In conjunction with Cloudera's industry-leading open-source platform, the University License provides CAP participants with the tools needed to achieve major breakthroughs in big data.
 
Foundation for CAP Program Curriculum: Cloudera University
The CAP program curriculum was developed from the industry-leading training courses and technical certifications offered by Cloudera University, which focuses on Apache Hadoop, its ecosystem and data science. Cloudera University offers the world's most complete and comprehensive Hadoop education programs for data professionals.
To date, Cloudera has trained more than 40,000 participants and certified more than 10,000 Hadoop professionals. Over 65% of the Fortune 100 and all 20 of the top 20 global technology firms have leveraged Cloudera's expertise to train employees on Apache Hadoop.
