Press Release
Now Accepting Nominations for the Fourth Annual Data Impact Awards



 









Spotlighting Modern Data Platforms that Are Transforming Business, Industry, and Society at Large
PALO ALTO, Calif., – April 12, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, announced today that it is accepting nominations for the fourth annual Data Impact Awards. The program, which grew 55 percent year-over-year based on number of nominations in 2015, celebrates organizations’ exceptional achievements using Cloudera’s market-leading Hadoop distribution, CDH, to modernize their data management infrastructures and drive smarter business decisions, delivering tangible results that impact IT, business, and society.
Organizations across all geographies and industries have embraced the need to evolve from being gut-driven to data-driven in recent years, due in large part to the interconnectivity of devices and rise of the Internet of Things (IoT). In summary of research released by the Economist Intelligence Unit, Forbes’ Bernard Marr reported that 60 percent of executives surveyed around the world believe data is generating revenue within their organizations and 83 percent say it is making existing services and products more profitable.[1] Opportunities to discover new solutions that solve the world’s biggest challenges are being made possible by the ability to store, manage, and analyze data without limits.
The 2016 Data Impact Awards will recognize CDH achievements in eight categories:
●      Data-Driven Product/Service
●      Business Risk Reduction
●      Customer Insight
●      Social Impact
●      Data Platform Optimization
●      IoT Empowerment
●      Cybersecurity Modernization
●      Fast Track to Future-Ready
 
Nominations Now Open
Nominations are now open to any organization that uses CDH in a production environment. All nominations will be evaluated by a panel of guest judges -- comprised of industry analysts, media, and thought leaders -- based on four criteria: creativity, results, maturity, and relevance. There is no cost to enter.
How to Enter

Learn more about the program or submit a nomination: www.cloudera.com/data-impact
Deadline to submit is August 15, 2016
Winners will be announced the week of September 26, 2016, in tandem with Strata + Hadoop World, New York

“The 2015 Data Impact Awards brought to light applications of the technology across the economy and around the world. The winners are doing everything from optimizing the distribution of refrigerated food around North America, improving the analysis of fires across the country, and fighting sexual exploitation of children over the internet, just to name a few,” said Alan Saldich, vice president of Marketing, Cloudera. “It’s always a gratifying and humbling exercise to learn about the amazing and sometimes inspiring ways our technology is making an impact, and we look forward to seeing what stories surface this year as implementations continue to mature and the ecosystem continues to evolve.”
