Press Release
Cloudera and Capgemini to Accelerate Organizations’ Transformation to Big Data Analytics with Capgemini’s new Industrialized Solution - Leap Data Transformation Framework



 









Customers realize more than 30% efficiencies in migration and transformation projects to next-generation Big Data Analytics platforms powered by Cloudera Enterprise
STRATA + HADOOP WORLD LONDON, June 1, 2016 – Cloudera, the leader in enterprise analytic data management powered by Apache Hadoop™, today announced a new industrialized software framework called Leap Data Transformation Framework built by Capgemini on top of Cloudera Enterprise.
Capgemini’s Leap Data Transformation Framework is an industrialized solution aimed at speeding up the end-to-end process of transforming existing BI and data warehouse systems with the new world of big data analytics, from discovery and estimation of effort, to development, testing and integration accelerators.
Cloudera provides the fastest, easiest and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop. With this platform, organizations are able to focus on insights-driven business outcomes, putting data at the core of their decision processes and operations. With Capgemini’s Leap Data Transformation Framework, organizations can now drastically accelerate their time-to-value in optimizing their current BI and data warehouse platforms with Cloudera Enterprise.
The first transformation projects utilizing Capgemini’s Leap Data Transformation Framework delivered jointly in the public sector by Capgemini and Cloudera have already shown more than 30% efficiencies in scope reduction, build efforts and testing.
“Capgemini’s Leap Data Transformation Framework is a great example of combining process and technology to increase value and reduce time to market for transitioning from traditional analytics to big data analytics,” said Tim Stevens, vice president, Corporate and Business Development, Cloudera. “With Cloudera at its core, Capgemini’s Leap Data Transformation Framework will allow our joint customers to stay ahead of the big data evolution and gain the ability to drive deeper analytic insight from more complete, longer-term datasets quickly.”

Industrialized approaches to Big Data Drives Bigger, Faster Business Value
As big data projects are becoming increasingly pervasive in the enterprise, only industrialized approaches can deliver business outcomes successfully. Capgemini’s Leap Data Transformation Framework was specifically developed for this situation. It provides an automatic assessment of the real usage and potential functional redundancies of legacy BI systems, allowing customers to optimize the scope of transformation projects. A metadata-driven application development process, and a test automation framework guarantees high-quality production rollouts.
 
“Organizations are looking at transforming their business operations with data. Analytics aren’t considered a nice to have anymore, they are at the very core of any company’s strategy,” said Anne-Laure Thieullent, Global Big Data Solutions Director, Capgemini Insights & Data. “Our clients can’t afford to be slowed down by non-industrialized approaches to transforming to big data. With Capgemini’s Leap Data Transformation Framework we deliver a bullet proof and cost optimized approach for these projects, so that our clients can get to business outcomes faster.”
Capgemini’s Leap Data Transformation Framework constitutes a new approach to data warehouse and BI transformations to a digital enterprise, decreasing risks of such complex projects with a modular but industrialized approach. With this framework, Cloudera and Capgemini jointly deliver big data transformation in a more cost efficient manner, guaranteeing business value.
Capgemini’s Leap Data Transformation Framework is part of Capgemini’s Ready2Series solutions catalogue, and has been formally certified by Cloudera.
