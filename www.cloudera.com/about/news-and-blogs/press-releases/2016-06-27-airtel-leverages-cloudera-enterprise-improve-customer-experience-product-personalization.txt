Airtel Leverages Cloudera Enterprise to Improve Customer Experience and Product Personalization






 









India’s Largest Telecommunications Company Builds 360-Degree View of Customers from Hadoop-based Platform for Successful Omni-channel Campaigns.
NEW DELHI, India, 27 June, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, announced today that Bharti Airtel Limited (Airtel), India’s largest telecommunications services provider, has adopted Cloudera Enterprise to build a 360-degree view of their customers in India, enabling them to better leverage customer data to execute successful omni-channel campaigns and influence buyers in a highly competitive market.
Communications service providers (CSPs) are amongst the world’s biggest aggregators of consumer information and have to keep pace in order to gain insights into their customers’ preferences and networks. Many CSPs, like Airtel, are utilizing Cloudera Enterprise to securely bring together user, network, device, business and social data to drive customer intimacy, improve network performance and drive new revenue streams.
Airtel's product offerings in India include wireless and fixed services, mobile commerce, high speed DSL broadband, IPTV, DTH, and national and international long distance services to carriers. With over 265 million customers across its India operations, Airtel faces the immense task of making sense of and leveraging huge volumes of customer and network data they collect on a daily basis, which was previously stored in multiple traditional systems built over a period of time.
“As part of our digital journey at Airtel, our main focus is on providing the best customer experience with our new Business Intelligence (BI) and analytics platform, powered by Cloudera. Now, we are able to gain an even greater technical edge, empowering our marketers with intelligent data and analytics to make better decisions and improve the entire customer lifecycle with customized offerings.” said Harmeen Mehta, Group CIO for Bharti Airtel Limited.
With Cloudera Enterprise now at the core of Airtel's information architecture, the massive volumes of data are in a centralized location, across formats, and available to all business users and groups, with full fidelity and security, but at a lower capital expenditure per terabyte compared to traditional data management mechanisms.
“CSPs, like Airtel, have access to massive volumes of data from a variety of sources,” said Vishal Rao, Senior Vice President, Field Operations, Cloudera. “Cloudera’s goal is to provide a fast, easy and secure platform, built on Apache Hadoop, that enables our customers to easily build predictive models for smarter decision making. These models can then be leveraged to indicate customer churn, develop insight-driven marketing campaigns, and ultimately lead to a higher wallet share by delivering better products and services for end-customers.”
