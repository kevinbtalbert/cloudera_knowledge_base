Press Release
Cloudera Eases the Path for Analytics on Apache Hadoop with the General Availability of Cloudera Navigator Optimizer and Cloudera Enterprise 5.8



 









Cloudera Navigator Optimizer Adds Predictability when Offloading Workloads to Hadoop and Active Data Optimization for Peak Performance with Hadoop
PALO ALTO, Calif., July 21, 2016 — Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced the general availability of Cloudera Navigator Optimizer, alongside the production release of Cloudera Enterprise 5.8. Since the announcement of the limited beta release of Navigator Optimizer, the tool has proven essential for customers looking to modernize their analytic database or augment their data warehouse solution with Hadoop, providing the necessary insights for predictably offloading key workloads. Additionally, this tool provides database administrators the usage visibility to actively manage Hadoop data models and guidance to optimize query performance. Now generally available, customers looking to power their analytic workloads with Cloudera Enterprise can benefit from this unique tool to ease their path for Hadoop success. Complemented by the release of Cloudera Enterprise 5.8, which includes cloud-native support for high-performance analytics and a powerful SQL development experience, these unrivaled capabilities make great strides for Cloudera’s Hadoop platform as a modern analytic database.
“Across our customers, adopting Cloudera Enterprise as a Hadoop-based analytic database is one of the most popular use cases. Cloudera’s platform - leveraging best-of-breed technologies such as Hive-on-Spark and Impala -  brings new scale, flexibility, and performance to these analytic workloads including ETL, BI, and exploratory analytics,” says Charles Zedlewski, vice president, Products at Cloudera. “To help our customers more effectively get on the path for Hadoop success, we’re excited to provide Cloudera Navigator Optimizer as a unique new tool. It provides the visibility and guidance necessary to help decrease the development costs when offloading to Hadoop and actively optimize these workloads for peak performance.”
Hadoop has proven itself as a strong complement to existing enterprise data warehouses (EDW), able to relieve the pressures of these systems, while enabling new workloads. Additionally, with Impala as the interactive SQL engine, Cloudera’s platform provides a high-performance, scalable alternative to traditional analytic databases - allowing businesses to tap into more value from more data, faster, and with more flexibility. However, effectively offloading key workloads to Hadoop isn’t always easy, especially when organizations have millions of queries generated of varying complexity. Businesses need to be able to identify the most suitable workloads for each system and develop a predictable offload strategy. Cloudera Navigator Optimizer eases the path for offloading the right workloads to Hadoop by analyzing existing SQL jobs and providing the instant insights and risk-assessments necessary to build out a comprehensive strategy and plan for offloading based on risk and development costs.
Once active with Hadoop, Navigator Optimizer provides usage-level visibility into these Hadoop workloads so database administrators can actively manage and recommend data models based on changing needs. Built-in optimization guidance for Apache Hive and Apache Impala also enables peak performance for faster data preparation, BI, and exploratory analytics.
Further enhancing the capabilities of Cloudera Enterprise as a modern analytic database solution, the Cloudera 5.8 also includes:

Cloud-Native High-Performance Analytics: Impala now supports Amazon S3 - joining Hive and Apache Spark - to enable analysts to get instant insights from all their data, including data stored in cloud environments.
Improved SQL Development Experience: Within the open-source Hue interface, SQL developers can easily explore and discover available tables through quickviews; quickly design queries with autocomplete suggestions; and get immediate assistance for debugging queries before they run for efficient troubleshooting. In addition, queries and results can be seamlessly shared with other users and groups, with the ability to directly set access permissions on results for trusted security.

Cloudera Enterprise 5.8 is now available for download and Cloudera Navigator Optimizer is available with the appropriate user license at optimizer.cloudera.com. Cloudera also offers world-class Data Analyst training for businesses looking to get started with Cloudera Enterprise as their analytic database solution.
