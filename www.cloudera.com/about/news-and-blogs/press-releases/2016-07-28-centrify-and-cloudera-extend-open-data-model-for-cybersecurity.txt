Press Release
Centrify and Cloudera Extend Open Data Model for Cybersecurity



 









Growing Community Continues to Meet Enterprise Demand for Apache Hadoop-Based Cybersecurity Solutions
PALO ALTO, Calif., July 28, 2016 — Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, and Centrify, the leader in securing enterprise identities, today announced that Centrify has joined the Open Network Insight (ONI) project. ONI is an open source, Apache 2.0 licensed cybersecurity project that leverages big data and machine learning to detect advanced threats. ONI provides an open data model for Network and with the addition of Centrify to the project will be extended to include identity.  By extending ONI’s open data model into identity, Centrify is allowing users to centralize identity and account credential data, integrate it into cybersecurity applications that leverage ONI, and to share related threat analytics and intelligence among industry peers.
“Centrify’s participation marks a major milestone for ONI,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer of Cloudera. “By adding the ability to integrate information about user identities alongside of data about network traffic and endpoints, the project is fulfilling on its promise to support a broad range of cybersecurity data sources that can be used to identify advanced threats and cyberattacks.”
Insights into how identities are being used are critical, as hijacked credentials have led to some of the largest compromises in history. Furthermore, the 2016 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)[1] states that stolen and misused credentials continue to play a major role in most data breaches. With Centrify, ONI will provide on-demand analytics needed to understand how user accounts and activities are impacting security and compliance across users’ environments.  
“We are excited to join the ONI community to further expand the underlying open data model to identity-based security,” said Bill Mann, Chief Product Officer for Centrify. “Our approach to cybersecurity needs a rethink, and ONI is an example of that.  Community-driven efforts will play a major role in the future of cybersecurity since this project is leveraging machine learning and big data analytics in ways that are addressing risk with speed, efficiency and accuracy.
Centrify joins a growing community comprised of Cloudera cybersecurity partners and customers. Among them are Anomali, Cloudwick, Intel, Jask, Cybraics, and Webroot. To learn more about the ONI visit: https://open-network-insight.org/
