Yang Bin, the Vice President of Tsinghua University, said: “Big data applications are like a speed train with nuclear fusion powered system, it will give tremendous power and opportunities to countries like China. With the continuous increase of global demands for data scientists, researchers and analysts, the talents with related big data professional skills are prone to obtain higher salaries and more comprehensive career paths.”
Chief Architect of Cloudera and the creator of Apache Hadoop, Doug Cutting said: “Hadoop is now in its prime time and this momentum is expected to continue for another several decades. Hadoop is ten years old, Cloudera just had its eighth anniversary and we have been in China for over 18 months. The cooperation with Tsinghua University clearly will enhance market development of Hadoop in China. And we are very proud to contribute to China’s big data talent education”.

Designed to strategically fill the skilled data professionals gap that the industry is currently facing, BASE pulls industry players and academic institutions together to equip more people with necessary skills in the areas of big data and analytics.
