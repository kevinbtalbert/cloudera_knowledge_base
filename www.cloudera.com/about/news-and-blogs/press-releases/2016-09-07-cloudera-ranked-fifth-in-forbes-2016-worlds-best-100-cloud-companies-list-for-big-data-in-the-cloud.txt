Press Release
Cloudera Ranked Fifth in Forbes 2016 World’s Best 100 Cloud Companies List for Big Data in the Cloud



 









Forbes Attributes Significant Revenue Growth and Advanced Innovation to the Only Apache Hadoop Based Data Management and Analytics Platform to Support Hybrid Cloud Environments in Its Ranking
PALO ALTO, Calif., September 7, 2016 — Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced it ranked #5 on the first-ever Forbes 2016 Cloud 100 list. Developed by Forbes in partnership with Bessemer Venture Partners, it’s a definitive list of the top 100 private cloud companies in the world. Forbes attributes significant revenue growth and advanced innovation to Cloudera, the only Apache Hadoop based data management and analytics platform to support hybrid cloud environments, in its evaluation and overall ranking of the company.
As the leading analytic data management platform provider based on a modern Apache Hadoop based architecture, Cloudera is uniquely positioned as a cloud platform provider.  Only Cloudera provides a data management platform that is elastic, multi-cloud and enterprise grade. 
“Cloudera enables enterprises to use big data to solve high value business problems, and leveraging cloud infrastructure to lower costs and improve agility,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. “Cloudera is setting the standard for big data in the cloud and is honored to receive recognition from Forbes and Bessemer Venture Partners.”
“Cloud companies are revolutionizing how businesses reach their customers today from digitizing painful old processes to allowing them more time to focus on what they really care about—what makes their products unique,” said Alex Konrad, Forbes editor of the Cloud 100 list. “Inclusion in the Forbes 2016 Cloud 100 list recognizes a company for its financial growth and excellence as recognized by customers and peers.”
“These are the companies to watch,” said Byron Deeter, a leading cloud investor and partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “The Forbes Cloud 100 companies represent the very best private companies in cloud computing. We will see big IPOs and category killers emerge from this list as cloud computing continues to propel the trillion-dollar software industry.”
Methodology
The first-ever Forbes 2016 Cloud 100 list profiles the world’s top-tier private companies leading the cloud technology revolution, plus twenty rising stars within the field. With advancements in software, cloud security, or platform development, these companies are redefining the future for all industries and sectors.
Forbes, in partnership with Bessemer Venture Partners, received hundreds of submissions to identify the most promising private companies in cloud. The Forbes 2016 Cloud 100 was selected by a panel of judges representing leading public cloud companies, using qualitative and quantitative data submitted by nominees, along with publicly available third-party data sources.
To view the list, please visit www.forbes.com/cloud100. This will also appear in the October 4, 2016 issue of Forbes magazine.
Recognition
Every company named to the Forbes 2016 Cloud 100 is recognized in print and online by Forbes, and Forbes’ partners Bessemer Venture Partners and Salesforce Ventures.  The companies also receive physical awards and digital badges signifying their inclusion on this exclusive list, as well as an invitation to the celebratory Cloud 100 Awards Dinner, hosted in San Francisco by Forbes, Bessemer Venture Partners and Salesforce Ventures.
