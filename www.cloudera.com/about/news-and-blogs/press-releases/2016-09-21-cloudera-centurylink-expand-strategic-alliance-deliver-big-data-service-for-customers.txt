Cloudera and CenturyLink Expand Strategic Alliance to Deliver Big Data as a Service for Customers 






 









Agreement aims to drive competitive advantage for CenturyLink customers by enabling them to better leverage their cloud data
PALO ALTO, Calif., September 21, 2016 — Companies across the globe have recognized the value they can derive from their big data to enable better business decision-making, transform their businesses and create competitive advantages. To enable customers to more effectively and efficiently use these innovative technology solutions, Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced an expanded partnership with CenturyLink, Inc., a global communications, hosting, cloud and IT services company. Together, Cloudera and CenturyLink Global IT Services are working to deliver big data as a service to enable customers to gain value from all their data.
As part of being a preferred partner, CenturyLink’s Global IT Services is delivering a fully managed big data solution powered by Cloudera Enterprise. This combined big data offering will exponentially speed time to deploy Cloudera Enterprise and also simplify some of the management complexities from Hadoop operations, so that customers can spend more time working with data and generating new insights that drive business growth.
“CenturyLink and Cloudera are aligned not just from a technology standpoint, but also in our shared interest in helping customers get more value out of all of their data,” said Gary Gauba, president, CenturyLink Cognilytics. “That’s why in addition to offering a platform for big data management and analytics in the cloud, we are also focused on delivering value-added use cases that run on this platform and help our customers become more agile and responsive.”
By leveraging Cloudera Enterprise, CenturyLink will gain a more complete view of its customers across all its systems, products, and diverse interaction channels. This entails integrating all existing data sources and ingesting real-time data. CenturyLink will use the Cloudera platform to perform advanced analytics in the areas of Software Defined Networks as well as Network Virtualization to proactively monitor and further optimize its global communications network.
“CenturyLink and Cloudera have a history of outstanding customer service and innovation, and we’re pleased to be helping deliver a data management and analytics platform that drives significant business benefits,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer, Cloudera. “CenturyLink’s big data-as-a-service offerings will make concepts like advanced analytics, machine learning, and real-time data more available and accessible to more people. And that’s where true business transformation happens.”
CenturyLink’s big data-as-a-service solutions are under development and expected to be generally available later this year. Cloudera managed services by CenturyLink are generally available today.
