Press Release
Cloudera Forms Precision Medicine Advisory Council to Reinforce Commitment to White House's Precision Medicine Initiative



 









Inaugural Council Members Include Practitioners from The Broad Institute, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, Seattle Children’s Research Institute and the University of Texas at Austin
PALO ALTO, Calif., September 28, 2016 - Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today unveiled its Precision Medicine Advisory Council to support the company’s commitment to the President’s Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) in advancing the use of data and analytics in precision medicine and genomics. The Advisory Council will help Cloudera evaluate grant applications from university labs requesting software and training to analyze and manage precision medicine data.
“The National Institutes of Health says that big data is one reason precision medicine can exist today at scale,” said Mike Olson, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Cloudera. “Cloudera knows big data, and our customers, partners, and colleagues have deep expertise in biology, bioinformatics, genomics combined with technology for in research and patient-centered applications. Our new Advisory Council will help us ensure that grantees under the Cloudera Precision Medicine program are advancing the state of the art in healthcare with big data.”
Inaugural members of the Precision Medicine Advisory Council include:

Niall Lennon, Ph.D. of the Broad Institute
“Precision medicine requires a set of capabilities for genomics, clinical data, public and open data, HIPAA, security and more. Ensuring grantees can quickly stand up Cloudera and be effective with best practices approaches can ensure success.”


Tod Davis of Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta
"Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta is committed to embracing precision medicine, research, and improved outcomes," said Tod Davis of Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, “Our long commitment to innovation to drive better pediatric outcomes continues through big data, especially as it relates to precision medicine.”


Sean Taylor, Ph.D. of Seattle Children’s Research Institute
“In the world of the $1000 genome, our researchers are inundated with data. The challenge now isn’t to get enough data, it is to distill it; to find the connections, those nuggets that lead to brilliant insights and breakthrough technologies. Life science has become a data science, and that is what precision medicine is all about. Our goal is to empower researchers with the right tools and the right training to ask the right questions from the right data so that magic can happen.” 


Ari Kahn, Ph.D. of the University of Texas at Austin
“Organizations like Cloudera who are adding their assets to the effort are key to enabling the community to leapfrog where we are today” said Ari Kahn, Ph.D. of the University of Texas at Austin. “As computer scientists and research scientists, we can add our expertise to bridge the gap between big data and precision medicine to ensure labs are able to succeed.”
 

“We have a world-class, experienced group of individuals joining our Advisory Council,” said Shawn Dolley, Industry Leader of Health and Life Science at Cloudera. “These are passionate practitioners who represent what the mission of precision medicine is about.”
Cloudera has committed to providing enterprise software and support to 50 labs performing precision medicine research, and to train 1,000 precision medicine researchers in the concepts of big data. To begin, the first grant awarded will be to Emory University for precision medicine research in women’s health. “The research we will do in women and children’s health will increasingly require big data,” said Alicia Smith Ph.D., Vice Chair of Ob/Gyn Research at Emory University School of Medicine. “Cloudera’s grant will provide us with the opportunity to be supported as we continue our informatics innovation leveraging genotype, methylation, and deep phenotypes.”
Cloudera expects to grow the Advisory Council over time to align with the growing number of grant applicants. Interested applicants can visit the program website and apply online starting in October 2016.
