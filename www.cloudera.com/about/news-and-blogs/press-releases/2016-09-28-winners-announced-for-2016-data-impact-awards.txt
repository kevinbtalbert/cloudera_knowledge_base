Press Release
Cloudera Announces 2016 Data Impact Award Winners



 









Highlights Successful Hadoop-based Implementations that Are Modernizing Datacenters and Transforming Businesses
STRATA+HADOOP WORLD NEW YORK, NY – September 28, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced the winners of the 2016 Data Impact Awards. The awards celebrate organizations that have implemented big data and analytics platforms based on CDH, the open source Hadoop-based distribution, with remarkable success. The winning organizations’ implementations demonstrate exemplary creativity, maturity, industry or application relevance, and tangible results, as evaluated by a panel of nearly 30 industry experts. The winners were announced at the annual Data Impact Awards Celebration hosted by Cloudera on September 27, 2016 in New York City.
“Not only did this year’s program elicit a larger number of nominations than ever before, but the level of detail and maturity articulated in each of the nominations was especially impressive,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. “From a large bank in Thailand to a global pharmaceutical company to a Silicon Valley start-up, the diversity of this year’s applicants was also unprecedented. Thanks to all nominees for enlightening us with your stories.”
The winners of the 2016 Data Impact Awards are:
 
Business Risk Reduction – Nordea
The largest bank in the Nordic region has implemented a Cloudera data lake architecture that allows Nordea to produce, report, and monitor core data faster and with better data quality management than ever before. The solution loads data in real-time, empowers agile delivery with daily release cycles and has reduced time to market to a fraction of previous change cycles -- all while reducing operating expenses significantly.
 
Customer Insight – tie between Drawbridge and NGDATA
Drawbridge is a cross-device identity company whose enterprise data hub ingests more than four trillion observations per week, 60 billion data and ad requests per day, 1.2 billion cookie syncs per day, and observes 360 million mobile devices per day so marketers can run and optimize cross-device campaigns in real-time. The precision of its Connected Consumer Graph has been independently verified at 97.3 percent. This cross-device identity framework forms the base of the entire Drawbridge platform.
NGDATA’s Lily Enterprise customer experience operating system delivers a complete customer DNA, ingesting data streams from every available source including point of sale systems, enterprise applications, social media sites, and more to deliver real-time insights and drive omni-channel experiences. Clients in banking, telecommunications, and media/publishing have gained tangible results from using Lily to personalize their customers’ experiences and interactions.
 
Cybersecurity Modernization  – Accenture Security
The behavioral-based Accenture Cyber Intelligence Platform (ACIP) leverages Apache Spark and Apache Impala to ingest billions of events per day. The platform then applies proprietary artificial intelligence techniques to the massive data set in near real-time, identifying never before seen internal and external threats that can easily bypass traditional security approaches.  
 
Data Platform Optimization – tie between Dun & Bradstreet (nominated by Cognizant Technology Solutions) and Yellow Pages (nominated by AtScale, Inc.)
Dun & Bradstreet’s Global Archived Data Project has reduced the time it takes to transfer years of information across international borders from months to days or hours -- driving more than $2.5 million in revenue and reducing data modeling costs by roughly $150,000 per score developed.
Yellow Pages, a Canadian digital media and marketing solutions company, has implemented a BI-on-Hadoop solution powered by Cloudera, AtScale, and Tableau to make the content and actions offered to its clients more relevant. The new environment is 20 to 200X faster while giving business users, data scientists, executives, and clients a single universal semantic layer.
 
Data-Driven Product/Service – Intel - Advanced Analytics
Intel’s Advanced Analytics group has built a machine learning platform on Cloudera to uncover hidden bugs and shorten time-to-market of its products. The platform robustly and quickly browses through many thousands of historical tests records to uncover hidden patterns; this task would take a human hundreds to thousands of hours and would be impractical to perform manually.
 
Fast Track to Future-Ready – Credit Suisse Group AG
Credit Suisse Group AG, one of the world’s leading global private banks with distinctive investment banking capabilities, set out to standardize on an enterprise-wide big data and analytics platform. Within a year, Credit Suisse productionalized the Cloudera-based platform with numerous additions including a number of security, authentication, and rapid push-button deployment enhancements. This allows any user that has completed associated prerequisites to get up and running on Hadoop in hours, not weeks, and has spurred many organizations across the bank to adopt the new platform.
 
IoT Empowerment – Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC)
Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) oversees the state’s transportation system, which includes 27,000 miles of highways, 230 airports and heliports, and more than three million drivers. KYTC has built a real-time weather response system that incorporates real-time data from Waze, HERE, ESRI’s GeoEvent processor, and Automatic Vehicle Locations (providing sensor data from salt trucks). KYTC can aggregate 15-20 million records every 24 hours and process more than a million records per second.
 
Social Impact – Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC)
The state’s weather response system is helping Kentucky manage snow and ice events in real-time by optimizing the use of salt on roadways, prioritizing routes, and understanding the environmental impacts of over-salting and plowing. The system is targeted to replace KYTC’s legacy 511 system providing real-time emergency road response and allowing KYTC to quickly adapt operations to changes in weather and traffic conditions that arise; supporting optimization of routes to save on net salt distribution costs. The best practices learned from building this system also allowed KYTC to help the state of Louisiana take advantage of data streams such as Waze during the recent flood crisis.
