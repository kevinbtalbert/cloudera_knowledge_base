Press Release
Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Inaugurates New Cloudera Budapest Offices



 









Cloudera Reaffirms Commitment to Central Europe with New Expanded Budapest Offices; Plans for over 275% Employee Growth
BUDAPEST, Hungary, – October 5, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop™ and the latest open source technologies, today announced the inauguration of its new Budapest offices by Levente Magyar, State Secretary for Economic Diplomacy for Hungary. Working with the Hungarian Investment Promotion Agency (HIPA), Cloudera is expanding its Budapest location to serve as a notable R&D center for Central Europe, a recruitment hub for local talent, and to serve as a technology ambassador to universities and other local businesses.
Cloudera’s new offices will expand to incorporate R&D, recruitment for talent across Central Europe, and foster partnerships with other electronics manufacturers and research companies in the region who are also drivers of innovation and economic growth in the country. Cloudera’s roadmap for their offices in Budapest is centered on building  long-term collaborative relationships aimed at investing in the local talent and economy through its proximity to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and eighteen universities including Eötvös Loránd University, the Budapest University of Technology and Economics and the Central European University. The new facility, located next to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, represents Cloudera's substantial commitment to Budapest—one of the largest regional economies in the European Union.
"The Hungarian Government looks for partners who are willing to make strategic investments in our local economy. Cloudera’s commitment to the region by expanding their operations and creating more new skilled job opportunities in the ICT market is important to supporting our goal of being one of the leading knowledge centers in Europe," said State Secretary for Economic Diplomacy for Hungary, Levente Magyar. "We look forward to a long and meaningful partnership with Cloudera."
By 2019, Cloudera expects to be fully operational across all areas of our business and to have achieved staffing capacity. "Broadening our presence here in Budapest is an important step for us as a company," said Mike Olson, chief strategy officer for Cloudera. "It’s a vibrant city of innovation with a wealth of opportunity for startups and enterprises alike and where the latest advances in technology and cutting edge R&D present opportunities to gain first hand experience. This presence will deepen our ability to serve and support our customers all across Central Europe and contribute to the local economy in a meaningful way."
