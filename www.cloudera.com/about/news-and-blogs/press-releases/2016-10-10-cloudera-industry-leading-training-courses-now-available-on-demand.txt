Press Release
Cloudera’s Industry Leading Training Courses Now Available On Demand



 









Professional Hadoop Training is Accessible Anytime, Anywhere
PALO ALTO, Calif., – October 10, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced Cloudera OnDemand, a catalog of online, self-paced training classes covering Cloudera's entire portfolio of industry-standard Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark training courses, allowing individuals to learn about the latest big data technologies in a searchable environment anytime, anywhere. Cloudera OnDemand allows users to learn Hadoop at their own pace and without the need to travel or take multiple days off to participate in live training events.
Cloudera OnDemand is the company’s eLearning platform that combines recorded lectures from Cloudera senior instructors with hands-on exercises completed in a cloud-based lab environment. Whether you’re an individual looking to expand your hands-on knowledge of Hadoop, or a company in need of training teams of developers, administrators, analysts, and prospective data scientists, Cloudera is making access to materials and tools seamless.
“With Cloudera OnDemand, we've made our training courses more accessible to our customers, as well as organizations thinking about deploying a big data solution,” said Mark Morrissey, senior director, Education Programs at Cloudera. “With our cloud-based lab environment, students don't need to worry about onerous hardware requirements, they simply need access to the web to start learning immediately. This is going to dramatically change the requirements of big data training and allow many more developers to flourish in a big data environment.”
In a December 2015 article, CIO Magazine covered the lack of technical skills business challenge. "Two-thirds of companies that possess even the most advanced analytics capabilities cannot hire enough people who can generate insights from corporate data, according to new research from A.T. Kearney, which surveyed 430 senior executives. Moreover, companies will need 33 percent more big data talent over the next five years [per] Khalid Khan, A.T. Kearney partner and co-author of the research.”
Open source platforms like Cloudera Enterprise have become the de-facto standard for driving business transformation across the value chain, from compliance and cost reduction to customer intimacy and competitive advantage. However, global organizations still face a skills gap - a lack of trained data professionals. Cloudera’s commitment to solving this skills gap is evidenced by its strong focus on education, a consistently expanding curriculum based on needs and interest, and their work with governments and universities around the world driving active involvement in open source software communities.
For companies with teams of users, Cloudera OnDemand presents an ideal setting for collaborative learning. Within Cloudera's training platform, students can interact with individuals from around the world allowing for more detailed discussion, archived answers to potential questions, and the opportunity to learn about different use cases. Customers that wish to keep their conversations internal, have the option to create private groups.  
Cloudera's OnDemand offering can be purchased as a library where individuals receive access to Cloudera’s entire suite of training content for twelve months, or by individual course title available in six-month subscriptions. All new courses developed during the subscription period are included with library subscriptions, as well as any updates to courses.
Among the courses being made available on demand are Developer Training For Spark and Hadoop, Cloudera Administrator Training, and Data Analyst Training. For more information on Cloudera OnDemand visit: https://www.cloudera.com/training/ondemand-training.html.
