Press Release
Cloudera at the Heart of NxtGen’s New Analytics as a Service Offering; Delivering Business Value from Data Centers and Cloud Technologies



 









Leading cloud and data center services firm sets up Big Data Analytics Center of Excellence in Bangalore

NEW DELHI, India, 18 October, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, announced today that NxtGen, an emerging leader in cloud and data center services, has adopted Cloudera Enterprise as the backbone of their new ‘Analytics as a Service’ offering which will be available from nine data centers across India.
Cloudera delivers a modern data management platform that makes it simple to run multiple and complex enterprise frameworks at scale. Organizations can collect and manage their data in one centralized, secure and fully governed place where users can access it anytime from anywhere.
Analytics as a Service offers NxtGen customers access to a one-stop shop where they can store unlimited amounts of data. Importantly, customers can run their analytics tool of choice to gain value from their data, all within the same platform.
“NxtGen is providing enterprises with unprecedented access to Cloudera’s fast, easy and secure data platform. NxtGen’s customers will be able to use data analytics to build predictive models for more informed decision-making and better engage with their own customers. This means that they will be able to take data-enhanced approaches to solve business challenges and will be able to do this while secured by data governance and security frameworks,” said Amr Awadallah, Founder and Chief Technology Officer, Cloudera.
Analytics as a Service empowers NxtGen customers to build digital businesses without investing and managing complex IT infrastructure. They can use NxtGen’s hyper-converged infrastructure and now big data analytics as service as well to minimize on cost and maximize on capabilities.
In this unique approach, NxtGen deploys and offers IT infrastructure services from both or a combination of on-premises resources and NxtGen’s own facilities -- Infinite DatacenterTM -- enabling customers to adopt a hybrid-computing model.
“Enterprises in India are keen to use big data analytics to transform their businesses. However, many are hampered by the need for big capital investments and lack of support for high bandwidth access patterns that big data workloads demand. Cloudera Enterprise can help to address these business challenges easily with its ability to run multiple and complex frameworks at scale and deliver active data optimization to build use cases accelerating the adoption of analytics into decision-making,” said A S Rajgopal, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, NxtGen.
As part of the agreement, Cloudera will also support NxtGen in the set up of a Center of Excellence for Big Data Analytics in Bangalore, India. The deployment will be certified by Cloudera. Furthermore, Cloudera will train and certify NxtGen staff for the Center.
