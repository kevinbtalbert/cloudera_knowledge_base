Press Release
Pioneer in Data-driven Marketing, Enterprise Software, and Cloud Joins Cloudera as Chief Marketing Officer




 









Mick Hollison, Former InsideSales.com, Citrix, Microsoft and IBM Executive Completes Management Team and Positions Company for Increased Growth
PALO ALTO, Calif. – October 24, 2016 – Cloudera, the industry’s leading data management and analytics platform for the hyper-connected enterprise, today announced the appointment of Mick Hollison as chief marketing officer (CMO) to lead global marketing strategy as the company targets additional growth and success as a prospective public company. Hollison - with more than 25 years of technology marketing, sales and product management experience - brings a unique background from some of the world’s most successful companies, including Citrix, Microsoft, IBM and most recently, sales acceleration and machine learning company, InsideSales.com.
According to The Forrester Wave™: Big Data Hadoop Distributions, Q1 2016: “Cloudera thinks big and acts fast. Cloudera’s scope and pace of innovation is astounding, but not surprising for the first commercial Hadoop startup, founded in 2008.” The appointment of Hollison as CMO continues that tradition as the company embarks on its next phase of growth, pushing new boundaries in cybersecurity and advanced machine learning for modern businesses.
“As I searched for a CMO, I required a unique individual that embodied a number of essential traits and skills that match our corporate values. I wanted an open, trustworthy team player who takes initiative and possesses the expertise and rigor to guide Cloudera to the next level,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer, Cloudera. “Mick has a deep appreciation for the complexity of infrastructure software, he has been a salesman, a strategist, and a broad marketer, building his expertise in product marketing. His most recent years were spent creating a next generation demand generation machine and establishing a new market category for InsideSales.com, where as the CMO he helped drive consecutive years of triple digit sales growth during his three and a half year tenure.”
Hollison joins the company at an important time, as Cloudera has continued to innovate new ways to intelligently store, access, and analyze huge amounts of data at breakneck speeds. This continuous innovation has enabled Cloudera to win dozens of large enterprise customers including some of the world’s largest and most innovative companies such as ADP, Airbnb, Citigroup, Kaiser Permanente, Lockheed Martin, Mastercard, and Walt Disney.
“Mick’s appointment completes Cloudera’s strong and experienced executive team,” said Steve Sordello, chief financial officer at LinkedIn and Cloudera board member. “He is going to add tremendous value as the company separates from the competition and solidifies its position as the definitive leader in the high-growth data management and analytics market.”
Hollison has also held roles including Global Vice President of Marketing and Strategy at Citrix Systems, Senior Director of Enterprise Marketing at Microsoft, and a variety of executive roles at IBM including Director of Worldwide Sales for both WebSphere and Lotus Software.
“Cloudera is well positioned to be one of the leading software companies in the world,” said Mick Hollison, chief marketing officer at Cloudera. “Our platform is well suited to solve any big data challenge, from accelerating the human genome project, to detecting cyber threats, and even predicting vehicle maintenance. No other company can deliver that breadth of solutions seamlessly in private, public, and multi-cloud environments. The experience I bring to Cloudera is well aligned to the company goals of accelerating market leadership, expanding our global footprint, and providing rock-solid, business critical solutions.
