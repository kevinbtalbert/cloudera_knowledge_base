Press Release
Dialog Calls on Cloudera Enterprise to Drive Customer Intimacy and Enhance Product Personalization



 









Sri Lanka’s Telecommunications Leader Gains Unified View of Customer Insights from Hadoop-based Platform for Successful Omni-channel Campaigns
SRI LANKA, 26 OCTOBER, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, announced today that Dialog, Sri Lanka’s largest and most rapidly growing mobile telecommunications network provider, has adopted Cloudera Enterprise to gain a unified view of their customer insights and networks. This allows Dialog to more efficiently use customer data to execute successful omni-channel campaigns and enhance product customization in a highly competitive market. 
Communications service providers (CSPs) are amongst the world’s biggest aggregators of consumer information and have to keep pace in order to gain insights into their customers’ preferences and networks. Many CSPs, like Dialog, are utilizing Cloudera Enterprise to securely bring together user, network, device, business and social data to deliver a superior customer experience, increase network performance and drive new revenue streams. 
Dialog delivers advanced mobile telephone and high-speed mobile broadband services to a subscriber base of 10.9 million Sri Lankans, via 2.5G and 3G/3.5G and 4G networks. Being the largest telecommunications operator in Sri Lanka, Dialog has the mammoth task of processing, storing and leveraging massive volumes of customer and network data collected over time, which were previously stored in multiple traditional systems, resulting in scattered pockets of data silos.
“With Cloudera Enterprise now at the core of Dialog's information architecture, the large volumes of cross format data are accessible from a centralized location, and available to Dialog staff with full fidelity and security. The new solution also allows Dialog to achieve a lower capital expenditure per terabyte compared to traditional data management mechanisms. The Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub can provide a fast, easy and secure platform, built on Apache Hadoop, to enable Cloudera’s customers to build predictive models with more dimensions.” said Eranda Adikari, Chief Manager, Business Intelligence Analytics, Dialog. 
“A common challenge that CSPs face is the efficient and secure management of large volumes of data from multiple sources,” said Amy O'Connor, Vice President, Business Value Enablement, Cloudera.
“A Cloudera enterprise data hub can provide a fast, easy and secure platform, built on Apache Hadoop, to enable Cloudera’s customers to easily build predictive models for more informed decision making. These models can then be leveraged to indicate customer churn, develop insight-driven marketing campaigns, and ultimately lead to a higher wallet share by delivering more innovative products and services for end customers.” 
CSPs are among the biggest aggregators of data under evolving market, technology and regulatory conditions. Globally, telecommunication companies tap on Cloudera Enterprise to securely sync user, network, device, business and social data to drive customer intimacy and accelerate innovation. Currently, three of the top five mobile providers run on Cloudera.
