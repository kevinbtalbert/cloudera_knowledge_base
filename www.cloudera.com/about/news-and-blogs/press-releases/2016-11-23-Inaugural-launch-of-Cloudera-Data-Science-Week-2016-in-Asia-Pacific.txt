Press Release
Inaugural launch of Cloudera Data Science Week 2016 in Asia Pacific powers change beyond the ‘Data Revolution’



 









Week-long industry event explores multi-faceted transformative technologies powered by Apache Hadoop for business growth
Singapore – November 23, 2016 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop and the latest open source technologies, today announced the inaugural launch of Cloudera Data Science Week Asia Pacific 2016. Held across several markets in Asia Pacific from 3 to 9 December 2016, this series of events brings together industry experts and distinguished speakers providing strategic insights around critical public and private sector issues on big data for senior executives. 
Despite the tremendous growth of businesses utilizing big data, more than 65 percent of organizations are still at initial stages of experimenting with big data usage, according to IDC. Harnessing data, however, remains a business imperative, and providing real world solutions to such business challenges remains Cloudera’s goal through the establishment of this annual industry event. 
Daniel Ng, Senior Director, Asia Pacific, Cloudera commented: “Cloudera is introducing the first ever Cloudera Data Science Week Asia Pacific. As organizations transition to life beyond big data and look to re-engineer their business by utilizing data, topics such as artificial intelligence come into play. Predicting big data’s future, exploring new opportunities, harvesting, and leveraging big data for innovation is just the start of this journey.” 
Cloudera Data Science Week Asia Pacific is set to become an annual industry event, mobilizing organizations to gain competitive advantages with more meaningful insights, make quicker and sharper decisions, and discover issues and trends that affect their businesses. 
Mike Olson and other senior Cloudera executives such as Amr Awadallah, Chief Technology Officer, Mick Hollison, Chief Marketing Officer, and Charles Zedlewski, Senior Vice President of Products will host dialogue sessions, workshops, and roundtables on data management, down to how government and public organizations can use analytics to gain a better understanding of enterprise operations, predict outcomes, and guard against unauthorized data access. 
All events will culminate in the second edition of Strata + Hadoop World Singapore 2016, the annual big data industry conference co-sponsored by O’Reilly Media starting on 5 December 2016, where data scientists, analysts, and business executives address case studies, develop new skills, share emerging best practices, and build the future of big data.
With Cloudera’s Data Science Week Asia Pacific, companies will be better equipped to identify the challenges and pitfalls that organizations may face with data, to prepare their businesses for the year ahead.
Please find below a breakdown of events and conferences which will be held during Cloudera Data Science Week Asia Pacific 2016:
 
Cloudera Data Science Week Asia Pacific 2016:  
Cloudera Sessions is a one-day expert forum for customers and partners to learn to employ Hadoop to build a modern architecture and make data analytics pervasive across any organization. Past networking and learning events have been held in key cities such as Seoul, Beijing, and Shanghai.  
Upcoming sessions will be held in Melbourne and Brisbane on 29 November 2016 and 1 December 2016 respectively. 
Data Science Weekend in Yogyakarta, Indonesia (3 to 5 December 2016)
Data professionals, communities, and students will explore implications of data science, barriers between data-based and creative decision making, and the corresponding business impact through workshops and sessions. Cloudera’s Chief Technology Officer, Amr Awadallah will host this weekend.
Fajar Jaman, Head of Data Science Indonesia, commented: “Data Science Indonesia is thrilled to be part of Cloudera’s Data Science Week in Asia Pacific with the upcoming Data Science Weekend in Indonesia. This entire initiative is part of a larger effort to bring the current and future big data community together today, for a smarter and more digital tomorrow. The Data Science Weekend with Cloudera in Indonesia, and all other events surrounding this inaugural week, is testament to the impact that big data truly has on businesses and the community in Indonesia and the rest of the Asia Pacific region.” 
The first annual Cloudera Government Forum provides a collaborative opportunity among the public and private sector to discuss Big Data analytics and share case studies of how data can be used to improve decision-making. The forum gathers government professionals – from the front office to the front line – to implement strategies and optimize processes to manage, share, and analyse data assets efficiently and cost-effectively. The event will also build on big data initiatives and fundamentals, such as Hadoop Essentials, to leverage data for more efficient search, discovery, and related mission-support capabilities.

Dr Karl Ng, Director of Innovation Capital Division at Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), commented: “Part of Cloudera’s Data Science Week in Asia Pacific, the Wrangle conference in Malaysia is an ecosystem-led effort to integrate the big data community. Bringing together the region’s top data scientists, this conference and week will discuss challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in today’s ever-connected business landscape.
