Press Release
Cloudera and Intel Driven Open Source Project Powers Enterprise Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Cybersecurity Applications 



 









Apache Spot (Incubating) Provides Scalable, Flexible, Open Source Cybersecurity Hub for Forensic, Telemetry and Contextual Data
PALO ALTO, Calif., – February 09, 2017 – Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management, analytics and machine learning platform built on the latest open source technologies, today announced that Apache Spot (incubating) now acts as a modern, open-source solution that can economically provide a comprehensive cybersecurity hub for forensic, telemetry, and contextual data. These capabilities combined with log management, compliance, reporting and advanced netflow analytics are being used to power machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) cybersecurity applications for advanced threat hunting and reduced mean time to detection and investigation. Since Spot’s launch in September of 2016, Cloudera, alongside Intel and other project collaborators, have continued to accelerate the larger vision of fighting cybercrime via a community supported open data model.
In today’s cybersecurity landscape, there is a proliferation of data that organizations need to constantly monitor. Cyber criminals have discovered ways to learn from one another, while enterprises have been operating independently to fight threats. Spot allows security operation centers to break down siloed proprietary application data repositories by creating a single, shared open data model that any vendor or custom security application can plug into. Spot also works with the Apache Spark community, enabling organizations to harness the parallel processing power for advanced detection using machine learning and AI.
“Cobbling together cybersecurity applications without a common architecture creates data silos that limit the effectiveness of advanced analytics that can be used for faster threat detection, investigation and remediation,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. “The Apache Spot project is breaking down data constraints to open up new analytics capabilities, enabling organizations across industries to reduce risk.”
In September 2016, Intel donated Spot to the Apache Software Foundation with Cloudera’s support. This donation marked a significant milestone for the cybersecurity industry. Intel and Cloudera’s efforts towards Apache Spot have provided a new level of cybersecurity response and the community at large continues to discover new analytics functionality for detecting advanced cyber threats that are impacting our society. Since launching, Apache Spot has already been recognized by the industry and awarded InfoWorld’s 2017 Technology of the Year and an Edison Award for Collective Disruption.
Intel Corporation
“The momentum generated behind the Apache Spot community is allowing us to collectively come together to enable AI and provide comprehensive visibility across all security data using an open, scalable platform. Spot’s open data models, scalability, and flexibility has fostered a rich ecosystem of AI-based applications that can run simultaneously on a single, shared, enriched data set.”
-- Alan Ross, Senior Principal Engineer and Chief Cloud Security Architect
Context Relevant
"With Apache Spot, CISOs now have a way to effectively centralize all of their cybersecurity data in one open platform. Context Relevant is excited to deliver our ML-driven Context Security Engine on top of Spot, empowering our customers to rapidly identify and stop advanced persistent threats. We want to concentrate on innovative results for security analysts, not the cumbersome management of data sources. Spot's advantage is knocking out barriers between organizations' existing security data repositories, enabling the Context Security Engine to connect advanced behaviors across datasets and dramatically reduce the mean time to threat detection.”
-- Dustin Hillard, vice president of Engineering
Arcadia Data
“To get a complete picture of a security posture requires real-time analyses across a diverse set of corporate data sources siloed away in systems that are too slow or expensive to handle. Apache Spot brings together this myriad of data sources so Arcadia Data can enable security professionals to build advanced visual applications that capture investigative workflows, real-time incident response, and machine learning-guided data exploration for the very first time across networks, entities, applications, and endpoints.”
-- Shant Hovsepian, co-founder and chief technology officer
Streamsets Inc.
"StreamSets works within the Apache Spot community to accelerate cybersecurity data ingestion into the Apache Spot open data model. By contributing pre-assembled pipelines and connectivity, StreamSets equips organizations to easily create Apache Spot applications that analyze diverse security-oriented data feeds in order to quickly detect threats through machine learning."
-- Arvind Prabhakar, co-founder and chief technology officer
