Press Release
Wargaming Partners with Cloudera to Expand Online Gaming Platform using Machine Learning



 









Free-to-Play, Massively Multiplayer Online Game Analyzes 3TB Raw Data Daily to Predict and Personalize Player Experience for More Authentic Game-Play
PALO ALTO, Calif., February 22, 2017 - Cloudera, the provider of the leading global platform for machine learning and advanced analytics built on the latest open source technologies, today announced that Wargaming has implemented a Cloudera-powered Data Analytics platform to personalize game interaction and optimize its business for a more enjoyable playing experience. Wargaming, an award-winning online game developer and leader in the free-to-play massively multiplayer online (MMO) game market, delivers authentic gaming experiences and services across PC, console and mobile platforms to over 150 million players worldwide.
Utilizing an enterprise data hub from Cloudera, Wargaming developed a real-time game recommendation and player communications platform that uses iterative machine learning to predict and personalize a player’s gaming experience based on their latest game-play. It also deployed a historical management reporting and gaming analytics system for its 3TB processed per day of raw data.
“Player interaction and satisfaction in online gaming is paramount in today’s competitive climate. The scope of what we work on at Wargaming extends beyond the development of world-class online games to understand who our players are and what they need,” said Sergei Vasiuk, development director, Technology Services & PRMP at Wargaming.net. “To do this we tap into the substantial amount of data we process each day - which includes every shot fired or military vehicle a player chooses to use - to ensure all gamers have an enjoyable experience every time they login.”
Wargaming's Player Relationship Management Platform (PRMP) analyzes player engagement, and then predicts the most interesting scenario for a player based on the player's personal interests. The platform utilizes Apache Hadoop to deliver a 360-degree view of the player. Wargaming also developed the Data-Driven Real-time Rules Engine (DDRRE) to analyze the large amounts of data in real time and allow personalization of game interaction with players. The DDRRE uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify and predict potential player objectives and to provide players with items that will achieve those goals from the online store (e.g., the latest tank or aircraft for battle). The DDRRE is based on Cloudera’s enterprise data hub, including Apache Impala, Apache Kafka and Apache Spark Streaming.
“Entertainment is personal today -- that’s what makes video games so compelling,” said Mike Olson, chief strategy officer, Cloudera. “In order to attract and keep players, game developers have to deliver a rich experience, tailored in real time to each individual player. Wargaming’s use of high-speed data collection and powerful machine learning help it understand the personalities of its players and adjust its games in real time. Wargaming customizes play for every active player, driving engagement. The games are just more fun.”
