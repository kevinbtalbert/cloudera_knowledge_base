Press Release
Navistar Partners with Cloudera to Accelerate their IoT and Connected Vehicles Journey



 









Leading Commercial Truck Manufacturer Utilizes Cloudera Enterprise Analytics Platform for IoT enabled Predictive Maintenance and Vehicle Systems Management
PALO ALTO, Calif., February 27, 2017 — Cloudera, the provider of the leading global platform for machine learning and advanced analytics built on the latest open source technologies, today announced increased support for Navistar, a leading manufacturer of commercial trucks, buses, defense vehicles and engines, in applying data management and analytics to accelerate their Internet of Things (IoT) and connected vehicle journey. With Cloudera Enterprise, Navistar has built a large scalable platform that enables them to ingest and store multiple data sources and formats—including data from sensors in vehicles in order to deliver predictive vehicle maintenance, system diagnostics and management, and route optimization—all in an effort to maintain consistent on-time delivery and minimal vehicle downtime.
“By collecting and analyzing our vehicle telematics, we have reduced maintenance costs and vehicle downtime by almost 40% and have implemented remote monitoring coverage to more than 250,000 vehicles,” said Terry Kline, chief information officer at Navistar. “Cloudera’s platform enabled us to ingest not only IoT and telematics data from sensors, but meteorological, engineering, traffic and vehicle usage, and access and analyze all these different data types in ways that weren’t possible before.”
Navistar’s remote diagnostics platform, OnCommand™ Connection, is built on Cloudera Enterprise. It leverages data feeds from telematics service providers and combines them with meteorological, geographical, vehicle usage, traffic, historical warranty and parts inventory information to provide real-time vehicle performance data. The platform allows Navistar to run ad-hoc analysis and predictive modeling to detect potential maintenance issues on customers’ trucks before they occur.
Navistar is able to offer analytics as a service to their customers, who can now monitor the performance of their trucks in real time from their smartphones or tablets, and use the resulting insights to schedule planned maintenance, thereby reducing unplanned repairs and downtime.
“Today’s connected vehicles generate enormous amounts of data,” said Mike Olson, founder and chief strategy officer at Cloudera. “Navistar is an excellent example of the practical benefit that IoT delivers. Working with Navistar, we’ve seen just how powerful IoT can be in making maintenance predictive, not reactive. Trucks and buses can be maintained when they need service, not on a fixed schedule or when they break down. That’s a huge benefit for fleet operators with hundreds or thousands of vehicles.”

Navistar International Corporation (NYSE: NAV) is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates produce International® brand commercial and military trucks, proprietary diesel engines, and IC Bus™ brand school and commercial buses. An affiliate also provides truck and diesel engine service parts. Another affiliate offers financing services. Additional information is available at www.Navistar.com.
