Press Release
Cloudera broadens industry ecosystem to nurture more big data professionals in Indonesia



 









Cloudera’s BASE (Big Analytics Skills Enablement) Initiative launches in Indonesia, bringing private and public sector partners together to train and develop the next generation of data professionals
JAKARTA, Indonesia – March 23, 2017 – Cloudera, provider of the leading global platform for machine learning and advanced analytics built on the latest open source technologies, today announced the launch of the BASE (Big Analytics Skills Enablement) initiative in Indonesia. BASE is an industry-led ecosystem that is designed to groom a future workforce of data professionals and has been launched in Singapore, Malaysia, China, and Korea so far.
According to IDC, 62% of Indonesian organizations identify a skills shortage as a challenge in delivering the full value of Big Data Analytics (BDA) to their customers. Designed to bolster Indonesia’s Smart City initiatives and to strategically fill the skilled data professionals gap in the market, BASE enables industry players, government stakeholders, and academic institutions to collectively educate and support more professionals with the necessary skills in areas of BDA. The initiative also incorporates job placement firms that work to match trained data professionals with positions across sectors where their skills are required.
Mr. Rudiantara, Minister of Communications and Information Technology, Republic of Indonesia, said of the BASE launch: “I am extremely pleased to be launching this important Big Data enablement initiative at the inaugural Big Data Week Jakarta event.” He concurred with the view that as the nation moves towards the goal of digitally transforming Indonesian cities, it is critical to see investment in the talent of local IT professionals. Educating Indonesian businesses and future professionals with BDA skills will take the country a step further in the journey to success. “The partnership with Cloudera on the BASE Initiative is important as it empowers Indonesia to train and qualify local professionals for the new era of digital disruption,” Mr. Rudiantara added.
Currently, businesses like Bank Danamon, Dell EMC, Microsoft, Red Hat, Telkomsigma, along with community based organization, Data Science Indonesia, have already stepped forward to join the BASE Initiative in Indonesia, committing to play a role in this collaborative ecosystem. Academic institutions like Universitas Multimedia Nusantara (UMN) and Telkom University have also joined to provide their students with data skills training and executive recruitment company, Monroe Consulting Group Indonesia, will further support certified data professionals by matching them to suitable job vacancies and career opportunities.
Cloudera’s Senior Director, APAC and the Founder of BASE, Daniel Ng commented: “Through the Cloudera BASE Initiative, we bring together public and private sector organizations to work with the big data community and educate, train, collaborate, and employ big data professionals. We will have 16 BASE partners join us on stage as we officially launch the initiative in Indonesia. We believe that through BASE, Indonesia can build an arsenal of big data professionals and advance the nation’s Smart City initiatives.”
“Having seen great traction from BASE in Singapore, Malaysia, China, and Korea, we want to continue to play a catalyst role in uplifting Asia Pacific as a data-driven region through advanced technology and skills development. Bringing various partners into a collaborative effort will help us to continue bringing new, talented data professionals into the industry, who can use the right tools and actualize data for businesses and the community at large,” added Fred Groen, Country Manager for Cloudera Indonesia.

The BASE Initiative is complementary to the Cloudera Academic Partnership (CAP) program. Through CAP, Cloudera provides partner institutions with a complete, industry-standard open source curriculum at no charge that can be incorporated into computer science and business analytics courses. Teaching staff and students of affiliated institutions also get access to software and discounted training to help accelerate the adoption of open source platforms and related technologies. Currently, over 100 academic institutions around the globe are members of CAP, including UMN and Telkom University in Indonesia.
