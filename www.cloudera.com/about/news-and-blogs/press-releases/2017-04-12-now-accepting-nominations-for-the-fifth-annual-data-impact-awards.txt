Press Release
Now Accepting Nominations for the Fifth Annual Data Impact Awards



 









Recognizing Innovative Organizations That Are Transforming Business, Industry and Society
PALO ALTO, Calif., — April 12, 2017 — Cloudera, provider of the leading modern platform for machine learning and advanced analytics built on the latest open source technologies, announced that it is accepting nominations for the fifth annual Data Impact Awards. The program, which has grown year-over-year based on the number of nominations, celebrates organizations’ exceptional achievements using CDH (Cloudera’s Distribution of Apache Hadoop).
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced machine learning, the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) and the ability to scale massive data with cloud-based services mean data for insights no longer has limits. Opportunities to discover new solutions that solve some of the world’s biggest challenges are now possible with exploratory data science, machine learning at scale, predictive analytics, AI and advanced data engineering.
The 2017 Data Impact Awards will recognize business, technical and special achievements in eight categories:

Business Impact
Instrument your business
Secure your business
Customer insight


Technical Impact
Cloud pioneers
Innovators in machine learning and artificial intelligence


Special Impact
Modern architecture for big results
Rookie of the year
Societal impact



Nominations Now Open
Nominations are now open to any organization that uses CDH in a production environment. A distinguished panel of third-party judges including industry analysts, media, and thought leaders from around the globe will evaluate all applications.
How to Enter
Learn more about the program or submit a nomination. Deadline to submit is July 31, 2017. There is no cost to enter. Winners will be announced the week of September 25, 2017, in tandem with Strata Data Conference, New York.
“The 2016 Data Impact Awards showcased the remarkable array of applications using Cloudera’s technology to impact industries across the globe. From environmental-saving IoT-based snow plows to behavioral-based artificial intelligence cybersecurity threat detection to predictive maintenance on truck fleets for driver safety and vehicle savings, the diversity of applicants in 2016 was unprecedented,” said Mick Hollison, chief marketing officer at Cloudera. “With more data, connectivity and automation, we are able to help organizations solve challenges in real-time that weren’t possible before. We expect this year’s nominations and winners will invent disruptive technologies that will create new markets and enhance the way we live and work.”
