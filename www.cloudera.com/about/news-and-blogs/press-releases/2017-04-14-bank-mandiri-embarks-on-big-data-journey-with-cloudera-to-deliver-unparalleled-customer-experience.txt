Press Release
Bank Mandiri embarks on Big Data Journey with Cloudera to Deliver Unparalleled Customer Experience



 









Indonesia’s largest financial institution relies on Cloudera Enterprise to unlock new data management capabilities
JAKARTA, 13 April, 2017 – Cloudera, the provider of the modern platform for machine learning and advanced analytics announced that Bank Mandiri, Indonesia’s largest financial institution, has adopted Cloudera Enterprise to enhance their omni-channel customer engagement enabled by a scalable and robust big data management environment .
Financial service institutions (FSIs) are increasingly investing in the technologies of the future and adopting big data projects to revolutionize customer experience in today’s digital economy. Spurred by the success of big data analytics adoption in the telecommunications and Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industries, Mohammad Guntur, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Data Management Group, for Bank Mandiri, believes that the same benefits can be conferred upon the financial services industry. “Big data technology plays a critical role in our aspiration of becoming Indonesia’s best and ASEAN’s most prominent financial institution by 2020,” said Guntur. “With Cloudera’s tremendous market penetration and track record in this region, we are confident that this partnership will accelerate our efforts in developing strong big data capabilities to support our business roadmap in technology innovation.”
Bank Mandiri’s wide range of banking services and customer transactions have created an exponential amount of data, leading to challenges across the entire data lifecycle. With Cloudera Enterprise, Bank Mandiri will be better armed to overcome common hurdles in data ingestion, integration and accuracy, creating a seamless big data analytics environment to derive meaningful insights and drive business decisions. Enhanced by Cloudera’s modern data management platform and capabilities for financial services organizations to take advantage of machine learning models to better predict cybercrime, money laundering, and insider threats, customer data is secure yet easily accessible, and compliant with the latest industry regulations.
“FSIs are facing a tipping point in today’s age of disruption. Forced to keep up with = financial technology advancements to stay relevant, big data analytics has become a key factor in the focus to delivering unparalleled customer experiences,” said Fanly Tanto, Sales Director for Indonesia, Cloudera. “Cloudera aims to provide FSIs, like Bank Mandiri, with a competitive edge through an open source platform that not only tackles complex challenges of big data, but enables organizations to address today’s threats, such as cybersecurity. Bank Mandiri has turned to Cloudera to strategically align their IT roadmap and accomplish business transformation efforts, while maintaining industry standards of risk and compliance to champion a vigorous and innovative financial ecosystem.”
