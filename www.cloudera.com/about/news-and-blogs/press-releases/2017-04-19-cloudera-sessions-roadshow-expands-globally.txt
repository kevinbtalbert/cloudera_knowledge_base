Press Release
Cloudera Sessions 2017 Roadshow Expands Globally



 









Cloudera Sessions 2017 Roadshow Expands Globally; Delivers Guidance and Best Practices for Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics through Real-life Customer Stories and Use Cases
Fifth Annual Roadshow Announces New Dates and Locations
MEDIA ALERT: PALO ALTO, Calif. – 20 April, 2017

 What: Cloudera, the provider of the leading global platform for machine learning and advanced analytics built on the latest open source technologies, announced the expansion of the fifth annual Sessions roadshow, as well as dates and locations for the complimentary one day event. The program, aimed at helping organizations determine an intelligent path toward data platform modernization, has expanded to include more than 20 cities globally. In addition, the company plans to introduce a virtual event experience for organizations in the Asia Pacific. The program will highlight and discuss real-life examples of organizations using data to inform business critical decision-making. The event is divided into two distinct sessions - the morning will focus on high-level business use cases and the afternoon will focus on more technical content.
“Cloudera is helping organizations use data to make what is impossible today, possible tomorrow,” said Mick Hollison, chief marketing officer for Cloudera. “This year Sessions will feature leading industry experts, customers and partners describing how to build data-driven organizations that are extending their use of data from insight to action. The program will specifically explore the role of machine learning and advanced analytics in driving customer insights, connecting products and services (IoT) and protecting businesses.”
Who: Keynotes from a host of Cloudera executives and support teams, including:

Mike Olson, co-founder and chief strategy officer
Tom Reilly, chief executive officer
Amr Awadallah, co-founder and chief technology officer
Mick Hollison, chief marketing officer
Charles Zedlewski, senior vice president, products

Each event will also feature Cloudera partners and end-users who will share information on production use cases, best practices, and lessons learned in the field. Additionally, Cloudera technical experts will teach hands-on breakout sessions on cloud, data science, and BI and analytics. Attendees will also have the opportunity to interact with technical experts during the Ask The Expert panel.
Why: Cloudera believes that data can make what is impossible today, possible tomorrow and through the Sessions events attendees will:

Learn how to transform vast amounts of complex data into clear and actionable insights for their businesses through a mix of presentations, demos and hands on sessions.
Gain firsthand insight into how many of the leading minds in IT are using data-driven insights to grow businesses, improve efficiencies, and manage risk.
