Press Release
Cloudera Named Best Place to Work For Second Consecutive Year



 









Cloudera Honored by San Francisco Business Times, Ranked in Top 25 Companies
PALO ALTO, Calif., 20 April, 2017 – Cloudera, the provider of the leading modern platform for data management, machine learning and advanced analytics, today announced it has been recognized as one of the San Francisco Business Times’ "Best Places to Work," ranking among the top large companies in the Bay Area. The designation marks Cloudera’s second consecutive win, based on an independent internal survey conducted by the San Francisco Business Times. The survey measures employee satisfaction across a number of values such as trust in leadership, team dynamics, personal engagement and satisfaction of individual needs through benefits and perks.
Since the company’s founding in 2008, Cloudera has been committed to providing its staff with a collaborative and transparent work environment, which according to employee feedback, fosters innovation and creativity. With over 1,400 employees and offices in 27 countries, Cloudera’s team around the world is credited with building the most comprehensive machine learning and analytics platform to address today’s most complex business challenges. 
"We strive to attract, motivate and promote the very best and diversified tech talent around the globe to join and grow in our organization,” said Britt Sellin, vice president, Human Resources at Cloudera. “In nine years, our employees built an industry that enables enterprise organizations to use data to do what was impossible just a few years ago. From using behavioral-based artificial intelligence cybersecurity applications for advanced threat detection, to applying predictive analytics to risk score every patient in a health system, to using IoT-based snow plows to keep highways open – our platform and our partners’ technologies work together to make a long-lasting, positive impact on our society.”

Amr Awadallah, founder and CTO of Cloudera, accepted the award on behalf of the company.
Cloudera was previously honored by the San Francisco Business Times in 2016 in the large-size company category and in 2013 and 2012 as one of the best mid-sized companies to work for in the Bay Area.
