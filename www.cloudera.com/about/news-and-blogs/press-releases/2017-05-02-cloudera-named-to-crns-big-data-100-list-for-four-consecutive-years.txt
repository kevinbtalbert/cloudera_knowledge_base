Cloudera Recognized as an Innovative Supplier for Data Management
Palo Alto, Calif. – May 02, 2017 – Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE:CLDR), the leading provider of the modern platform for machine learning and advanced analytics built on the latest open source technologies, has been named to The Channel Company’s CRN® 2017 Big Data 100 list for the fourth year. This annual list recognizes the ingenuity of technology suppliers bringing to market innovative offerings for harnessing the increasingly large volumes of data generated. 
Businesses are constantly grappling with the exploding volume, speed and variety of information they produce and utilize on a daily basis to remain competitive.

In response to this challenge, the CRN editorial team has identified the IT vendors at the forefront of data management, business analytics and infrastructure technologies and services. The resulting Big Data 100 list is a valuable guide for solution providers seeking out key big data technology suppliers.
“As the amount of accessible data continues to increase, so does the challenge to maximize its value,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. “By offering next-generation technology and our advancements in machine learning impacting the Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, data science and the cloud, we will continue helping our customers solve the most complex problems in the world.”
