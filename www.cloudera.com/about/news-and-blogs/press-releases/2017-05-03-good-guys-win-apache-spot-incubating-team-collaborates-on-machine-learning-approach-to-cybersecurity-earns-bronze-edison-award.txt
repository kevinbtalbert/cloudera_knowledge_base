Press Release
Good Guys Win: Apache Spot (Incubating) Team Collaborates on Machine Learning Approach to Cybersecurity, Earns Bronze Edison Award



 









Cloudera Accepts Bronze Award For Apache Spot at Edison Awards Gala in New York; Awards Celebrate 30 Years of Honoring Excellence in Business and Innovation
PALO ALTO, Calif., May 3, 2017 – Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the leading provider of the modern platform for machine learning and advanced analytics built on the latest open source technologies, announced that Apache Spot (incubating) was voted the Bronze Winner for the category 'Collective Disruption and Connected Collaboration' at the 30th Annual Edison Awards Gala in New York City. Cloudera joined senior executives from some of the world's most recognized companies to acknowledge the hard work and commitment of all of the 2017 Edison Award winners.
For 30 years, the distinguished Edison Awards have honored excellence in the development of new products and services and has become one of the highest accolades a company can receive in the name of innovation and business. The awards are named after Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931) whose inventions, new product development methods and innovative achievements garnered him 1,093 U.S. patents and made him a household name around the world.
The ballot of nominees for the Edison Awards was judged by a panel of more than 3,000 leading business executives, including past award winners, academics and leaders in the fields of product development, design, engineering, science and medical. “Our judges recognized Apache Spot as a true innovator out of the many products in its category,” said Frank Bonafilia, executive director of the Edison Awards.
Apache Spot is a community-driven cybersecurity project built to bring enterprise visibility and advanced analytics to telemetry and contextual data on an open, flexible and scalable platform. Cloudera, recognized for contributing to Spot to expedite threat detection, investigation, and remediation via machine learning, and consolidating all enterprise security data into a comprehensive security hub based on open data models, accepted the award on behalf of Intel and a team of collaborators, including Anomoli, Centrify, Cloudwick, Cybraics, eBay, Endgame, Jask, Streamsets and Webroot. Apache Spot’s open data model strategy is extending these capabilities, allowing Cloudera’s Information Security Team and other project innovators to push cybersecurity advancements into the open source community.
“Cloudera is committed to a collaborative approach to open source technology as a way to pave the future for information security teams,” said Sam Heywood, director, Cybersecurity Strategy at Cloudera. “This recognition underscores the company’s commitment to delivering advanced cybersecurity solutions based on machine learning and advanced analytics capabilities to protect the hyper-connected enterprise from the escalation of cyber threats.”
