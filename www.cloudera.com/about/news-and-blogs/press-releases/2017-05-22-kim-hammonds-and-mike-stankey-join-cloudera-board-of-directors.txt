Press Release
Kim Hammonds and Mike Stankey Join Cloudera Board of Directors to Broaden Industry Insight and Advise Newly Public Company



 









Appointments Bring Added Business Acumen, Executive and Technology Leadership to Leading Analytics and Machine Learning Provider
PALO ALTO, Calif. – May 22, 2017: Cloudera (NYSE: CLDR), the provider of the leading global platform for machine learning and advanced analytics built on the latest open source technologies, announced the appointments of Kim Hammonds, Member of the Management Board and Group Chief Operating Officer at Deutsche Bank and Mike Stankey, Vice Chairman of Workday to the Cloudera board of directors.
As the Group Chief Operating Officer at Deutsche Bank, Ms. Hammonds is responsible for the company's technology and operations, including information security, data management and digital transformation and corporate services. Prior to her current role, Ms. Hammonds served as Deutsche Bank's Global Chief Information Officer and Global Co-Head of Group Technology & Operations. She has also served as the Chief Information Officer for Boeing, and has held management positions in Dell and Ford Motor Company, in product engineering, manufacturing, marketing and information technology leadership. Her extensive leadership and industry expertise will bring invaluable insight and experience to Cloudera. Ms. Hammonds will help guide and counsel the company to develop and hone its product lines.
"I am looking forward to providing my perspectives to Cloudera as it continues to build machine learning, cybersecurity, cloud and the latest open source technologies into its offerings," said Ms. Hammonds. “These technologies are exciting. They are shaping everyday life, how organizations operate and the global economy more broadly."
As vice chairman at Workday, Mr. Stankey focuses on the company's market expansion, key customer relationships, external communications, and leadership development. He is also a member of the company's board of directors. Previously, from 2009 to 2015, he served as president and chief operating officer. Prior to joining Workday in 2009, Mr. Stankey was a partner at Greylock Partners, where he focused on the next generation of enterprise technologies. Before Greylock, he served for five years as chairman and CEO at PolyServe, a storage virtualization software company that was sold to Hewlett-Packard under Mike's leadership in 2007. Mr. Stankey began a nine-year career at PeopleSoft starting in 1993, where he held various general management and sales management roles, including senior vice president of North American sales. Mr. Stankey brings to Cloudera extensive experience in product development, marketing and go-to-market strategy. He currently also serves on the boards of Okta and Code42.
“Cloudera's unique approach to machine learning, advanced analytics, cybersecurity, cloud and other technologies solves a number of key challenges that many organizations are facing today," said Mike Stankey. “With the deluge of data that most companies encounter on a daily basis due to the world becoming more and more connected, it can be difficult to make sense of it or ensure that value is being extracted without experiencing challenges."
"With our recent IPO and new board members, Cloudera is well-positioned to achieve its next phase of growth with two extraordinary industry leaders in Kim Hammonds and Mike Stankey," said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer, Cloudera. "Both will be invaluable in the strategic development of our product line and our company."
Other Cloudera board members include Mike Olson, founder and chairman of the Board; Tom Reilly, chief executive officer, Cloudera; Martin Cole, former chief executive of Accenture's Technology group; Ping Li, Accel Partners; and Steve Sordello, chief financial officer, LinkedIn.
Both Mr. Stankey and Ms. Hammonds were appointed as directors prior to the Company's recent initial public offering.
