Press Release
Cloudera Reports First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results



 









 

Q1 revenue up 41% year-over-year
Q1 subscription revenue up 59% year-over-year
Net expansion rate of 142%

PALO ALTO, Calif., June 08, 2017 —Cloudera, Inc., (NYSE: CLDR), provider of the leading global platform for machine learning and advanced analytics, today reported results for its first quarter fiscal 2018, ended April 30, 2017. Total revenue was $79.6 million, an increase of 41% from the first quarter fiscal 2017. Subscription revenue was $64.7 million, an increase of 59% from the year-ago period. Subscription revenue represented 81% of total revenue, up from 72% in first quarter fiscal 2017.
"We had a strong first quarter as a public company, making progress against many of our key objectives,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. “We are proud of the role that Cloudera is playing in helping solve some of the world’s most challenging problems through data. In Q1, we continued our innovation leadership in machine learning with the introduction of Cloudera Data Science Workbench, in IoT with the general availability of Apache Kudu and in cloud analytics with our first Platform-as-a-Service offering, Cloudera Altus. In addition, I am pleased with the success that our customers are experiencing in becoming data- and insight-driven enterprises and its corresponding effect on our business with our net expansion rate of 142% for the quarter."
GAAP loss from operations for the first quarter fiscal 2018 was $222.3 million, compared to a GAAP loss from operations of $43.5 million for the first quarter fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP loss from operations for the quarter was $30.3 million, compared to a non-GAAP loss from operations of $37.0 million in the year-ago period.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was positive $5.0 million compared to operating cash flow of negative $23.6 million in the first quarter fiscal 2017. Our generation of positive operating cash flow in the quarter was driven by strong collections and continued improvement in operating efficiencies.
Based on weighted-average shares outstanding of 38.5 million shares, GAAP net loss per share for the first quarter fiscal 2018 was $5.78 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss per share in the first quarter fiscal 2017 of $1.20 per share, based on weighted-average shares outstanding of 35.9 million shares. First quarter fiscal 2018 GAAP operating results included a $191.1 million stock-based compensation charge primarily due to achievement of the liquidity event vesting condition for the majority of RSUs granted to employees as well as $0.9 million relating to the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Collectively, the impact on net loss per share was negative $4.99 per share. Operating results for the same period a year ago included stock-based compensation expense of $5.7 million and amortization of acquired intangible assets of $0.9 million. First quarter fiscal 2018 GAAP net loss per share was impacted by the timing of our initial public offering as the offering became effective in the first quarter and closed in the second quarter fiscal 2018. See tables below for additional information regarding historical and forward-looking stock-based compensation expenses and shares outstanding.
Based on non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding of 114.0 million shares, non-GAAP net loss per share for the first quarter fiscal 2018 was $0.27 per share, compared to non-GAAP net loss per share in the first quarter fiscal 2017 of $0.33 per share, based on non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding of 110.8 million shares.
A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
As of April 30, 2017, the company had total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash of $275.3 million, excluding initial public offering net proceeds of $233.0 million.

Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this press release that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements that, within the meaning of the federal securities laws including the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Words such as "may", "will", "expect", "intend", "plan", "believe", "seek", "could", "estimate", "judgment", "targeting", "should", "anticipate", "goal" and variations of these words and similar expressions, are also intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release address a variety of subjects, including the “Business Outlook” for our second quarter fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2018 operating results. Readers are cautioned that actual results could differ materially from those implied by such forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including global economic conditions, competitive pressures and pricing declines, intellectual property infringement claims, and other risks or uncertainties that are described under the caption “Risk Factors” in the final prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on April 28, 2017 and in our other SEC filings. Although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurances that our expectations will be attained. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report all financial information required in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the results of our operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by us include forward-looking non-GAAP gross margins,historical and forward-looking non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition- and disposition-related expenses (if any), amortization of acquired intangible assets, and charitable contributions made to the Cloudera Foundation from the Cloudera unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. In addition, we use non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding to calculate non-GAAP net loss per share. This non-GAAP measure includes the assumed conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock to common stock and the impact of anti-dilutive RSUs and options outstanding, on a weighted basis.
For a description of these items, including the reasons why management adjusts for them, and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information” as well as the related tables that precede it. We may consider whether other significant non-recurring items that arise in the future should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures we use.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core business, operating results or future outlook. Management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We use these non‑GAAP financial measures in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods.
