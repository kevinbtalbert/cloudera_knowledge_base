Press Release
Cybraics Builds on Cloudera to Accelerate Artificial Intelligence and Advance Cybersecurity Analytics



 









Cybersecurity AI company implements Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub to help automate analytics and decrease compute time
PALO ALTO, Calif., July 19, 2017  - Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the leading provider of the modern platform for machine learning and advanced analytics, announced that Cybraics, a security analytics and artificial intelligence company focused on solving the hardest problems in cybersecurity, is now deploying Cloudera as part of its nLighten platform, the first advanced security analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) platform delivered as-a-service. Cloudera’s Enterprise Data Hub helped Cybraics reduce the cost and complexity of deploying the nLighten platform, enabling better analysis of data used to identify and classify anomalies, and detect cybersecurity threats and attacks.
With more devices, attack vectors and vulnerabilities than ever before, the proliferation of unknown and undetected threats is rapidly growing. In addition, security teams are overburdened with managing volumes of data. With Cloudera’s Enterprise Data Hub, Cybraics found a solution that could support the analytic complexity of its AI capability and provide real-time access to the petabytes they process, making it possible to use all available data to assess cybersecurity risk and quickly identify threats.
“Cloudera’s Enterprise Data Hub has helped us enable a next generation data and analytics management platform, making it possible for Cybraics to extract the full value of our artificial intelligence technology,” said Alan Ross, Chief Technology Officer at Cybraics. “This platform shifts a significant portion of triaging security alerts from man to machine allowing security team to focus on what is most important. This is transformational technology, and Cloudera is strategic in facilitating this.”
Cybraics has seen a significant improvement in performance since it implemented Cloudera Enterprise. In the company’s initial prototypes, individual analytics would take up to eight hours to run against data. By incorporating Cloudera Enterprise into their technology stack, Cybraics can now process massive volumes of data in less than an hour and run individual analytics in minutes.
“Cybraics is addressing a significant problem for cybersecurity - proactively identifying nefarious cyber attacks on enterprise networks by applying AI to vast amounts of data and discovering anomalous activity, “ said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera.  “Collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data including netflows, deep packets, application activity, and applying AI techniques makes it possible for Cybraics to quickly detect and correlate outlier activity and advanced threats”
Cybraics, a company that, like Cloudera, also believes in an open approach to cybersecurity solutions, has embraced Apache Spot – the community-driven cybersecurity project built to bring advanced analytics to all IT telemetry data on an open, scalable platform. Cloudera, alongside Intel and other project collaborators, launched Spot in September of 2016 and continues to foster cybersecurity collaboration through Spot’s centralized hub for security data. By joining the Apache Spot community, Cybraics can access and share information to help push cybersecurity advancements into the open source community and at the same time deliver results to their customers in less time. As a contributor to Apache Spot, Cybraics will be making some of their custom analytics available to the community.
