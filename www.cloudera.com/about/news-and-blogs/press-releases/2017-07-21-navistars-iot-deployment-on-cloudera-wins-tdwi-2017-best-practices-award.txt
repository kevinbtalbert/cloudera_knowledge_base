Press Release
Navistar’s IoT Deployment on Cloudera Wins TDWI 2017 Best Practices Award



 









Using IoT-enabled predictive maintenance, Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub helps leading truck manufacturer slash downtime for 300,000+ vehicles up to 40%
PALO ALTO, Calif., July 21, 2017 - Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the leading provider of the modern platform for machine learning and advanced analytics, announced that TDWI, the leading global provider of analytics and data management research and education, has named Navistar’s Internet-of-Things (IoT) deployment of Cloudera a winner of the 2017 Best Practices Award in the Big Data category. Navistar, a leading manufacturer of commercial trucks, buses, defense vehicles and engines, was chosen for its IoT-enabled connected vehicles and real-time diagnostics solution, powered by Cloudera, that helps manage and maintain hundreds of thousands of vehicles through predictive analytics.
Navistar uses Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub to gather and analyze 70+ unique data feeds from connected vehicles in real-time, across multiple telematics sources. Since adopting Cloudera, Navistar has been able to gain real-time visibility of more than 300,000 vehicles, help customers reduce maintenance cost and vehicle downtime up to 40%, and immediately reduce spending on proprietary hardware and disk solutions. By utilizing the platform, Navistar is now able to offer real-time monitoring and advanced vehicle diagnostics as value-added services for its customers, which include fleet owners, large enterprises, government agencies, and local school administration.  One Navistar customer was able to reduce the vehicle maintenance costs-per-mile from 12-15 cents to just under three cents for its large fleet.
“Using IoT devices, machine learning and predictive analytics powered by Cloudera, Navistar has completely overhauled the way we sell, maintain and service our customers’ vehicle fleets,” said Ashish Bayas, chief technology officer at Navistar. “As a company nearly two centuries old, we are proud of our digital transformation and the momentum we have built in the marketplace. We use real-time IoT data to frame essential business decisions and deploy predictive maintenance to manage customers’ fleets. This innovation has opened up new revenue streams for our business and added service offerings and value for our customers, while transforming the vehicle manufacturing industry.”
With Cloudera, Navistar is able to apply data management and advanced analytics practices that accelerate the company’s IoT and connected vehicle journey. Building a massively scalable platform to derive valuable insights from multiple data sources and formats, Navistar is driving critical business decisions, further improving their products and services and increasing their industry-leading uptime for trucks and engines.
“Cloudera empowers organizations to become data‑driven enterprises in this newly hyperconnected world. Connected cars, including trucks and buses of tomorrow, could generate up to 25 GB of data per hour – meaning a highly scalable data management and advanced analytics platform is imperative,” said Amr Awadallah, cofounder and chief technology officer at Cloudera. “We are helping multiple industries deliver next generation products and services using data from IoT sensors. We enable companies such as Navistar to leverage machine learning and advanced analytic techniques to transform the massive volumes of data that IoT generates into new business value.”
TDWI chooses winners for the Best Practices Awards by enlisting a panel of independent judges who have expertise in each of the awards’ categories. Entries are scored on business value, maturity, innovation and relevance to other organizations. The Big Data category honors organizations that are working with various types of big data, especially data from web applications, social media, machines, sensors, streams, devices, grids, surveillance equipment, geospatial systems, and the IoT. Cloudera and Navistar were chosen for the solutions’ use of real-time streaming, advanced IoT devices and predictive analytics that demonstrated measurable business value.
