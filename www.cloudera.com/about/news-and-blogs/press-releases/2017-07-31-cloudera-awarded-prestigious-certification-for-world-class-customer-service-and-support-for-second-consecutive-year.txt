Press Release
Cloudera Awarded Prestigious Certification for World Class Customer Service and Support for Second Consecutive Year



 









Company Meets Stringent Criteria Under Service Capability & Performance (SCP) Standards Certification
PALO ALTO, Calif., July 31, 2017  - Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the leading provider of the modern platform for machine learning and advanced analytics, announced that for the second consecutive year it has achieved certification under the prestigious Service Capability & Performance (SCP) Standards for delivering world class customer service and support. Based on a stringent set of over 100 major performance factors, the SCP Standards quantify the effectiveness of service and support operations.
"Effective enterprise technical support is one of the primary reasons many of the largest companies in the world choose to work with Cloudera today," said Angus Klein, vice president, Support at Cloudera. "Quite simply, we make it easy and cost-effective for our customers to get mission critical technical support as their requirements grow. While we are pleased to re-certify with SCP Standards, it's equally important that we use feedback from the certification process to drive further improvements to the Global Cloudera Technical Assistance Center (CTAC)."
Cloudera recently completed its annual, comprehensive SCP Standards recertification audit as part of the company’s commitment to delivering outstanding enterprise-grade service. The audit helps ensure the right organizational structures, tooling, and systems are in place and effective in meeting the ongoing demands and business needs of Cloudera customers. It also details areas for improvement. For example, Cloudera has implemented several customer service enhancements based on findings from last year’s audit, including:

Improving the effectiveness of Cloudera Customer Operations Engineers (COEs) through soft skills training program enhancements
Speeding time to productivity for CTAC personnel with a new Learning Management System
Providing a more consistent and higher quality customer service experience across Cloudera’s global CTACs
Helping customers more quickly recognize value from their Cloudera investment by implementing new programs that ensure the enterprise readiness of new products and services

The SCP Standards provide a benchmark of service excellence that enable companies to validate performance and drive continuous improvement in order to deliver the best overall service experience. SCP Standards audits help drive consistency across an entire organization, improving service touch points, increasing efficiency and productivity, enhancing operational and financial performance, and creating a competitive advantage. More than two hundred service organizations including EMC, NetApp, Teradata, and other enterprise companies around the world are using SCP Standards to improve business operations.
“Cloudera's dedication to the continuous improvement of their service operations demonstrates a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and service excellence," said Greg Coleman, vice president of strategic programs for Service Strategies. "While Cloudera performed well in the previous year's audit under the Service Capability & Performance Standards, the company made significant improvements that were identified during the 2017 audit that provide customers with an exceptional service experience and ensure the company continues to deliver the highest quality services in the years to come.”
