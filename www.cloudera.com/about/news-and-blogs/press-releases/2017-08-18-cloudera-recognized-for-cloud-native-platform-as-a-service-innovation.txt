Press Release
Cloudera Recognized for Cloud-Native Platform-as-a-Service Innovation



 









Company wins two awards: the Stratus Award for Cloud Computing by Business Intelligence Group; and for the third time, best Hadoop Solution by DBTA Readers' Choice
PALO ALTO, Calif., August 18, 2017 — Cloudera, Inc., (NYSE: CLDR), the leading platform provider for machine learning, advanced analytics and data management built for the cloud, announced that it has been named a winner for two accolades: the Stratus Awards for Cloud Computing in the Platform-as-a-Service for Enterprise category by the Business Intelligence Group, and the 2017 Readers' Choice Awards in the Best Hadoop Solution category by Database Trends and Applications (DBTA). This is Cloudera’s fourth year in a row either winning or placing in the DBTA Readers' Choice Awards.
The Stratus Awards for Cloud Computing recognizes Cloudera Altus, a platform-as-a-service that makes it easy and cost-effective to process large-scale data sets in the public cloud, such as with Amazon Web Services (AWS). The end-user focused platform was designed to simplify big data workloads in the cloud. This managed service, introduced in May, simplifies the process of building and running elastic data pipelines, eliminates data silos and has backward compatibility and platform portability with built-in workload management.
“Congratulations to the Cloudera team for helping enterprise customers accelerate the adoption of their solutions in the cloud,” said Maria Jimenez, chief nominations officer of the Business Intelligence Group. “A whole new class of elastic data-driven apps will now be available to all organizations who embrace the public cloud.”
Cloudera’s three-time win of the DBTA Readers' Choice Award underscores the company’s continued contributions to the large Apache Hadoop ecosystem of open source projects. Cloudera was named the winner of this award in 2015 and 2014, and a finalist in 2016. This year, Cloudera was also recognized as a finalist in the Best Big Data Platform category.
“Today, more than ever, businesses are looking for ways to manage and leverage their information resources to create new opportunities and deliver a real competitive advantage,” said Tom Hogan, Group Publisher of Database Trends and Applications magazine. “There is an expanding array of solutions for storing, protecting, integrating, enhancing and analyzing data. The DBTA Readers’ Choice Awards play a key role in spreading information about products that are providing a unique value to customers. Our congratulations go out to all the winners and finalists.”
“The Stratus Awards for Cloud Computing honors Cloudera’s efforts to bring forth an innovative Platform-as-a-Service offering and meet the agility, convenience and lowest total cost of ownership requirements that our customers demand,” said Amr Awadallah, chief technology officer at Cloudera. “And our third win of the Database Trends and Applications Readers’ Choice Awards reinforces our commitment to helping expand the diverse open-source ecosystem, which incorporates the latest technologies and is future-proof.”
