Press Release
Cloudera deepens commitment in Asia Pacific through expansion of operations in Indonesia



 









Leading machine learning and analytics platform provider to augment Indonesia’s digital transformation initiatives through strategic partnerships and expanded customer networks
JAKARTA, Indonesia, 29 August, 2017 — Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the
modern platform for machine learning and analytics, optimized for the cloud, announced the launch of its official entity in Indonesia, deepening its commitment to the Asia Pacific region. The opening ceremony was officiated by Mr. Rudiantara, Minister of Communications and Informatics, Republic of Indonesia.
Cloudera’s expansion into Indonesia was strategically charted to bolster the government’s Smart City initiatives and upskill professionals across the technology industry. The Indonesia office will support its strong prospects for growth, with local hires filling key roles across functions such as Sales, Solutions Engineering and Solutions Architecture. Together with the recent launch of the Cloudera BASE Initiative, an industry-led ecosystem designed to groom a future workforce of data professionals, Cloudera’s deepened commitment in the market will accelerate efforts to strengthen the big data community in the region and yield a new generation of skilled professionals to spearhead Indonesia’s rising digital economy.
"As we strive towards realizing digital transformation in Indonesian cities, government, businesses and the community must be empowered with the right resources and expertise for it. The launch of Cloudera Indonesia as an official entity enables us to forge a stronger partnership with the company to strengthen Indonesian human resources’ big data capabilities and expertise. I sincerely hope that Cloudera’s deepened commitment in Indonesia will help take us a step further in the journey to success through big data utilizations.” said Mr. Rudiantara.
With its Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore, Cloudera works with customers across many industries such as telecommunications, financial services and government sectors to better equip them to address the challenges that organizations often face with data. Cloudera’s solutions have been adopted by several leading organizations in Indonesia including Bank Danamon, Bank Mandiri, and Telkomsel to accelerate data capabilities to support business roadmaps in technology innovation, increase revenue, improve customer service, detect fraud and reduce compliance cost in today’s digital age.
Through Cloudera’s strong network of partners like the recently announced partnership with Tech Data, businesses in Indonesia will be empowered with a competitive edge through a scalable and robust data environment. Cloudera aims to promote innovation, accelerate pace of technology adoption and contribute towards developing Indonesia as a connected country of opportunity in the future. 
Cloudera has also recently appointed Mark Micallef as the Vice President of Asia Pacific and Japan, to spearhead the organization’s expansion in the region. “As governments and organizations across the region drive digital transformation through Smart City projects, it is crucial that businesses are given the right support and tools to enable success. Cloudera’s expansion into Indonesia is a testament to our commitment in providing businesses with a modern platform for machine learning and advanced analytics that not only tackles the complexity of data, but enables them to overcome today’s challenges. We plan to play a critical role to help strengthen Indonesia’s digital capabilities and contribute to the nation’s efforts in building a digital economy,” said Micallef.
