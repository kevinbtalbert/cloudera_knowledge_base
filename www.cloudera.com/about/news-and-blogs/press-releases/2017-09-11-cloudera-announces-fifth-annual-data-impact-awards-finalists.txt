Press Release
Cloudera Announces Fifth Annual Data Impact Awards Finalists



 









Number of nominations jumped 65 percent year-over-year; submissions highlight insight-driven innovations from organizations worldwide
PALO ALTO, Calif., September 11, 2017 — Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics optimized for the cloud, announced finalists for this year’s Data Impact Awards. In its fifth year, the awards program increased by 65 percent in number of nominations from 2016. The Data Impact Awards recognize the leading organizations that are running Cloudera Enterprise in a production environment, resulting in innovations that demonstrate the biggest impacts to technology, science, health, lifestyle, and community across a wide variety of industries. The winners will be announced at the annual Data Impact Awards Celebration on Tuesday, 26th September in tandem with Strata Data 2017, New York.
Finalists were selected by a panel of third-party thought leaders in the data management and analytics space, from executives and industry analysts to professors and media experts.
"It's clear from the entries for the Data Impact Awards that real companies are delivering meaningful transformation with advanced data processing solutions across all industries,” said first-year judge,  Maribel Lopez, founder of Lopez Research. “The entrants are improving operational efficiencies, but also delivering new business models such as 'as-a-service' offerings."
“The caliber and sheer diversity of use cases made it more challenging than ever to choose winners this year,” said fourth-year judge, Tony Baer, principal analyst at Ovum. “The breadth of the candidate pool revealed just how far enterprises in sectors outside classic early adopters have matured in their understanding of big data and harnessing the power of the community. The use cases have grown sufficiently compelling, that the Data Impact Awards really lived up to their name this year.”
