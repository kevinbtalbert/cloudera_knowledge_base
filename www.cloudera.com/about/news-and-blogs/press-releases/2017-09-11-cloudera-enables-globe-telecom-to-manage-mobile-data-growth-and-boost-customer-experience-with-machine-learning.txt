Press Release
Cloudera Enables Globe Telecom to Manage Mobile Data Growth and Boost Customer Experience with Machine Learning



 









Leading telecommunications service provider achieves 360-degree customer view; improves real-time marketing campaigns to 60 million customers
MANILA, Philippines, 12 September, 2017 — Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics optimized for the cloud, announced that Globe Telecom has used the Cloudera platform to successfully enhance customer experience and deliver real-time targeted marketing campaigns and offers to its 60 million customers. Globe Telecom, a leading provider of telecommunication services in the Philippines, is using machine learning with Cloudera to enrich customer experiences across channels and deliver targeted and optimized products and services, while maintaining compliance with the latest industry data regulations.
As expanding numbers of consumers adopt a digital lifestyle, telecommunications companies like Globe Telecom are looking to manage the increased volume of data with technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) to glean real-time insights of consumer behavior.
Globe Telecom’s mobile data traffic grew 85 percent from 151 petabytes (PB) in 2016 to 280 PB this year and mobile data is a growing and significant contributor to total mobile revenues for the first half of 2017 versus the similar period a year ago, according to Globe’s quarterly results announcement. 
“To sustain our growth, we are always looking for ways to improve customer experiences across our channels and touchpoints. Our ability to strategically manage and monetize information about our customers will enable us to deliver value-added products and further differentiate ourselves in today’s competitive business landscape,” said Gil Genio, Chief Technology and Information Officer at Globe Telecom. 
With Cloudera Enterprise now at the core of Globe Telecom’s data management architecture, the increasing volumes of data are ingested from different sources and channels into a centralized data hub and made available to all employees across the organization with full fidelity and security.
“Telecommunications companies are known for the large amount of consumer data they collect daily, but are challenged to manage and use the data effectively,” said Mark Micallef, regional vice president, Asia Pacific and Japan at Cloudera. “Cloudera’s platform scales to today’s and future data volumes and delivers machine learning and advanced analytics techniques to become data and insight driven. Globe Telecom can now use data to gain valuable insights, make accurate business decisions faster and deliver targeted marketing campaigns and offers to enhance their customer’s experience.”
