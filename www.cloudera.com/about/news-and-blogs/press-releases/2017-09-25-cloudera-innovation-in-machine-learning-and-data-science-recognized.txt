Press Release
Cloudera Innovation in Machine Learning and Data Science Recognized



 









Selected by Datanami for Readers’ and Editors’ Choice Awards
STRATA DATA New York — September 25, 2017 — Cloudera, Inc., (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics, optimized for the cloud, announced that it has been named a winner for two accolades in the second annual Datanami Readers’ and Editors’ Choice awards presented during the 2017 Strata Data Conference. In the “Best Data Science Platform” category,  Cloudera Data Science Workbench was voted the winner by readers. And for the second year in a row, Cloudera was selected as a “Top 5 Vendors to Watch” by editors.
“Cloudera is focused on helping teams apply machine learning to practical business problems,” said Mick Hollison, chief marketing officer at Cloudera. “It’s an honor to be recognized by Datanami in our efforts to simplify the development and use of machine learning-based applications with Cloudera Data Science Workbench built for analysts, developers and data scientists to work easier together.”
The Datanami Readers’ and Editors’ Choice Awards are determined through a nomination and voting process with input from the global Big Data community, as well as selections from the Datanami editors, to highlight key trends, shine a spotlight on technological breakthroughs and capture a critical cross section of the state of the industry. These awards are revealed each year to kick off the annual Strata Data Conference, presented by O'Reilly Media and Cloudera, which showcases data science, machine learning and analytics for business and technical professionals.
"Datanami is the premiere news portal covering Big Data and advanced-scale analytics and its readers are at the forefront of the global data science community. By taking part in our annual Readers’ Choice program, our readership has the privilege of honoring the top organizations making strides in Big Data today,” said Tom Tabor, CEO of Tabor Communications, publisher of Datanami. "The Datanami Readers’ and Editors’ Choice Awards voice not only our support, but also the appreciation from the community at large, and we couldn’t be more proud to celebrate these organizations and their accomplishments. Our congratulations go out to all the winners.”
