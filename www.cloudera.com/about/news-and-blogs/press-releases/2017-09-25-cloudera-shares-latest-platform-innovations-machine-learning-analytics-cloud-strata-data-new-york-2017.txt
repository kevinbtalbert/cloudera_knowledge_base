Press Release
Cloudera to Share Latest Platform Innovations in Machine Learning, Analytics and Cloud at Strata Data New York 2017



 









Cloudera Founder and Chief Strategy Officer, Mike Olson to Deliver Keynotes Alongside Apple and Navistar
NEW YORK, New York – (Strata Data Conference) – September 25, 2017 — Cloudera, Inc., (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics, optimized for the cloud, announced that Mike Olson, Chief Strategy Officer and founder will deliver two keynotes at Strata Data New York 2017 (Strata Data.) At the intersection of cutting-edge science and new business fundamentals, Strata Data is where attendees come together to learn about emerging techniques and technologies in data science, and develop new skills through case studies, panel sessions, and in-depth tutorials.
On Wednesday, September 27, Cesar Delgado, Siri platform architect at Apple, will join Mike Olson, founder and chief strategy officer at Cloudera, to show how Apple is using its big data stack and expertise to solve non-data problems. On Thursday, September 28, Olson will present alongside Terry Kline, senior vice president and chief information officer at Navistar, a leading manufacturer of commercial trucks, buses, defense vehicles, and engines, to take a look at how machine learning and predictive analytics can accelerate the Internet of Things (IoT) and keep more than 300,000 connected vehicles running.
Formerly known as Strata + Hadoop World, Strata Data Conference was created in 2012, when O’Reilly and Cloudera merged their two successful big data-focused conferences. Cloudera’s chief architect and founder of Apache Hadoop, Doug Cutting alongside Ben Lorica, Chief Data Scientist at O'Reilly, and entrepreneur Alistair Croll have since created a collegial program that covers the entire range of big data tools and technologies. This year, Cloudera will continue to lead discussions around IoT, machine learning, Spark, security, AI, and more. Additional Cloudera speakers include industry leaders, senior engineers, developers, architects, product managers, and subject matter experts delivering more than twenty trainings, sessions, tutorials and executive briefings over the course of the four-day conference.
