Press Release
Cloudera Launches SDX, a Shared Data Experience for the Enterprise



 









Game-changing SDX technologies make complex machine learning & analytics apps easier to develop, less expensive to deploy and more secure
STRATA DATA New York, NY — September 26, 2017 — Cloudera, Inc., Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics, optimized for the cloud, launched Cloudera SDX, a modular software framework that enables companies to have a “shared data experience”.  By applying a centralized, consistent framework for schema, security, governance, data ingest and more, SDX makes it possible for dozens of different customer applications to run against shared or overlapping sets of data. SDX makes multi-function data applications easier to develop, less expensive to deploy and more consistently secure. Cloudera SDX is available today for Cloudera Enterprise customers.
Addressing many of today’s executive-level initiatives - cybersecurity, connecting products and services, increasing the lifetime value of a customer and more -  requires several different complex applications working together. For example, Internet of things (IoT) applications often involve ingest, ad hoc analytics, and machine learning on batch and streaming data. Next-best-offer platforms use machine learning and real-time processing together. In many cases these multi-function application clusters either run on cloud infrastructure or rely on data that was generated in the cloud.
Developing and delivering these complex applications is a challenge in multi-tenant clusters on-premises, and it’s particularly difficult in cloud environments because data context and policies don’t persist in transient environments. Furthermore, most cloud services are actually siloed applications running in isolated clusters.
SDX enables customers to create, govern, secure, and manage these multi-function, high-value analytic applications. SDX also facilitates Cloudera-certified partner solutions that integrate with and further enhance the platform capabilities.
A key component within Cloudera SDX is a shared data catalog upon which consistent security, governance, and management functions can be established and leveraged for both long-running and transient analytics applications. The shared catalog also enables self-service access to business data, because IT is no longer required to recreate context and controls or each new use case.
“Companies often cite security, governance, and complexity among their primary reasons for not moving their operational workloads to cloud,” said Tony Baer, principal analyst at Ovum. “Cloudera has planted its stake in the ground by building in the security and data governance features to make companies confident in standing up their big data workloads in production . Cloudera SDX builds on the company’s IP with a shared data experience across cloud and on-premises environments.”


Cloudera SDX addresses the following critical challenges for businesses:

Siloed data - Self-service clusters in the cloud do not naturally share data and metadata, so individual clusters become de facto silos. By sharing persistent data and metadata across on-demand applications and transient clusters, Cloudera customers can stay agile and ensure each isolated cluster does not require individual control and management nor incur the additional cost of data replication and storage.
Security breaches - Without centralized security controls, administrators are forced to continuously reapply security and access policies against multiple copies of siloed data, creating extra work and greater risk of exposing sensitive information.  With Cloudera SDX, security is applied consistently at the data level. Policies are pervasive and do not need to change or be reapplied when the data is moved or used within a new analytics application.
Governance challenges/noncompliance - A shared data and metadata catalog is imperative for dealing with HIPAA and PCI-DSS compliance today and looming requirements like GDPR. A shared data catalog makes it easy to quickly find and understand the context of data, enabling self-service applications and providing inviolable audit and lineage functionality.

The following features, available next month in Cloudera 5.13, deliver enhanced SDX capabilities for cloud environments:

Multi-cluster catalog, a Hive metastore based on shared Amazon RDS or shared MySQL for Azure users, to store and manage context about data
Multi-cluster Cloudera Navigator capabilities that make it easier for users to discover data and govern access, meet audit requirements, and understand lineage
Multi-cluster Sentry security permissions and policies to provide granular, role-based access controls to shared data
The same Cloudera Manager interface for clusters anywhere, for more simplified operations and enhanced data authentication
Backup and disaster recovery from on-premises clusters to Amazon S3

“SDX is the ‘secret sauce’ within Cloudera Enterprise that accelerates data science, machine learning, and analytics,” said Mike Olson, founder and chief strategy officer at Cloudera. “Data is the world’s most valuable resource. It is the fuel that drives insights, powers machines, and solves impossible problems. From day one Cloudera’s focus has been on helping companies extract value from their data. Cloudera SDX simplifies this mission for IT and business users alike.”
 
What Customers and Partners are Saying
“SDX provides an impressive set of capabilities required to successfully deploy and manage a modern analytics platform,” said Wei Zheng, vice president, Products at Trifacta. “As our customers utilize Trifacta to wrangle raw data into clean outputs to perform analytics and machine learning, they generate quite a bit of metadata that is incredibly valuable to an organization’s data governance efforts. We’re excited about how Trifacta's integration with SDX will enable joint customers to more effectively manage metadata and make it available to various stakeholders for security and governance.”
"SDX is yet another innovation that creates more value for our joint customers by providing shared services and simplifying security and governance for enterprise data,” said Girish Pancha, chief executive officer at StreamSets. “StreamSets award winning platform for data ingest both reads from and writes to the catalog of business and technical metadata.  Customers can thus help break down data silos and deliver better data SLAs to end users, so they can be more effective and efficient in analyzing data within Cloudera."
“With the Cloudera platform, our Sepsis Biosurveillance tool enables earlier detection in patients, which reduced mortality rates significantly,” said Dr. Joseph Colorafi, Vice President System, Chief Medical Information Officer at Dignity Health. “Cloudera SDX allows us to apply consistent governance and security including encryption at rest and in motion, authorization, authentication, and the full set of requirements to be HIPAA compliant.”
Cloudera SDX supports multiple public cloud, private cloud and bare metal configurations and
is available today for customers with Cloudera Data Science and Engineering, Analytic DB, Operational DB, or Enterprise Data Hub licenses.

There is no other foundation right now that focuses exclusively on using data analytics and machine learning to advance solutions to these issues,” said Claudia Juech, Executive Director, Cloudera Foundation. “I am excited about launching a bigger platform for the work Cloudera staff has started with Cloudera Cares and to work with my colleagues to have a positive impact on many more people. I look forward to working with non-profit organizations, other foundations, as well as people in academia, policy, and the corporate world, to realize the full potential of big data in an ethical and fair way for the benefit of people everywhere.”
