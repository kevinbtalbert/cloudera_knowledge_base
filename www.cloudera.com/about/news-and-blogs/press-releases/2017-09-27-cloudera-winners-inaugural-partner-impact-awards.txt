Press Release
Cloudera Announces Winners of Inaugural Partner Impact Awards



 









Recognizes Partner Innovations with Cloudera's Machine Learning and Analytics Platform
STRATA DATA New York — September 27, 2017 — Cloudera, Inc., (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics, optimized for the cloud, announced the winners of its inaugural Partner Impact Awards, which consist of the Best Solution Awards and the Business Excellence Awards. The Best Solution Awards celebrate partners who developed and implemented solutions which help Cloudera’s customers gain insights into their businesses. The Business Excellence Awards recognize partners who grew their revenue, pipeline and overall investment in driving joint business with Cloudera.
“In this new phase of Cloudera’s growth, partners are even more critical to the success of our customers.  We find it important to recognize and celebrate their innovation and their contribution to the successes of our customers. Cloudera’s ecosystem is large and fast growing, it includes tech giants and startups providing hundreds of solutions across multiple industries.” said Philippe Marinier, vice president of Business Development at Cloudera. “We want to thank all the applicants for their investment and their collaboration in delivering impactful solutions to customers.”
In order to demonstrate their solution’s success with customers, the Best Solution Awards nominees are also required to submit for the Data Impact Award. The Best Solution Awards winners were selected based on the solutions’ impact on customer business transformation and the Business Excellence Award winners were selected based on Cloudera business metrics.  The winners in each category were selected by a panel of Cloudera judges.
