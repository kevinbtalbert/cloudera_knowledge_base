Press Release
BCS Technology Launches Machine Learning-based Chatbot Solution to Drive Customer Insights



 









New ‘Interactive Social Airline Automated Companion’ now available on Cloudera Solutions Gallery
SYDNEY, Australia, 28 September, 2017 – Cloudera, Inc. BCS Technology, a global IT company headquartered in Australia providing end to end solutions in big data and analytics, announced the launch of their chatbot solution - Interactive Social Airline Automated Companion (ISAAC) built on Cloudera’s modern platform for machine learning and analytics optimized for the cloud - Cloudera Enterprise. ISAAC is now available on Cloudera’s Solutions Gallery. ISAAC, analyses customer conversations in the airline and travel industry to derive insights and gain a 360-degree view of their customers in the easiest and most convenient way possible.
The solution combines the use of modern big data analytics technologies and natural language processing (NLP) by leveraging Microsoft’s LUIS framework and the Cloudera Enterprise platform. Businesses are able to create a customer experience using ISAAC that not only generates effective communication using predictive analytics, but also has the ability to collect this data and transform and translate it into prospective strategies and opportunities.
“The launch of ISAAC in the wider market will have a significant impact on charting future customer loyalty strategies, sales promotions and competition in the industry,” said Richard Parhusip, BCS Technology’s Commercial Director.
Our clients, as well as their own customers, have requested for a chatbot advanced enough to replicate the experience a person has when communicating with a human. ISAAC has the ability to predict what the customer might want and make suggestions accordingly. This not only improves the customer experience but allows companies to upsell and cross sell effectively.
“With Cloudera’s machine learning and advanced analytics technology at the core of ISAAC, businesses can now use data to gain valuable insights, make accurate business decisions faster and deliver better products and services to enhance their customers’ experiences. We are confident that our partnership with BCS Technology will continue to deliver innovative solutions in the big data and analytics space,” said Shyam Sundar Srinivasan, regional director for Australia and New Zealand at Cloudera.
With its effortless integration into any e-commerce website, its ability to simplify and analyse data gathered, to delivering intuitive business outcomes, ISAAC is a true example of the progression and application of data science and analytics in today’s digital era.
BCS will be sponsoring the upcoming Cloudera Sessions in Melbourne and Sydney, where more details about its services and partners will be shared. Technical experts from BCS will also be speaking at the event, where you can learn more and discuss their experience and knowledge in big data and analytics.
To find out more information on ISSAC, visit the BCS Technology website, or speak to one of our consultants at info@bcstechnology.com.au
