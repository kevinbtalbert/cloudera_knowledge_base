Press Release
Cloudera Speeds Analytics Deployment for Cybersecurity Hub



 









New Service Simplifies Path to Deploying Next Generation Cybersecurity Hub, Making Machine Learning Easier and Accessible
PALO ALTO, Calif. – October 23, 2017 – Cloudera, Inc., (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics, optimized for the cloud, announced that it has partnered with Arcadia Data, Centrify, and StreamSets to simplify the first use case on the cybersecurity hub. Leveraging Cloudera Manager’s parcel deployment capabilities, chief information security officers (CISOs) can now access Cloudera’s cybersecurity solution based on Apache Spot (incubating), through an app store-like experience, making machine learning simple and accessible by removing the barrier of entry to data-driven insights for security operation centers. The new feature also provides easy access to associated ISV capabilities such as ingestion, visualization, and analytics. Get the step by step tutorial here.
Today’s threat landscape presents a clear need for a fast and simple way to gain enterprise-wide visibility and to accelerate the rate of threat detection, investigation, and response. Cloudera’s next generation cybersecurity hub enables anomaly detection, behavior analytics, and comprehensive access across all enterprise data using an open, scalable platform. With this app-like experience, Cloudera is enabling organizations to expedite security use cases such as cyber vulnerability and events analytics.
“CISOs understand that today’s threats require investment in open, scalable, future proofed data platforms,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. “At Cloudera, we want to remove as much of the friction as we can and make it easy for CISOs to deploy their first big data cyber use cases. Together with our partners, Cloudera is providing CISOs with a point and click path to deploy and benefit from a next generation cybersecurity data platform.”
Cloudera’s partners are already contributing to the new service and deployment capabilities for the cybersecurity hub that allow for easy deployment via Cloudera Manager, working towards effective next generation solutions that better secure their customer’s business.
Arcadia Data provides the visualization capabilities including pre-configured application screens that let security operations centers quickly analyze data that resides in Cloudera’s solution. Read more about Arcadia Data’s application.

"CISOs need a faster way to detect and respond to cyber threats across diverse and ever-growing digital endpoints, networks, and users," said Priyank Patel, co-founder and chief product officer at Arcadia Data. "Arcadia Enterprise was architected for big data analytics and provides the powerful visualizations to let security analysts quickly identify cyber threats, effectively perform forensic analysis, and hunt for the unknown. We are excited to collaborate with Cloudera to provide out-of-the-box visual analytics which illuminate the value of Apache Spot as a leading big data open source cybersecurity solution".
Centrify has worked with the community to define the user data model so that Centrify data can seamlessly land in the community-defined open data model.
 
Centrify
“According to Verizon, identity is the top attack vector for hackers and we have seen that compromised credentials for both IT and end users have increasingly resulted in data breaches. Centrify provides a single comprehensive platform to secure each user’s access to applications and infrastructure through the power of identity services,” said Bill Mann, chief product officer at Centrify. “Centrify is working with Cloudera to help Apache Spot incorporate Identity information into the Open Data Model from Centrify Identity Services, ensuring that Apache Spot has the most comprehensive data sources for advanced analytics to prevent attacks.”
StreamSets has donated ingestion pipelines to the community in order to accelerate data ingest for the Cloudera cyber solution.
 
StreamSets
“Getting consumption-ready data into the enterprise data hub while managing the ever-changing data sources is critical to unlock the potential of big data for cybersecurity,” said Kirit Basu, Head of Products at StreamSets. “Our partnership and technical integrations with Cloudera and Apache Spot make it easy for our customers to deploy ingestion pipelines quickly and operate them continuously with real-time monitoring and alerts.”
