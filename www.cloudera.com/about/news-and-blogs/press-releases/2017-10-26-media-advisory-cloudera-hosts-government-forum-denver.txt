DENVER, CO. – October 26, 2017
What: Cloudera (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics, optimized for the cloud, announced the Cloudera Government Forum Denver.

When: Tuesday, November 7, 2017 from 7:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. MT
Where: The Denver Art Museum, 100 West 14th Ave Parkway, Denver, CO 80204
Why: Public sector agencies generate vast amounts of data on a daily basis and are increasingly challenged – within budget constraints – to maximize that data into actionable insights to improve citizen services and decision-making. A modern platform for machine learning and analytics can enable agencies to better understand data patterns, predict outcomes, and provide scalable solutions at the lowest cost per terabyte.
The Cloudera Government Forum Denver brings together Cloudera experts and public sector leaders to discuss use cases and examine how data, machine learning and analytics can be harnessed to improve efficiency and transform the public sector. Benefits of a modern data platform include enhancing security to improve threat detection and mitigation, modernizing IT architectures to strengthen operations, and transforming government services with transparency and cost-savings.
