Press Release
Cloudera Ranked as One of the Fastest Growing Companies in North America on Deloitte’s 2017 Technology Fast 500









Company Continues to Lead Technological Innovation in Emerging Enterprise Machine Learning and Analytics Market
PALO ALTO, Calif., December 11, 2017 — Cloudera, Inc., (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics optimized for the cloud, announced its ranking as one of the fastest growing companies in North America on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500™. This annual ranking showcases the growth of companies in the technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences, and energy tech sectors.
“We continue to demonstrate sustained growth and penetration in machine learning and analytics, as we add more solutions for the cloud by developing innovative technology that gives our enterprise customers the solutions they need in the age of digital transformation,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. “An example of this focus on innovation is our acquisition earlier this year of a recognized leader in machine learning applied research, development, and solutions, Fast Forward Labs.”
In addition to the Deloitte Technology Fast 500 recognition, Cloudera has won multiple awards this year including Datanami Editors’ Choice Award, IoT & Innovation Award, Big Data 50 award, and 2017 Stratus Award, to name a few. Awardees of the Deloitte Technology Fast 500 are selected for this honor based on percentage fiscal year revenue growth from 2013 to 2016. Overall, the 2017 Technology Fast 500 companies achieved revenue growth ranging from 135 percent to 59,093 percent in the 2013 to 2016 time frame, with a median growth rate of 380 percent.
“The Deloitte 2017 North America Technology Fast 500 winners underscore the impact of technological innovation and world-class customer service in driving growth, in a fiercely competitive environment,” said Sandra Shirai, vice chairman, Deloitte Consulting LLP and U.S. technology, media, and telecommunications leader. “These companies are on the cutting edge and are transforming the way we do business. We extend our sincere congratulations to all the winners for achieving remarkable growth while delivering new services and experiences for their customers.”
“Emerging growth companies are powering innovation in the broader economy. The growth rates delivered by the companies on this year’s North America Technology Fast 500 ranking are a bright spot for the capital markets and a strong indicator that the emerging growth technology sector will continue to deliver a strong return on investment,” said Heather Gates, national managing director of Deloitte & Touche LLP’s emerging growth company practice. “Deloitte is dedicated to supporting the best and brightest companies of the future in the emerging growth company sector. We are proud to acknowledge the significant accomplishments of this year’s Fast 500 winners.”
