Press Release
Cloudera Honored as a Recipient of Navistar International 2017 Diamond Supplier Award









PALO ALTO, Calif., February 27, 2018 — Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics optimized for the cloud, announced Navistar International Corp. (NYSE: NAV), a leading manufacturer of commercial trucks, buses, defense vehicles, and engines, has awarded Cloudera  with the 2017 Diamond Supplier Award. The Diamond Supplier award is reserved for the best-in-class companies in Navistar’s supply base and the top two percent of suppliers were selected out of their portfolio of several thousand vendors. Cloudera is the only technology company to achieve this honor in 2017.

“We are delighted to acknowledge our best suppliers with the elite Diamond Supplier Award.
The suppliers earning top honors this year demonstrated an unwavering commitment to quality,
delivered customer value and partnered with us on cost-effective, innovative solutions,” said Dennis Mooney, senior vice president, global product development at Navistar.
Demonstrating a strong partnership, Cloudera and Navistar won the 2018 IoT Breakthrough Award for Connected Car Innovation. In July 2017, TDWI, the leading global provider of analytics and data management research and education, named Navistar's Internet-of-Things (IoT) deployment of Cloudera, a winner of the 2017 Best Practices Award in the Big Data category. These industry honors showcase Cloudera and Navistar’s commitment to customers by reducing maintenance costs by more than 30% and trimming budget on legacy hardware.
“For the first time, we included a software supplier in the winner’s circle of our closest business partners who helped make an impact to our business,” said Terry Kline, senior vice president and chief information officer at Navistar. “Cloudera has demonstrated their commitment to execution with their modern enterprise platform and by their team’s high standard of technical expertise and customer service. They have helped us transform into a data-driven organization.”
Navistar built an IoT-enabled connected vehicles and real-time diagnostics solution, powered by Cloudera, which helps manage and maintain a fleet of 375,000 connected trucks through predictive analytics. The data from connected vehicles is accessed by more than 800 applications and by using Cloudera SDX, Navistar is able to unify security, governance, and compliance across all of the data, and drastically simplify usability and management. The platform enables Navistar to protect sensitive customer data while driving interactive queries across hundreds of terabytes of vehicle data on premises and in the cloud.
“Together, Navistar and Cloudera are using machine learning and advanced analytic techniques to transform the massive volumes of data that IoT generates into new business value," said Dave Shuman, IoT and manufacturing industry leader at Cloudera. “We will continue to focus on developing solutions that improve the customer experience, and we are honored to receive this recognition from Navistar."
