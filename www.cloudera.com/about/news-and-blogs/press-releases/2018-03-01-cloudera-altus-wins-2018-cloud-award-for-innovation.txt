Press Release
Cloudera Altus Wins 2018 Cloud Award for Innovation









PALO ALTO, Calif., March 1, 2018 — Cloudera, Inc., (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics optimized for the cloud, announced that Cloudera Altus has been named a winner of the 2017-18 Cloud Awards for Most Innovative Use of Data in the Cloud. The first and largest recognition program of its kind, the Cloud Awards honors achievements in cloud computing across the globe. Cloudera was chosen for pioneering the first multi-cloud, multi-function platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for data engineering and analytics that provides an easy, unified and enterprise-ready solution with offerings on both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.
Click to Tweet: Award for innovation in the #Cloud goes to... @Cloudera Altus! http://bit.ly/2EZBxIG Multi-cloud, multi-function PaaS for unified data engineering and #analytics.
According to IDC, the public cloud deployment represented 17.5% of the overall Big Data and Analytics (BDA) software market in 2016 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 27.0% through 2021, compared with a CAGR of 5.5% for on-premises/other software deployment methods. IDC expects just over one-third of the BDA market to be deployed in the public cloud by 2021.[1] Cloud is one of the fastest growing deployment environments for Cloudera customers.
Cloudera developed Altus after recognizing the challenges that its customers were facing with big data in the cloud: rising costs, too few enterprise tools, operational complexity, cloud vendor lock-in and siloed applications. By allowing enterprises to access cloud infrastructure alongside the same familiar large-scale data processing tools available, Cloudera Altus takes advantage of the cloud’s elasticity, low-cost storage and compute options. Altus makes it easier for customers to run large-scale transient and persistent data processing applications on the public cloud and helps data engineers and analysts use an on-demand infrastructure to reduce cloud costs and migration risk.
“Many organizations face challenges with cloud-based cluster management, data processing and migration, which is right where Cloudera Altus comes into play,” said Vikram Makhija, general manager of Cloud at Cloudera. ”Altus transforms the way data engineers run workloads, bringing an easy-to-use, end-user focused, managed service that offers a competitive advantage over other cloud data platforms. With Altus’ unified platform, open architecture, and simplification, we’re helping our customers modernize their existing analytic environments and bring the data warehouse to the data.”
The initial rollout of Cloudera Altus Data Engineering in May 2017 included support for Apache Spark, Apache Hive on MapReduce2, and Hive on Spark and availability for most AWS regions. In September 2017, Cloudera expanded Altus Data Engineering to support Microsoft Azure with an October 2017 beta release. In December 2017, Cloudera announced the beta of Altus Analytic DB on AWS, too.
