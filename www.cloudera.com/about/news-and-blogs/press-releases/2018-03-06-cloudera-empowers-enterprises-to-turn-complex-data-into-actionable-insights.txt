Press Release
Cloudera Empowers Enterprises to Turn Complex Data into Actionable Insights









STRATA DATA SAN JOSE, Calif., – March 6, 2018— Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR),  the modern platform for machine learning and analytics optimized for the cloud, announced that Cloudera Enterprise powered by SDX is helping customers fundamentally transform their business with data by uniquely combining a variety of data analysis capabilities with a ‘shared data experience’.

Navistar helps fleet and vehicle owners reduce maintenance costs by more than 30 percent using machine learning and analytics to proactively detect operating problems and predict maintenance requirements.
The New York Stock Exchange gains real-time insights across more than 20 petabytes of data to improve market surveillance and confirm member compliance.
Octo Telematics doubled its business volume and is transforming the auto insurance industry by modeling and understanding driver behavior to improve crash response, evaluate crash dynamics, and detect fraud.

These transformative use cases require a variety of processing and analytic capabilities - ETL, streaming analytics, SQL, machine learning, AI - working together to derive unique insights and create compelling data products. Typical approaches to support these types of use cases require integration of multiple single-function data analytics applications. However these applications have very little in common - no common way of cataloging data to provide business context; nor shared security, governance, or management policies. The resulting integration efforts usually deliver complex to manage and hard-to-use analytic silos that impede data exploration, lead to data security and governance headaches, and fall short of business expectations.

Cloudera Enterprise is a modern approach to solving enterprise data challenges, combining machine learning and analytics functions into a single scalable platform that can be deployed anywhere - public cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment.  Cloudera SDX unifies the most common analytic workloads to deliver a ‘shared data experience’ that allows companies to more quickly, easily, and securely deliver high-value use cases.
“Our customers are using Cloudera’s machine learning and analytics platform to fundamentally change the way they attract and retain customers, connect products and services, and protect their business from cybercrime and fraud,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. “We’re in a unique position to make this possible because our software applies a centralized, consistent framework for catalog, security, governance, data lifecycle, and more. This means customers can run dozens of different analytic applications against shared data, providing unprecedented business insights.”
“With Cloudera, we can analyze data in ways and speeds that were not previously possible,” said Terry Kline, chief information officer, Navistar. “We can evaluate billions of rows of data from connected vehicles in hours, not weeks, to enable predictive maintenance. And we expect to connect several hundred thousand more vehicles to the platform this year and don’t have to worry about scaling.”
“The results are overwhelmingly positive,” said Troy Clarke, chief executive officer, Navistar. “Using real-time big data to frame business decisions and deploy proactive maintenance has opened new revenue streams and delivered additional customer value.”
Cloudera Enterprise also makes it possible for companies to analyze billions of data points from millions of different connected devices to make more accurate predictions and reduce risk.
“For example, in the case of an accident, because the technology understands the type and severity of the impact, if the policyholder can’t pick up the phone, the insurer can contact authorities to get help,” said Gianfranco Giannella, chief operating officer, Octo Telematics. “Additionally, the technology can help reduce the time to manage the entire claim process from weeks to one hour. This includes analyzing liability, assessing damages, and steering the car to a repair shop.”
According to IDC MarketScape, Asia/Pacific Big Data and Analytics Platform 2017 Vendor Analysis, “Cloudera has a clear strength in structuring its big data products for ML and analytics according to the diversified needs of enterprise users across LOBs and standard use cases, covering network anomaly detection, fraud detection, recommendation systems, 360-degree customer profiling, supply chain and asset management analytics, service operation analytics, compliance analytics, workforce analytics, and more. This is further strengthened by its partner development of industry-specific solutions and Cloudera's hybrid cloud and on-premise offerings.”
