Press Release
Cloudera Expands Budapest Headquarters









BUDAPEST, Hungary, 27th March 2018 - Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics optimized for the cloud, announced that it is planning to expand its Hungarian R&D team with an additional 33 employees. The company, headquartered in Palo Alto, California, plans to increase its current Hungarian employee base by 160% by the end of 2019. The expansion has been supported by the active participation of the Hungarian Investment Promotion Agency (HIPA). Cloudera’s CEO, Tom Reilly and Péter Szijjártó, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both attended a press conference where the expansion was announced.  
Cloudera opened its new office in Budapest in 2015. The United States-based company has since built a Central European R&D base, talent recruitment center and a technological hub enjoying excellent relations with Hungarian universities and businesses in the Hungarian capital. Since Cloudera entered the market, it has increased its workforce to more than 150 employees. The addition of 33 employees is a step towards the company’s goal of increasing its current Hungarian employee base by 160% by the end of 2019. The R&D expansion has been supported by the active participation of HIPA. Cloudera also plans to expand it’s office space at Széchenyi Square in the near future, by adding 12,000 square feet of new workstations and meeting rooms.
“We are helping to make what is impossible today, possible tomorrow through our machine learning and analytics platform optimized for the cloud. Therefore, we urge companies to boldly use their complex data,” stated Tom Reilly, chief, executive officer, Cloudera, following the announcement of the office expansion. He added, “We can provide the latest machine learning and analytics methods for this. Hungary provides outstanding investment opportunities in the CEE region. To realize our plans, we develop university relations, offer unique training solutions to provide proper professional labor supply and continuously monitor cooperation possibilities to build and operate the R&D center.”
“Technological changes take place at unprecedented speed, allowing the Hungarian economy to enter a new dimension, where primarily not the number of created jobs matter but technological values created by employees," stated the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Péter Szijjártó, during the press conference. He added, "It is our task to convince companies in this new economic era that it is worth investing in Hungary. For this reason, it is a great honor for us that Cloudera mainly relies on Hungarian software engineers to establish its latest Digital developments."
Cloudera’s subsidiary in Hungary primarily employs software developers and professionals in charge of system-installation support. Newly hired employees spend a month at the Palo Alto headquarters of Cloudera, where they return once or twice each year for additional training. Cloudera’s employees in Hungary enjoy many of the benefits of working for a company based in the United States, such as competitive wages, equity, and benefits packages.
Cloudera participates in a number of programs related to recruiting and developing talent.  For instance, Cloudera is a part of the PARIPA program of Budapest Technical University, which allows the most talented engineering students to work as interns at Cloudera, observing company operations and, with the help of Cloudera mentors, gathering valuable and marketable work experience. In addition, the company has an active  guest lecturer program, which introduces its employees to experts in the field of big data and analytics.
About Cloudera 
At Cloudera, we believe that data can make what is impossible today, possible tomorrow. We empower people to transform complex data into clear and actionable insights. We are the modern platform for machine learning and analytics optimized for the cloud. The world's largest enterprises trust Cloudera to help solve their most challenging business problems.
