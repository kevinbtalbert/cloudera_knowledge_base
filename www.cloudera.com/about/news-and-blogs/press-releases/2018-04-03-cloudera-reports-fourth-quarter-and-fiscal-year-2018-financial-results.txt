Press Release
Cloudera Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results










Q4 revenue up 42% year-over-year
Q4 subscription revenue up 50% year-over-year
Net expansion rate of 136%

PALO ALTO, Calif., April 3, 2018 -- Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics optimized for the cloud, reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018, ended January 31, 2018. Total revenue was $103.5 million, an increase of 42% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Subscription revenue was $84.3 million, an increase of 50% from the year-ago period.
"It was a year of considerable accomplishment for Cloudera and our team. In our first few quarters as a public company, we introduced six major product offerings, completed a strategic acquisition, and delivered significant technological innovations -- with the open source community and also proprietary to our products," said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. "Most enterprises are just embarking on their digital transformation journeys. In a rapidly evolving and disruptive market, we believe the investments we've made have us well-positioned to lead them on that journey."
GAAP loss from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $45.7 million, compared to a GAAP loss from operations of $61.0 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP loss from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $16.6 million, compared to a non-GAAP loss from operations of $33.4 million in the year-ago period.
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was negative $22.0 million compared to operating cash flow of negative $31.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
GAAP net loss per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $0.31 per share, based on weighted-average shares outstanding of 142.9 million shares, compared to a GAAP net loss per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 of $1.67 per share, based on weighted-average shares outstanding of 36.8 million shares. See financial statement tables below for additional information regarding historical and forward-looking stock-based compensation expenses and shares outstanding.
Non-GAAP net loss per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $0.10 per share, based on non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding of 142.9 million shares, compared to non-GAAP net loss per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 of $0.30 per share, based on non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding of 111.7 million shares.
For fiscal year 2018, total revenue was $367.4 million, an increase of 41% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $301.0 million, an increase of 50% year-over-year, and equaled 82% of total revenue, up from 77% for fiscal year 2017.
GAAP loss from operations for fiscal year 2018 was $390.3 million compared to GAAP loss from operations of $187.3 million in fiscal year 2017. Non-GAAP loss from operations for fiscal year 2018 was $96.6 million compared to non-GAAP loss from operations of $140.3 million in fiscal year 2017.
Operating cash flow for fiscal year 2018 was negative $42.3 million compared to operating cash flow of negative $116.6 million in fiscal year 2017.
GAAP net loss per share for fiscal year 2018 was $3.38 per share, based on weighted-average shares outstanding of 114.1 million shares, compared to a GAAP net loss per share in fiscal year 2017 of $5.15 per share, based on weighted-average shares outstanding of 36.4 million shares.
Non-GAAP net loss per share for fiscal year 2018 was $0.69 per share, based on non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding of 133.1 million shares, compared to non-GAAP net loss per share for fiscal year 2017 of $1.26 per share, based on non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding of 111.3 million shares.
A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading Non‑GAAP Financial Measures.
As of January 31, 2018, the company had total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash of $460.7 million.

Global 8000 Customer List
We periodically update the Global 8000 list based on the FORBES Global 2000 list and information from Data.com, using the most recently published FORBES Global 2000 list (which is updated by Forbes annually) and the most recent Data.com information (which is continuously updated by Data.com).  Our customer count is subject to ongoing adjustment and, when adjustments occur, previously disclosed numbers of customers are updated to allow for comparability.
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this press release that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements that, within the meaning of the federal securities laws including the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Words such as "may", "will", "expect", "intend", "plan", "believe", "seek", "could", "estimate", "judgment", "targeting", "should", "anticipate", "goal" and variations of these words and similar expressions, are also intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release address a variety of subjects, including our belief that the enterprise machine learning and analytics market will quickly emerge and that we will continue to lead its direction through technology and product innovation, our expectation that we will continue our momentum in machine learning, analytics and the cloud, and our "Business Outlook" for our first quarter of fiscal 2019 and full year fiscal 2019 operating results. Readers are cautioned that actual results could differ materially from those implied by such forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including global economic conditions, competitive pressures and pricing declines, intellectual property infringement claims, and other risks or uncertainties that are described under the caption "Risk Factors" in our most recently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q filed with the SEC on December 8, 2017, and in our other SEC filings. Although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurances that our expectations will be attained. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report all financial information required in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the results of our operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by us include non-GAAP subscription gross margins, non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss, and historical and forward-looking non-GAAP net loss per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition- and disposition-related expenses (if any), amortization of acquired intangible assets, and donations of common stock made to the Cloudera Foundation from the Cloudera unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. In addition, we use non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding to calculate non-GAAP net loss per share.
For a description of these items, including the reasons why management adjusts for them, and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information" as well as the related tables that precede it. We may consider whether other significant non-recurring items that arise in the future should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures we use.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core business, operating results or future outlook. Management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We use these non‑GAAP financial measures in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods.
