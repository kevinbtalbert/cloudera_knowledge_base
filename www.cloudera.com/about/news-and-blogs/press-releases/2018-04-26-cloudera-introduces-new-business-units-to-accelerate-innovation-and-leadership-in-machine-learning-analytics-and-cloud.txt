Press Release
Cloudera Introduces New Business Units to Accelerate Innovation and Leadership in Machine Learning, Analytics, and Cloud









PALO ALTO, Calif.  April 26, 2018 – Cloudera, Inc., (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics, optimized for the cloud, announced the formation of three business units that will focus on the company’s core Machine Learning, Analytics, and Cloud initiatives. The additional organizational structure and resources will increase innovation and accelerate the company’s offerings, further empowering Cloudera’s customers to transform complex data into clear and actionable insights.
To lead the business units and accelerate growth, Cloudera named three general managers (GM), each focused on a very clear business objective. The GMs will report to Charles Zedlewski in his new role as senior vice president, High Growth Businesses. The newly appointed GMs and their respective objectives are as follows:

Lead machine learning in the enterprise - Hilary Mason, GM, Machine Learning
Disrupt the data warehouse market - Anupam Singh, GM, Analytics
Capitalize on cloud adoption - Vikram Makhija, GM, Cloud

“By creating these new business units, we will accelerate our momentum and extend our leadership in these areas while building on the incredible platform we’ve developed over many years. This focus bolsters our ability to deliver on our vision: helping customers grow, connect, and protect using machine learning, analytics, and cloud,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. “Hilary, Anupam, and Vikram were selected for these positions based on their backgrounds and track records. Their leadership is expected to drive business unit goals in furtherance of our overall corporate objectives.”
These new teams are positioned well to drive innovation, building on an unprecedented set of foundational technologies delivered by Cloudera over the past year:

Advancements in applied machine learning and artificial intelligence through the acquisition of Fast Forward Labs and the launch of Cloudera Data Science Workbench;
Availability of Cloudera Altus Analytic DB, the first data warehouse cloud service, that brings the warehouse to the data;
Breakthroughs simplifying cloud with Cloudera Altus, the first multi-function and multi-cloud machine learning and analytics Platform-as-a-Service; and
Cloudera Shared Data Experience (SDX), a powerful software framework that ties it all together, making multi-function data apps easier to develop, less expensive to deploy and more secure through centralized security, governance and metadata management spanning on-premises and cloud-based deployments.
