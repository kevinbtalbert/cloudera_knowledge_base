Press Release
Cloudera Recognized for World Class Customer Service and Support for Third Consecutive Year









Company successfully meets criteria for the prestigious Service Capability & Performance (SCP) Standards following yearly audit
Palo Alto, Calif., July 25, 2018 — Cloudera, Inc., (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics optimized for the cloud, announced that it received Service Capability & Performance (SCP) certification for the third consecutive year, underscoring the company’s commitment to providing exceptional service and support for customer success. The SCP Standards quantify the effectiveness of service and support operations based on a stringent set of over 100 major performance factors over a year-long period. The criteria represent the highest standards for best practices in the industry.

“The SCP Standards help guide Cloudera on our continued mission to provide the best mission-critical technical support for enterprise customers,” said Angus Klein, Vice President, Support at Cloudera. “Enterprise needs are constantly changing with the advancements in machine learning, analytics, and cloud. To receive the SCP certification three years in a row is an industry differentiator and demonstrates our tenacious commitment of using consistent best practices to deliver world-class support to our valued global customers.”
The SCP Standards serve as a benchmark of service excellence that help businesses ensure that the right organizational structures, tooling, and systems are in place to meet the evolving demands and business needs of customers.
“My colleague, Linden Hillenbrand, vice president, Customer Success, and I are both adamant about helping Cloudera to become even more customer-centric,” continued Klein. “We use several communication channels including Cloudera Engaged and our Voice of the Customer program where customers are invited to provide feedback on our products and services. We are religious about absorbing and acting on customers’ comments and SCP’s evaluation.”
Following the SCP Standards recertification audit, Cloudera has implemented several new customer service enhancements based on the findings from the annual certification process, including:

Launching Cloudera Support Hub (CSH), a custom-built case tracking system tuned for isolating customer issues faster and with higher accuracy
Reorganizing its Service Delivery Team into work groups aligned to customer use cases for improved collaboration and knowledge sharing resulting in a 20% reduction in time to resolution
Enhancing its Cloudera Support Learning Programs to support the education of 45 global support leaders and elevate the customer experience

“For the past three years, Cloudera has consistently demonstrated its commitment to the highest caliber of service excellence by strategically implementing findings from our yearly audit,” said Greg Coleman, Vice President of Strategic Programs at Service Strategies. “We look forward to continuing working with Cloudera to further uplevel their world-class service and support that helps their customers achieve long-term success.”
