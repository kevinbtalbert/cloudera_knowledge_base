Press Release
Cloudera and Hortonworks Announce Termination of Hart-Scott-Rodino Waiting Period for Proposed Merger



 









PALO ALTO, Calif., and SANTA CLARA, Calif., November 19, 2018 — Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR) and Hortonworks, Inc. (NASDAQ: HDP) jointly announced today that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), in connection with their previously announced merger.
