Press Release
Cloudera and Hortonworks Named Among Leaders in Cloud Hadoop/Spark Platforms Report by Independent Research Firm









Palo Alto, Calif., February 13, 2019 — Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the enterprise data cloud company, today announced that it was named a Leader by Forrester Research, Inc. in its report titled The Forrester Wave™: Cloud Hadoop and Spark (HARK) Platforms, Q1 2019. These platforms are defined by Forrester as distributed computing software and services that are rooted in open source Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark to ingest, store, process, manage and analyze data to generate insights that drive business outcomes.
According to Forrester, the Leaders identified in the report “support a broader set of use cases, enhanced automation and good scalability and performance.” Both Cloudera’s platform and Hortonworks’ platform were named among the Leaders in the report. Cloudera believes the positive recognition from Forrester, an independent third party, reinforces the rationale for the merger between Cloudera and Hortonworks, which combined has greater scale and resources to extend its market leadership and accelerate innovation for customers.
The full report can be downloaded on the Cloudera website here.
Cloudera is combining the best technology and product features from both companies and will produce the industry’s first enterprise data cloud for customers. Cloudera’s enterprise data cloud will uniquely support hybrid and multi-cloud deployments, providing enterprises the flexibility to run the most demanding workloads from the Edge to AI, with common security, governance and metadata powered by its unique SDX technology. Cloud-native and built for all major public cloud infrastructure – AWS, Azure, Google, IBM and Oracle – the unified platform embodies Cloudera’s “cloud everywhere” vision with a public cloud-like experience at the Edge, in private cloud, public cloud, multi-cloud and on-premises.
 










Sushant Rao, Cloudera’s director of product marketing for cloud, shares how Cloudera’s data analytics and Spark platform empowers teams to develop and deploy data warehouse and machine learning in the cloud.
According to Forrester, “Cloudera's approach to innovation has been core to meeting customer demands and differentiating its solution...Enterprises have successfully deployed a wide range of use cases with Cloudera, including fraud detection, real-time analytics, IoT analytics, and customer 360. Customers like Cloudera’s HARK platform performance, technical support, road map, continuous innovation, and partner ecosystem.”
With respect to the Hortonworks offering, Forrester noted, “Today, organizations are supporting new and emerging business use cases with Hortonworks, such as the IoT, customer 360, advanced analytics, and real-time insights. The vendor provides a cost-effective, nimble, and scalable architecture to implement HARK, whether on-premises, multi-cloud, or hybrid cloud. Customers like its flexible open source platform, multi-cloud support, data ingestion capabilities, performance and scale, and broad ecosystem of partners and tooling.”
Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub, Cloudera Altus and Cloudera Data Science Workbench were evaluated for the report and received scores of five out of five in the Performance, Management, Security and Data Governance criteria.
Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) and Hortonworks DataPlane were also evaluated and received scores of five out of five in the Scalability, Performance, Data Management, Security, Market Awareness and Packaging criteria (including Configuration Options and Cloud Deployment Options).
Together, having completed a corporate merger in January 2019, Cloudera is in an even stronger position to lead the enterprise data cloud market when it combines the best of both of its current platforms into its next-generation cloud data platform, called the Cloudera Data Platform.
“Customers require an open source data platform running in any cloud from the Edge to AI to truly unlock the power of any and all data,” said Arun C. Murthy, chief product officer of Cloudera. “This is exactly what we are delivering with the industry’s first enterprise data cloud, which, in our opinion, also aligns with Forrester’s Cloud Data Analytics and Spark Wave evaluation. We are thrilled to be named a Leader in this Forrester Wave.”
"Analytical insights are the key for us to be able to differentiate ourselves and create more value for our customers," said Sven Löffler, business development executive at Deutsche Telekom. "With Cloudera's solutions in the cloud, we were able to establish our Telekom Data Intelligence Hub which is a trusted, fully governed platform and ecosystem where our users are empowered to exchange and analyze data and develop multi-function, data-driven applications easier and more securely."
