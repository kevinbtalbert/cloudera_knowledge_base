Press Release
Cloudera Reports Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Financial Results



 









PALO ALTO, Calif., Sept. 4, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the enterprise data cloud company, reported results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2020, ended July 31, 2019. Total revenue for the second quarter was $196.7 million, and subscription revenue was $164.1 million. Annualized Recurring Revenue grew 16% year-over-year.
"We executed better in Q2, exceeding expectations on all our financial measures. Most importantly, we delivered an initial release of our cloud-native data management and analytics offering, Cloudera Data Platform. We already have a select group of customers evaluating this rich set of public cloud services, CDP Data Hub, Data Warehouse, and Machine Learning," said Marty Cole, chairman of the board and interim chief executive officer, Cloudera. "We are focused on meeting our customers' demands for hybrid and multi-cloud solutions that support use cases from the Edge to AI. That is the promise of CDP and the enterprise data cloud. Also, our internal metrics and pipeline generation have materially improved from Q1 levels. Together with solid execution in our second quarter, we are 'on plan' for achieving our objectives for this fiscal year."
All numbers reported for prior periods are presented for Cloudera on a standalone basis since the merger with Hortonworks, Inc. closed on January 3, 2019, and, as such, there is no comparative year-over-year financial information for the combined company.
GAAP loss from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was $89.1 million, compared to a GAAP loss from operations of $29.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Non-GAAP loss from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was $7.4 million, compared to a non-GAAP loss from operations of $8.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, which includes $13.3 million of merger-related payments, was negative $33.0 million, compared to operating cash flow of negative $23.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
GAAP net loss per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was $0.31 per share, based on weighted-average shares outstanding of 276.8 million shares, compared to a GAAP net loss per share of $0.19 per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, based on weighted-average shares outstanding of 149.5 million shares. See financial statement tables below for additional information regarding historical and forward-looking stock-based compensation expenses and shares outstanding.
Non-GAAP net loss per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was $0.02 per share, based on weighted-average shares outstanding of 276.8 million shares, compared to a non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.05 per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, based on weighted-average shares outstanding of 149.5 million shares.
A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
As of July 31, 2019, the company had total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash of $508.6 million.

Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this press release that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements that, within the meaning of the federal securities laws including the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Words such as "may", "will", "expect", "intend", "plan", "believe", "seek", "could", "estimate", "judgment", "targeting", "should", "anticipate", "goal" and variations of these words and similar expressions, are also intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release address a variety of subjects, including statements about our short-term and long-term goals and targets, including expectations regarding the acceptance by our enterprise customers of enterprise data cloud and the Cloudera Data Platform, and our "Business Outlook" for our third quarter of fiscal 2020 and our full year fiscal 2020 operating results. Readers are cautioned that actual results could differ materially from those implied by such forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including global economic conditions, competitive pressures and pricing declines, intellectual property infringement claims, and other risks or uncertainties that are described under the caption "Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in our other SEC filings. You can obtain copies of the company's SEC filings on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurances that our expectations will be attained. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report all financial information required in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). To supplement our unaudited and audited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the results of our operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by us include non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP subscription gross margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net loss, and historical and forward-looking non-GAAP net loss per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition- and disposition-related expenses (if any), and amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Cloudera unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. In addition, we use non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding to calculate non-GAAP net loss per share. This non-GAAP measure includes the impact of anti-dilutive restricted stock units and stock options outstanding, on a weighted basis.
For a description of these items, including the reasons why management adjusts for them, and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information" as well as the related tables that precede it. We may consider whether other significant non-recurring items that arise in the future should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures we use.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core business, operating results or future outlook. Management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods.
Annualized Recurring Revenue
Annualized Recurring Revenue ("ARR") is a performance metric, which we use to assess the health and trajectory of our business. ARR equals the annualized value of all recurring subscription contracts with active entitlements as of the end of the period, including pre-merger Hortonworks contracts. ARR does not reflect non-recurring partner revenue, subscription revenue with certain related parties, custom engineering and premium add-on support.
