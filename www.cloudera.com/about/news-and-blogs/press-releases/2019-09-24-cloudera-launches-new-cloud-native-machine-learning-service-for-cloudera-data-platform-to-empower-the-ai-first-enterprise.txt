Cloudera Machine Learning Powers Collaborative Data Science at Scale with Secure, Self-Service Access to Governed Data Anywhere
PALO ALTO, Calif., September 24, 2019 – Cloudera (NYSE: CLDR), the enterprise data cloud company, today launched Cloudera Machine Learning, the enterprise machine learning service for the new Cloudera Data Platform. Cloudera Machine Learning makes it easy for IT to say yes to self-service data science for business at scale.

The new machine learning service on the Cloudera Data Platform provides data scientists, data engineers, and machine learning engineers with:

Instant workspaces - deploy new machine learning workspaces for teams in a few clicks, with access to the project environments and resources they need for end-to-end machine learning.


Rapid replication - provide democratized access to replicate data sets across hybrid and multi-cloud environments while maintaining enterprise data security and governance controls. 


Choose your own tools - provide data science teams’ with access to their favorite, open data science tools while preserving security and minimizing administrative overhead  


Elastic, auto-suspending resources - deliver the scale-out, heterogeneous computing resources data science teams need to get work done fast while maintaining adjustable guardrails that help IT easily manage and optimize infrastructure resources and costs.


Comprehensive, cohesive user experience - data engineering, model training, experiment tracking, and deploying and managing production models all in one seamless environment, without switching or stitching workflows together with multiple tools.


Portability and consistency - the liberty to move data and infrastructure anywhere without creating disconnected silos and without changing the consistent user-experience that data science teams rely on for building robust workflows and processes for end-to-end ML.

Cloudera Machine Learning is fully integrated with the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) including Cloudera Data Warehouse and Data Hub, allowing for the fast delivery of new multi-function analytics and machine learning in any cloud.
