Press Release
Bank Mandiri Collaborates with Cloudera to Strengthen Resiliency and Agility in Addressing the Impact of COVID-19









The Indonesian bank is using data-driven insights to help customers, employees, and stakeholders adapt to the changes resulting from the pandemic.
JAKARTA, Indonesia, September 1, 2020 — Cloudera, Inc., (NYSE: CLDR), the enterprise data cloud  company, today announced that Bank Mandiri has expanded its use of Cloudera’s data platform to strengthen its resiliency and agility in dealing with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. By using Cloudera’s data platform, the Indonesian bank can manage more than 100 million data records on a daily basis and make use of data-driven insights to adapt to the changing situation more quickly while monitoring the health of its customers and employees, and maintaining compliance with prevailing regulations.
Bank Mandiri is the largest financial institution in Indonesia that has contributed to the local banking industry and economy for 20 years. To achieve its goal of becoming the country’s leading wholesale bank and digital retail bank, it is committed to providing financial services that integrate into its customers’ daily lives through simple, fast, and trusted digital banking solutions.
According to Billie Setiawan, Head of Enterprise Data Management at Bank Mandiri, Cloudera’s data platform has strengthened the bank’s resiliency and agility to maintain its business development and handle the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  “Cloudera’s data platform supports Bank Mandiri’s digital transformation. The platform allows us to gain data-driven insights to adapt to changing situations quickly. At the same time, we can look after our customers and our tens of thousands of employees in terms of COVID-19 exposure. This pandemic has created such significant pressure to the economy and the banking business. Yet, it has also brought about the new normal, which includes changing customer behaviors,” he said.
In response to such changes, Bank Mandiri and Cloudera jointly built a big data platform known as Enterprise Information & Decision Platform, which serves three main purposes.
Firstly, the platform monitors the liquidity and daily transactions of its 2,556 branch offices and 2,236 micro networks in real time. With the ability to collect important data--such as footfall, volume, value, and frequency of transactions-- the bank can make more effective decisions, empowering it to continuously deliver excellent customer service and maintain well-organized transactions. The big data platform also provides COVID-19 exposure zone mapping. As such, the bank can decide which branch should remain operational, as well as swiftly deliver that information to customers and stakeholders such as the Financial Services Authority (OJK).
Secondly, the Enterprise Information & Decision Platform keeps track of the health status of Bank Mandiri’s 76,477 employees working in 12 regional offices, 90 area offices, and 2,556 branch offices every day. In a matter of hours, the platform can determine if any employee is potentially exposed to COVID-19, by recording and analyzing their work location (i.e. in the office or at home), the type of transportation use, and their movement patterns on a daily basis. Such insights enable the bank to decide how to best arrange its teams and minimize the risk of COVID-19 exposure to its employees.
Finally, Bank Mandiri is also using the Cloudera-powered big data platform to accelerate the debt restructuring process.  This allows the bank to maintain its service level agreement with customers as the platform helps analyze factors that can speed up the debt restructuring process.
“Agility defines the ability of an organization to respond effectively to COVID-19 so that it becomes a more robust company in the future. And the insights derived from the data is the main driver of agility.” said Remus Lim, Managing Director of ASEAN and India, Cloudera. “Bank Mandiri has proven that taking a data-driven approach is crucial in addressing the impact of COVID-19 on the banking business and customers. Cloudera’s data platform has assisted Bank Mandiri in handling the complexities of data management and supporting multi-function analytics amidst changing situations, without compromising on security, governance, and compliance with the prevailing regulations."
