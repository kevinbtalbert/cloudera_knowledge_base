Press Release
Cloudera Agrees to Acquire SaaS Companies Datacoral and Cazena









Two strategic acquisitions to accelerate Cloudera’s launch of the self-service era for data and analytics in the public cloud
SANTA CLARA, CA, June 1, 2021 — Cloudera, (NYSE: CLDR), the enterprise data cloud company, today announced that it has agreed to acquire Datacoral and Cazena in two separate transactions. The additions of Datacoral and Cazena will support the evolution of Cloudera’s public cloud offering and expand Cloudera’s market opportunity as the company moves beyond big data to self-service. The two acquisitions mark an important milestone as Cloudera continues to execute its strategic plan to build a leader in the hybrid cloud space.
Rob Bearden, Chief Executive Officer of Cloudera, said: “The acquisitions will enable Cloudera to usher in a new era of low-code, no-code self-service by automating complex operations – enabling our customers to focus on getting value from their data rather than configuring, operating and managing the underlying infrastructure. Both businesses will enable our combined customers to enjoy a reduction in complexity and faster time to value for their data initiatives, leading to improved insights, faster innovation, and stronger engagements with their customers and partners.”
Datacoral’s fully managed service powers fast and easy data transformations and integrations for any type of data via a robust multi-tenant SaaS architecture that . Datacoral is flexible, easy-to-use, and secure, and its future-proof no-code connectors enable customers to extract data from a wide range of popular data sources. Multi-level transformations are automatically orchestrated using just SQL, and only a few clicks are required to set up end-to-end data pipelines that go from ingestion to transformation to publishing. Datacoral adds an easy-to-use SaaS platform to the Cloudera CDP portfolio that provides simple, reliable access to more than 80 common data sources. Since no engineering is needed, customers can spend more time focused on analyzing and improving their businesses.
“The combination of Cloudera’s robust platform with a cloud-native, ETL solution like Datacoral, offers a powerful solution to today’s self-service analytics challenge,” said Datacoral Founder and CEO Raghotham Murthy, who built out Facebook’s data infrastructure during its explosive growth years of 2008-2013. “I’m very excited to be joining the Cloudera team to help the no-code, low-code era become a reality.”
Cazena powers instant cloud data lakes, making it possible to accelerate time to analytics and AI/ML from months to minutes. Cazena’s SaaS platform includes end-to-end infrastructure and orchestration, so customers get a fully-managed, continuous operations model that delivers guaranteed security and performance 24x7. Cazena was founded by the visionary team behind the Netezza data warehouse appliance and represents a critical evolution from reporting-oriented data warehouses to innovation-focused data lakes. Purpose-built and optimized for the cloud, Cazena’s SaaS offerings enable Cloudera customers to easily and cost-effectively migrate to CDP for Public Cloud.
“Extending the Cloudera platform to a SaaS delivery model fulfills Cazena’s vision of enabling businesses to easily speed up their time to insight by focusing on their data rather than operating the infrastructure necessary to manage it – we make CDP easier to operate and consume for all enterprises,” said Cazena Founder and CEO Prat Moghe. “I look forward to working with the Cloudera team to offer a simplified experience that helps customers use all their data faster and more effectively.”
The acquisitions are expected to close in Cloudera’s current fiscal 2022 second quarter, ending July 31, 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.
