Press Release
Cloudera and Alibaba Cloud Join Forces to Help Businesses in China Accelerate their Data-Driven Journeys









The two parties have signed a definitive agreement to make the Cloudera Data Platform available on Alibaba Cloud and help organizations accelerate their cloud journey to become agile and data-driven
SINGAPORE, July 21, 2021 — Cloudera, (NYSE: CLDR), the enterprise data cloud company, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement with Alibaba Cloud, the digital technology and intelligence backbone of Alibaba Group, which is intended to enable the general availability of Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) on Alibaba Cloud in the Greater China Region (GCR). The partnership aims to help more companies in the region effectively harness data as they move to the cloud to gain business agility.

Global pandemic lockdowns and staged reopening of economies have driven up demand for cloud-based customer and business services. IDCWorldwide Quarterly Cloud IT Infrastructure Tracker reported an increase in spending on cloud IT infrastructure across most regions globally in the third quarter of 2020, with China experiencing a 29.4% annual growth rate.

As the industry’s first enterprise data cloud, CDP is an integrated data platform that helps companies better manage and secure their data as they embrace cloud. CDP is intended to deliver powerful, self-service analytics with a consistent Alibaba Cloud experience and enterprise-grade performance across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, with the granular security and governance policies that IT and business leaders demand.

“Alibaba Cloud has extensive experience in helping companies embrace cloud technologies, making it ideal for CDP to be on Alibaba Cloud as the partnership enables those customers to reap the full benefits of the cloud and meet business needs,” said Mark Micallef, Vice President of Asia Pacific and Japan, Cloudera. “Cloud adoption can lead to data management challenges as data could be kept in silos, making it difficult for data to be discoverable, available, trusted and compliant across all IT environments. We’re excited to offer CDP on Alibaba Cloud to help more customers – such as financial services, manufacturing, and internet companies in the GCR -- speed up time to insights while having better control of their data to reduce risks as they move to the cloud.”   

“Committed to the success of our customers, our partnership with Cloudera aims to empower companies to better compete on data as they try to outmaneuver the uncertainties in the business environment,” said Jia Yangqing, vice president of Alibaba Group and Senior Fellow of Business Unit, Alibaba Cloud Intelligence. “CDP on Alibaba Cloud will help organizations accelerate their cloud journey to become data-driven and more agile. The solution will enable data to be democratized across the business so that the organization can be more responsive to customers and market opportunities in a timely manner.”
