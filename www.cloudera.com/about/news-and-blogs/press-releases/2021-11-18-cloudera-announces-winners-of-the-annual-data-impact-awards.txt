Press Release
Cloudera Announces Winners of the Annual Data Impact Awards









Winners exemplify innovation with outstanding data projects that deliver a substantial impact to their business and broader community
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 17, 2021 - Cloudera, the enterprise data cloud company, today announced the winners of its annual Data Impact awards. Since 2013, the Data Impact Awards have recognized  organizations whose data projects deliver substantial benefits to technology, science, health, lifestyle, and the community, across a wide variety of industries and geographies. Winners  have been selected across seven different categories, including a new award recognizing organizations at the forefront of pushing for diversity, equity and inclusion in and outside of the workplace.
After nearly two years of change and uncertainty, the stage has been set for profound transformation and enduring positive change. As organizations plan for the future, technologies like data science, AI and machine learning, and predictive analytics will continue to be at the forefront of these efforts. The Data Impact Award winners show what can be accomplished when data powers decision making to benefit everyday people that need it the most.
“It is an honor to recognize the winners of this year’s Data Impact Awards,” said Mick Hollison, President at Cloudera. Every single one of these organizations demonstrate how utilizing cloud technology and next generation data solutions can have a positive impact on a business’ bottom line - and on the world.”
Cloudera is proud to announce the 2021 Data Impact Awards winners:


Data Lifecycle Connection: Carrefour Spain - Enhancing customer experiences by connecting multiple parts of the data lifecycle to collect, enrich, report, serve, and predict.

Data is the DNA of today's organizations and decision making processes, as well as the fuel guiding forward-thinking enterprises to new innovation and revenue streams.”
