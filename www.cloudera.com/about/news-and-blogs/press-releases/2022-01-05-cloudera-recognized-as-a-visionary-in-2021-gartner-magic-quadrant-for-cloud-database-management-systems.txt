Press Release
Cloudera Recognized as a Visionary in 2021 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud Database Management Systems









SANTA CLARA, Calif., January 5, 2022 — Cloudera, the enterprise data cloud company, today announced it has been positioned by Gartner as a Visionary in the Magic Quadrant for Cloud Database Management Systems (DBMS) 2021.1
According to Gartner, “Database management systems continue their move to the cloud – a move that is producing an increasingly complex landscape of vendors and offerings.”

The analyst firm also predicts, “by 2025, cloud preference for data management will substantially reduce the vendor landscape while the growth in multicloud will increase the complexity for data governance and integration.”



“Our vision is to dramatically simplify the approach Fortune 5000 companies can take to data management and analytics in the cloud by providing a single comprehensive solution for easily managing all their hybrid data at scale,” said Sudhir Menon, Chief Product Officer at Cloudera. “In the new hybrid data reality, enterprises need to manage, access and utilize all their data, on-prem and in multiple clouds, from the edge to AI. Instead of niche cloud-only point solutions that don't support unified analytics and operational workloads, Cloudera is the only vendor delivering a comprehensive, hybrid data-enabled solution for all data everywhere – all divisions, all geographies, all datasets across all use cases.”
The Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) establishes a governed architecture specifically designed for today’s real-world hybrid deployments. This provides customers with a fully supported path for moving to the cloud, while keeping portions of their infrastructure on-premises – even permanently – to precisely balance performance, security and cost.
The complete report, including the quadrant graphic, is available on the Cloudera website here.
