Press Release
Leading Australian University Collaborates with Cloudera to Advance Learning Outcomes









Deakin University has entered a strategic relationship with hybrid cloud company to deliver deeper data insights into 8.8 million data events, levelling up on teaching and learning outcomes for its 60,000 students
Melbourne, Australia, December 7, 2022 — Cloudera, the hybrid data company, today announced its collaboration with leading Australian higher education provider Deakin University. The university has selected Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) to achieve the next phase of its digital transformation journey. Through this strategic data investment, Deakin University will become more data-driven, improving the teaching and learning experience for its 60,000 students.
Remaining future-proof in Australia’s highly competitive higher education market is mission critical for Deakin University. Modernizing its data architecture not only strengthens its personalized learning pathways but heightens operational efficiencies. Using CDP, Deakin’s IT teams can now ingest and process more than 8.8 million data events per day from disparate systems, including learning management, registrar, administration, and occupancy analytics.
The university also upgraded its learning management system with analytics that provide crucial insights into student learning patterns, providing real-time understanding of how to improve teaching and student learning outcomes. Teaching staff are also able to access various data sources via Deakin’s CDP learning analytics dashboard to provide more personalized and targeted support to students. 
Faster access to usable data insights enables Deakin University to develop comprehensive profiles of student campus experiences and the many ways students interact with academic staff and learning materials. Armed with this knowledge of student learning patterns, university leadership, faculty, and staff are now empowered to deliver more engaging lessons aligned to learning preferences and future workplace needs. 
Deakin University’s Chief Digital Officer, Craig Warren said that CDP is giving the University crucial insights to improve its data collection and analysis strategy. “Deakin University partnered with Cloudera to capture and better understand key student data to realize the next phase of our digital transformation. Providing improved and enhanced teaching and learning experiences is integral to our digital strategy and Cloudera Data Platform helps us deliver this. The collaboration has not only generated significant value for current students but supports the university’s future plans to deliver data analytics capabilities to more departments.”      
Keir Garrett, Vice President, Cloudera Australia and New Zealand comments, “Australia is one of the world’s most competitive higher education sectors. Investing in a modern data infrastructure ensures Deakin has the ‘data intelligence’ to really understand the needs of today’s students while also anticipating how this might change in the future. Our team at Cloudera is delighted to be supporting Deakin on their data transformation journey as we are equally passionate about equipping students with the skills and knowledge they will need to thrive in the workplaces of tomorrow.”
