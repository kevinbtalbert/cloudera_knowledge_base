Press Release
Cloudera Recognized as a Leader in 2022 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud Database Management Systems 









SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 10, 2023 — Cloudera, the hybrid data company, today announced it has been positioned by Gartner in the Leaders Quadrant in the 2022 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Database Management Systems (DBMS)1 based on Cloudera’s flagship offering Cloudera Data Platform (CDP). The evaluation was based on specific criteria that analyzed the company’s overall completeness of vision and ability to execute.

According to Gartner, “organizations that adopt aggressive metadata analysis across their complete data management environment will decrease time to delivery of new data assets to users by as much as 70%.” The analyst firm also predicts, “by 2025, 90% of new data and analytics deployments will be through an established data ecosystem, causing consolidation across the data and analytics market.”
“We’ve heard loud and clear from our customers and the industry that data management tools and platforms that fail to support hybrid and multi-cloud capabilities will be set for decommissioning,” said Sudhir Menon, chief product officer at Cloudera. “We believe our placement in the Leaders Quadrant of this year’s Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud DBMS demonstrates that Cloudera’s hybrid and multi-cloud strategy is the right one. With our open data lakehouse and unified data fabric, Cloudera is still the only hybrid and multi-cloud enabled data platform for all data everywhere – all divisions, all geographies, all datasets. Cloudera also includes the security and tools that geographically distributed enterprises need to confidently move their businesses forward.”
Magic Quadrant reports are a culmination of rigorous, fact-based research in specific markets, providing a wide-angle view of the relative positions of the providers in markets where growth is high and provider differentiation is distinct. Providers are positioned into four quadrants: Leaders, Challengers, Visionaries and Niche Players. The research enables you to get the most from market analysis in alignment with your unique business and technology needs.
The complete report, including the quadrant graphic, is available on the Cloudera website here.
