SANTA CLARA, Calif., May  12, 2023 - Cloudera, the hybrid data company, has recognized seven key partners at their annual Partner Kickoff - Impact24, on April 18 and 20. The 2023 Cloudera Global Partner Awards recognize Cloudera partners dedicated to transforming the future of data and enabling customers to do more with their data by leveraging the power of a hybrid cloud platform. 
This year's global award winners are:


IBM - Global Partner of the Year 

AWS - Cloud Partner of the Year



Talend - Emerging Partner of the Year

Carahsoft - Public Sector Partner of the Year 


This year’s regional award winners are:


Accenture - EMEA Partner of the Year



Nuvento - APAC Partner of the Year



Martinexsa - Americas Partner of the Year


“We strongly believe that collaboration is key to driving customer value and achieving long-term success,” said Andy Moller, Cloudera’s SVP of Global Alliances and Ecosystem. "We are proud to recognize the exceptional contributions of our partners.”

Winners were determined based on several factors, including, but not limited to, revenue, their year-over-year growth trajectory, technology alignment, development commitment, and joint wins.

The Annual Partner Kickoff and Awards Program is an important part of the Cloudera Partner Network (CPN). The CPN, launched in November 2022, is designed to strengthen collaboration and solution building with partners, and to help them guide their customers to adopt modern data strategies based on the Cloudera hybrid data platform. The CPN includes a competency-based, points-driven approach to leverage expanded program opportunities, comprehensive tools and support, and industry-leading incentives and promotions. In 2022,  nearly 400 partners joined the Cloudera Partner Network.
