Press Release
BCA Delivers Data-Driven Banking Innovations with Cloudera









Cloudera enables one of Indonesia’s largest banks to improve operational efficiency, deepen customer engagement, support new business models and future proof its journey to the cloud
JAKARTA, Indonesia, July 9, 2020— Cloudera, Inc., (NYSE: CLDR), the enterprise data cloud company, today announced that Bank Central Asia (BCA) is using Cloudera’s data platform to support its customer-centric culture. By enhancing its customer data analytics capability with Cloudera, the Indonesian bank can continuously innovate to enrich the customer experience and enhance fraud detection. JAKARTA, Indonesia, July 9, 2020 
BCA has a core focus on transaction banking and provides loan facilities and solutions to the corporate, commercial, retail, and consumer segments. As one of the leading banks in Indonesia and the largest consumer banking provider in the region, BCA handles millions of transactions daily. It took days to analyze those transactions using the previous legacy data management system, making it challenging for the bank to gain an accurate and timely view of its customers.
With Cloudera as its foundation for big data and machine learning, BCA can quickly aggregate both structured and unstructured data from emails, social media, and call centers, and has significantly shortened the time taken for queries from days to hours or as little as minutes. As a result, the bank’s business units gained a holistic view of their customers and are able to use near real-time insights to provide personalized offerings based on customer profiles. Additionally, Cloudera’s data platform also enabled the bank to implement machine learning models for process automation.
To ease the growing concerns around data security from regulators and consumers, BCA leveraged Cloudera’s data platform to protect customer data from being accessed for fraudulent activities. By powering its fraud detection system with Cloudera, the bank is able to better identify data pattern anomalies and prevent fraudulent transactions.
“Putting customers at the heart of our business has always been in our DNA,” said Dirgo Vanto, Head of Data Management, PT. Bank Central Asia. “Cloudera has been part of our customer-led culture as it empowers us to harness data to deliver innovative banking products and services that keep pace with customers’ evolving needs while securing our business. These capabilities have led BCA to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty as well as international recognitions such as being named the Best Bank in Indonesia and Best Asian Bank for the past few years. With the shift towards digital and contactless services among Indonesian consumers fuelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, Cloudera’s hybrid and open source based data platform will bolster our journey to securely enable hybrid cloud where it’s needed.”
“As customer demands are constantly evolving, it is imperative for banks to undertake continuous product and service innovations to attract and retain customers,” said Remus Lim, Managing Director of ASEAN and India, Cloudera. “As exemplified by BCA, Cloudera’s data platform can help Indonesian banks achieve that by enabling them to use secure, governed, multi-function analytics and machine learning to transform complex data into clear and actionable insights. Those timely insights can then be used to improve operational efficiency, deepen customer engagement, and support new business models—ultimately enabling the bank to deliver exceptional customer experience and retain competitiveness.”
