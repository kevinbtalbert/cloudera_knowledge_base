Press Release
Cloudera Announces Winners of the Annual Data Impact Awards 









Winners exemplify innovation with outstanding data projects that deliver a substantial impact to their business and broader community
SANTA CLARA, Calif., November 18, 2020 — Cloudera, (NYSE: CLDR), the enterprise data cloud company, today announced the winners of its annual Data Impact awards. Since 2013, the Data Impact Awards have recognized organizations whose data projects deliver substantial benefits to technology, science, health, lifestyle, and the community, across a wide variety of industries and geographies. Winners have been selected across eight different categories, including a new award recognizing a customer that has consistently achieved transformation of their business.
As the landscape continues to change and technologies such as data science, machine learning, predictive analytics, and AI continue to evolve, the world is becoming increasingly data driven. This shift will disrupt every industry, but will open the door to innovation. Problems that were previously seen as impossible to solve are now becoming easier to tackle in real-time with limitless amounts of data and an increased ability to harness it. The Data Impact Award winners show what can be accomplished when data powers decision making, leading to better business outcomes.
“Each of the winners brings to life the development and investment that we put into our products to show the world what is possible when the power of data is unlocked,” said Anupam Singh, chief customer officer at Cloudera. “Congratulations to all of the Data Impact Award winners for showcasing data-driven innovation, problem-solving and proven real-world impact.”  
Cloudera is proud to announce the 2020 Data Impact Awards winners:

"It has been an absolute pleasure judging the Data Impact Awards this year. It is really reassuring to see across all of the nominees that companies are identifying clear paths to success, even in a difficult climate, when they are putting data at the heart of their transformation initiatives.” said Nick McQuire, Vice President, Enterprise Research, CCS Insight. “What stood out for me is the sheer level of transformation we are seeing across industries and across businesses - and at the heart of that is data. But the most important thing that stood out to me this year, was the level of business benefits we are now starting to see companies report with respect to their data projects."
Nominations are evaluated by a panel of independent thought-leaders and expert industry analysts, who then select the finalists and winners. The winners exemplify the most-cutting edge data projects and represent innovation and leadership in their respective industries
