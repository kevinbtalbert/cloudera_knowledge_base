      Our Mission In Action: Cloudera in the Community.
      























Cloudera’s mission is to make data and analytics easy and accessible for everyone: by improving access to skills, software and mentorship we are increasing diversity in the technology sector and driving global
economic sustainability. 











 








 










Fresh Squeeze on Data
In order to make complex STEM concepts less abstract and more relatable for 8- to 12-year-olds, we partnered with the education company ReadyAI, and created a downloadable children's book, A Fresh Squeeze on Data.
Since launch, A Fresh Squeeze on Data has been translated into 7 languages, downloaded over 3 million times and implemented in schools over 300,000 times using the complimentary lesson plan.

Boys & Girls Club
In partnership with Boys & Girls Clubs of Middle Tennessee and Boys & Girls Clubs of the Peninsula, Cloudera launched the Teen Accelerator program, with a vision to work with high school youth in underserved areas to provide them with skills utilized in the corporate workplace and provide them with resources that they may not otherwise have access to. This program consists of three phases, beginning with online learning, progressing to mentorship by Cloudera employees, and ending with a summer internship at Cloudera.

Democratizing access to the technology sector of the future
Cloudera’s mission is to make data and analytics easy and accessible, for everyone. We are making it real by improving access to digital skills, mentorship, and resources to help democratize access to the technology sector and drive sustainable career opportunities.
To achieve this, Cloudera partners with global organization, Generation, and regional organizations, Per Scholas and Blue Hope to provide no-cost skilling and mentorship to prepare, place, and support individuals into life-changing careers that would otherwise be inaccessible.
Cloudera also joined cross-sector coalitions - SkillUp Coalition and National Skills Coalition Business Leaders United - to conduct research, share best practices, and advance industry conversations around the Future of Work and diversity and Reboot Representation to collectively and intentionally invest in a more inclusive industry.

Hear What Clouderans Are Saying

I participated in last year's Global Days of Service and I’m so glad I did. It was great to learn about an organization's mission to help the community and to do my part to make a positive impact in someone's day. The process was easy, enjoyable and brought those of us volunteering closer together. I'm proud to work for a company that provides these opportunities.

-  Rory Ruedas, Talent Branding Specialist 








 












The [volunteering] experience truly changed my life as it gave me a different view of the world around me and taught me that there are things that I am privileged to that others are not

- Kylie Drake, Marketing Events Manager.
