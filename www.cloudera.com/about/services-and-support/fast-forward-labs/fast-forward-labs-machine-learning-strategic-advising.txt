Transform your capabilities
Despite the excitement around machine learning and its rapidly evolving technology, some organizations are struggling in their efforts to apply new algorithmic capabilities to real-world business problems. Technology alone is seemingly insufficient to unlock its potential.
Cloudera Fast Forward Labs Advisory Services can help you cut through the hype, understand the opportunities in context of your business, and innovate at scale.
We respect that you can’t outsource something as fundamental as understanding your own business, however. We work in tandem with your organization to define recommendations based on your vision, your data, your technology, and your use cases.
Fast Forward Labs advisors’ technical expertise is culled from real-world experience as practitioners. This informs their clear, practical guidance on where to focus valuable resources, how to implement effective practices, as well as how to expedite development and avoid technical dead ends. Their experience expedites the process, saves you time and money, and improves productivity.







 













It’s all about you
Collaboration is at the heart of our engagement. Together with your team, we develop a strategic plan tailored to your unique business opportunities as well as your technical capabilities.  












      
      
      The engagement
      







Pre-meeting conversations to align on goals and resources
