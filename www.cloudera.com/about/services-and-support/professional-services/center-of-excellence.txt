Big Data center of excellence







 










 







    
    
      Build solutions for your information-driven enterprise
      




The biggest challenge facing today’s enterprise is how to maximize the business benefit of data. Centralization and activation of all your data as part of an enterprise data hub is a first step towards relevant outcomes, and the right strategy, insights, and team can drive growth, operational efficiency, and innovation. But you may also need to build a center of excellence to steward and standardize big data projects as use cases proliferate throughout the organization.




















    
    
      Big data solutions as a service
      





 












Scale
Systematically learn, develop, deploy, operate, publish, and repeat







Security
Centrally manage access, authorization, audit, and governance










Speed
Drive adoption via a solutions engine, not autonomous projects







Savings
Exploit expertise and increase utilization via a multi-tenant data hub








 












    
    
      Manage disruption throughout the enterprise
      




A center of excellence ensures you can disrupt the industry without disrupting your business. It provides an environment for teams to learn crucial technical skills and apply information-driven practices to decision-making. As new projects are developed, your team will draw on best practices and milestones published from past pilots to improve operational efficiency and focus on achieving business outcomes.
A Center of Excellence engagement with Cloudera Professional Services will set your organization on the path to building a rapidly scalable solutions engine using Big Data and Hadoop. Available services include:

Use case discovery and planning
Deployment of Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub Edition
Staffing, skills, and organizational assessment and recommendations
Workshops on operational efficiency, programmatic best practices, and process change
