Hadoop Descriptive Analytics Pilot







 











    
    
      Build an analytics solution configured to all your data needs
      




Analysis on any platform begins with describing and summarizing historical data, and Hadoop is no different. However, prosecuting data sets at petabyte scale, particularly including multi-structured data, may require a custom configuration including real-time query and delivery. Cloudera will design and implement an analytics process targeting a single use case. This process will also serve as a reference architecture for future solutions.









 





































 







    
    
      A typical Hadoop Descriptive Analytics Pilot lasts two weeks and consists of the following activities:
      





Review use case requirements
Review existing hardware and recommend changes as necessary
Design and develop a process for loading data from up to two data sources
Design and implement a data storage, schema, and partitioning system
Design and prototype a data integration process
Design and implement specific data processing jobs
