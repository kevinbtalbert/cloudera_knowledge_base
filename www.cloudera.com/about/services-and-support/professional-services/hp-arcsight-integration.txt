HP ArcSight integration






 










 







    
    
      Complement your existing ArcSight implementation
      




Leverage Cloudera’s professional services to set up a data pipeline from ArcSight to your existing Cloudera cluster. Once the Arcsight data is in the cluster, this will allow for deeper ad-hoc analysis on your historic ArcSight security data for enhanced threat hunting—while allowing ArcSight to focus on real-time threat detection. Cloudera can customize the data ingestion pipeline in order to optimize the data for further analysis. 



























    
    
      Connecting to ArcSight typically includes:
      





Connect the Hadoop cluster to ArcSight for data ingestion
Identify how data needs to be formatted in order to connect to existing analytics applications

Review and test the integration customization
