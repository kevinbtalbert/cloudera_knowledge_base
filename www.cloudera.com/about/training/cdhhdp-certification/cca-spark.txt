CCA Spark and Hadoop Developer













CCA Spark and Hadoop Developer Exam (CCA175)

Number of Questions: 8–12 performance-based (hands-on) tasks on Cloudera Enterprise cluster. See below for full cluster configuration
Time Limit: 120 minutes
Passing Score: 70%
Language: English

 
Exam Question Format
Each CCA question requires you to solve a particular scenario. In some cases, a tool such as Impala or Hive may be used. In most cases, coding is required.
Evaluation, Score Reporting, and Certificate
Your exam is graded immediately upon submission and you are e-mailed a score report within three days of your exam. Your score report displays the problem number for each problem you attempted and a grade on that problem. If you fail a problem, the score report includes the criteria you failed (e.g., “Records contain incorrect data” or “Incorrect file format”). We do not report more information in order to protect the exam content. Read more about reviewing exam content on the FAQ.
If you pass the exam, you receive a second e-mail within a week of your exam with your digital certificate as a PDF and your license number.
Audience and Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites required to take any Cloudera certification exam. The CCA Spark and Hadoop Developer exam (CCA175) follows the same objectives as Cloudera Developer Training for Spark and Hadoop and the training course is an excellent preparation for the exam.
