CCA Administrator













CCA Administrator Exam (CCA131)

Number of Questions: 8–12 performance-based (hands-on) tasks on pre-configured Cloudera Enterprise cluster. 
Time Limit: 120 minutes
Passing Score: 70%
Language: English
Exam Question Format


Each CCA question requires you to solve a particular scenario. Some of the tasks require making configuration and service changes via Cloudera Manager, while others demand knowledge of command line Hadoop utilities and basic competence with the Linux environment.
Evaluation, Score Reporting, and Certificate
Your exam is graded immediately upon submission and you are e-mailed a score report within three days of your exam. Your score report displays the problem number for each problem you attempted and a grade on that problem. If you fail a problem, the score report includes the criteria you failed (e.g., “Records contain incorrect data” or “Incorrect file format”). We do not report more information in order to protect the exam content. Read more about reviewing exam content on the FAQ.
If you pass the exam, you receive a second e-mail within a week of your exam with your digital certificate as a PDF and your license number.
Audience and Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for taking any Cloudera certification exam; however, a background in system administration, or equivalent training is strongly recommended. The CCA Administrator exam (CCA131) follows the same objectives as Cloudera Administrator Training and the training course is an excellent part of preparation for the exam.
