CCA Data Analyst
A SQL developer who earns the Cloudera Certified Data Analyst credential is able to perform core competencies required to pull and generate reports in Cloudera's CDH environment using Impala and Hive. The credential is earned after successfully passing the CCA Data Analyst Exam (CCA159).







 




Certification


CDH HDP Certification


CCA Data Analyst




















CCA Data Analyst Exam (CCA159) 

Number of Questions: 8–12 performance-based (hands-on) tasks on a Cloudera Enterprise cluster. See below for full cluster configuration
Time Limit: 120 minutes
Passing Score: 70%
Language: English

Exam Question Format
You are given eight to twelve customer problems with a unique large data set, a CDH cluster, and 120 minutes. For each problem, you must implement a technical solution with a high degree of precision that meets all the requirements. You must possess enough knowledge to analyze the problem and arrive at an optimal approach given the time allowed. You need to know what you should do and then do it on a live cluster, including a time limit and while being watched by a proctor.
Evaluation, Score Reporting, and Certificate
Your exam is graded immediately upon submission and you are e-mailed a score report within three days of your exam. Your score report displays the problem number for each problem you attempted and a grade on that problem. If you fail a problem, the score report includes the criteria you failed (e.g., “Records contain incorrect data” or “Incorrect file format”). We do not report more information in order to protect the exam content. Read more about reviewing exam content on the FAQ.
If you pass the exam, you receive a second e-mail within a week of your exam with your digital certificate as a PDF and your license number.
Audience and Prerequisites
Candidates for CCA Data Analyst can be SQL developers, data analysts, business intelligence specialists, developers, system architects, and database administrators. There are no prerequisites.
The CCA Data Analyst exam was created to identify talented SQL developers looking to stand out and be recognized by employers looking for these skills. It is recommended that those looking to achieve this certification start by taking Cloudera’s Data Analyst training course, which has the same objectives as the exam.
Required Skills
Provide Structure to the Data
Use Data Definition Language (DDL) statements to create or alter structures in the metastore for use by Hive and Impala.

Create tables using a variety of data types, delimiters, and file formats

Create new tables using existing tables to define the schema

Improve query performance by creating partitioned tables in the metastore

Alter tables to modify existing schema

Create views in order to simplify queries


Data Analysis
Use Query Language (QL) statements in Hive and Impala to analyze data on the cluster.

Prepare reports using SELECT commands including unions and subqueries

Calculate aggregate statistics, such as sums and averages, during a query

Create queries against multiple data sources by using join commands

Transform the output format of queries by using built-in functions

Perform queries across a group of rows using windowing functions
