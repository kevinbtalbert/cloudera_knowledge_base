Attempting the exam FAQ








How do I launch my exam?
The start icon for your appointment will be active 15 minutes before your scheduled appointment time. Click the start icon to launch your exam. Please note, if you launch prior to your scheduled exam start time, you may be required to wait for proctor to become available.








What do I need on the day of my exam?
The proctor is attending your session by webcam merely to enforce the rules and protect the integrity of the exam. They will verify that you are the correct person, that you have the correct identification documentation, that there are no other people in the room, that you are not using notes, etc. The proctor knows nothing of Hadoop or clusters and has never seen the contents of the exam. They are not there to aid you with any technical issues. You must follow all instructions given by the proctor. You must treat the proctor and all employees with respect.








What are the rules for taking the exam?

Your desk and surrounding area must be free of all materials. You may not take notes outside of the exam environment
You must be alone
There is no talking during the exam
You may not wear headphones or earbuds and there is no use of phones or other electronic devices
Your face must be clearly visible to the proctor at all times. You may not sit in front of a bright light, that is you must not be backlit.
You may not chew gum, eat, or drink during the exam
You may not launch any other application on your computer during the exam
You may not take screenshots of the exam environment
You may not take a break or leave the webcam view for any reason during your exam.









What is the proctor’s job during the exam?
The proctor is attending your session by webcam merely to enforce the rules and protect the integrity of the exam. They will verify that you are the correct person, that you have the correct identification documentation, that there are no other people in the room, that you are not using notes, etc. The proctor knows nothing of Hadoop or clusters and has never seen the contents of the exam. They are not there to aid you with any technical issues. You must follow all instructions given by the proctor. You must treat the proctor and all employees with respect.








What am I responsible for during the exam?
It is your responsibility to keep everyone out of the room in which you are attempting the exam. It is your responsibility to keep the room completely silent (if the proctor hears any voices, yours or others the exam may be stopped.) It is also your responsibility to ensure a stable internet connection.








Can I use wifi or a mobile hotspot for taking the exam?
It is highly recommended to use a stable, wired internet connection. WiFi and mobile hotspots are not recommended.








What external websites will I have access to while taking the exam?
None. You are not permitted to access any websites other than Questionmark during the exam.








How can I retrieve my forgotten password?
Yes. On the Questionmark login screen click Retrieve Password.








What is my recourse if technical problems prevent my environment from being ready at exam time?
It is your responsibility to ensure you have a stable Internet connection. If a technical issue with Cloudera University or Questionmark prevents you from starting your exam at the scheduled time, we will help reschedule your exam.








What if I lose internet connectivity during the exam?
If you are able to quickly reconnect you will be allowed to continue your exam - your timer will continue to run while you are disconnected.








What happens if I don't show up for my exam?
You are marked as a no-show for the exam and you forfeit any fees you paid for the exam.








Does the exam proctor have access to my computer or its contents?
The proctor will be able to see your webcam, hear you via your microphone and watch your desktop via desktop sharing.

After the exam FAQ








When will I get my results?

What is Cloudera’s retake policy?
Candidates who fail an exam must wait a period of seven (7) calendar days, beginning the day after the failed attempt, before they may retake the same exam. You may take the exam as many times as you want until you pass, however, you must pay for each attempt; Cloudera offers no discounts for retake exams. Retakes are not allowed after the successful completion of a test.








Does my certification expire?
CDP Certification Program certifications are valid for 2 (two) years.








I passed, but I'd like to take the test again to improve my score. Can I do that?
No. Once passed you may not attempt an exam again. If your certification expires after two years, you will be permitted to retake the exam to maintain your certification status.








I failed, and now I can’t purchase another exam attempt. What should I do?
Per the retake policy, you must wait 7 days to schedule your next attempt.
