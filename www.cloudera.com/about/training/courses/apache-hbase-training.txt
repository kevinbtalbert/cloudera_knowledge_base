Cloudera Training for Apache HBase
Cloudera Educational Services HBase course enables participants to store and access massive quantities of multi-structured data and perform hundreds of thousands of operations per second. This course is part of both the developer learning path and the administrator learning path.
















    
    
      Overview
      




Take your knowledge to the next level with Cloudera Training for Apache HBase. Cloudera Educational Services’ three-day training course enables participants to store and access massive quantities of multi-structured data and perform hundreds of thousands of operations per second.





    
    
      Hands-on Hadoop
      




Through instructor-led discussion and interactive, hands-on exercises, participants will navigate the Hadoop ecosystem, learning topics such as:

The use cases and usage occasions for HBase, Hadoop, and RDBMS
Using the HBase shell to directly manipulate HBase tables
Designing optimal HBase schemas for efficient data storage and recovery
How to connect to HBase using the Java API to insert and retrieve data in real time
Best practices for identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks






    
    
      Audience and prerequisites
      




This course is appropriate for developers and administrators who intend to use HBase. Prior experience with databases and data modeling is helpful, but not required. Knowledge of Java is assumed. Prior knowledge of Hadoop is not required, but Cloudera Developer Training for Spark and Hadoop provides an excellent foundation for this course.
