ARCH-492: Architecting Cloudera Edge to AI



Cloudera Data Platform, Cloudera Hybrid Computing


















    
    
      Overview
      




Designing Edge to AI Applications is a 4-day learning event that addresses advanced big data architecture topics for building edge to AI applications to cover streaming, operational data processing, analytics, and machine learning.  The workshop brings together technical contributors into a group setting to design and architect solutions to a challenging business problem. The workshop addresses big data architecture problems in general, and then applies them to the design of a challenging system.
Throughout the highly interactive workshop, participants apply concepts to real-world examples resulting in detailed synergistic discussions. The workshop is conducive for participants to learn techniques for architecting big data systems, not only from Cloudera’s experience but also from the experiences of fellow participants. 
More specifically, this workshop addresses advanced big data architecture topics, including, data formats, transformation, transactions, real-time, batch and machine learning processing, scalability, fault tolerance, security, and privacy, minimizing the risk of an unsound architecture and technology selection.

      What you'll learn
      





Cloudera Data Platform 
Big Data Architecture 
Building Scalable applications 
Building Fault Tolerant Solutions 
Security and Privacy Deployment on Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud






    
    
      What to expect
      




Participants should mainly be architects, developer team leads, big data developers, data engineers, senior analysts, dev ops admins and machine learning developers who are working on big data or streaming applications and have an interest in how to design and develop such applications on CDP. To gain the most from the workshop, participants should have working knowledge of popular Big Data and streaming technologies such as HDFS, Spark, Kafka, Hive/Impala, Data Formats, and relational database management systems. Detailed API level knowledge is not needed, as there will not be any programming activities and instead the focus will be on architecture design.
The workshop will be divided into small groups to discuss the problems, develop solutions, and present their solutions.
