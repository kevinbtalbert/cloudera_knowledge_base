ADMIN-232: Building Secure Cloudera Clusters



Cloudera Private Cloud Base and Shared Data Experience powered by Apache Ranger and Apache Atlas


















    
    
      Overview
      




This four-day hands-on course for Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) administrators teaches the skills and practices needed to configure solutions that meet the most demanding technical security audit standards. The course is built around a recommended project plan for CDP administrators. The first project stage is implementation of Perimeter Security by installing host level security and Kerberos. The second project stage protects data by implementing Transport Layer Security via Auto-TLS and data encryption using Key Management System and Key Trustee Server (KMS/KTS). The third project stage controls access for users and data using Ranger and Atlas. The fourth stage teaches visibility practices for auditing of systems, users, and data usage. The final project stage analyzes applications in terms of vulnerabilities and introduces CDP practices for risk management in a fully secured Cloudera Data Platform. This course is primarily hands-on, consisting of 70% lab exercise and 30% lecture.
