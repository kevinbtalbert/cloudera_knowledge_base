During this course, you'll learn the key concepts behind the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP), Cloudera's next-generation platform and the world's first implementation of the enterprise data cloud. You'll learn how CDP originated, how it enables both business teams and IT staff to be more productive, and understand its capabilities for turning data into actionable insight. Additionally, this course showcases an edge-to-AI use case, including stories from two customers who have successfully implemented it using Cloudera's technologies.

Which characteristics define the enterprise data cloud
What the Cloudera Data Platform is and what capabilities it provides
How the Cloudera Data Platform supports both on-premises and cloud-based deployments
