Cloudera OnDemand Training Library
Convenient access to our latest self-paced training, available by subscription.

















What is Cloudera OnDemand?
The skills gap in emerging technologies continues to grow. Does your team have the expertise needed to keep pace? Cloudera’s OnDemand Training is designed to support both the enterprise-wide and individual training required to advance big data projects.
Cloudera OnDemand offers video-based instruction  led by experts and access to 100 hours of cloud-based, ready-to-run lab environments that enable students to practice what they've learned through hands-on exercises.






Why is a subscription valuable?
Employers find that Cloudera OnDemand library subscriptions maximize the value of their training budgets. Employees appreciate the flexibility to learn at the time, location, and pace that's most comfortable for them. The subscription provides instant access to our existing library of video instruction, as well as early access to new training, for 365 days.






Who should subscribe?
A subscription is appropriate for anyone who wants to learn how to use Cloudera’s platforms and products effectively, including administrators, developers, data scientists, and data analysts.
Whether you are just beginning your Cloudera journey, or are a technical veteran looking to stay current on the latest tools and techniques, Cloudera OnDemand delivers the training to help you and your organization succeed.






The Fine Print
This subscription starts on the date of purchase and is valid for the standard access period (365 days) or until the Training Credit expiration date or other customer-specific contracted terms.**
Your subscription also includes a predefined number of lab hours in which you can access the cloud-hosted exercise environment. Library subscriptions receive 100 hours of lab time to be shared between all of the included courses.
