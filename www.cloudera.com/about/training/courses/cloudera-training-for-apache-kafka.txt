 Cloudera Training for Apache Kafka

















About this Training
This four-day instructor-led course begins by introducing Apache Kafka, explaining its key concepts and architecture, and discussing several common use cases. Building on this foundation, you will learn how to plan a Kafka deployment, and then gain hands-on experience by installing and configuring your own cloud-based, multi-node cluster running Kafka on the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP).
You will then use this cluster during more than 20 hands-on exercises that follow, covering a range of essential skills, starting with how to create Kafka topics, producers, and consumers, then continuing through progressively more challenging aspects of Kafka operations and development, such as those related to scalability, reliability, and performance problems. Throughout the course, you will learn and use Cloudera’s recommended tools for working with Kafka, including Cloudera Manager, Schema Registry, Streams Messaging Manager, and Cruise Control.
