DOPS-242: Ingesting with Cloudera DataFlow



Cloudera Data Flow powered by Apache NiFi


















    
    
      Overview
      




One of the most critical functions of a data-driven enterprise is the ability to manage ingest and data flow across complex ecosystems.  Does your team have the tools and skill sets to succeed at this?
Apache NiFi and this four-day course provides the fundamental concepts and experience necessary to automate the ingress, flow, transformation, and egress of data using NiFi. The course also covers tuning, troubleshooting, and monitoring the dataflow process as well as how to integrate a dataflow within the Cloudera CDP Hybrid ecosystem and external systems.
Download full course description 





    
    
      What you'll learn
      




During this course, you learn how to: 

Define, configure, organize, and manage dataflows 
Transform and trace data as it flows to its destination 
Track changes to dataflows with NiFi Registry 
Use the NiFi Expression Language to control dataflows 
Optimize dataflows for better performance and maintainability
Connect dataflows with other systems, such as Apache Kafka, Apache Hive, and HDFS
Utilize the Data Flow Service






    
    
      What to expect
      




This course is designed for developers, data engineers, administrators, and others with an interest in learning NiFi’s innovative no-code, graphical approach to data ingest. Although programming experience is not required, basic experience with Linux is presumed, and previous exposure to big data concepts and applications is helpful.
