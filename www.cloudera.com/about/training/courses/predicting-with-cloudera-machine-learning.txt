DSCI-272: Predicting with Cloudera Machine Learning



Cloudera Machine Learning powered by Apache Spark and Spark ML


















    
    
      Overview
      




Enterprise data science teams need collaborative access to business data, tools, and computing resources required to develop and deploy machine learning workflows. Cloudera Machine Learning (CML), part of the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP), provides the solution, giving data science teams the required resources.
This four-day course covers machine learning workflows and operations using CML. Participants explore, visualize, and analyze data. You will also train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models. 
The course walks through an end-to-end data science and machine learning workflow based on realistic scenarios and datasets from a fictitious technology company. The demonstrations and exercises are conducted in Python (with PySpark) using CML.
Download full course description 





    
    
      What you'll learn
      




Through lecture and hands-on exercises, you will learn how to:

Utilize Cloudera SDX and other components of the Cloudera Data Platform to locate data for machine learning experiments

Use an Applied ML Prototype (AMP)

Manage machine learning experiments

Connect to various data sources and explore data

Utilize Apache Spark and Spark ML

Deploy an ML model as a REST API

Manage and monitor deployed ML models







    
    
      What to expect
      




The course is designed for data scientists who need to understand how to utilize Cloudera Machine Learning and the Cloudera Data Platform to achieve faster model development and deliver production machine learning at scale. Data engineers, developers, and solution architects who collaborate with data scientists will also find this course valuable.
