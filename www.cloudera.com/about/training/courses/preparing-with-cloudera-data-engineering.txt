DENG-254: Preparing with Cloudera Data Engineering



Cloudera Data Engineering powered by Apache Spark, Hive, and Airflow


















    
    
      Overview
      




This four-day hands-on training course delivers the key concepts and knowledge developers need to use Apache Spark to develop high-performance, parallel applications on the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP). 
Hands-on exercises allow students to practice writing Spark applications that integrate with CDP core components. Participants will learn how to use Spark SQL to query structured data, how to use Hive features to ingest and denormalize data, and how to work with “big data” stored in a distributed file system.
After taking this course, participants will be prepared to face real-world challenges and build applications to execute faster decisions, better decisions, and interactive analysis, applied to a wide variety of use cases, architectures, and industries.
Download full course description 





    
    
      What you'll learn
      




During this course, you will learn how to:

Distribute, store, and process data in a CDP cluster
Write, configure, and deploy Apache Spark applications
Use the Spark interpreters and Spark applications to explore, process, and analyze distributed data
Query data using Spark SQL, DataFrames, and Hive tables
Deploy a Spark application on the Data Engineering Service






    
    
      What to expect
      




This course is designed for developers and data engineers. All students are expected to have basic Linux experience, and basic proficiency with either Python or Scala programming languages. Basic knowledge of SQL is helpful.  Prior knowledge of Spark and Hadoop is not required.
