Description of Training Services
















The current course catalog can be found at the following URL:
http://cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/training/courses.html
 
Cloudera Custom Training
Training courses tailored to Customer’s requirements are available at Cloudera’s then-current daily rate based on the number of students, subject to an agenda as mutually agreed upon by Customer and Cloudera.
 
Cloudera Training Credits
Cloudera Training Credits (“Training Credits”) are pre-paid training funds that can be redeemed for public, private and OnDemand training from Cloudera or public training through a Cloudera-authorized training delivery partner. Training Credits may be pre-purchased in a minimum quantity of $20,000 USD (or equivalent), are provided for a period of 12 months from date of purchase, and expire 12 months from the date of purchase (“Training Credits Term”). The Training Credits must be redeemed prior to expiration. All unused credits will be forfeited (i.e., all private or public classes must be completed before the expiration date of the Training Credits Term to be eligible for Training Credit redemption). Access to OnDemand training purchased using Training Credits will terminate at the end of the Training Credits Term.
Training Credits may be redeemed for Cloudera certification products. The exam voucher will expire at the end of the Training Credits Term. Exams must be completed during the Training Credits Term; no extensions will be granted.
 
Training Course Policies
Minimum duration for on-site courses is three days. All one or two day courses must be ordered in combination with other training.
Training Materials, including course slides and the Exercise Manual, are for the personal use of the student attending the course only. The Training Materials may not be copied, shared or redistributed in any form or manner. Please contact training-admin@cloudera.com for more information.
Attendee lists must be provided in advance. Course participation is limited to the maximum number as indicated by the training product purchased. In the event Training Credits are redeemed for on-site training, the credits will be allocated based on the student count confirmed at the time of class booking.
Mutually agreed upon additional students will incur an additional $500 per attendee per day fee. More than 20 students are not allowed in any course without prior consent from Cloudera. Any changes to the number of participants must be requested in writing no later than two weeks prior to the start of class.
Remote attendees, if any, count toward maximum participant limitation. Courses are hands-on and interactive; remote attendees are not recommended unless they are attending a scheduled virtual session. Cloudera must pre-approve any remote attendees for on-site training, and Customer will be responsible for supplying and managing the web-conferencing technology.
Attendance is limited to Customer employees and full-time contractors. Attendees who are not Customer employees or full-time contractors will incur an additional $5,000 USD participation fee.
For sessions cancelled 30 days or more in advance, the cancellation fee is 10%.
For sessions cancelled or rescheduled 15 days or more in advance, but fewer than 30 days in advance, the cancellation/reschedule fee is 50%.
For sessions cancelled or rescheduled fewer than 15 days in advance, the cancellation/reschedule fee is 100%.
Customer must notify the Cloudera Education team at schedule-training@cloudera.com to cancel or reschedule sessions.
 
Training Credit Policies
Training credits may only be redeemed in the currency in which they were purchased.
Customer must designate a primary contact (“Account Owner”) authorized to use the credits.
Credits will apply towards the list price of the course effective at the time of redemption.
Prices and course types are subject to change.
Scheduling is subject to availability. Cloudera does not guarantee seats to any particular public course or availability of an instructor for delivery of private courses on any particular date.
 
OnDemand Training Policies
Training Services provided via OnDemand video may be provided directly by Cloudera to Customer, or may be hosted by a third-party services provider. OnDemand training is licensed to unique individuals. One license equates to one user, as counted by unique email addresses.  It is prohibited for OnDemand access credentials to be shared by multiple individuals.  The term of OnDemand licenses is as follows: (i) licenses for individual courses will be valid for a period of six months from the purchase date, and (ii) licenses to the OnDemand Library (which is a collection of Cloudera courses) are valid for a period of 12 months from the purchase date.  Access to the applicable video content and remote lab environment (if any) will be terminated upon the earlier of (i) the expiration date of the applicable license, or (ii) if purchased via Training Credits, the expiration of the Training Credits Term.  Fees paid for such OnDemand training are non-transferable, non-cancelable and non-refundable.
 
Public Training Seats Purchased by Purchase Order
Public training seats bought by purchase order require a signed Order Form and will expire if not used within 12 months of the purchase date.  Additional public training terms and conditions can be found at the following URL: https://university.cloudera.com/legal/order_terms_and_conditions.
 
Training Facility Rentals
In the event Customer cannot provide a room and/or computers which meet the requirements listed in the following section (Cloudera Training Technical Classroom Requirements), Customer must rent a training facility with workstations to host the class. Cloudera recommends that Customer utilize Cloudera to assist with sourcing a qualified training facility as Cloudera has established relationships with vendors who are familiar with our course requirements.  The estimated daily rental rates will be as follows:

US Locations:  $1150 USD per day; no lunch included
UK Locations:  £1150 GBP per day; no lunch included

Note:  Lunches can be added for $18 USD per student per day in the US and £18 GBP per student per day in the UK.
For all other locations, please contact schedule-training@cloudera.com for rates and availability. Please note that room availability is NOT guaranteed, and all costs associated with room rentals are the responsibility of Customer. Some locations may not be offered directly through Cloudera but can be sourced as a “partner venue.”  Such rates may exceed the above amounts and such fees will be the responsibility of Customer. Facility rental costs may be deducted from a Training Credit balance if sufficient funds exist.  Cloudera Connect Partner discounts or other coupon codes will not be accepted for facility fees. Facility cancellation fees will be Customer’s responsibility if cancelled within 15 days of the class start date for US classes and 22 days for non-US locations.
 
Cloudera Training Technical Classroom Requirements
Computer setup requirements for Cloudera standard courses can be found at the following URL:
https://university.cloudera.com/technical_classroom_requirements
 
Custom Courses
Custom courses are built from existing Cloudera courses. For system requirements, the largest values from the courses included in the materials comprising the custom course will apply. Customer may contact Cloudera via e-mail at training-admin@cloudera.com for assistance related to custom courses.
