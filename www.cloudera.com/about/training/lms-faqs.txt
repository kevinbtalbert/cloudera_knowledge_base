Instructor-led training (ILT) FAQ








On the new learner’s platform, am I able to access all the courses that were previously available?
Yes. Our instructor-led training offerings are not changing. The complete catalog will still be available once we cut over to the new platform. 
Private Instructor Led Training Classes: Private classes will continue to be scheduled via the Cloudera Educational Services team.

OnDemand training FAQ

Yes. Your OnDemand purchases and completion history will be migrated to the new platform, but only the past 2 years of data. Details for any OnDemand training purchased or completed more than 2 years ago will not be migrated.








If I started a course but did not complete it, is my progress transfer to the new platform?
No. Enrollments in OnDemand library courses not completed on the old platform will be migrated to the new platform with a status of ‘not started’. If there are courses that you started but did not yet complete, you will need to retake chapter quizzes you already have passed. We recommend completing any in-progress courses before May 18, 2022.








Do my OnDemand courses continue to be available at ondemand.cloudera.com?
No. Cloudera OnDemand training courses will be migrated to the new learner’s platform, and the old platform will be retired. The new URL is https://education.cloudera.com.








Is a separate login still required to access OnDemand courses?
No. All Cloudera OnDemand courses will be directly accessible from within our new single, integrated learner’s platform. To access, users will continue to use their cloudera.com account credentials for authentication.








Am I able to access the same courses on the new platform?
Most of our OnDemand courses will be transferred with a new look, but not all. We have retired some courses. Here is a list of courses that we do not expect to migrate:

Administrator Training for Apache Hadoop
Cloudera Director: An Introduction
Cloudera Security Training
CDP for CDH Users (general audience)
CDP for HDP Users (general audience)
CDP Private Cloud Fundamentals

Note that a new version of the Cloudera Data Science Workbench Training course will be released in the very near future. 








Is the balance of my time allotment for lab environment access migrated to the new platform?
Effectively, yes. The time allotment is managed by the service that hosts the environments. You will still have access to your same environments with your existing remaining time.








I have only purchased individual course titles on the old platform, not a library subscription. Do I continue to have access to the individual course(s) I purchased on the new platform?
Yes. Although individual courses can no longer be purchased on the new platform, we will honor existing purchases.








Are student question forums still available on the new platform?
Yes. You will be able to post questions as they arise, and interact with other students on their posts.
