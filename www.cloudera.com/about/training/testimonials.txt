Testimonials






 











Training was a key factor in our decision to go with Cloudera Enterprise. The right education helps make software a solution and helped make our team ready to engage with all our data.
Servicio de Impuestos Internos de Chile










Cloudera has not only prepared us for success today, but has also trained us to face and prevail over our big data challenges in the future. We're trained to make use of every part of the ecosystem and derive full value from all our data.
Persado










We were able to jumpstart an Introduction to Big Data Analytics course thanks to the support of Cloudera. The materials provided by them, including the lab setup, are integral to the course.
San Jose State University










I am really impressed by Cloudera's online offerings. The range of material is remarkable and the professional, informative, and fun manner in which it is presented is top notch. It is a wonderful resource for anyone interested in technical training.
Argova










Administrator Training gave me an excellent jumpstart on acquiring the knowledge I need to address my customers' big data and cloud challenges. Cloudera saved me oodles of time!
Canonical










My team had an exceptional training experience. The Cloudera instructor's depth of knowledge and ability to address all our questions really kept us engaged. This was definitely one of the best, if not the best, course I have ever attended.
Syncsort










I was very impressed with the depth and completeness of Developer training. Cloudera really helped me understand Hadoop's capabilities so that I can make better technology choices relative to our big data opportunity going forward.
BancVue










The professionalism and expansive technical knowledge demonstrated by our classroom instructor were incredible. The quality of the training was on par with a university.
General Dynamics










I came away from the class with a far more solid understanding of the inner workings of MapReduce. Questions, no matter how detailed, were encouraged and answered precisely by Cloudera's well-prepared instructor.
Alion Science and Technology










I not only learned how to code for Hadoop, but I now understand how to apply it for maximum results. I previously had limited experience, but the Cloudera instructor helped me pick it up pretty easily. I would definitely recommend Cloudera to others.
Looksmart










I was really impressed with Cloudera training. The instructor was very knowledgeable and was able to answer all the questions the class threw at him, including in-depth Java-type questions. These are experts!
Experian










The Developer and Administrator courses were very helpful. When we were setting up our cluster, I was like: “Oh, I remember this from admin training!” It was a lot smoother and less painful after the classes.
RelayHealth










I can say that the Cloudera Administrator Training for our Operations Engineers paid off big time! It really made the daily work much smoother.
nurago GmbH










Cloudera Developer training was great. I believe Cloudera is the best vendor evangelizing the big data movement. Thanks for all your help getting me started on this journey.
Cisco










Cloudera has true expertise in its ranks, offering intimate insight and experience with the ecosystem.
Menara Solutions Limited










The course instructor was excellent, offering clear and concise instruction that was easy to understand. Their wide-ranging peripheral knowledge helped apply the course material to real-world situations. I look forward to attending another course!
comScore










Beyond the technical merits of the courses, the certification validated the technology and my experience in the eyes of management. It’s often difficult to get buy-in when proposing new technology, and Cloudera’s efforts are very helpful in that regard.
Online Computer Library Center










The course provided me with the confidence to apply Hadoop to new projects. The certification was an important tick box for providing confidence to customers.
NICTA
