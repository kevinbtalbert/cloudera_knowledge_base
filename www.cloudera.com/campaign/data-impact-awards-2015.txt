2015 Data Impact Awards







 











 








CDH Users
You have accomplished amazing things with Hadoop, and it’s time to shine a spotlight on your success. That's precisely what the annual Data Impact Awards, presented by Cloudera, are for.
The goal of this program is to recognize organizations running CDH for the applications you’ve built using Hadoop, to share best practices for achieving big data success, and to showcase the impact your project is having on the organization, business, and/or society at large. Organizations may be nominated by employees, partners, vendors, or peers, with nominee consent.
We are no longer accepting nominations for the 2015 Data Impact Awards. Find out who won!






















Highlighting Achievements in 9 Categories
The 2015 Data Impact Awards recognize organizations’ achievements with the CDH platform across nine categories, classified into three overarching themes:





    
    
      Biggest Business Metrics

      Most Admirable Architectures
      




Data Discovery & Analytics: MarkerStudy (nominated by Zoomdata)
