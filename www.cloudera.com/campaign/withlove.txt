RESEARCH REPORT






Critical success factors to achieve a better enterprise data strategy in a multi-cloud environment
 


















 



 







 


















Harvard Business Review Analytic Services survey points to challenges threatening to interrupt innovation.
As technology has become more powerful, more affordable, and more accessible, we are witnessing customers making breakthroughs and discoveries at a pace that was previously unimaginable. At the same time, we’ve identified new challenges emerging that threaten to interrupt that innovation.
Enterprise IT is simply not meeting business demands and users are prioritizing speed over security, accuracy, and maximum impact.
We sponsored research by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services to survey global executives to answer the following questions:

Can enterprises access all their data efficiently and at scale? 
How are organizations managing a complex ecosystem of public, hybrid, and on-premises environments? 
Do companies have a data strategy that’s working?

Download the report for insight into these questions and more as well as to assess where your organization falls in comparison.
