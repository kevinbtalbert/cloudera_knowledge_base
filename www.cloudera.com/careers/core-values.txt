      The Cloudera Code
      





At Cloudera, our culture, our ethos, is centered on our values. We're here not only because we're experts at what we do, but also because we hold these values in common.

We are committed.
We are committed to prioritizing and delivering high quality results quickly: to our customers, our communities, our teams, and ourselves.









 










We act with integrity.
We always act with integrity; approaching interactions with good intentions, honesty, transparency, and respect.









We take risks.
We believe in taking calculated risks; to push past ‘what’s always been done’ in order to find what was never thought possible.
