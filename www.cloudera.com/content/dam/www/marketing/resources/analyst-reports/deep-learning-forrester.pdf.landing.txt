A revolution because the internet giants have all embraced deep learning as their go-forward AI strategy. And, finally, a revolution because it has only just begun. Once a revolution gets big enough, it disrupts. That’s the opportunity for application development and delivery (AD&D) professionals who build
enterprise and customer applications.
