Helping the Fortune 100 Access a 360-degree Customer View Through a Self-serve Data Hub





                    By deploying Impala and allowing for self-service data discovery, Magnify can offer clients a web-based solution through which they interact directly with Hadoop.

Impala is used to query millions of rows to identify specific records that match the dealers’ criteria.
