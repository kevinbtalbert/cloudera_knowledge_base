True Corporation: Speaking to More Than a Million Customers Individually





                    Using Intel® Xeon® processors E5 to power a CDH, a distribution of Apache Hadoop from Cloudera, True Corporation has created a unified and governed enterprise data platform to deliver a 360-degree, omni-channel view so that it can deliver greater value through more relevant offers and services. Thanks to the solution’s ease of use, data scientists work more efficiently, finding it simpler to integrate multiple data streams and discover new trends and patterns to support business development.
