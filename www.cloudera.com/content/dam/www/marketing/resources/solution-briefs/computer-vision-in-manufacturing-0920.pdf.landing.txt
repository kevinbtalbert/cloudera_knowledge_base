Allowing Machines to Hear, Feel and Now See - Computer Vision





Digital Transformation is Extending to Sight
Manufacturing’s digital transformation has produced high profile use cases delivering proven and documented value—predictive maintenance that reduces equipment downtime by 50%; supply chains that respond 8 to 20% faster and fully digitized manufacturing process optimization producing 20-40% more product. By 2025 Industry 4.0 is expected to generate greater than $1 trillion in economic value as manufacturing processes, operations and supply chains become more streamlined, efficient, agile and realize improved productivity, uptime and product quality. Most of these gains have been driven from sensors that measure manufacturing process and design parameters (weight, temperature, pressure, viscosity, speed and torque). Computer vision, extending to sight, is a high growth extension of this technology.
