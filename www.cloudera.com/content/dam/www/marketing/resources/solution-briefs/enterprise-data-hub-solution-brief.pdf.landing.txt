Solution Brief - Enterprise Data Hub





                    An enterprise data hub has emerged as a powerful new platform at the center of modern data strategy. It can collect and store unlimited data, cost-effectively and reliably, and enable diverse users to quickly gain value from that data through a collection of frameworks that span data processing, interactive analytics, and real-time serving applications. With an enterprise data hub, it is now possible to deliver integrated analytic solutions for less cost and effort than ever before. Cloudera Enterprise, powered by Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark at the core, enables an enterprise data hub together with the security, governance, management, support, and commercial ecosystem required for production success.
