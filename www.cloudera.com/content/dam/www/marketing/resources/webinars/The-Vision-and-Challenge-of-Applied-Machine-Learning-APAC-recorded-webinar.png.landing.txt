The Vision and Challenge of Applied Machine Learning APAC





                    Even with incredible advances in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI, general off-the-shelf software does not solve your specific business challenges. Just having large volumes of data is not enough. To be successful, organizations also need to tap into and create expertise in the implementation and operationalization of ML, along with adopting strategic views on ML.

This webinar discusses how organizations can leverage these resources as vital tools for building competitive data products, achieving short- and long-term ROI in ML and places one technical approach in context.
