Customer Experience: A Catalyst for Digital Transformation





                    Customer experience is a catalyst in many digital transformation projects. It is why many businesses invest in new technologies and processes to more effectively engage customers, constituents, or employees. The goal of putting digital tools to work in a transformative way is to ensure that data and insights connect people with information and processes that ultimately lead to a better experience for customers. Yet, it demands a modern approach that considers all of the platforms, processes, and data across the customer journey. The goal for many organizations is dynamically maintaining a single source of truth about each customer to drive personalized experiences based on individual preferences and behaviors.
However, businesses today have primarily invested in systems of record. While these systems are critical for managing internal operational processes, they are typically not effective for today's pace of business change. Insight-driven experiences require customer intelligence platforms that can finally create a customer 360. The deeper data and improved algorithms now available let users factor in individual affinity, segment, and a myriad of growing data sources. The result is greater relevance and effectiveness to deliver a differentiated experience that in today’s competitive landscape is not a luxury, but a necessity for survival.
