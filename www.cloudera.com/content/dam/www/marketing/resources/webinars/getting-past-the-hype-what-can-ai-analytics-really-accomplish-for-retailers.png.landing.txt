Getting Past The Hype: What Can AI Analytics Really Accomplish For Retailers?





                    In the space of a few years, AI has moved from what may have once been viewed as an expensive capability that only the largest and most progressive retailers had, to evolving into a true competitive barrier for those that may have been / still sitting on the sidelines.
Retail ‘winners’ have accelerated their use of machine learning and AI to gain a competitive edge - where do you compare? 
RSR Research and Cloudera have teamed up to produce and disseminate a very current and relevant look at how AI & ML is integral now to Retail and it’s digital transformation. The study interviewed a broad range of retail organizations, functional business teams, and retail sectors to gain insight into the challenges, opportunities, organization inhibitors and technology enablers now affecting retail’s digital transformation. 
You will Learn:
How your peers judge how AI is transforming retail
Where ‘retail winners’ are focusing their AI investments, and how they differ from ‘retail laggards’
How your peers are leveraging specific technologies to gain competitive advantage
Pragmatic insights into top challenges, lessons learned and business improvement opportunities leveraging AI in retail
