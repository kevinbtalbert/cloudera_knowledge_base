Introducing Cloudera Navigator Optimizer: Offload Assessments and Active Data Optimization for Hadoop Success





                    Cloudera Enterprise can be used as an adaptive, high-performance analytic database, complementing existing data warehouses by relieving the pressure of growing numbers of ETL jobs and BI analytics. But where do you get started when developing your offload strategy? Cloudera Navigator Optimizer eases the path for moving the right workloads to Hadoop and then actively manages data allowing you to take advantage of Hadoop’s benefits. Now generally available with the recent release of Cloudera 5.8 and a unique part of Cloudera’s analytic database solution, Navigator Optimizer gives you the workload visibility and assessments to build a predictable offload plan, adapt to evolving data and workload demands, and optimize query performance for Hadoop technologies.
