Microsoft, Quantexa, Cloudera: Balance innovation and efficiencies to protect against financial crime





                    Striking the middle ground between technological innovation and efficiencies (both cost and agility), is increasingly difficult for many organizations. Is it possible to strive for industry best practice, such as predictive responses, while managing the wider choices offered by on-premise, public and private cloud offerings in an efficient, agile and compliant manner?
Join Jamie Hutton, Patrice Amann and Dr Richard Harmon to learn more about how you can most efficiently and compliantly innovate on the enterprise data cloud.
In this webinar, you will learn how customers have employed Cloudera and Quantexa technology on Microsoft Azure to:
Innovation: utilize contextual decision intelligence technology to get a single entity view and network analytics to find hidden risk and reduce false positives.
Efficiency: protect your data while maintaining an agile environment with the ability to scale resources up and down, depending on demand. Microsoft Azure provides such flexibility and can lead to significant savings for the business.
Compliancy: consolidating any data, anywhere, into Cloudera’s enterprise data cloud allows you to maximize efficiencies provided by different data storage options and to integrate into innovative technologies like Quantexa. The enterprise data cloud ensures your data is completely secure, governed and compliant with secure data fabric, SDX.
