MIT: Agility in the Age of the Cloud 





                    Quentin Hardy, Editor in Chief at Google Cloud, who will discuss how companies can increase 
their agility by adopting a cloud-centric mindset. You’ll learn how we will all have to react in real time to ever richer data flows, how the cloud can help to break down data and organizational silos, the potential impacts of cloud-based collaboration on product development and innovation, which ethical questions the cloud creates, and how to think about them.
