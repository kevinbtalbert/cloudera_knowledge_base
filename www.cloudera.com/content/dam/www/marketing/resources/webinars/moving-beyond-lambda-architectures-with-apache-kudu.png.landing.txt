Moving Beyond Lambda Architectures with Apache Kudu





                    One of the benefits of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem is the ability to choose the broad set of ecosystem components to efficiently meet the requirements of your use case. The availability of multiple frameworks gives users the ability to do real-time or batch processing with varied storage engines, efficiently handling your data along the way. However, when a use case requires a lambda architecture - a combination of speed and batch layers - the Hadoop ecosystem’s response has been to stitch together a complex hybrid architecture from its existing components. Cloudera has identified this gap, and plans to address it through Apache Kudu, the storage engine for fast analytics on fast data.
