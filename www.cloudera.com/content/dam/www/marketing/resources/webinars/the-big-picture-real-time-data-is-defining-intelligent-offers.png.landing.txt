The Big Picture: Real-time Data is  Defining Intelligent Offers





                    New research shows that 57% of the buying cycle is completed before a prospect even speaks to a company. Marketers already know this, Ninety-six percent (96%) of organizations believe that email personalization can improve email marketing performance. But where do we get this increasingly personal direction? The answer is likely in your customer data. In order to understand your customer needs contextualized in the moment they feel the need to act you will require a platform that can leverage real-time data. Apache Kudu is a Cloudera component that makes dealing with quickly changing data fast and easy. Companies are leveraging next generation data stores like Kudu to build data applications that deliver smart promotions, real-time offers, and personalized marketing. Join us as we discuss modern approaches to real-time application development and highlight key Cloudera use cases being powered by Cloudera’s operational database.
