Omdia, IBM & Cloudera: Meeting the New Intelligent Data Economy Head-on





                    The current global pandemic and associated societal unrest bring two important facts into stark relief.  First, data and trust in data matters. It is the engine that forms both the ability to innovate and the capacity to withstand unanticipated change.   Second, data, especially data residing on-premises, demands an underlying storage infrastructure that’s capable of accommodating a rich array of data, analytics, cloud-native, and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads securely and reliably at scale.   In this whitepaper, Omdia analysts will help enterprise leaders understand how evolving market trends in data warehousing and processing, cloud-native development practices, and converged infrastructures can jointly transform legacy big data deployments into flexible, resilient engines of innovation fit for premises, edge, and beyond.
