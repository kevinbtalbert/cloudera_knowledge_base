Risk Control for a Digitized Financial Sector: RegTech’s illumination of IT and data blind spots





                    JWG Is a pioneering market intelligence company working with firms, technologists, and regulators since 2006 to help the industry comply with the ever-changing regulatory landscape. This research report draws conclusions from JWG’s February 2020 RegTech 2.0 conference with 250 market experts who discussed forthcoming challenges and defined strategies on how to get ahead of the curve. An expert panel on Infrastructure debated the impact of new technology on the risk footprint of the financial system and how well current policies help mitigate these risks under Chatham house rule. "An explosion of advanced computing capability facilitated by Cloud technology has provided massive benefits to both regulated financial institutions and their regulators. However, it has also introduced new Systemic Technology Risks (STRs) to the financial sector. Rapidly scalable technology and data enable powerful new business and supervisory models at far lower cost and faster deployment cycles. This enables supervisors to get hold of and interpret the vast quantity of information they receive daily on the safety of the system."
