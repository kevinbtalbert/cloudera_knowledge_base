EMEA Evolve Data Study





                    Driven by ongoing digital transformation projects, the ongoing data explosion offers a potentially significant competitive advantage to organizations capable of harnessing it in a cost-effective manner. The challenge is no longer about storing such huge volumes of data. It's about managing and optimizing it effectively, even as data is being created across the distributed enterprise, from on-premises servers to the public cloud and network edge.
Cloudera polled 850 IT decision makers (ITDMs) in a survey across the EMEA region regarding their organisation's cloud and data management practices, and the challenges they face in making all their data actionable.

Key takeaways:

92% of EMEA organisations plan to migrate more data to the cloud, 76% indicate they plan to move data back to on-premises
Almost three-quarters (72%) of IT decision makers (ITDM) say having data across both cloud and on-premises environments makes it complex to extract value.
Modern data architectures enable organisations to drive more value from their data, optimise cloud costs and become AI ready
