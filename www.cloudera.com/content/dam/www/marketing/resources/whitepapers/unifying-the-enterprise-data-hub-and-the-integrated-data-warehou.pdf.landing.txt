Unifying the Enterprise Data Hub and the Integrated Data Warehouse





                    Businesses have access to more data now than at any time in recorded history. Companies today must adjust to meet the new strains and demands big data places on them. And they must begin to do so now, as big data is going to grow and become more integral to success in the next decade. According to IDC, the amount of data generated will be in excess of 44 zettabytes by 2020. With that type of growth, businesses that are not evaluating their current data architecture risk being overwhelmed by the volume and speed of data. Even worse is being left behind by competitors who are better equipped to use data as a way of driving decision-making. The term big data is misleading—there’s more to this phenomenon than size alone. In addition to unprecedented data volumes, organizations now face a range of new data types and a pace of data creation they often aren’t prepared to handle. Big data is highly complex and differentiated; it originates from a variety of sources. Yet at the same time, big data also encompasses traditional structured financial, operational, and customer data. It turns out the ideal solution for big data is one built on multiple components, allowing the enterprise to turn big data hype into productive solutions fit to their specific needs. The logical data warehouse is a dramatic expansion of the prior blueprint for a data warehouse. Together, Teradata® and Cloudera are championing the rapid expansion of data warehouse concepts into a fresh, new way of delivering analytic value to the business.
