Oracle Instant Client for Hue
The Oracle Instant Client parcel for Hue enables Hue to be quickly and seamlessly deployed by Cloudera Manager with Oracle as its external database. For customers who have standardized on Oracle, this eliminates extra steps in installing or moving a Hue deployment on Oracle and allows for automated deployment of Hue on Oracle via the Cloudera Manager API.
Use of this software requires acceptance of the Cloudera Redistribution License Agreement for Oracle Instant Client. 
Please review the requirements below and our documentation for more information.
