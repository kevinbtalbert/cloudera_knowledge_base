Why this matters to organizations

Traditional technologies struggle to keep up with the exponential growth of information needed to protect against security attacks.
Many organizations have not tapped into new data sources and struggle to get meaningful insights.
Existing systems are challenged to economically manage and process all of the data from these new, streaming sources—hindering the improvement of products and efficiencies.
