      Same SQL skills. More efficiency. Better insights.
      












Quickly discover relevant data
Easily search and discover relevant tables, views, and columns across all databases, including cloud-native object stores, for faster and more robust analytics. Ensure data can be trusted immediately with embedded data stewardship and end-user tagging for further categorization and project-focused organization.









Intelligent query design and assistance
The only SQL editor with usage-enriched intelligence to make SQL users more productive and protect against rogue queries. Drag and drop tables and columns, quickly design queries with autocomplete pop-ups, and get query recommendations based on usage and best practices for efficient, iterative exploration and analytics.









 










Save and iterate across teams
Eliminate siloed analytics and BI with seamless and secure sharing and collaboration. Save queries and result sets for future use, share them across users or departments, and set access permissions directly to protect even the most sensitive data.









Cloud-native integration
Browse, query, and save results across all databases both on-premises and in cloud environments. Hue integrates with the entirety of Cloudera’s platform, including storage engines, Apache Kudu and Amazon S3 object storage, Apache Hive for data preparation, Apache Solr for free-text analytics, and Apache Impala for high-performance SQL analytics.
