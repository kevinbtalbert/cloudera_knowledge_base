What is the registration process for the Cloudera Live on Amazon Web Services (AWS)?
When you select “Deploy on AWS” from the Cloudera Live homepage for any of the tutorials, you will be prompted for registration. After completing the registration, you will receive a unique registration key that is necessary to start the deployment on AWS. You will also receive the AWS link to the relevant deployment.
Using the AWS link, you will be prompted to login into your AWS account. This is the account that will accrue hosting charges. If you do not have an AWS account, you will need to sign up for one. Once you login, you can start the deployment of your selected trial.
Hosting charges are the responsibility of the user. The software used in the tutorial Cloudera Enterprise, Tableau, and Zoomdata are available free for 60 days.








Do I need an AWS account for Cloudera Live?
Yes, to start the Cloudera Live deployments, you will need to login in to AWS with your account information. If you do not have an account, you will be prompted to create one. The account you choose to login with will be charged based on the size of your cluster and the length of time you are using it.
By default, Cloudera Live will spin up four m4.xlarge instances. The Zoomdata option will spin up a fifth m4.xlarge instance. The Tableau option will spin up a fifth m4.large instance instead.
Full pricing details for AWS can be found here: http://aws.amazon.com/pricing/








Will I be charged for this trial?
You are responsible for all hosting costs associated with this trial. These charges will be accrued to the AWS account that you used to initially deploy the tutorial(s). The trial will default spin up four m4.xlarge instances. The Zoomdata option will spin up a fifth m4.xlarge instance. The Tableau option will spin up a fifth m4.large instance instead.
The trials of Cloudera Enterprise, Tableau, and Zoomdata are available for 60 days, though you do not need to continue hosting them for the entire period.
