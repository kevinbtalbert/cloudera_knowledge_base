Apache Hadoop drives business value
Data can help us better understand our world, build innovative products and services of higher quality, and reduce operational costs and risk. Taking advantage of these new opportunities requires a different approach to working with data. Cloudera can help you harness the business value of Hadoop.

 Watch: Getting Started with Hadoop









 












 







    
    
      An enterprise data hub
      




An enterprise data hub is a powerfully simple idea: A unified platform that can collect and store unlimited data, cost-effectively and reliably, and enable diverse users to quickly gain value from that data through a collection of frameworks that span data processing, interactive analytics, and real-time serving applications. With an enterprise data hub, it is now possible to deliver integrated analytic solutions for less cost and effort than ever before.
