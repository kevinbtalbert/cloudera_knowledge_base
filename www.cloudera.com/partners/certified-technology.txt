Cloudera Certified Technology
Cloudera Connect Technology Certifications provide joint customers with a level of assurance that your product has been tested and certified to work with Cloudera. Certified partners display a special Certified Technology Partner badge in their partners listings on Cloudera.com. 


 Certified Partners








 











    
    
      Deliver peace of mind and faster deployments
      




With Cloudera-certified solutions, customers can adopt joint solutions that put their data to work solving important business problems. Customers gain:  

The knowledge that a joint solution has been tested to work with specific Cloudera components and proven in real-world deployments
Choice of providers for specific solutions and industries
Faster time to deployment with established reference architectures
Cloudera Support will help address customer questions for a Technology Certified product that has been tested and certified by Cloudera










 


































    
    
      Get certified with guidance at every step
      




Cloudera uses a well-documented, proven process to test our partners’ integration architectures. Because the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) provides a unified data architecture platform across cloud and on-premise deployment models, technology certifications will be based on individual platform engines such as Spark, Hive, or Impala, and/ or governance components such as Ranger and Atlas.









 




























    
    
      Clear Value
      




When evaluating products, look for the Cloudera Certified Technology logo and rest assured that these products have been tested, validated and certified to work with Cloudera products. See Cloudera Certified Technology Partners.
