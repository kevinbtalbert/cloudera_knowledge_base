Cloudera Partner Data Processing Addendum
This Partner Data Protection Addendum (“DPA”) forms part of and is incorporated into the Cloudera Partner Network Terms, Partnership Terms and Conditions, or similar contract, agreement, or legal document (“Agreement”) between Cloudera, Inc. and any Cloudera affiliates, and the Partner and any Partner affiliates.  Cloudera and Partner are each a “Party” and, together, “the Parties.”  This DPA forms a legally binding contract between Cloudera and Partner and applies to the extent that the Parties Process Personal Data for purposes of and pursuant to the Agreement.  This DPA shall prevail over any prior data protection addendum or similar agreement entered into by the Parties.
Whereas

Cloudera and Partner intend and agree to process Personal Data, as separate and independent Controllers, subject to the terms and conditions of this DPA, for their own respective purposes.
Cloudera and Partner have entered into this DPA to set out the framework for the Processing of Personal Data by the Parties, including the sharing of such data, each acting in the capacity as a Controller, and to define the procedures, obligations, responsibilities, liabilities, and rights of the Parties. 

1. Definitions
In relation to the Processing of Personal Data, the following terms, and their cognate words, shall have the same meaning as set forth and defined in and by Data Protection Law:
“Business”; “Collect”; “Consent”; “Consumer”; “Controller”; “Data Subject”; “Personal Data”; “Personal Data Breach”; “Personal Information”; “Process(es)” or “Processing”; “Processor”; “Recipient”; “Sell”; “Sensitive Personal Data”; “Service Provider”; “Share”; “Special categories of Personal Data”; and “Third party”.
The following terms shall have the meanings set forth below and cognate terms shall be construed in accordance with these definitions and Data Protection Law:
“Applicable Law” means any law, rule, or regulation to which a Party is subject.
“Data Protection Law” means all data protection and privacy laws, rules, and regulations (as may be amended, updated, superseded, or replaced from time to time) applicable to the Processing and protection of Personal Data under the Agreement and this DPA, including, among others, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC [General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)]; the United Kingdom Data Protection Act 2018; the Switzerland ​​Federal Act on Data Protection (“FADP”) and the revised FADP; the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018; the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act; Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act; the Australia Privacy Act 1988; Hong Kong’s Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance; Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act; and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, as well as any marketing, consumer protection, and data breach notification laws.
“Data Protection Authority” means the relevant or competent government or public authority in charge of regulating the Processing of Personal Data and enforcing Data Protection Law.
“Restricted Data Transfer” means any transfer of Personal Data from the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (UK) to a third country outside of any of those regions, countries, or jurisdictions that does not ensure an adequate level of data protection (e.g., a country without an “adequacy decision”) according to the respective governmental authority, including any Data Protection Authority.  A Restricted Data Transfer includes an onward transfer, i.e., a subsequent transfer of the Personal Data initially transferred outside the relevant jurisdictions.
“EU Standard Contractual Clauses (EU SCCs)” means Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
 
2. DPA Purpose, Scope, and Description of Processing
2.1.  Parties as Independent Controllers
Each Party shall act as an independent Controller with respect to the Processing of Personal Data under or pursuant to the Agreement.
2.2.  Purpose and Scope of the DPA
This DPA’s purpose is to ensure that the Processing of Personal Data by each Party, including, among other things, any transfer, sharing, transmission, or dissemination of Personal Data between the Parties, for the purposes set forth in section 2.3 of this DPA, complies with Data Protection Law.  This DPA shall govern such Processing.  The disclosure or sharing of Personal Data between the Parties for purposes of the Agreement shall not constitute a “sale” or “sharing” as those terms are defined under applicable Data Protection Law.
2.3.  Description of the Processing
Exhibit II of this DPA specifies the details of the Processing.  The Parties may make reasonable amendments to Exhibit II as the Parties reasonably consider necessary to meet requirements of Data Protection Law or explicit guidance or a direct mandate issued by a Data Protection Authority by executing a signed addendum.
 
3. Controller Obligations
3.1.  General Obligations
3.1.1. Each Party shall Process Personal Data in compliance with Data Protection Law and according to this DPA, unless required to do so otherwise by Applicable Law to which each or either Party is subject.  In particular, each Party shall obtain lawful consent of data subjects or establish a lawful basis for each Processing activity.

3.3.2.  of the categories of Personal Data Processed; and
3.3.3.  where the Party intends to make an onward transfer of the Personal Data to any third party/ies, of the recipient(s) or categories of recipients, the purpose(s) of such onward transfer(s), and the ground(s) of such transfer(s).
The foregoing shall not apply where the Data Subject already has the above information, including when such information has already been provided by the Party, or providing the information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort for that Party.  In the latter case, the Party shall, to the extent possible, make the information publicly available (such as through a privacy notice or statement).
3.4.  Data Accuracy and Data Minimization
3.4.1. Each Party shall ensure that the Personal Data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.  Having regard to the purpose(s) of Processing, each Party shall take every reasonable step to ensure that Personal Data that is inaccurate or incomplete is erased or rectified or made complete without delay.
3.4.2.  If a Party becomes aware that the Personal Data it has disclosed to the other Party is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the other Party without undue delay.
3.4.3.  Each Party shall ensure that the Personal Data is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose(s) of the Processing.
3.5.  Processing under the authority of the Controller

3.6.  Duration of Processing
Processing shall only take place for the duration specified in Exhibit II.
3.7  Direct Marketing
To the extent that a Party intends to Process the Personal Data for direct marketing, that Party shall do the following:
3.7.1 ensure that the appropriate types of any necessary consents have been obtained from the relevant Data Subjects or otherwise establish a lawful basis to allow the Personal Data to be used for direct marketing in compliance with Data Protection Law;
3.7.2 implement effective procedures and communications to allow a Data Subject to exercise the right to opt out from or object to direct marketing; and
3.7.3 implement effective procedures to enable the Party to notify relevant third parties of any Data Subject’s choice to opt-out of or object to such marketing.
 
4. Technical and Organizational Measures
4.1 Security Measures
Each Party shall implement technical and organizational measures to ensure the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Personal Data, including protecting such data against a Personal Data Breach.  In assessing the appropriate level of security, each Party shall take account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of Processing, and the risks of varying likelihood and severity for Data Subjects’ rights and freedoms.
4.2 Records
Each Party shall keep accurate records of the technical and organizational security measures which each Party has implemented and maintains, and each Party shall make such records available to the Data Protection Authority upon request.
 
5. Data Retention and Deletion
5.1 Retention
Each Party shall retain the Personal Data for no longer than is necessary to carry out the purpose(s) of Processing set forth in this DPA and do so in accordance with Data Protection Law.  Each Party shall implement appropriate technical or organizational measures to ensure compliance with this obligation, including appropriate data retention policies and procedures, and mechanisms to securely delete, erase, destroy,  dispose of, or anonymize the Personal Data.
Each Party may continue to retain the Personal Data in accordance with any statutory or professional retention periods applicable in their respective countries and/or industry, any documented backup policies and procedures, and/or as otherwise permitted by Data Protection Law.  During this retention period, the Party shall continue to treat the Personal Data in accordance with Data Protection Law and shall not Process such data for purposes other than those set forth in this DPA.
 
6. International Personal Data Transfers
If the Parties engage in cross-border transfers of Personal Data, they shall comply with Data Protection Law, including ensuring that the third country of destination has data protection requirements that are equivalent, comparable, or substantially similar to, or commensurate with, the Data Protection Law that governs the Personal Data and that Processing in the third country will not contravene said Data Protection Law.  Likewise, the Parties shall ensure that any onward transfer of the Personal Data to other third parties or third countries complies with the same requirements under the Data Protection Law.
In particular, if the Parties engage in a Restricted Data Transfer, the Parties shall ensure compliance with Data Protection Law by using a lawful transfer mechanism (e.g., the EU SCCs set forth in the Exhibits), provided that the conditions for the use of the transfer mechanism are met and that any required modifications are made.  Likewise, the Parties shall ensure that any onward transfer (of Personal Data that was part of the Restricted Data Transfer) to another party (such as to an affiliate or a Processor) complies with the conditions for lawful data transfers under Data Protection Law by using a lawful transfer mechanism.
 
7. Data Subjects 
7.1 General

7.1.2 In case of a dispute between a Data Subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with Data Protection Law, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a timely fashion.
7.1.3 Each Party shall, without undue delay, deal with any inquiries and requests it receives from Data Subjects relating to the Processing of their Personal Data and the exercise of their rights under Data Protection Law.  Each Party shall take appropriate measures to facilitate such inquiries, requests, and the exercise of Data Subjects’ rights.  Any information provided to the Data Subjects shall be in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.
7.1.4 Each Party shall, upon the Data Subject’s request, fulfill the rights request free of charge, unless otherwise permitted under Data Protection Law.

7.1.6 A Party may refuse a Data Subject’s request if Data Protection Law allows such refusal.  In this case, the Party shall inform the Data Subject of the reasons for the refusal and, if applicable, of the Data Subject’s right to contest the refusal and/or lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority and/or seek judicial redress.
7.2 Mutual Assistance
The Parties agree that the responsibility for complying with a Data Subject’s rights request belongs to the Party receiving such a request in respect of the Personal Data held by that Party.
However, the Parties shall provide each other reasonable assistance, as is necessary, to enable each Party to comply with their obligations to respond to Data Subjects’ requests to exercise their rights and to respond to any other queries or complaints from Data Subjects.  The Parties shall, as is necessary, keep each other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, reasonably cooperate in resolving them.
 
8. Compliance

9.2.3 The Party that has experienced the Personal Data Breach shall (A) document all relevant facts relating to the breach, including its effects and any remedial action taken, and keep a record thereof; and (B) notify the other Party of the breach with the information in 9.2.1., to the extent required by Data Protection Law or where such notification is reasonably necessary or appropriate given the relationship between the Parties and the nature and context of the Processing under this DPA.

Each Party shall inform the other Party if it is unable to comply with this DPA, for whatever reason.

11.4.1 Each Party shall be liable to the other Party for any damages it causes the other Party by any violation of this DPA.  Each Party’s (and each of its affiliate’s) liability, taken together in the aggregate, arising out of or related to this DPA, including without limitation under the EU SCCs, whether in contract, tort, or under any other theory of liability, is subject to the limitations and exclusions of liability under the Agreement, and any reference in such section(s) to the liability of a Party means the aggregate liability of that Party and all of its affiliates under the Agreement, this DPA, and the EU SCCs together.
11.4.2 Each Party shall be liable to a Data Subject if it violates the Data Subject’s rights in relation to this DPA and/or under Data Protection Law.  The Data Subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages, from the Party that causes(ed) the Data Subject by breaching the Data Subject’s rights under this DPA and/or Data Protection Law, to the extent permitted by Data Protection Law.

11.4.3 Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the Data Subject as a result of a violation of Data Protection Law in relation to this DPA, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally liable and the Data Subject is entitled to bring an action in a competent, independent court against any Party to the extent permitted by Data Protection Law.

11.4.3.1 The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph 11.4.3., it shall be entitled to claim back from the other Party that part of the compensation corresponding to its responsibility for the damage.

11.4.4 The liable Party or Party in breach may not invoke the conduct of a Processor or sub-processor to avoid its own liability.
11.5 Indemnification

12. General Terms
12.1 Amendments
12.1.1 From time to time, Cloudera may amend this DPA when it reasonably considers amendments to be necessary to address Data Protection Law or guidance or requirements issued by a Data Protection Authority.  Cloudera shall publish the updated DPA and, upon its publication, the updated DPA shall supersede and take precedence over the prior DPA. 
12.1.2 If Partner has any proposed changes to the DPA required by Data Protection law, it may notify Cloudera.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Parties shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith with a view to agreeing to and implementing the proposed amendments or alternatives, if required and appropriate, as soon as is reasonably practicable.  The Parties shall not unreasonably withhold or delay agreement to any consequential variations to this DPA that places a Party at risk of infringing Data Protection Law.
12.2 No Waivers
No failure or delay by a Party to exercise any right or remedy provided under this DPA or by Applicable Law or Data Protection Law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other remedy.  No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.
12.3 Hierarchy
In the event of any conflict or contradiction with respect to Processing of Personal Data between this DPA and related agreements, including the Agreement, this DPA shall prevail, except where explicitly agreed otherwise in writing and signed on behalf of by both Parties.
In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this DPA and the EU SCCs, the EU SCCs shall prevail.

12.5 Severance
Should an independent, competent court within a country, jurisdiction, or territory in which the Parties are subject to Data Protection Law deem any provision of this DPA to be invalid or unenforceable, then the remainder of the DPA shall remain valid and in force.  The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be either (A) amended as necessary to ensure its validity and enforceability, while preserving the Parties’ intentions as closely as possible; or (B), if this is not possible, construed in a manner as if the invalid or unenforceable part had never been contained therein.
 
13. Term
This DPA shall take effect on the date the Parties execute or enter into the Agreement and shall remain in effect for the term of the Agreement, or until terminated by a Party on ninety (90) days’ written notice to the other Party.
 
14. Data Controller - Data Processor Relationship
If the Partner has a direct contractual relationship with a customer or an end-customer that subscribes to Cloudera’s public cloud products (i.e., platform as a service) and said customer requires a data processing agreement between itself and the Partner, the Parties acknowledge that such circumstances may necessitate that the Parties execute a separate data processing addendum, with Partner acting as a Processor and Cloudera acting as a Sub-processor (i.e., the Partner’s Processor).  In such a case, the Parties shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith to execute an appropriate data processing addendum.
 
15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
15.1 Governing Law
The laws of the country or territory stipulated in the Agreement shall govern this DPA and all non-contractual or other obligations arising out of or in connection with it.

Exhibit VI - Switzerland Data Transfers
 
With respect to any transfer of Personal Data outside of Switzerland or of Personal Data governed by the Switzerland Federal Act on Data Protection (“FADP”) and, when applicable, the revised FADP (“revFADP”), to a third country (without an adequacy decision or its equivalent), the Parties agree that the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“EU SCCs”) in Exhibit IV of this DPA shall apply, subject to the following terms and conditions:

References: The terms “General Data Protection Regulation” or “Regulation (EU) 2016/679” as utilized in the EU SCCs shall be interpreted to include the FADP/revFADP.
Clause 13: Insofar as the Personal Data transfer is solely subject to the FADP/revFADP, the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) of Switzerland is the exclusive supervisory authority.  Insofar as the transfer of Personal Data is governed by both the GDPR and the FADP/revFADP, the competent supervisory authority with parallel supervision (in accordance with Annex I.C of the EU SCCs) is the FDPIC and the criteria of Clause 13(a) for the selection of the competent authority must be observed for the transfer governed by the GDPR.
Clause 17: The EU SCCs shall be governed by Swiss law, if the transfer is solely subject to the FADP/revFADP, or, in other cases, the law of one of the EU Member States, provided such Member State law allows for third-party beneficiary rights.

Clause 18(b): Disputes arising from the EU SCCs shall be resolved by the courts of Switzerland if the transfer is solely subject to the FADP/revFADP, or an EU Member State in other cases.
Clause 18(c): The term “Member State” must not be interpreted in such a way as to exclude data subjects in Switzerland from the possibility of suing for their rights in their place of habitual residence (Switzerland) in accordance with Clause 18(c) of the EU SCCs.
revFADP: The EU SCCs shall protect the data of legal entities until the entry into force of the revFADP.
