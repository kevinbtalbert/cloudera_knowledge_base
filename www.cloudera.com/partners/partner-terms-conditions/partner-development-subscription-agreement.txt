IF SUCH INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY OR DOES NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS OR CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN, HE OR SHE MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND PARTNER MAY NOT USE THE LICENSED SOFTWARE.
1. PURPOSE.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Cloudera will make the Licensed Software available to Partner free-of-charge, as a benefit of Partner’s membership in the Cloudera Partner Network (the “Program”), solely for the purposes of allowing Partner to (i) conduct internal training on the Licensed Software, (ii) develop Partner’s own products or items, such as connectors or accelerators, that permit or improve the interoperability of Partner’s own products with the Licensed Software (the “Partner Products”), (iii) test the Licensed Software for use with Partner Products, and (iv) demonstrate the Licensed Software to potential end customers  (the “Authorized Purposes”).   
2. DELIVERY; TRIAL LICENSE; RESTRICTIONS; FEEDBACK; OWNERSHIP.
2.1. Delivery.  Upon Partner’s acceptance of this Agreement, Cloudera will make the Licensed Software available to Partner. Any updates to the Licensed Software that Cloudera, in its sole discretion, makes available to Partner if and when available during the Agreement Term (as defined in Section 3 below) will also be considered Licensed Software under this Agreement.
2.2. License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Cloudera grants Partner, during the Agreement Term, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Licensed Software solely for the Authorized Purposes.  
2.3. Restrictions.  Unless otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, Partner agrees that it will not, nor will it permit or authorize any third party to (i) sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, sublicense, distribute, or provide third parties with access to, or the rights to use, the Licensed Software; (ii) use or host the Licensed Software to provide services for, or otherwise for the benefit of, third parties; (iii) use the Licensed Software for production purposes; (iv) publicly display, or otherwise make publicly available any portion of the Licensed Software; (v) bypass or attempt to avoid any process, system or software designed to manage or control access to the Licensed Software; (vi) modify, alter, translate or create derivative works of the Licensed Software; (vii) disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer or reverse assemble the Licensed Software, in whole or in part, or attempt to derive any source code or bypass any code obfuscation, except to the extent that Partner is entitled to do so by applicable law; (viii) modify, obscure, or remove any trademark, logo, copyright or other intellectual property rights notices included in or on the Licensed Software; (ix) publish any performance or benchmark tests or analysis relating to the Licensed Software or use them for competitive purposes; or (x) otherwise use or copy the Licensed Software in a manner not expressly permitted by this Agreement.
2.4. Ownership.  Cloudera and its licensors own and will retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Licensed Software and related documentation, including any and all Intellectual Property Rights therein and thereto.  Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Partner does not acquire any other rights, express or implied, in or to the Licensed Software.  CLOUDERA RESERVES ALL RIGHTS NOT EXPRESSLY GRANTED HEREUNDER.
3. TERM AND TERMINATION.  The term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and expires either (i) one year thereafter or (ii) on the date that Partner’s membership in the Program terminates or expires, whichever is first to occur (the “Agreement Term”), unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Section 3.  Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party if the other party is in material breach of any obligation under this Agreement. Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement, the rights and licenses granted to Partner under this Agreement will immediately terminate, and Partner must immediately cease using, and must return to Cloudera (or, at Cloudera’s request, delete or destroy), the Licensed Software and all other tangible items in Partner’s possession or control that contain Confidential Information provided to Partner under this Agreement.  The terms of Sections 2.3, 2.4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.
4. SUPPORT.  The Licensed Software is provided without any support except to the extent expressly set forth in Program policies or guides made available to Partner within the Partner Portal (the “Program Policies”) for specified Program membership levels. Any support that Cloudera may provide will be provided on a commercially reasonable basis subject to the availability of support resources.
5. THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE.  Partner acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Licensed Software may contain certain copyrighted, patented and/or otherwise legally protected software and/or material of third parties (“Third-Party Software”); and (ii) in addition to the terms of this Agreement, its use is further subject to the terms of third-party licenses applicable to such Third-Party Software, which may be licensed to Partner directly from the applicable third party.  Partner is advised to read such third-party license agreements prior to using the Licensed Software. If Partner does not agree to the terms of such third-party license agreements, Partner may not use the Third-Party Software and the Licensed Software may not function.  Partner acknowledges that Cloudera makes a list of Third-Party Software available to Partner (i) on Cloudera’s website, (ii) in the Licensed Software itself, the Licensed Software source code (if made available to Partner by Cloudera) and/or the third-party notice file that accompanies the Cloudera Product, and/or (iii) in another reasonable manner. Further, Partner acknowledges that such third-party suppliers may disclaim and make no representation or warranty with respect to such Third-Party Software and assume no liability for any claim that may arise with respect to such Third-Party Software or Partner’s use or inability to use the same.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OF THE TERMS IN THE THIRD-PARTY LICENSES, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT PARTNER MAY HAVE WITH CLOUDERA: (A) CLOUDERA PROVIDES THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE TO PARTNER AS-IS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND; (B) CLOUDERA DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; (C) CLOUDERA IS NOT LIABLE TO PARTNER FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE; AND (D) WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE, CLOUDERA IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES RELATED TO LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF INCOME, LOSS OF BUSINESS ADVANTAGE OR DAMAGE TO, OR UNAVAILABILITY, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA.
6. CONFIDENTIALITY.  “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed (whether in oral, written, or other tangible or intangible form) by Cloudera to Partner, its affiliates and their respective employees, contractors and agents concerning or related to this Agreement or Cloudera (whether before, on or after the Effective Date) which Partner knows or should know, due to the nature of the information and circumstances surrounding its disclosure, is confidential information of Cloudera. Additionally, any suggestions, comments, or other feedback that Partner provides to Cloudera specifically with respect to the Licensed Software (“Feedback”) will constitute Confidential Information of Cloudera, and Cloudera will be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license, and otherwise distribute and exploit the Feedback as it sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind on account of Intellectual Property Rights or otherwise.  Partner will, during the Agreement Term and thereafter, maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and will not use such Confidential Information except for the Authorized Purposes. Partner will use the same degree of care in protecting the Confidential Information as Partner uses to protect its own confidential information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than reasonable care. Confidential Information does not include information that Partner can demonstrate (i) was already known to Partner, without an obligation of confidentiality, at the time of disclosure; (ii) was generally available to the public at the time of disclosure to Partner; (iii) became generally available to the public after disclosure other than through any act or omission of Partner; (iv) was subsequently lawfully disclosed to Partner by a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; or (v) was independently developed by Partner without use of or reference to Confidential Information disclosed by Cloudera. Partner may disclose Confidential Information to the extent compelled to do so pursuant to a judicial or legislative order or proceeding; provided that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Partner provides to Cloudera prior notice of the intended disclosure and an opportunity to respond or object to the disclosure or, if prior notice is not permitted by applicable law, prompt notice of such disclosure; and provided further that Partner must limit the scope of Confidential Information that is disclosed to only that which is required to be disclosed by the applicable order or proceeding. 
7. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.  THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS.” CLOUDERA DOES NOT MAKE OR GIVE ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSED SOFTWARE.  CLOUDERA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT IT WILL BE FREE FROM DEFECTS OR ERRORS, OR THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL MEET ANY OR ALL OF PARTNER’S BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CLOUDERA EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT BASED ON COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE IN TRADE.
8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT WILL CLOUDERA BE LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES RELATED TO LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF INCOME, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS ADVANTAGE), WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RELATING TO OR ARISING FROM DAMAGE TO, OR UNAVAILABILITY, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF, DATA. CLOUDERA’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, PARTNER’S USE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER MATTER ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED US $1,000.00. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
9. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Governing Law.  This Agreement, and all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California, without reference to conflict of laws principles.  All such disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California, and the parties agree and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts.  The parties acknowledge that breach of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to Cloudera and that remedies at law may be insufficient.  As such, in addition to any and all remedies available at law, Cloudera will be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in the event of any alleged or actual breach of the terms hereof.
9.2. Assignment.  Partner may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder, directly or indirectly, by operation of law, merger, acquisition of stock or assets, or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Cloudera.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Entire Agreement; No Waiver; Severability.  This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings, and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to such subject matter. No waiver or modification of this Agreement will be valid unless made in a writing signed by both parties.  The waiver of a breach of any term hereof will in no way be construed as a waiver of any term or other breach hereof.  If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining terms will continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
9.5. Notices.  Legal notices to Cloudera under this Agreement must be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or via reputable overnight air courier addressed to Cloudera, Inc., 395 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94306, Attn: Legal Department.  Legal notices to Partner under this Agreement may be sent (i) by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or via reputable overnight air courier addressed to Partner’s address as set forth on its website, to the attention of its General Counsel; or (ii) by email, with read receipt requested, to the email address provided by Partner as part of the registration for the Program or the registration and/or download process for the Licensed Software.  Notices are effective five (5) days after posting if sent by registered or certified mail, upon confirmation of receipt if sent by overnight courier, or upon receipt by Cloudera of a read receipt if sent by email.  Either party may change its address for notification under this Agreement, by notifying the other party in accordance with this Section 9.5.

Treatment of Confidential Information.  The Receiving Party will, during the Subscription Term and for three years thereafter, use the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party that it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the Confidential Information disclosed is (a) the Disclosing Party’s trade secret, the Receiving Party will treat such information as Confidential Information for as long as the Confidential Information remains the Disclosing Party’s trade secret, or (b) required by law to be protected for a duration beyond that provided hereunder, the Receiving Party will maintain such information in confidence for the duration required by law.
6.3. Use; Disclosure.  Any Confidential Information will be used by the Receiving Party solely for the purpose of carrying out the Receiving Party’s rights and obligations under these Terms. In addition, the Receiving Party will not reproduce Confidential Information, in any form, except as required to accomplish the Receiving Party’s rights and obligations under these Terms. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent compelled to do so pursuant to a judicial or legislative order or proceeding; provided that (a) to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Receiving Party provides to the Disclosing Party prior notice of the intended disclosure and an opportunity to respond or object to the disclosure, or if prior notice is not permitted by applicable law, prompt notice of such disclosure, and (b) the Receiving Party must limit the scope of Confidential Information that is disclosed to only that which is required to be disclosed by the applicable order or proceeding.
6.4. Remedy for Breach.  The parties agree that damages may be an inadequate remedy in the event of a breach of this Section 6. Therefore, each party is entitled, in addition to any other rights and remedies otherwise available, to seek injunctive and other equitable relief in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Section 6 by the other party.

10. GENERAL.
10.1. Diagnostics and Reporting.  Partner acknowledges that the Services include diagnostic functionality as the default configuration. The diagnostic function collects configuration files, software versions, log files and other information regarding the Partner Environment and use of those elements of Cloudera Online Services that are deployed in the Partner Environment, and reports that information to Cloudera for use in proactively identifying potential issues with the Services, to enhance the usability of the Services, and for other internal Cloudera purposes. While Partner may elect to change the diagnostic function of the Services in order to disable regular automatic reporting, Partner agrees that, up to once per quarter, if requested by Cloudera, it will run the diagnostic function and report the results to Cloudera. For purposes of clarity, the diagnostic functionality described in this Section 10.1 does not include metering capabilities within the Services which Cloudera uses to determine Partner’s usage for billing purposes.  Partner may not disable, tamper with, or otherwise alter any such metering capabilities within the Services.
10.2. Assignment.  Neither these Terms nor any rights or duties thereunder may be transferred, assigned or delegated by Partner, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Cloudera, and any attempted transfer, assignment or delegation without such consent will be void and without effect; provided, however, that Partner may assign these Terms, including all of its rights and duties thereunder, to any of its Affiliates upon written notice to Cloudera if such Affiliate agrees in writing to assume all of Partner’s obligations, and such Affiliate is, in the sole judgment of Cloudera, adequately capitalized and credit-worthy. Cloudera may freely transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms or its rights and obligations thereunder. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective representatives, heirs, administrators, successors and permitted assigns.
10.3. Section Headings.  The section headings contained in these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not, in any way, affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.
10.4. Severability.  If any provision of these Terms are held to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) all other provisions will nonetheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by these Terms are not affected in any manner adverse to either party, and (ii) the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify these Terms so as to give effect to the original intent of the parties as closely as possible.
10.5. Waiver.  The failure of a party to enforce any provision or exercise any right under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such provision or right and will not preclude such party from enforcing such provision or exercising such right at any later time.
10.6. Modifications; Amendments.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth in these Terms, no modification, addition, deletion, or waiver of any rights under these Terms will be binding on a party unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party.

Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California, and the parties expressly consent to personal jurisdiction and venue therein.
10.8. Dispute Resolution; Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.  In any action to enforce these Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees from the non-prevailing party.
10.9. Notices.  Legal notices to Cloudera under these Terms must be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or via reputable overnight air courier addressed to Cloudera, Inc., 395 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94306, Attn: Legal Department.  Legal notices to Partner under these Terms may be sent (i) by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or via reputable overnight air courier addressed to Partner’s address as set forth on its website, to the attention of its General Counsel; or (ii) by email, with read receipt requested, to the email address provided by Partner as part of its registration for the Program or the registration for the Services.  Notices are effective five (5) days after posting if sent by registered or certified mail, upon confirmation of receipt if sent by overnight courier, or upon receipt by Cloudera of a read receipt if sent by email. Either party may change its address for notification under these Terms, by notifying the other party in accordance with this Section 10.9.   
10.10. Entire Agreement.  These Terms set forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, negotiations, conversations, discussions, and understandings, written or oral, with respect to such subject matter and all past dealing or industry custom. These Terms will prevail over any additional, conflicting, or inconsistent terms or conditions which may appear on any purchase order furnished by Partner, and any such terms on a Partner purchase order will have no force or effect, notwithstanding Cloudera’s acceptance or execution of such purchase order.
10.11. No Third-Party Beneficiaries.  There are no third-party beneficiaries under these Terms.
10.12. Force Majeure.  Neither party will be liable to the other, including for any delay or failure to perform, due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, riots, strikes or labor disputes, embargoes, government orders, terrorist acts, and denial of service, virus, or hacking attacks.
10.13. Independent Contractors.  The relationship between the parties established under these Terms is that of independent contractors, and nothing in These Terms will be construed to create an employment, partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between the parties.

Each party acknowledges and agrees that no payment or gift of money or anything of value has been or will be offered, authorized, promised, provided or paid, directly or indirectly, to any government official, state-owned enterprise official, public international organization official, political party official (or candidate for such office) or political party for the purpose of influencing official acts or decisions (including failures to act or decide) in order to assist the other party in obtaining or retaining an improper business advantage. Each party will promptly notify the other party if it receives a request to take any action which may violate its obligations under this Section 10.14.
10.15. Export Control.  The Services and Cloudera Open-Source Software may be subject to export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. Partner agrees to comply with all export and import laws and regulations of the United States and other applicable jurisdictions.  Without limiting the foregoing, (a) Partner represents and warrants that it is not listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties or located in (or a national of) a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country, (b) Partner will not (and will not permit any third parties to) access or use the Services in violation of any U.S. export embargo, prohibition or restriction, and (c) Partner will not submit to the Services any information that is controlled under the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the Confidential Information disclosed is (a) the Disclosing Party’s trade secret, the Receiving Party will treat such information as Confidential Information for as long as the Confidential Information remains the Disclosing Party’s trade secret, or (b) required by law to be protected for a duration beyond that provided hereunder, the Receiving Party will maintain such information in confidence for the duration required by law.
6.4 Use; Disclosure. Any Confidential Information will be used by the Receiving Party solely for the purpose of carrying out the Receiving Party’s rights and obligations under these Terms. In addition, the Receiving Party will not reproduce Confidential Information, in any form, except as required to accomplish the Receiving Party’s rights and obligations under these Terms. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent compelled to do so pursuant to a judicial or legislative order or proceeding; provided that (a) to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Receiving Party provides to the Disclosing Party prior notice of the intended disclosure and an opportunity to respond or object to the disclosure, or if prior notice is not permitted by applicable law, prompt notice of such disclosure, and (b) the Receiving Party must limit the scope of Confidential Information that is disclosed to only that which is required to be disclosed by the applicable order or proceeding.
6.5 Remedy for Breach. The parties agree that damages may be an inadequate remedy in the event of a breach of this Section 6.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL CLOUDERA BE LIABLE TO PARTNER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA OR USE OF DATA, ANY INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, PREVIEW SERVICES, PARTNER TRANSACTION DATA, OR PARTNER SAMPLE DATA, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE.  IN NO EVENT WILL CLOUDERA'S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF ONE THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($1,000.00 USD). THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
10. GENERAL.
10.1 Diagnostics and Reporting. Partner acknowledges that the Services include diagnostic functionality as the default configuration. The diagnostic function collects configuration files, software versions, log files and other information regarding the Partner Environment and use of those elements of Cloudera Online Services that are deployed in the Partner Environment, and reports that information to Cloudera for use in proactively identifying potential issues with the Services, to enhance the usability of the Services, and for other internal Cloudera purposes. While Partner may elect to change the diagnostic function of the Services in order to disable regular automatic reporting, Partner agrees that, up to once per quarter, if requested by Cloudera, it will run the diagnostic function and report the results to Cloudera. For purposes of clarity, the diagnostic functionality described in this Section 10.1 does not include metering capabilities within the Services which Cloudera uses to determine Partner’s usage for billing purposes.  Partner may not disable, tamper with or otherwise alter any such metering capabilities within the Services.
10.2 Assignment. Neither these Terms nor any rights or duties thereunder may be transferred, assigned or delegated by Partner, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Cloudera, and any attempted transfer, assignment or delegation without such consent will be void and without effect; provided, however, that Partner may assign these Terms, including all of its rights and duties thereunder, to any of its Affiliates upon written notice to Cloudera if such Affiliate agrees in writing to assume all of Partner’s obligations, and such Affiliate is, in the sole judgment of Cloudera, adequately capitalized and credit-worthy. Cloudera may freely transfer, assign or delegate these Terms or its rights and obligations thereunder. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective representatives, heirs, administrators, successors and permitted assigns.
10.3 Section Headings. The section headings contained in these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not, in any way, affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.
10.4 Severability. If any provision of these Terms are held to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) all other provisions will nonetheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by these Terms are not affected in any manner adverse to either party, and (ii) the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify these Terms so as to give effect to the original intent of the parties as closely as possible.
10.5 Waiver. The failure of a party to enforce any provision or exercise any right under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such provision or right and will not preclude such party from enforcing such provision or exercising such right at any later time.
10.6 Modifications; Amendments. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in these Terms, no modification, addition, deletion or waiver of any rights under these Terms will be binding on a party unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party.
10.7 Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. These Terms are governed by and will be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California, and the parties expressly consent to personal jurisdiction and venue therein.
10.8 Dispute Resolution; Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. In any action to enforce these Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees from the non-prevailing party.
10.9 Notices. Legal notices to Cloudera under these Terms must be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or via reputable overnight air courier addressed to Cloudera, Inc., 395 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94306, Attn: Legal Department.  Legal notices to Partner under these Terms may be sent (i) by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or via reputable overnight air courier addressed to Partner’s address as set forth on its website, to the attention of its General Counsel; or (ii) by email, with read receipt requested, to the email address provided by Partner as part of its registration for the Program or the registration for the Services.  Notices are effective five (5) days after posting if sent by registered or certified mail, upon confirmation of receipt if sent by overnight courier, or upon receipt by Cloudera of a read receipt if sent by email. Either party may change its address for notification under these Terms, by notifying the other party in accordance with this Section 10.9.   
10.10 Entire Agreement.  These Terms set forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, negotiations, conversations, discussions and understandings, written or oral, with respect to such subject matter and all past dealing or industry custom. These Terms will prevail over any additional, conflicting or inconsistent terms or conditions which may appear on any purchase order furnished by Partner, and any such terms on a Partner purchase order will have no force or effect, notwithstanding Cloudera’s acceptance or execution of such purchase order.
10.11 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. There are no third-party beneficiaries under these Terms.
10.12 Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable to the other, including for any delay or failure to perform, due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, riots, strikes or labor disputes, embargoes, government orders, terrorist acts, and denial of service, virus or hacking attacks.
10.13 Independent Contractors. The relationship between the parties established under these Terms is that of independent contractors, and nothing in These Terms will be construed to create an employment, partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between the parties. Neither party will have any right or authority to assume or create any obligations or to make any representations or warranties on behalf of any other party, whether express or implied, or to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever.
10.14  Anti-Corruption. Each party will comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and all other applicable anti-corruption laws. Each party acknowledges and agrees that no payment or gift of money or anything of value has been or will be offered, authorized, promised, provided or paid, directly or indirectly, to any government official, state-owned enterprise official, public international organization official, political party official (or candidate for such office) or political party for the purpose of influencing official acts or decisions (including failures to act or decide) in order to assist the other party in obtaining or retaining an improper business advantage. Each party will promptly notify the other party if it receives a request to take any action which may violate its obligations under this Section 10.14.
10.15 Export Control. The Services and Cloudera Open Source Software may be subject to export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. Partner agrees to comply with all export and import laws and regulations of the United States and other applicable jurisdictions.  Without limiting the foregoing, (a) Partner represents and warrants that it is not listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties or located in (or a national of) a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country, (b) Partner will not (and will not permit any third parties to) access or use the Services in violation of any U.S. export embargo, prohibition or restriction, and (c) Partner will not submit to the Services any information that is controlled under the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations. 
10.16 Federal Government End Use Provisions. If Partner is a United States government entity, or these Terms otherwise become subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Partner acknowledges and agrees that the Services and all Cloudera Technology provided hereunder are provided as “commercial items,” “commercial computer software,” “commercial computer software documentation”  and “technical data” (as such terms are defined in the FAR) with the same rights and restrictions as are customarily provided by Cloudera to its customers and Partners generally, as set forth in these Terms. This is in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and FAR 2.212 (Software) and, for Department of Defense transactions, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data Commercial Items) and DFAR 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Commercial Computer Software Documentation).
