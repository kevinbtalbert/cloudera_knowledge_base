      Why choose Powered by Cloudera
      




Over the years, enterprise application vendors have built solutions aimed at solving specific business problems, utilizing data to enable organizations to be more information-driven. However, with data generated rapidly by various sources in high volume, enterprise application vendors are experiencing many new challenges. Cloudera’s Commercial Use program solves these common problems faced by enterprise application vendors:

Current data management platforms are unable to access, store, and analyze large volumes of multi-structured data
Mandates to store and access data over a longer period of time has placed a burden on keeping COGS down
Infrastructure platforms embedded in enterprise applications get outdated due to the rapid change of the data management landscape






































    
    
      Advantages
      




As a member of the ‘Powered by Cloudera’ Commercial Use Program, enterprise vendors can:

Increase the value of their application – Extend the strategic relevance of your applications by collecting and storing more data and more types of data in full fidelity while removing data silos
Provide a single platform to access all your data - Enable any types of access and analysis (Batch processing, SQL, streaming, machine learning, etc.) through the support of multi-genre workloads
Reduce cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) – Reduce design and management costs while benefiting from 10-100 times performance improvement
Eliminate integration and design complexity – Focus on the business, not the design, integration, and maintenance of the platform infrastructure
Lower the risk of application obsolescence – Extend application design and deployment with massively scalable architecture and support for multiple types of workloads
