      Why Cloudera + Capgemini?
      




Technology solutions alone cannot solve big data challenges, leaving many companies struggling to adapt and evolve to “new normal” architectures and governance processes. Together with their ecosystem of partners, Capgemini and Cloudera are delivering end-to-end big data solutions that will help organizations achieve significant additional value from their data with  relatively low capital investment.









 
















Addressing real business challenges such as managing the evolution of the Customer Experience or the impact of IoT requires Big Data.  Partnering closely with Cloudera allows us to accelerate the execution of Big Data projects.
Manuel Sevilla, Capgemini CTO for Insights and Data












      
       
      Joint Solution Overview
      




Industrializing the transition from legacy to modern enterprise architecture using accelerators and automation
Capgemini's Leap Data Transformation Framework enables large organizations to transform their legacy BI systems to optimize the modern big data architecture. By consolidating fragmented BI systems into a modern unified data landscape, organizations can obtain greater business value from their data.
Although the transformation to next-generation data landscapes brings many benefits, this needs to be done carefully with particular attention at the optimization and automation phases of the transformation process. This means finding the most efficient strategies possible for assessment of existing applications, decommissioning outdated technologies, promoting user adoption, performing regression testing, and so on.
Capgemini is a leader in helping clients identify optimal data strategies. And now, Capgemini has created a comprehensive Leap Data Transformation Framework, industrializing that leadership to help clients make the transformation from traditional BI and reporting capabilities to the Business Data Lake, in a low risk, predictable, repeatable and cost-effective manner.
Capgemini’s Leap Data Transformation Framework modules accelerate all phases of the transformation lifecycle to big data architectures by industrializing every aspect of transitioning existing BI assets and capabilities to next-generation big data management platforms.
The Leap Data Transformation Framework is certified by Cloudera because of proven results with Capgemini and Cloudera clients: one of Capgemini’s largest implementations of Cloudera Enterprise used the Leap Data Transformation Framework to reduce the transition effort to modern data architecture by over 30%.

Insights-Driven Operations with SAP HANA & Cloudera Enterprise 
Collaborating with SAP® and Intel, Cloudera and Capgemini have created a reference architecture, integrating all the components needed to put “Insights at the point of action.” We have designed an innovative reference architecture that can enable real-time integration with business processes and operational systems through SAP HANA’s link with SAP Business Suite. This allows companies to benefit from high-performance computing, combined with optimized total cost of ownership (TCO) and scalability that Cloudera provides.
With the integration of SAP HANA and Cloudera Enterprise, it is now possible to look at the net new value that can be brought to business operations by bridging the gap between transactions and analytics. This solution is designed to support both the new Internet of things and connected people applications, and to keep improving your existing landscape.
In addition to extending the scope of data, this solution gives you access to new analytical capabilities (machine learning, long-term signal detection on the longest history of data). Training these algorithms on additional data results in more accurate predictions, and more accurate preventative actions helps to retain your most valuable customers.

Enterprise Data Hub Accelerator
The Enterprise Data Hub Accelerator helps organizations execute their first Big Data projects quickly and effectively by providing a clear and complete roadmap on how to scale the data platform, governance, and analytics. This roadmap becomes part of a full enterprise-wide Big Data strategy to aid business transformation.
The Enterprise Data Hub Accelerator addresses organizations’ needs to better understand where they should start with Big Data implementations, how to ensure success and value creation for their business users, and how to guarantee that the choices made will scale long term.
The solution combines Cloudera’s open-source, enterprise data management platform, with Capgemini’s best practices in Information Strategy and Transformation. Cloudera provides one centralized platform to manage all data in an agile and cost-efficient way so it can be integrated flexibly with existing infrastructure and tools. Capgemini works with the customer to identify business drivers, transform information governance, and rethink analytics processes through a clearly defined roadmap that helps organizations define what they should do when.

Data Optimization for the Enterprise
Data Optimization for the Enterprise is a service offering that helps organizations achieve significant additional value from their data in return for a relatively low capital investment. Clients can take full advantage of Cloudera’s big data technology to optimize the ratio between the value of data and its storage costs, while also gaining extended capabilities to handle complex data.
Cloudera’s expertise in optimizing existing Data Warehouse architectures using Hadoop complements Capgemini’s broader view of these analytical landscapes—from the variety of source systems (internal or external) to the interfaces (business applications) that expose the data in the form of practical insights for your business users.
Data Optimization for the Enterprise is the fast, cost-effective way to start getting full value from your data.
