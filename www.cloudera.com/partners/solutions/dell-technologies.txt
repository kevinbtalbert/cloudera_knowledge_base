Security, Risk, and Compliance












      
      
      Challenge
      
      





Improving regulatory compliance.








      
      
      Solution
      
      





Today, the world’s most innovative enterprises unlock value from their data and compete in the data age with the most valuable and transformative business use cases like predictive maintenance, genomics research, and real-time compliance monitoring.
These use cases require multiple analytics workloads and data science tools and machine learning algorithms to run against the same diverse datasets. However, many businesses still struggle with limited data visibility and insufficient insights, often caused by 

Analytic workloads running independently—in silos—because even newer cloud data warehouses and data science tools were never designed to work together
Data being everywhere—in data centers, public clouds, and at the Edge—and companies have no practical way to run analytics or apply machine learning algorithms to all their data
An incoherent approach to data privacy or IP protection—often resulting in onerous controls that limit business productivity and increase costs










 


















Government Solutions












      
      
      Challenge
      
      





Government agencies are faced with a multitude of challenges, including aging legacy systems, fraud and abuse, and sophisticated Cyberattacks. 








      
      
      Solution
      
      





Dell and Cloudera combine to provide a proven platform that can securely manage their data. Dell and Cloudera Government Solutions addresses these challenges by simplifying data acquisition and delivery—providing public sector leaders with the insights they need to make better and more timely decisions.
