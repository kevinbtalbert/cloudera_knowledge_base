      Why Cloudera + Deloitte?
      




Deloitte and Cloudera work together to jointly enhance our clients’ ability to derive actionable insights from their data. Together, we can address new business problems and drive more business value from customers’ data. Our alliance combines Cloudera’s industry-leading distribution of Apache Hadoop with Deloitte’s recognized leadership in analytics and technology services.









 
















Through our relationship with Cloudera, our clients are now better positioned to produce enhanced insights to drive more informed and differentiating business decisions.
Marc Zimmerman, Global FSI Analytics Leader, Deloitte Consulting LLP












      
       
      Joint Solution Overview
      




Enhancing central counterparty clearing (CCP) risk
Agent-based modeling (ABM) for central counterparty clearing risk is a bottom-up approach to the modeling of complex and adaptive systems with heterogeneous agents.  This model's emergent behaviors in the financial markets, which is particularly useful when simulating stressed scenarios or default events.
This ABM model is implemented jointly with Simudyne, a simulation software company, and Cloudera. Together, the solution combines a state-of-the-art CCP market model with an easy-to-customize, highly scalable, cloud-enabled platform for market participants to quickly and easily evaluate the implications of any proposed changes to the CCP’s risk management frameworks.

Insurance Claims Subrogation
Deloitte and Cloudera’s Insurance Claims Subrogation Solution uses advanced quantitative modeling, sentiment analytics and Cloudera’s Enterprise Data Hub (EDH) to enable a highly effective process for identifying claims that should be investigated for subrogation. By isolating those claims that statistically present the best opportunities for recovery, we are enabling our joint clients to dramatically improve financial performance with the least amount of time and cost.

Customer Next Best Offer
Deloitte and Cloudera’s Customer Next Best Offer accelerator uses Cloudera technology to perform pattern analysis and gain insights about customer behaviors to enable clients to appropriately and efficiently fit future product and service offerings to their customers on a highly individualized basis. The accelerator can improve prospects for business growth and increase overall customer satisfaction through more effective digital marketing campaigns and call center communications.

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)
Deloitte has developed a CCAR solution utilizing Cloudera Enterprise for data management that can offer cost savings for banks. The expected savings in software license and data management costs potentially exceed the costs of migrating your CCAR models. In addition, Deloitte has developed a number of tools and accelerators that help reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating your models to this new and more cost-effective open-source environment that can be provisioned on-premises or in the cloud.
