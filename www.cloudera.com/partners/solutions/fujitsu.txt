Fujitsu







 








      
       
      Why Cloudera + Fujitsu?
      




The partnership between Cloudera and Fujitsu ensures that customers have access to flexible deployment options, including entry level appliance and scale out rack solutions on premise and in the cloud. Guaranteed compatibility of components enable customers to smoothly establish powerful frameworks that process and analyze Big Data. Fujitsu’s Hadoop-based strategic approach makes data of all types – both structured and unstructured – easier to effectively integrate and manage. A ‘centralized architectural model’ provides functionality for analysis, search and alerting and for combing through Big Data in search of actionable analytics – information that can be used commercially.









 
















The broad and active utilization of big data requires the empowerment of business users and citizens by tools answering their questions and interests in a self-service way. Such environments will unveil huge values from big data and will help to democratize the access to information.
Dr. Fritz Schinkel, Fujitsu, Distinguished Engineer, Head of Big Data Competence Center
