      Overview
      





      
       
      Why Cloudera + Google Cloud?
      





Imagine running Cloudera’s enterprise data platform on a platform built for Google-scale challenges. With Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) on Google Cloud, you can do just that. Google Cloud offers a rich suite of services across compute, storage, big data, networking, and management that can be mixed and matched to meet individual needs. These services can strengthen Cloudera deployments because each is offered with a focus on scalability, performance, security, and support.
Google customers can deploy CDP on Google Cloud opening up new business opportunities for both Cloudera and Google
Finding hidden patterns in data can mean the difference between being a market leader or falling behind. Businesses have too much data and not enough time to analyze it. To stay ahead of the competition, unlocking real-time insights from data is critical. CDP Data Hub on Google Cloud allows companies to get positive business results fast with instant access to quality data on a scalable, open source, enterprise data cloud platform.
Cloudera Data Platform on Google Cloud uses Cloudera’s Shared Data Experience (SDX), to create secure data lakes in an organization’s Google Cloud account and provision analytic and machine learning services in minutes instead of weeks. It replaces tedious scripting with ‘set it and forget it’ convenience. With CDP on Google Cloud, companies can easily migrate existing data pipelines to Google Cloud or quickly set up new ones that can ingest data from a number of existing or new data sources.










The pace of our digital transformation has accelerated exponentially this past year. Participating in an early test of Cloudera Data Platform on Google Cloud has been helpful in showing us how the combination of the two could deliver the speed and agility required by the business without compromising on data security or governance.”
Nico Wolf, Chapter Lead, Big Data Platform Engineering, Commerzbank
