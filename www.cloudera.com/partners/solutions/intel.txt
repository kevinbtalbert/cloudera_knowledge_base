      Overview
      





      
       
      Any Cloud, Any Analytics, Any Data
      





Insights powered by diverse and exploding data sources are the currency of modern digital business.
To expand data analytics capacity, enterprises need an end-to-end strategy that addresses inefficiencies in the data pipeline, optimizing software, hardware, and libraries at every stage of the data lifecycle (ingest, prepare, model, deploy). Intel innovation powers the kind of transformation that enterprise IT infrastructure needs to support the demands of analytics-powered digital business and rapidly advance to next-generation AI and HPC workloads.
By uniting the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) with the data center architecture based on Intel® Xeon® technology, this becomes a faster way to achieve a true hybrid data platform designed for unmatched freedom to choose—any cloud, any analytics, any data.















Intel and Cloudera have collaborated for years to provide a high-performing and open platform for data analytics across on-prem, private, or public cloud deployments. Our partnership has provided organizations with the ability to embrace their most critical data, thereby accelerating insights to drive digital transformation.
— Janet George, Intel Corporate Vice President and General Manager, Cloud and Enterprise Solutions

Deploying private clouds












      
      
      Challenge
      
      





Businesses can’t extract value from the data they generate because of the prevalence of data and analytics silos. They struggle with limited data visibility and insufficient insights.  As data grows and analytics workloads increase accordingly, infrastructure cannot scale appropriately and storage requirements often outpace compute needs, so the ability to scale these resources independently is crucial to data center efficiency.
Private clouds can address many of these challenges by allowing different analytic applications to work together at their source while maintaining strict enterprise security, governance, and control across all environments.








      
      
      Solution
      
      





Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) running on Intel technologies delivers an end-to-end analytics platform that supports hybrid and multi-cloud environments and eliminates costly and inefficient data silos. It is open source, with open compute and storage, ensuring no vendor lock-in and maximum interoperability.









 


















Optimizing data pipelines












      
      
      Challenge
      
      





Obtaining key insights from incoming and existing data has always been a challenge for organizations. Only a fraction of the data that is received is stored, and even less is used for generating value. That leaves a huge amount of unused data that can’t be used in say fraud detection or improving customer experience.
Data pipelines can ingest and store more of this data and help turn them into insights. However, they can be complex to build as they interact with many applications and most parts of the infrastructure in the data center.








      
      
      Solution
      
      





Cloudera and Intel provide joint solutions for building a modern and open data pipeline that spans the ingest to analyze phases. Intel technologies optimized with Cloudera software provide a clear choice for data-intensive workloads. ​​









 


















Machine learning and predictive analytics












      
      
      Challenge
      
      





Many enterprises would like to make more data-driven decisions, but their analytics solutions are not ideal, whether they are not fast enough, work with poor quality data or don’t use the right models. This means that they can’t understand their customer better which is the biggest challenge most enterprises face.
An approach to dealing with these challenges is adopting more predictive analytics and machine learning solutions. This means better recommendation engines, customer analytics, risk management, and segmentation. They help organizations stay competitive by identifying opportunities and embracing digital transformation.








      
      
      Solution
      
      





Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) using Intel technologies like accelerators, libraries, and instruction sets enable several of these predictive analytics and machine learning workloads. There are also innovative, open-source technologies that are a part of the overall solution.
