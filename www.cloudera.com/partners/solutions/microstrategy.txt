Cloudera and MicroStrategy
MicroStrategy, a leader in business intelligence (BI) technology, and Cloudera together offer a connector that empowers organizations to extract and deliver valuable insights from massive volumes of structured and unstructured data. By providing sophisticated yet familiar reporting and analysis tools on top of Apache Hadoop, business users can quickly and easily unlock the potential of their data to make better business decisions.






 










 







      
       
      About MicroStrategy
      




A global leader in business intelligence technology, MicroStrategy provides integrated reporting, analysis, and monitoring software that enables companies to analyze the data stored across their enterprise to make better business decisions. MicroStrategy’s business intelligence platform delivers actionable information to business users via e-mail, web, and mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and BlackBerry. Companies choose MicroStrategy for its ease-of-use, sophisticated analytics, and superior data and user scalability.











      
       
      Joint Solution Overview
      




Easy-to-use business intelligence for Apache Hadoop
Cloudera and MicroStrategy have collaborated to develop a powerful and easy-to-use BI framework for Apache Hadoop by creating a connection between MicroStrategy 9 and CDH. This connection is established via an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver for Apache Hive and is available as the Cloudera Connector for MicroStrategy.
The connector allows business users to perform sophisticated point and clickanalytics on data stored in Hadoop directly from MicroStrategy applications – just as they do on data stored in data warehouses, data marts and operational databases. Users can run queries via MicroStrategy’s visual interface without the need to write unfamiliar HiveQL or MapReduce scripts. In essence, any user, without programming skill in Hadoop, can ask questions against vast volumes of structured and unstructured data to gain valuable business insights.
