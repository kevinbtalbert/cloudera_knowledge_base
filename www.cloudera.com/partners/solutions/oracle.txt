Why Cloudera + Oracle?
For over 38 years Oracle has been the market leader of RDMBS database systems and a major influencer of enterprise software and hardware technology. Besides leading the industry in database solutions, Oracle also develops tools for software development, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, supply chain management, business intelligence, and data warehousing.  Cloudera has a long standing relationship with Oracle and has worked closely to develop enterprise class solutions that enable enterprise customers to quickly manage with big data workloads.










 



 







 















As the leader in Apache Hadoop-based data platforms, Cloudera has the enterprise quality and expertise that make them the right choice to work with on Oracle Big Data Appliance.
Andy Mendelson, Senior Vice President, Oracle Server Technologies






 














    
    
      Joint Solution Overview
      





Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure combines the elasticity and utility of public cloud with the granular control, security, and predictability of on-premises infrastructure to deliver high-performance, high availability and cost-effective infrastructure services. Customers of Cloudera and Oracle can run Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub deployments in the Oracle cloud, leveraging the power of Bare Metal compute instances and high performance local storage to drive flexible, scalable, and performant clusters in an automated fashion using Terraform on OCI.
Oracle Big Data Appliance
The Oracle Big Data Appliance is an engineered system optimized for acquiring, organizing, and loading unstructured data into Oracle Database 12c. The Oracle Big Data Appliance includes CDH, Oracle NoSQL Database, Oracle Data Integrator with Application Adapter for Apache Hadoop, Oracle Loader for Hadoop, an open source distribution of R, Oracle Linux, and Oracle Java HotSpot Virtual Machine.
Exelon Consolidates Big Data Analytics on Oracle
Big Data Cloud Service 
Big Data Cloud Service is a Cloudera Certified, automated cloud service that provides a high-powered environment tailor-made for advancing businesses’ analytical capabilities. With automated lifecycle management and one-click security, Big Data Cloud Service is designed to optimally and securely run a wide variety of big data workloads and technologies (incl. CDH, Apache Kafka and Apache Spark) while simplifying operations.
Oracle Big Data Discovery
Oracle Big Data Discovery is the visual face of Hadoop that allows anyone to find, explore, transform, and analyze data in Hadoop. Discover new insights, then share results with big data project teams and business stakeholders.  
Oracle NoSQL Database
Oracle NoSQL Database Enterprise Edition is a distributed, highly scalable, key-value database. Unlike competitive solutions, Oracle NoSQL Database is easy-to-install, configure and manage, supports a broad set of workloads, and delivers enterprise-class reliability backed by enterprise-class Oracle support.
Oracle Data Integrator Enterprise Edition
Oracle Data Integrator Enterprise Edition is a comprehensive data integration platform that covers all data integration requirements: from high-volume, high-performance batch loads, to event-driven, trickle-feed integration processes. Oracle Data Integrator Enterprise Edition (ODI EE) provides native Cloudera integration allowing the use of the Cloudera Hadoop Cluster as the transformation engine for all data transformation needs. ODI EE utilizes Cloudera’s foundation of Impala, Hive, HBase, Sqoop, Pig, Spark as well as many others, to provide best in class performance and value. Oracle Data Integrator Enterprise Edition enhances productivity and provides a simple user interface for creating high performance to load and transform data to and from Cloudera data stores.
Oracle GoldenGate
Oracle GoldenGate is a comprehensive software package for real-time data integration and data replication in heterogeneous IT environments. Oracle GoldenGate enables high availability solutions, real-time messaging, transactional change data capture, data replication, transformations, and verification between operational and analytical enterprise systems. Oracle GoldenGate for Big Data streams transaction data into big data systems in real time, without impacting the performance of source systems. Oracle GoldenGate for Big Data provides native Cloudera integration to HDFS, Hive, HBase, Flume, Kafka as well as many others, which provides best in class performance and value to Big Data and Data Science systems. 
In addition, Oracle provides the Management Pack for Oracle GoldenGate, a visual management and monitoring solution for Oracle GoldenGate deployments as well as Oracle GoldenGate Veridata, which allows high-speed, high-volume data validation and repair between two data stores.
Oracle Loader for Hadoop
Oracle Loader for Hadoop enables customers to use Hadoop MapReduce processing to create optimized data sets for efficient loading and analysis in Oracle Database 12c. Unlike other Hadoop loaders, it generates Oracle internal formats to load data faster and use less database system resources.
Oracle R Enterprise
Oracle R Enterprise integrates the open-source statistical environment R with Oracle Database 12c. Analysts and statisticians can run existing R applications and use the R client directly against data stored in Oracle Database 12c, vastly increasing scalability, performance and security. The combination of Oracle Database 12c and R delivers an enterprise-ready deeply-integrated environment for advanced analytics.
Oracle NoSQL Database, Oracle Data Integrator Application Adapter for Hadoop, Oracle Loader for Hadoop, and Oracle R Enterprise will be available both as standalone software products independent of the Oracle Big Data Appliance.
