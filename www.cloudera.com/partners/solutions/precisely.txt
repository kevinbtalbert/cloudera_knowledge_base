Why Cloudera + Precisely
Precisely and Cloudera provide an enterprise data cloud that is flexible, scalable, and cost-effective. Precisely offers everything you need to maximize your Cloudera investment, including data integration, data quality, location intelligence, and data enrichment.
Precisely’s industry-leading data integration software, Connect, helps make all your critical transaction data available for analytics, AI/ML projects, or to feed real-time data pipelines.  Connect’s “design once, deploy anywhere” approach lets you focus on your business objectives, not the underlying technology.
Our market-leading data quality software, Trillium Quality, gives you the tools to profile and analyze those critical data assets and validate their fitness for purpose; and when you find issues you can leverage its natively executed data standardization and data-matching technology to ensure you have data ready for use that you can trust.
Additionally, Precisely helps you to quickly geo-enrich addresses with 9,000+ attributes through fast, accurate, and easy to use geocoding, spatial-processing, and routing directly within CDP. Precisely gives you the ability to leverage over 400 datasets related to addresses, boundaries, demographics, points of interest, and streets to make stronger business decisions more efficiently. 
We collaborate with Cloudera to provide our customers with a best-of-breed cloud data platform and native integration with the CDP stack from installation through to deployment.
