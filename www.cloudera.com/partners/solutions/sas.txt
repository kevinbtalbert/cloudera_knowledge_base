      Why Cloudera + SAS?
      




SAS and Cloudera enable customers to achieve competitive advantage by gaining value from all of their data, through a proven combination of enterprise-ready storage, processing, analytics and management.









 
















With the economic scalability to store and analyze data in Hadoop, SAS and Cloudera allow customers to reveal hidden insights that have loomed out of reach. Businesses can base more decisions on hard data instead of hunches, and look at complete data sets, not just samples. By providing a more visual and interactive Hadoop experience, SAS makes it easier to discover significant trends and insights. SAS’ strategy is to help customers manage their entire analytics lifecycle, from data preparation and exploration, to modeling and deployment – on all the data.
Randy Guard, Vice President of Product Management, SAS












      
       
      Joint Solution Overview
      




Prepare, explore, and visualize data faster than ever. Build predictive models natively in Hadoop.
By bringing together superior data management and the world’s most powerful analytics, SAS helps unlock the value of data stored in your enterprise data hub (EDH) -- so you can make better decisions faster. With SAS, you can access and integrate data from Cloudera’s EDH offering, push SAS processing in the Hadoop cluster, or lift data into memory and perform highly scalable, distributed computing.
