      Joint Solution
      



Cloudera and SoftLayer deliver Hadoop in the cloud, with no compromises



Big Data is a big deal. Organizations looking to utilize Big Data solutions can create their own by selecting, installing, and configuring the hardware and software needed. But many seek for a more ready-to-use solution from the experts to avoid trial-and-error and to save money and time.
To meet this demand, many providers are using multi-tenant options to lower the cost. SoftLayer and Cloudera have partnered to bring a turnkey, cloud-based Big Data solution with Cloudera pre-installed and pre-configured, focusing on single tenant, high performance architecture. 
Dedicated On-Demand Deployment
SoftLayer dedicated servers can be deployed in two to four hours enabling large enterprise deployments in hours not months.
Bare Metal Servers for Better Performance
SoftLayer servers (ranging from entry-level quad-core servers to sixteen core powerhouses) provide a higher level of performance than virtualized solutions are capable of delivering.
Customized Computing Options
Get the level of compute options desired by selecting from a wide range of dedicated servers with the memory and storage options ideal for the Cloudera deployment.
Easy Design and Provisioning
SoftLayer solution designer tool makes it easy to design and deploy complete Cloudera architectures, allowing Cloudera to be provisioned at the push of a button.
On-demand Scalability
Handle large workloads by scaling out on demand. Add new and better hardware with the latest processors without having to reconfigure the platform.
Cloudera Certified
SoftLayer collaborated with Cloudera, the creator of CDH, to optimize the platform. The configurations have been certified for Cloudera best practices, based on Cloudera and SoftLayer’s insight, expertise and experience and provide a range of options for any Cloudera deployment specifications.
