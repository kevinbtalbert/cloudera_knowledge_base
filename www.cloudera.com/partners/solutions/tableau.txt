      Why Cloudera + Tableau?
      




Tableau makes it easy to answer questions about your data visually and begin discovering new insights in seconds. Create interactive visualizations and dashboards—all without any programming. Then share with a few clicks.











 



 















If your database can’t keep up with the speed of thought, that really is a buzz kill, and you want to make sure you have a high-performance query engine on the backend which Impala gives us.
Dan Jewett, vice president of product management, Tableau
















      
       
      Joint Solution Overview
      




Cloudera and Tableau make it easy to perform sophisticated visual analysis directly on data in Hadoop without needing to know code or query languages. Information from Cloudera Enterprise is visually displayed in Tableau as a series of fields that users can drag- and-drop to visualize the data relevant to the analysis.
Connecting Tableau to Impala is as easy as connecting to any other data source from Tableau, with no additional setup or programming required. Unlock the power of big data with experience interactive analytics on the massive volume and variety of data stored in Cloudera Enterprise.
