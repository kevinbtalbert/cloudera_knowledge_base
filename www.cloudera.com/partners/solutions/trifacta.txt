      Why Cloudera + Trifacta
      




Trifacta and Cloudera enables business and IT departments to partner in driving innovation with data. As the recognized industry leader, Cloudera allows organizations to leverage the best of the open source community with the enterprise capabilities required to succeed with Hadoop. With Trifacta Wrangler Enterprise, organizations can finally leverage the full potential of Cloudera Enterprise to perform exploratory analytics instead of utilizing the platform primarily for ETL or cost-effective storage.









 
















We’re seeing organizations like Royal Bank of Scotland working with data in this way using a combination of Trifacta and Cloudera. Our data wrangling solution provides a uniquely intuitive and powerful model for manipulating data in the Cloudera stack. It enables analysts to be far more productive and agile in working with data.
Joe Hellerstein, Co-Founder & CSO, Trifacta












      
       
      Joint Solution Overview
      




Cloudera and Trifacta: Data Wrangling on the Enterprise Data Hub
Trifacta is designed to help data analysts do the work associated with data preparation without having to manually write code. The joint solution from Trifacta and Cloudera provides a workflow optimized for transforming data at scale. Trifacta Wrangler Enterprise empowers analysts to visualize data stored in Cloudera Enterprise,  to interact with data to define transformation rules that define a Hadoop job (either through  Spark or MapReduce), and to process the data in the desired form for analysis. Trifacta Wrangler Enterprise sits between the Cloudera Enterprise and the visualization, analytics, or machine learning applications used downstream in the process.
Industry-leading Integration & Certification with Cloudera
Trifacta and Cloudera have a strategic partnership to speed the time to analytic value out of Hadoop implementations. Trifacta Wrangler Enterprise is certified with Cloudera Enterprise to execute data transformation logic at scale on Hadoop components packaged within Cloudera including HDFS, Hive, Spark, PIG, and YARN. The partnership between Trifacta and Cloudera includes joint development, certification, and solution collaboration.
Certified with Cloudera Navigator
The joint integration with Cloudera Navigator uniquely augments Hadoop metadata captured by Cloudera Navigator with user-generated metadata from data wrangled in Trifacta. Additionally, from within Navigator, users can search for metadata and use Navigator’s lineage view to see Trifacta wrangle scripts directly associated with the datasets on the Hadoop cluster. This integration provides better collaboration between business and IT groups by providing bi-directional transfer of metadata and a more complete understanding of how data is accessed and used across the cluster.
