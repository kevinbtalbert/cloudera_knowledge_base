OVERVIEW
The ultimate flexibility in hybrid data management and data analytics.
Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) is a hybrid data platform designed for unmatched freedom to choose—any cloud, any analytics, any data.
CDP delivers faster and easier data management and data analytics for data anywhere, with optimal performance, scalability, and security.
With CDP you get all the advantages of CDP Private Cloud and CDP Public Cloud for faster time to value and increased IT control. 

















 

















Get value from all your data with a unified data fabric, open data lakehouse, & scalable data mesh











 

















CDP provides the freedom to securely move  data, applications, and users bi-directionally between the data center and multiple data clouds, regardless of where your data lives.











 










Designed to handle complexity automatically—so you don't have to

Open & scalable

Open data fabrics, data lakehouses, and data meshes with data anywhere at scale.
Reap the rewards of CDP’s open-source pedigree and interoperability to address existing critical issues and anticipate future needs. Turn any data into fuel for your digital transformation engine through modern data architectures for petabyte-scale data meshes, unified data fabrics, and the world’s only data lakehouses powered by Apache Iceberg.





















 



 







 

























Multi-cloud & on premises

Extend powerful AI-powered data applications across your business—faster, easier, and more reliably.
Only Cloudera has the power to span multi-cloud and on premises with a hybrid data platform that delivers cloud-native data analytics across the full data lifecycle—data distribution, data engineering, data warehousing, transactional and operational data, streaming data, and data science and machine learning—with a consistent experience that’s portable across infrastructures.





















 



 







 

























Portable data analytics

Moving data and applications among clouds or back on premises as business conditions change is an imperative.
Implementing a new use case requires more than a point solution that only runs in the cloud. CDP’s unified platform enables portable, interoperable data analytics for the full data lifecycle and distributed, consistent data management running on public clouds, on premises, and at the edge. No more refactoring, no more redevelopment.










 



 







 

























Unified security

Meet the compliance needs of even the most regulated industries with a unified data fabric. 
Consistent policy-based controls across private and public clouds are required for both hybrid success and portable data and services. A unified data fabric, powered by Cloudera SDX, orchestrates disparate data sources intelligently and securely, maintaining lineage across all analytics. SDX facilitates self-service access to trusted data while maintaining accountability and ensuring regulatory compliance.

      CDP Public Cloud
      












Create and manage secure data lakes, self-service analytics, and machine learning services without installing and managing the data platform software. CDP Public Cloud services are managed by Cloudera, but unlike other public cloud services, your data will always remain under your control in your VPC. CDP runs on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud.
CDP Public Cloud lets you:

Control cloud costs by automatically spinning up workloads when needed and suspending their operation when complete 
Isolate and control workloads based on user type, workload type, and workload priority
Combat proliferating silos and centrally control customer and operational data across multi-cloud and hybrid environments
