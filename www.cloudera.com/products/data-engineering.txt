Orchestrate complex data transformation workflows backed by Apache Airflow with hundreds of operators to meet mission-critical analytic requirements. 













Data Engineering is containerized, scalable, and portable, with isolated workload environments and guardrails—enabling secure pipeline management with on-demand elastic compute to meet business SLAs cost-effectively.













Visualize performance metrics including CPU, memory, and I/O across all the stages of your Spark jobs to pinpoint performance bottlenecks and identify the needle in the haystack while troubleshooting.













Leverage a rich job management interface through a CLI and REST APIs to automate and integrate with existing workflows like CI/CD pipelines and third-party tools with ease.













Data Engineering offers a fully integrated Spark on Kubernetes service that automates and streamlines artifact management, security, and resource scheduling—leveraging Apache Yunikorn to provide FIFO and GANG scheduling.













From a centralized interface, platform administrators can manage access and security, then quickly provision new workloads while easily monitoring capacity and visualizing resource usage over time. SDX also enables full lifecycle lineage tracking to know where data came from and where it’s going.
