Running on Cloudera Data Platform (CDP), Data Warehouse is fully integrated with streaming, data engineering, and machine learning analytics. It has a consistent framework that secures and provides governance for all of your data and metadata on private clouds, multiple public clouds, or hybrid clouds.

Operations & events analytics

Analyze large amounts of events and time-series data.
It’s nearly impossible for traditional data warehouses to analyze huge volume of events and time-series data originating from machine logs, sensors, and other devices at the edge. Built on Apache Kudu and Druid, CDP Data Warehouse— combined with Cloudera DataFlow—delivers innovation in performance, scale, and ease of use to tackle the new reality of fast-moving data with self-service analytics.
