Open source and open standards
When Cloudera’s chief architect Doug Cutting founded the Apache Hadoop project, it was with an open source vision firmly in mind. Throughout its history, Cloudera has been strongly committed to a community-driven, Hadoop-based platform based on open standards that meets the highest enterprise expectations for stability and reliability. 

 Learn about Apache Hadoop









 










Innovating in open source
Some vendors consume the open source community’s activity; others help drive it. Cloudera leads in influencing Hadoop platform evolution by creating, contributing, and supporting new capabilities that meet customer requirements for security, scale, and usability.
Learn about Apache Kudu









Curation of open standards
Cloudera has a long and proven track record of identifying, curating, and supporting open standards (including Apache HBase, Apache Spark, and Apache Kafka) that provide the mainstream, long-term architecture upon which new customer use cases are built.
Read about our commitment to open source
 









Highest enterprise requirements
To ensure the best customer experience, Cloudera invests significant resources in multi-dimensional testing on real workloads before releases, as well as in supportability of the entire platform via extensive involvement in the open source community.
 














    
    
      Open source big data: An ecosystem of projects
      





Apache Hadoop is an open source software platform for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware.  Hadoop services provide for data storage, data processing, data access, data governance, security, and operations.

Cloudera's open source credentials

Cloudera is the first and original source of a supported, 100% open source Hadoop distribution (CDH)—which has been downloaded more than all others combined.

Cloudera has contributed more code and features to the Hadoop ecosystem, not just the core, and shipped more of them, than any competitor.

Cloudera employs the most contributors and committers across open standards in the ecosystem, not just the core.

Cloudera employees have founded more (20+) successful Hadoop ecosystem projects than any competitor, including Apache Hadoop itself.

For components that are supported by multiple vendors (i.e., standards), more than half of all Apache JIRAs that are assigned to platform vendor employees are closed/resolved by Cloudera employees.

Cloudera engineers currently occupy more than 100 Apache committer seats (and more than 80 project management committee seats) across all projects that we support.
