      Accumulo key features
      




Secure data delivery
Built with the table and cell-level security required to serve data to diverse sets of users with varying levels of permissions and security clearance, for complete and secure government applications.
Flexibility
Store data of any type — structured, semi-structured, unstructured — without any upfront modeling. Flexible storage means you always have access to full- fidelity data for a wide range of analytics and use cases.
Near real-time speed
Perform fast, random reads and writes to any type of data stored all within the single platform.
Reliability
Automatic, tunable replication means multiple copies of your data is always available for access and protection from data loss. Built-in fault-tolerance means servers can fail but your system will remain available for all workloads.
Hadoop scalable
Designed for massive scalability, so you can store unlimited amounts of data in a single platform and handle growing demands for serving data to more users and applications. As your data needs grow, you can simply add more servers to linearly scale with your business.














    
    
      Common use cases
      




Originally created by the National Security Agency (NSA), Accumulo is the ideal solution for government agencies looking to build secure, real-time applications, including:

Sessionization

Real-Time metrics and analytics

Graph data

“Internet of Things” applications

Public Sector solutions
