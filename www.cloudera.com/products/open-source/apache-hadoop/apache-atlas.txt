Apache Atlas
Atlas is designed to exchange metadata with other tools and processes within and outside of the Hadoop stack, thereby enabling platform-agnostic governance controls that effectively address compliance requirements
Apache Atlas provides scalable governance for Enterprise Hadoop that is driven by metadata. Atlas, at its core, is designed to easily model new business processes and data assets with agility. This flexible type system allows exchange of metadata with other tools and processes within and outside of the Hadoop stack, thereby enabling platform-agnostic governance controls that effectively address compliance requirements
Apache Atlas is developed around two guiding principles:

Metadata Truth in Hadoop: Atlas provides true visibility in Hadoop. By using native connector to Hadoop components, Atlas provides technical and operational tracking enriched by business taxonomical metadata. Atlas facilitates easy exchange of metadata by enabling any metadata consumer to share a common metadata store that facilitates interoperability across many metadata producers.
Developed in the Open: Engineers from Aetna, Merck, SAS, Schlumberger, and Target are working together to help ensure Atlas is purposely built to solve real data governance problems across a wide range of industries that use Hadoop. This approach is an example of open source community innovation that helps accelerate product maturity and time-to-value for the data-first enterprise.











 



 







 



Apache Atlas empowers enterprises to effectively and efficiently address their compliance requirements through a scalable set of core governance services. These services include:

Data Lineage: Captures lineage across Hadoop components at platform level
Agile Data Modeling: Type system allows custom metadata structures in a hierarchy taxonomy
REST API: Modern, flexible access to Atlas services, HDP components, UI & external tools
Metadata Exchange: Leverage existing metadata / models by importing it from current tools. Export metadata to downstream systems

















How Atlas Works
Apache Atlas is designed to effectively exchange metadata within Hadoop and the broader data ecosystem. Atlas’s adaptive model reduces enterprise time to compliance by leveraging existing metadata and industry-specific taxonomy. With Atlas, data administrators and stewards also have the ability to define, annotate and automate the capture of relationships between data sets and underlying elements including source, target and derivation processes.
Atlas also ensures downstream metadata consistency across the ecosystem by enabling enterprises to easily export metadata to third-party systems.
