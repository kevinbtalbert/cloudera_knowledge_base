      HBase Key Features
      










Real-Time Speed:
Perform fast, random reads and writes to all data stored and integrate with other components, like Apache Kafka or Apache Spark™ Streaming, to build complete end-to-end workflows all within the single platform.   









Hadoop Scalable:
HBase is designed for massive scalability, so you can store unlimited amounts of data in a single platform and handle growing demands for serving data to more users and applications. As your data needs grow, you can simply add more servers to linearly scale with your business.









Flexibility:
Store data of any type — structured, semi-structured, unstructured — without any up-front modeling. Flexible storage means you always have access to full- fidelity data for a wide range of analytics and use cases, with direct access through the leading frameworks including Impala and Apache Solr.









Reliability:
Automatic, tunable replication means multiple copies of your data is always available for access and protection from data loss. Built-in fault tolerance means servers can fail but your system will remain available for all workloads. For ensured business continuity, active-active replication is also available for disaster recovery.



































    
    
      Common Use Cases
      




HBase enhances the benefits of HDFS with the ability to serve random reads and writes to many users or applications in real-time, making it ideal for a variety of critical use cases all within a single platform, including:

Messaging service
Sessionization
Real-time metrics and analytics (advertising, auction, etc)
Graph data
“Internet of Things” applications










 



































 







    
    
      Integrated across the platform
      




As an integrated part of Cloudera’s platform, users can build complete real-time applications using HBase in conjunction with other components, such as Apache Spark™, while also analyzing the same data using tools like Impala or Apache Solr, all within a single platform. It also benefits from unified resource management (through YARN), simple deployment and administration (through Cloudera Manager) and shared compliance-ready security and governance (through Cloudera Navigator) — all critical for running in production.
