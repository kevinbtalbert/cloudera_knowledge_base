An integrated part of CDH and supported with Cloudera Enterprise, Pig provides simple batch processing for Apache Hadoop.

      Pig Key Features
      




Simple Language:
Leverage the simple scripting language, Pig Latin, to perform complex data transformations, aggregations, and analysis. Queries are translated into MapReduce or Apache Spark jobs, making it easy for more users to process and analyze unlimited amounts of data.






Shared Data Structures:
Using HCatalog, a table and storage management layer for Hadoop, Pig can work directly with Hive metadata and existing tables, without the need to redefine schema or duplicate data. This flexibility allows users to easily read and write data without facing concerns about where the data is stored, its format, or redefining the structure for every processing tool.



































    
    
      Common Use Cases
      




With its simple scripting language, Pig makes Hadoop data accessible for a variety of batch processing workloads, including:  

Data preparation
ETL
Data mining

BT case study
Data engineering solutions









 



































 







    
    
      Integrated across the platform
      




As an integrated part of Cloudera’s platform, users can run batch processing workloads with Apache Pig, while also analyzing the same data for interactive SQL or machine learning workloads using tools like Impala or Apache Spark — all within a single platform. Pig also benefits from unified resource management (through YARN), simple deployment and administration (through Cloudera Manager) and shared compliance-ready security and governance (through Apache Sentry and Cloudera Navigator) — all critical for running in production.

      The shift to Pig-on-Spark
      




Apache Spark is a powerful data processing engine that has quickly emerged as an open standard for Hadoop due to its added speed and greater flexibility. Together with the community, Cloudera has been working to evolve the tools currently built on MapReduce, including Hive and Pig, and migrate them to the Spark execution engine for faster processing.
Pig-on-Spark is available in alpha on Github.
