      Integrated across the platform
      




As an integrated part of Cloudera’s platform, users can search using Solr, while also analyzing the same data using tools like Impala or Apache Spark™ — all within a single platform. It also benefits from simple deployment and administration (throughout Cloudera Manager) and shared compliance-ready security and governance (through Apache Sentry and Cloudera Navigator) — all critical for running in production.
Cloudera Search integrates, out-of-the-box, with the open source visualization interface, HUE, for simple, intuitive insights into data, immediately.
