      Sqoop Key Features
      










Efficiently move structured data:
Easily import and export bulk data between Hadoop and structured datastores (such as a data warehouse, relational database, or NoSQL systems). Parallel processing ensures data is efficiently transferred and stored in Hadoop for unified analytics, and resulting structures can be transferred back to optimize existing operational workloads — making data quickly available to a wide range of users and workloads.









Connect to existing systems:
Leverage pre-built connectors to easily integrate with the most popular external systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Teradata, Netezza, and Oracle. All connectors are freely available and ready for production use so you can reliably bring existing, structured data into Hadoop to offload certain workloads and combine them with other data types for new insights.









Unified data for analytics:
Combine structured data with unstructured and semi-structured data in a single, flexible platform to discover powerful new insights and enhance existing analytics. You can easily bring unlimited amounts of structured data into the platform, store it alongside other data types, and share it with users across the company — whether they want to optimize batch processing, build machine-learning models, or anything in between.

      Common Use Cases
      




As the standard tool for bringing structured data into Hadoop, Sqoop is a critical component for building a variety of end-to-end workloads to analyze unlimited data of any type. Typical use cases include:

Active archive

Optimized data processing

Ad hoc data discovery

National Children's Hospital case study
Data Engineering solutions









 



































 







    
    
      Integrated across the platform
      




As an integrated part of Cloudera’s platform, Sqoop can easily work with other components, such as Apache Hive and Impala, to make data easily accessible all within a single platform. It also benefits from unified resource management (through YARN), simple deployment and administration (through Cloudera Manager), and shared compliance-ready security and governance (through Apache Sentry and Cloudera Navigator) — all critical for running in production.
