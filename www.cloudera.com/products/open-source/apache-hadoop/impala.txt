Additionally, as part of Cloudera Enterprise, it’s easy to elastically scale Impala compute power to best support changing access and performance demands.

      Integrated across the platform
      




As an integrated part of Cloudera’s platform, Impala benefits from unified resource management (through YARN), simple administration (through Cloudera Manager), and compliance-ready security and governance (through Apache Sentry and Cloudera Navigator) — all critical for running in production.
Impala’s flexibility also supports all the common Hadoop file formats, including Apache Parquet, the leading columnar storage format.
