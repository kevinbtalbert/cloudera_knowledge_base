      Cloudera Director key features
      




Flexible, self-service deployment. Through an intuitive user interface (UI), multiple user groups can quickly take advantage of the added speed and greater flexibility of the cloud with self-service provisioning for the fastest time-to-value. Deployments are preconfigured for immediate production use, regardless of the cloud environment. Cloudera Director will get your business up and running quickly, consistently, and reliably with Hadoop in the cloud.

Simple cloud-centric administration. Get a single pane of glass view of all cloud deployments for unified administration. Cloudera Director is deeply integrated with Cloudera Manager for a direct connection and consistent administration for cluster-level management and monitoring. The Cloudera Director user interface provides simplified cluster lifecycle management—with wizards to spin up, scale, terminate, and even clone clusters as needed—and the ability to easily monitor multiple deployments, even across cloud environments.
