      Cloudera Manager — making Hadoop easy
      




Automated deployment and configuration. The fastest way to get up and running with Hadoop and Cloudera Enterprise. Automated wizards let you quickly deploy your cluster, no matter what the scale or the deployment environment, complete with intelligent default settings based on your system. Ensure consistency as you move from testing to production, or across environments with portable cluster configuration templates. Through a centralized interface, your operations team can easily tune configurations and resourcing; manage a wide range of user roles for cross-departmental self-service access; and even manage multiple clusters for multi-tenant environments.
Customizable monitoring and reporting. Get complete visibility into your cluster with hundreds of built-in health checks and alerts that you can configure based on what matters most to you. Not only can you monitor all components across all clusters (including Cloudera Manager itself), you can also easily monitor jobs and query performance. Cloudera Manager has the industry’s only customizable dashboard, with the ability to create advanced charts for historical monitoring and custom triggers and thresholds for your environment.

Effortless, robust troubleshooting. The only centralized log management aggregates logs across all services and hosts, and makes them searchable for simple troubleshooting, including integrated, custom alerting for the errors you care about. Historical views and metrics let you see exactly what happened when, and allow you to quickly see anomalistic behavior. Cloudera Support is also directly integrated with Cloudera Manager, for proactive support and issue resolution based on your system and logs.

Zero downtime maintenance. Never worry about system downtime with comprehensive automations for rolling upgrades and rollbacks, so you always get the latest advancements without the hassle. High availability across components and built in backup and disaster recovery means you can run even your most critical workloads risk-free.

      Multi-tenant management and visibility
      




Open your cluster to many workloads and user groups, while still meeting priority SLAs through dynamic resource management and cluster utilization reporting. Easily allocate YARN and Impala resources across different tenants and automatically adjust based on time, day, and weighted priority. Cluster utilization reporting provides per-tenant visibility into resource consumption and efficiency for capacity planning, preemption tuning, and troubleshooting problematic workloads.

      Extensible integration
      




Get unified visibility into Cloudera Enterprise and the leading third-party tools, all through Cloudera Manager. Designed with an extensible framework, partner tools can seamlessly integrate with Cloudera Manager for truly centralized administration.
This extensibility also lets Cloudera Manager quickly adapt as the Hadoop ecosystem expands, so you get access to the leading innovations and new components (including Apache Spark™, Apache Kafka, and Impala) all through the same administrative experience.
