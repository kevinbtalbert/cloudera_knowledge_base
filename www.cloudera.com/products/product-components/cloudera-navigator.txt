Big data meets data governance
Manage data and get more done with Cloudera Navigator.

 Datasheet









 





The only complete data governance solution for Apache Hadoop













 










As organizations increasingly rely on Hadoop as a core component of their data strategy, pressures arise to manage growing volumes of data, monitor access to sensitive assets, and seamlessly enforce policies across the enterprise. Other governance solutions offer limited insights into subsets of Hadoop’s rich ecosystem, or may require costly and complex add-ons to do the job.









Cloudera Navigator is the only complete data governance solution for Hadoop, offering critical capabilities such as data discovery, continuous optimization, audit, lineage, metadata management, and policy enforcement. As part of Cloudera Enterprise, Cloudera Navigator is critical to enabling high-performance agile analytics, supporting continuous data architecture optimization, and meeting regulatory compliance requirements.









 
















 



 







Self-service data discovery
Data engineers and analysts need to continuously identify relevant data sources and assess their value. Unfortunately, a complete picture of all the data in Hadoop is hard to find, and other solutions lack the ability to unify business and technical metadata. Cloudera Navigator enables users to effortlessly explore and tag data through an intuitive search-based interface. By consolidating metadata, and supporting rich custom tags and comments, it is also easy to track, classify, and locate data to comply with business governance and compliance rules.









 












    
    
      Compliance-ready data governance: lineage and audit
      




Data governance and compliance professionals need the ability to comprehensively track and understand how data is used in Hadoop. Other solutions only follow some data or processes, and only at a high level. As the only comprehensive, compliance-ready data and process audit solution for Hadoop, Cloudera Navigator automatically collects audit logs from across the entire platform and maintains a full history, with a unified, searchable audit dashboard for simple, point-in-time visibility. With automatic collection and visualization of column-level lineage, users can also quickly identify the origin, usage, and impact of a dataset. With Cloudera Navigator, it’s easy to comply with regulatory requirements and manage Hadoop data governance centrally.









 





















 







    
    
      Compliance-ready data protection
      




Keep information secure at rest and in motion with Cloudera Enterprise, the only Hadoop platform with comprehensive native encryption and key management. Other Hadoop vendors only encrypt HDFS data, leaving log files and metadata repositories exposed to malicious actors. Cloudera Navigator Encrypt and Key Trustee protect everything in your cluster so you can meet compliance initiatives and ensure the integrity of your enterprise data.
Cloudera’s comprehensive security offerings





















    
    
      Hadoop-scale lifecycle automation
      




Running Hadoop in production requires preparing for business-continuity scenarios. Only Cloudera Enterprise offers integrated backup and disaster recovery, as well as tools to assist with policy management. Cloudera Navigator’s unique policy engine automates critical data stewardship and curation activities, including metadata classification and data archiving and retention, and integrated with leading data preparation, quality, and profiling tools.
