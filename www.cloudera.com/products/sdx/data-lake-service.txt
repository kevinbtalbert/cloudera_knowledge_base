Capture and store all schema and metadata definitions automatically as they are discovered and created by platform workloads. Governance and data log capabilities turn metadata into information assets, improving its usability, trust, and value throughout the lifecycle. 
 













Standardize and enforce granular, dynamic, role- and attribute-based security policies. Prevent and audit unauthorized access to sensitive or restricted data across the platform. Encrypt data across the stack at rest as well as in motion and manage encryption keys.

Identify and manage sensitive data while also effectively addressing compliance requirements with unified data management operations, including metadata search, lineage and chain-of-custody auditing, and security as well as classification, profiling, and business glossary.
