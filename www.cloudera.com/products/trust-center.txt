Overview
Transparency is essential to security
Cloudera's priority is to make your experience with our products safe and secure.  This means you have the information you need to feel comfortable managing your data and utilizing multi-function analytics in the cloud. That’s why we created this Trust Center, to bring together the latest Cloudera security, compliance, and system performance information, accessible from one central location.





















 


















 



 




        ** See Cyber Essentials Certificate
        








Our approach
Certified secure
Cloudera continually strives to apply industry best practices, validated through third-party audits and certifications. For example, our ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II certifications help ensure CDP is developed, reviewed, tested, and released following the ISO and AICPA Trust Services Principles. This means CDP Public Cloud is continuously being developed using audited processes and controls to help ensure the highest level of trust and security.









 










Security practices












      
      
      Security first development
      






Earning our customers’ trust is our top priority. We’re committed to building security-focused engineering teams that follow our Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC). Using developer training, education, and our prescribed security best practices, each of our development teams makes sure CDP features and services are designed with security first.








      
      
      Shared responsibility, risk & compliance
      






From the beginning, we designed security into the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud. CDP Public Cloud follows a shared responsibility model, providing customers with complete control over the compute and storage resources running in their public cloud account. With advanced security features such as support for custom AMIs and support for AWS PrivateLink and Azure Private Link, customers can deploy the CDP Public Cloud in some of the most restricted cloud environments.








      
      
      Production service operations 
      






Built to be cloud-native, CDP Public Cloud leverages sophisticated cloud security technologies and runs on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing service, benefitting from Amazon’s secure, world-class data centers, which are certified for ISO 27001, and SOC 1 / SSAE-16. The result is a service that is secure and resilient, giving you the confidence to trust your most demanding workloads with CDP.
