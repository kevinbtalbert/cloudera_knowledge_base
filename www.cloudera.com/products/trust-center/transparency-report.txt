Cloudera’s Transparency Report provides detailed information on any government and law enforcement (hereinafter “Public Authority”) request for access to or disclosure of customer data received by or directed to Cloudera, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the countries of our operations.  Cloudera publishes this Transparency Report biannually.






Public Authority Data Request Policy

A Public Authority request may include a legally binding warrant, subpoena, court order, writ, or national security letter for customer data. Cloudera requires that a request comply with applicable law and will review and assess the legality of the request. To be considered, any such request must, at a minimum, satisfy the following criteria:

Be submitted in writing and on official letterhead;
Identify the authorized official making the request on the public authority’s behalf, including that official’s title and contact information;
Be signed by the authorized official;
Identify and describe the purpose and nature of the request, as well as the lawful basis of the request, including a citation to the relevant law, rule, or regulation;
Identify the customer and/or customer account, which is the target of the request;
Provide a detailed description of the type of data sought and explain its relationship to the purpose and lawful basis of the request; and
Be issued and served in accordance with applicable law.
