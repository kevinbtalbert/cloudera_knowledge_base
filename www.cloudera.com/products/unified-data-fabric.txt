Overview
Manage data anywhere across hybrid cloud with a unified data fabric.
With a data fabric, organizations can unlock disparate data sources across hybrid cloud; truly know and understand their contents; and make them available in a safe, compliant, and self-service manner across the organization. Consistent data management delivers a solid basis for accelerated value and insight and all modern data architectures.










 



 







 



Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) enables organizations to deploy a data fabric to unlock data anywhere for key data-driven use cases with key capabilities: 



















Data Catalog
Fulfill the first and crucial aspect of F.A.I.R. (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data qualities and let data practitioners discover the information at their disposal.















Data management
Address organizational, industrial, and regulatory constraints and policies with a federated service to consistently secure, govern, and track data across hybrid cloud.















Observability
Know and understand the health of your data, how it’s used, and how it’s performing and receive recommendations on how it could be used better.















Replication
Move data to where it’s needed or where it’s safe, always with full knowledge and insight into its security, governance, as well as lineage.









 


















 



















Key Components
 
All of your data. Anywhere. Securely.

Powerful Replication Manager

Data may be born anywhere yet data gravity pulls it where it is needed. A unified data fabric replicates data as needed and without breaking security and governance controls. Tightly integrated with SDX, Replication Manager supports that function by moving context with the data, replicating all associated metadata, classification tags, security policies, compliance rules, and lineage information.
