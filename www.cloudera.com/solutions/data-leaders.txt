Our data was in silos, so it was difficult to take what we learned across the R&D pipeline and build on it. … To gain the new levels of efficiency and insight we needed to reduce our costs and speed development, we had to create a platform that would ingest all unstructured and structured R&D data, and deliver greater analytic capabilities.
—Mark Ramsey, former senior vice president and R&D Chief Data Officer, GSK




Customer story














 


























Traditional data management platforms are not flexible enough to handle the huge volume of data or the ad-hoc analytics that we need
—Roberto Álvarez, Chief Data Officer, Unidad Editorial




Customer story































You don’t always know what data will be valuable for a particular use case or what use cases lie ahead. Cloudera enables us to innovate, pursue new capabilities, and achieve outcomes that wouldn’t be possible otherwise.
—Manav Misra, Chief Data and Analytics officer, Regions Bank




Customer story














 



























 










Cloudera has been the Big Data leader for over a decade, with 25 exabytes of data under management and used by nine out of ten of the largest global companies across any given industry.
—Forbes































Cloudera stands apart as the sole provider of an open data lakehouse that spans multiple public clouds and on-premises environments, retaining their data where it is best suited. Moreover, the unified security and governance offered by CDP ensures consistent data access and protection, irrespective of its structure or format.
—Analytics India Magazine












 



























 










LLM integration takes Cloudera data lakehouse from Big Data to Big AI.
With LLM integration, Cloudera is making it easier for enterprises to directly integrate with open-source LLMs from Hugging Face and open-source vector databases to build AI applications.
— VentureBeat
