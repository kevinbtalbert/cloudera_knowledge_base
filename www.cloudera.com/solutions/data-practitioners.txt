CDP Public Cloud





CDP Private Cloud







CDP Public Cloud
CDP Private Cloud









    
    
      CDP Public Cloud
      












Create and manage secure data lakes, self-service analytics, and machine learning services without installing and managing the data platform software. CDP Public Cloud services are managed by Cloudera, but unlike other public cloud services, your data will always remain under your control in your VPC. CDP runs on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud.
CDP Public Cloud lets you:

Control cloud costs by automatically spinning up workloads when needed and suspending their operation when complete 
Isolate and control workloads based on user type, workload type, and workload priority
Combat proliferating silos and centrally control customer and operational data across multi-cloud and hybrid environments











 



 







 







    
    
      CDP Private Cloud
      












CDP Private Cloud delivers powerful analytic, transactional, and machine learning workloads in a hybrid data platform. With a choice of traditional as well as elastic analytics and scalable object storage, CDP Private Cloud modernizes traditional monolithic cluster deployments in a powerful and efficient platform. 
CDP Private Cloud provides the first step for data center customers toward true data and workload mobility, managed from a single pane of glass with consistent data security and governance.
With CDP Private Cloud, organizations benefit from:

Rapid time to value through simplified provisioning of easy-to-use, self-service analytics in minutes rather than days
Improved cost efficiency with optimized resource utilization and the decoupling of compute and storage
Predictable performance thanks to workload isolation and perfectly managed multi-tenancy
