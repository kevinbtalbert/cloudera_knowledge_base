Solutions Gallery > Next Generation Financial Crimes with riskCanvas







 








Solution overview
In many cases, today’s systems generate hundreds of thousands of transaction alerts which require investigation. The resources needed to support these investigations require an army of analysts, investigators, and auditors, and represents the largest expense of Financial Crimes  programs within most financial institutions.
The next big shift in the fight against financial crime and money laundering is advanced machine learning and sophisticated data science.
Cloudera and riskCanvas can help you automate most of the manual processes and decrease the time to action on possible fraudulent transactions.
riskCanvas is an end-to-end Financial Crimes  software platform designed to meet the comprehensive needs of today’s Financial Crimes  program. riskCanvas can be implemented as a complete package or in individual modules to address niche Financial Crimes gaps. riskCanvas includes the following modules:

KYC / CDD / EDD data collection
Customer risk scoring using riskDNA™ risk algorithm
Transaction monitoring (AML & Fraud)
Automated alert triaging
Case management and workflow automation
Investigation acceleration / Single view of the customer
Advanced analytics, prototyping, & dashboarding
