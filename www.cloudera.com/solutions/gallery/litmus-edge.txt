Solution overview
The ability to quickly access data and enable analytics to sustain growth in today's Industry 4.0 world is limited by legacy industrial systems. Challenges that enterprises have to overcome include accessing data from heterogeneous devices and systems, managing non-integrated OT (operational technology) and IT (information technology) systems, and addressing the lack of ability to scale IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) solutions. With modern technology that liberates data, enterprises can make data available to the people, processes and tools that need it to succeed on their digital journey.
Litmus and Cloudera help enterprises collect, analyze, and take action on real-time data to improve both operations and IT decisions. Litmus is an industrial edge data connectivity platform that streams ‘ready-to-use’ data to the Cloudera Data Platform for analytics and machine learning. Litmus can send data either to Cloudera DataFlow at the edge or the Cloudera Data Platform in the cloud, and machine learning models can be deployed and run back at the edge via Litmus.
