      Pepperdata and Cloudera Help Your Big Data Platform Perform at its Best
      









 



 







 












Solutions Gallery > Pepperdata and Cloudera: Help Your Big Data Platform Perform at its Best







 








Solution Overview
Accelerated cloud and microservices adoption have resulted in ephemeral environments with sometimes unpredictable behavior. Because of constant and dynamic changes, siloed solutions limit visibility and do not work across platforms. Today’s big data environments require observability to handle the complexity, volume, and speed necessary to meet SLAs and business objectives.
Pepperdata provides observability and automatic optimization for big data systems running on CDP. This gives enterprises actionable data about their applications and infrastructure, allowing them to better understand system behavior over time. This understanding can transform their organization, going from reactive to proactive to predictive.
Together, Pepperdata and Cloudera make it possible for your big data on CDP to run at its best. The Pepperdata product suite allows enterprises to gain key insights into their big data performance, recapture wasted resources, and automatically optimize the performance of both their big data applications and platform.
The CDP-certified Pepperdata products constantly work in the background, gathering and analyzing real-time performance data and other metrics to discover the most ideal configurations to accelerate application performance by up to 50%. The solution then provides actionable insights and recommendations, so enterprises can ensure their big data is performing optimally no matter where it’s running.

About Pepperdata
Pepperdata products help customers transform the performance of their big data systems. Unlike solutions that provide only summary dashboards from infrastructure monitoring and APM vendors, Pepperdata automatically scales system resources while providing a detailed and correlated understanding of each application using hundreds of real-time application and infrastructure metrics.







 




 










 



 




Pepperdata Portfolio
The Pepperdata product suite provides observability and autonomous tuning for enterprises running big data on CDP, whether in the cloud or on premises. The suite includes:

Application Spotlight: Provides a comprehensive view of all your data in one place, empowering you to improve efficiency and deliver the best big data workload performance.

Platform Spotlight: Automatically monitors and analyzes the performance of your entire big data architecture. It gives you an in-depth view of your infrastructure and resource utilization, allowing you to quickly diagnose big data performance issues.

Capacity Optimizer: Autonomously optimizes your big data cluster resources and recaptures wasted capacity so you can run more applications and get the most out of your infrastructure investment—all without tuning individual applications.    


Pepperdata provides the following benefits while running on CDP:

Automatically tunes your big data environment to deliver the best application performance for even your most challenging workloads.

Empowers enterprises to track spend and accurately attribute spending to business units via chargeback reports. 

Autonomous provisioning of compute based on real-time actual node usage instead of peak workload requirements—resulting in the optimized utilization of CPU, memory, and I/O resources on big data clusters even while rapidly scaling.


The combination of Pepperdata and CDP delivers observability and autonomous optimization so enterprises can cut costs in the cloud, slash resource wastage, and ensure the optimal performance of their big data stack.
