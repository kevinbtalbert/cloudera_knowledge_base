Quality of care optimization






Healthcare providers are increasingly capturing and analyzing data from bedside sensors, bio-monitors, HL7, FHIR, and other streaming and internet-of-things scale data feeds. Environmental and epigenetic factors such as ambient light, ambient noise, stress, and clinical interventions represent examples of enriching healthcare predictive analytics data. Cloudera, provides a scalable next generation, hybrid data management platform that empowers physicians, researchers, and others to easily collect, process, secure, and analyze all of this data for evaluating ways to impact patient outcomes.

Translational research






Analysis of the relevant DNA sequences, whether whole genome, exome, methylation or multi-omics, puts us in reach of precision medicine and high confidence biomarker  discovery for the first time. Cloudera’s enterprise grade platform can drive tremendous improvements in cost and in computing power over traditional compute approaches in tertiary or downstream molecular analytics at scale. This helps enable use cases from health system pathology departments performing pharmacogenomics to research labs doing genome-wide association studies. Cloudera enables the fastest path to merge omic data with clinical/phenotype data from any technology in the market. More than  a dozen organizations have selected Cloudera as their precision medicine repository or enterprise variant store for unlimited scale.
