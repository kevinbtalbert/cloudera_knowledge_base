      Industrial IoT
      





The Industry 4.0 revolution, powered by IoT, is driving increasing focus on connected factories, assets, and industrial ecosystems. Data generated by connected devices has the potential to provide your business with crucial insights, such as how your assets are performing in real time, how agile your supply chain is, and how your products are being used. It can even predict when and how something might break. Cloudera’s data management and analytics platform can help process sensor and machine data from connected assets, in real time, and help predict key outcomes, ensuring you are always ahead of the curve.

      Predictive maintenance
      





IoT-enabled predictive maintenance makes it possible for organizations to continuously monitor the health of their assets and predict and prevent failures by performing the right maintenance at the right time, thereby reducing costly equipment downtimes. Cloudera Enterprise enables organizations to stream data from connected assets and drive machine learning and predictive analytics on sensor data to accurately predict the chances of a machine being down—including when and how an asset will fail. This lets organizations plan early and corrective measures and introduce them in the most effective way, thereby avoiding unplanned downtimes and unnecessary staffing and resource costs.

      Connected vehicles
      





Traditional data management architectures lack the scalability and flexibility to manage the volume, diversity, and streaming nature of data that connected vehicles generate. Capitalize on all of your IoT data from connected vehicles with Cloudera’s end-to-end data management platform that enables streaming analytics and machine learning to drive intelligence at the edge or in the cloud.
