Cybersecurity for government






Real-time collection, aggregation, and analysis of public sector security data allow for the proactive detection of breaches, whether they originate from outside the network or from malicious insiders. Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) empowers government agencies with a comprehensive and unified view of risks, automating the detection of threats and streamlining operations for a rapid response. As a foundational framework within the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) environment, CDP serves as a crucial tool in the cybersecurity arsenal, enabling government agencies to leverage data effectively.

Fraud, waste and abuse






The U.S. Government spends trillions of dollars on benefit programs annually but millions are improperly paid due to fraud, reducing the benefits to those citizens who most need support. By adopting a modern data platform, agencies can more effectively monitor for fraudulent claims and ensure that citizen services are not misused.

Proactive and predictive support






Government agencies are tasked with the challenge of migrating vast quantities of data and unlike commercial organizations government agencies often require an added level of security, as well as U.S. Citizen Based resources to ensure that critical data is kept out of harm’s way.
