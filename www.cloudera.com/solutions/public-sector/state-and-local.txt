State and Local Government
Enhance services. Build smarter cities.
Contain costs. Repeat.
Citizen-focused government—it’s time to let data inform the mission.
The Rise of Smart Cities
Data-Driven Citizen Experience
 




















Lead with efficiency and innovation
State and local governments must find ways to use the data they collect, generate, protect, and share to better inform decision-making to benefit constituents now and into the future. A modern data architecture can help deliver targeted citizen services, protect against waste, fraud, and abuse of government resources, and more effectively manage sensor data from connected devices on everything from public transit to building maintenance. How is your data working for you?
State and Local Government Modernization: Challenges and Opportunities







 













 Key use cases







 










Government modernization
Challenges resulting from the increase in data volume, velocity and variety have compelled organizations to rethink how they approach data management by revamping their architecture to support this new way of business. By modernizing their architecture, organizations can adopt new data storage and management architectures designed to meet the challenging analytical needs of the modern enterprise.









Cybersecurity and compliance
 Enhance threat detection through improved access to all data with advanced analytics to uncover patterns of deceit. Access and compile diverse data sets to detect and prevent fraud, and to meet external compliance requirements. 









 










 Public works
Support enhanced interaction between citizens and government to improve services and enable resource requests for repairs through multiple channels. Allow citizens to request road repairs, storm damage, power outages, park permitting, and more.









 Health and human services
Deliver targeted services to the right citizens at the right time with insight gained from your data, while also protecting against waste, fraud, and abuse of limited resources.









 










Law enforcement/Public safety
Equip first responders and law enforcement officers with the tools needed to make timely, data-driven decisions that can protect citizens in need and improve outcomes by building much-needed collaboration between police, EMS, fire departments, and hospitals.

Transportation
Provide more effective and efficient roads and public transit solutions for citizens through better visibility into sensor data. Improve services and control costs by monitoring everything from vehicle maintenance to social media feedback.
