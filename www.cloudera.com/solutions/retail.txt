Connected supply chain & fulfillment






Simply analyzing in-store POS data to forecast demand and fulfillment is not good enough. Today’s connected customers chip away at margins, especially when it comes to fulfillment. Smart retailers and brands rely on connected data from both internal and external demand signals to continually improve demand forecast accuracy and analytic model precision. The ability to optimize product staging locations and routes while minimizing markdowns and fulfillment costs is today's competitive differentiator.
