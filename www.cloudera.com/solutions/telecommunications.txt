OVERVIEW
Enabling Digital Life in the Network Cloud
In post-pandemic life, communications and content services have become increasingly dependent on networks. Connectivity is no longer a mere convenience—having a poor quality connection is simply not acceptable. Cloudera processes petabytes of information every day to power real time analytics with ML and AI. For service providers, it's a single pane of glass, across public and private data clouds, giving you a 360 degree view of the business.

Service Assurance






Service assurance—fault management and prediction, anomaly detection, and predictive maintenance—historically have required multiple point solutions.
But with Cloudera Data Platform, you gain new insights, understanding not just that a fault was identified and prioritized, but why it happened. By employing advanced analytics and ML across the infrastructure, you have a clear view of repeating patterns and can effectively apply predictive maintenance. This same ML-powered platform enables strategies for prioritizing 4G/5G network expansion.

Total experience management






Customer relationships go beyond churn: It’s critical to understand and optimize every customer engagement for a “good” experience, and potential up-sell. They tell their friends and family, whether the experience is positive or negative, and they can either drive or challenge your business growth.
Cloudera lets service providers model their customer and employee experience, measuring key indicators including sentiment, advocacy, and loyalty. Build the models, measure, automate, and optimize. Move from mere chatbots to intelligent optimized interactions, across multiple channels with sustained positive outcomes.

Security & privacy analytics






Today, telcos are migrating IT to the public cloud and find themselves in a complex hybrid data cloud environment. Across the board, this brings both security and privacy issues. These multiple data environments all need to abide by the same security access rules. And second order analytics must have consistent privacy rules across clouds.
Cloudera provides a single data governance environment to manage multiple workloads in a multi-cloud setting. Each of these unique data workloads requires robust governance with holistic security and privacy management capabilities.

Telcos vitally participate in today’s AI ecosystems, from digital marketing and advertising to ADAS automotive and smart cities. As the connectivity layer for IoT and the edge, they are an integral piece of the puzzle.
Cloudera enables telcos to contribute data, analytics, monetization solutions, and infrastructure—all with comprehensive governance.
