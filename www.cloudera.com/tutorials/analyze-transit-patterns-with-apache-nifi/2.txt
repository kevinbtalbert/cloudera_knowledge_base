Introduction

With the Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) Sandbox, Apache NiFi comes pre-installed in the Ambari Stack and pre-configured out of the box to utilize many of its features. In the tutorial, it shows you how to access the NiFi HTML UI in one of two ways: use the HDF Splash Screen Page "Advanced Quick Links" or Ambari UI "Quick Links".
Prerequisites

Completed the prior tutorials within this tutorial series
Downloaded and deployed the Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) Sandbox
Added CDF Sandbox Hostname to Your Hosts File, refer to Learning the Ropes of the HDF sandbox

Outline

Step 1: Open HDF Splash Page
Approach 1: Access NiFi HTML UI via Ambari Dashboard
Approach 2: Launch NiFi HTML UI from HDF Splash Quick Links
Summary

Note: For VMware users, you will need to add the auto generated IP address on startup of your virtual machine followed by CDF Sandbox hostname to your hosts file, example 192.168.17.129 sandbox-hdf.hortonworks.com. On MAC, open /private/etc/hosts; LINUX, open /etc/hosts; WINDOWS 10, open C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts as an administrator.

Step 1: Open HDF Splash Page
1. Open sandbox-hdf.hortonworks.com:1080 with your favorite web browser:

Choose either approach to access NiFi UI.
Approach 1: Access NiFi HTML UI via Ambari Dashboard
1. Select the LAUNCH DASHBOARD button
2. Type raj_ops/raj_ops to login to Ambari.

3. Select the NiFi Service, and click on NiFi UI:

4. The NiFi UI comes with a default Trucking-IoT NiFiFlow as seen on the image below. To delete the default NiFiFlow and work with a new canvas select the NiFiFlow (cltr+A) then right click and select delete.

Sample of a clean NiFi Canvas:
Approach 2: Launch NiFi HTML UI from HDF Splash Quick Links
1. Select the QUICK LINKS button
2. Hover over the NiFi box and select Go to UI

3. The NiFi UI comes with a default Trucking-IoT NiFiFlow as seen on the image below. To delete the default NiFiFlow and work with a new canvas select the NiFiFlow (cltr+A for Mac) then right click and select delete.

Sample of a clean NiFi Canvas:
Summary
Congratulations! You explored two approaches for launching NiFi UI. You opened the HDF Splash Page: Approach 1 was launching the Ambari Dashboard from the "New To HDF path" while Approach 2 was using the NiFi Quick Link from the "Advanced HDF path". Now you are ready to explore the next tutorial to began building our simple dataflow.
