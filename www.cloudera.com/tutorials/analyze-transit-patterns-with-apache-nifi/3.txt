Run Schedule
1 sec


Run Schedule the processor executes a task every 1 second and avoids back pressure downstream to the next processor

5. Open the processor config Settings tab, under Auto terminate relationships, check the failure and original checkboxes. Click Apply.

Figure 5: UnpackContent Settings Tab Window
Step 4: Add ControlRate to Regulate Data Flow Speed
1. Add the ControlRate processor onto the NiFi canvas.
2. Connect UnpackContent to ControlRate processor. When the Create Connection window appears, verify success checkbox is checked, else check it. Click Add.

Figure 6: Connect UnpackContent to ControlRate
3. Open the processor configuration properties tab. Add the properties listed in Table 5 to update the processor's appropriate properties.
Table 5: Update ControlRate Properties Tab

Property
Value
Rate Control Criteria
flowfile count
Maximum Rate
20
Time Duration
6 second


Rate Control Criteria instructs the processor to count the number of FlowFiles before a transfer takes place

Maximum Rate instructs the processor to transfer 20 FlowFiles at a time

Time Duration makes it so only 20 FlowFiles will transfer through this processor every 6 seconds.


4. Open the processor config Settings tab, under Auto terminate relationships, check the failure checkbox. Click Apply.
Step 5: Add UpdateAttribute to Make Each FlowFile Name Unique
1. Add the UpdateAttribute processor onto the NiFi canvas.
2. Connect ControlRate to UpdateAttribute. When the Create Connection window appears, verify success checkbox is checked, else check it. Click Add.

Figure 7: Connect ControlRate to UpdateAttribute
3. Add a new dynamic property for NiFi expression, click on the plus button "+" in the top right corner. Insert the following property name and value into your properties tab as shown in the table below:
Table 6: Add UpdateAttribute Properties Tab

Property
Value
filename
transit-data-${UUID()}.xml


Figure 8: UpdateAttribute Property Tab Window

filename updates each FlowFile with a unique identifier

4. Click Apply.
Step 6: Add PutFile to Store RawTransitEvents to Disk
1. Add the PutFile processor onto the NiFi canvas.
2. Connect UpdateAttribute to PutFile. When the Create Connection window appears, verify success checkbox is checked, else check it. Click Add.

Figure 9: Connect UpdateAttribute to PutFile
3. Open the processor configuration properties tab. Add the property listed in Table 7 to update the processor's appropriate properties.
Table 7: Update PutFile Properties Tab

Property
Value
Directory
/sandbox/tutorial-files/640/nifi/output/rawtransitevents

4. Open the processor config Settings tab, under Auto terminate relationships, check the failure and success checkboxes. Click Apply.
Step 7: Add Output Port for External Component Connection
1. Add the Output Port  component onto the NiFi canvas. Name it RawTransitEvents.
2. Connect UpdateAttribute to RawTransitEvents output port. When the Create Connection window appears, verify success checkbox is checked, else check it. Click Add.

Figure 10: Connect UpdateAttribute to Output Port (RawTransitEvents)
Step 8: Check Data Stored to Local File System Via Web Shell Client
1. With the NiFi DataFlow unselected, hit the start button  located in the Operate Palette to activate the SimulateXmlTransitEvents process group dataflow.
2. Let the flow run for about 1 minute, then stop the flow by hitting the stop button.
3. Launch Sandbox Web Shell Client via Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) Splash Screen from Advanced HDF SB Quick Links Link.
Figure 11: SB Quick Link for Web Shell Client
Note: Username is "root", initial password is "hadoop".


You have now SSH'd into the CDF Sandbox Server.
4. Navigate to the output directory in which the transit data is being written to:

cd /sandbox/tutorial-files/640/nifi/output/rawtransitevents

5. Run the ls command to list files in the current directory:

ls

6. Run the cat command to output the content of the data file to the console:

cat transit-data-{flowfile-UUID}.xml


Figure 12: Output of Transit Data in Web Shell Client
Approach 2: Import NiFi SimulateXmlTransitEvents Process Group
1. Download the tutorial-3-nifi-flow-SimulateXmlTransitEvents.xml template file.
2. Use the template icon  located in the Operate Palette.
3. Browse, find the template file, click Open and hit Upload.
4. From the Components Toolbar, drag the template icon  onto the graph and select the tutorial-3-nifi-flow-SimulateXmlTransitEvents.xml template file.
5. Right click on the process group, hit the start button  to activate the dataflow.

Figure 13: NiFi Flow that pulls in San Francisco Muni Transit Events from the XML Simulator, stores the raw transit events to the local file system and also sends the data out to the rest of the flow through the output port.
The building blocks of every dataflow consist of processors. When sections of the flow become complex, you can start grouping processors inside process groups. These tools perform actions on data to ingest, route, extract, split, aggregate or store it. Our dataflow process group above contains processors, each processor includes a high level description of their role in the tutorial:

SimulateXmlTransitEvents (Process Group)
GetFile fetches the vehicle location simulator data for files in a directory.
UnpackContent decompresses the contents of FlowFiles from the traffic simulator zip file.
ControlRate controls the rate at which FlowFiles are transferred to follow-on processors enabling traffic simulation.
UpdateAttribute renames every FlowFile to give them unique names
PutFile stores data to local file system
Output Port makes the connection for the process group to connect to other components (process groups, processors, etc)



Refer to NiFi's Documentation to learn more about each processor described above.
Summary
Congratulations! You just built a NiFi SimulateXmlTransitEvents process group to replicate the NextBus API, which generates transit data for passengers. You learned to use GetFile processor to ingest the transit data seed. The UnpackContent processor decompressed the transit data seed zip file and routed the data onto the rest of the flow. ControlRate processor controlled the rate at which each FlowFile was distributed to the remaining components of the flow. The Output Port allows for FlowFiles to be dispersed to the next process group you will learn to build in the next tutorial called ParseTransitEvents.
