If you prefer to build the dataflow manually step-by-step, continue on to Approach 1. Else if you want to see the NiFi flow in action within minutes, refer to Approach 2.
Approach 1: Manually Build ParseTransitEvents Process Group (PG)
1.1 Create Label for Process Group
1. Return to the NiFi root level by clicking on the Nifi Flow label at the lower left corner:

2. Add a Label  onto the NiFi canvas for the new process group. Right click, Change color to Blue.
3. Right click, select configure and name it Extract Transit Key Values pairs (Timestamp, Direction, Latitude, Longitude, Vehicle_ID, Vehicle_Speed) From XML FlowFiles using XPath Expression. Choose Font Size to 18px.

Step 1: Create a Process Group (PG)
1. Add a new Process Group onto the NiFi canvas and name it ParseTransitEvents

2. Double click on the new Process Group to enter it.

Step 2: Add an Input Port to Ingest Data Into this PG
1. Add the Input Port  component onto the NiFi canvas. Name it IngestRawTransitEvents.

Step 3: Add EvaluateXPath to Extract the Timestamp for Transit Observation
1. Add the EvaluateXPath processor onto the NiFi canvas.
2. Connect IngestRawTransitEvents input port to EvaluateXPath processor. When the Create Connection window appears, click Add.

Figure 1: Connect IngestRawTransitEvents to EvaluateXPath
3. Open the processor configuration properties tab. Add the properties listed in Table 1 and if the original properties have values, update them. For the second property in Table 1, add a new dynamic property for XPath expression, select the plus ( + ) button. Insert the following property name and value into your properties tab as shown in the table below:
Table 1: Update EvaluateXPath Properties Tab

Property
Value
Destination
flowfile-attribute
Last_Time
//body/lastTime/@time


Destination result from XPath evaluation stored into FlowFile attribute

Last_Time is a FlowFile Attribute and XPath expression that retrieves value of time node in the XML file



Figure 2: EvaluateXPath Configuration Property Tab Window
4. Open the processor config Settings tab, change the name to ExtractTimestamp, then under Auto terminate relationships, check the failure and unmatched checkboxes. Click Apply.
Step 4: Add SplitXml to Split A FlowFile into Multiple Separate FlowFiles
1. Add the SplitXml processor onto the NiFi canvas.
2. Connect ExtractTimestamp to SplitXML processor. When the Create Connection window appears, verify matched checkbox is checked, else check it. Click Add.

Figure 3: Connect EvaluateXPath to SplitXML
3. Keep SplitXML default configuration properties.
4. Since each property is updated, navigate to the Scheduling tab and change the Run Schedule from 0 sec to 1 sec, so the processor executes a task every 1 second.
5. Open the processor config Settings tab, under Auto terminate relationships, check the failure and original checkboxes. Click Apply.
Step 5: Add EvaluateXPath to Extract Transit Observations
1. Add the EvaluateXPath processor onto the NiFi canvas.
2. Connect SplitXML to EvaluateXPath processor. When the Create Connection window appears, verify split checkbox is checked, if not check it. Click Add.

Figure 4: Connect SplitXML to EvaluateXPath
3. Open the processor configuration properties tab. Add the properties listed in Table 2 and if the original properties have values, update them. For the remaining properties in Table 2, add new dynamic properties for XPath expressions, click on the ( + ) button. Insert the following property name and value into your properties tab as shown in the table below:
Table 2: Update EvaluateXPath Properties Tab

Property
Value
Destination
flowfile-attribute
Direction_of_Travel
//vehicle/@dirTag
Latitude
//vehicle/@lat
Longitude
//vehicle/@lon
Vehicle_ID
//vehicle/@id
Vehicle_Speed
//vehicle/@speedKmHr


Destination set to FlowFile attribute because the result of values from XPath expressions need to be stored in FlowFile attributes.

5 user-defined attributes each represent data related to transit observations associated with the timestamp extracted earlier.


4. Open the processor config Settings tab, change the name to ExtractTransitObservations, then under Auto terminate relationships, check the failure and unmatched checkboxes. Click Apply.
Step 6: Add an Output Port to Route Data Outside this PG
1. Add the Output Port  component onto the NiFi canvas. Name it ParsedTransitEvents.
2. Connect ExtractTransitObservations to ParsedTransitEvents output port. When the Create Connection window appears, verify matched checkbox is checked, if not check it. Click Add.

Figure 5: Connect ExtractTransitObservations to ParsedTransitEvents
Step 7: Connect SimulateXmlTransitEvents to ParseTransitEvents
1. Re-enter the NiFi Flow breadcrumb.

2. Connect SimulateXmlTransitEvents to ParseTransitEvents process group. When the Create Connection window appears, verify From Output = RawTransitEvents and connects to To Input = IngestRawTransitEvents. Click Add.

Figure 6: Connection of SimulateXmlTransitEvents and ParseTransitEvents process group.
Step 8: Verify ParseTransitEvents Extracts Values From SimulateXmlTransitEvents
1. Hold Shift, press on the mouse and hover over process groups to select them, then hit the start button  located in the Operate Palette to activate the dataflow.

2. Double click on ParseTransitEvents process group. Right click on the ExtractTransitObservations processor, select View Data Provenance.

3. View any event by selecting the view provenance event icon
4. Pick a row from the list of events, click on the "i" to the left of that row. Then click on the Attributes tab. Select Show modified attributes only to display only the attributes being parsed with XPath expression language. As long as you see values mapped to their attribute name, you have verified the processor is extracting XML data from the flowfile successfully.

Figure 7: ExtractTransitObservations parses the XML data for Direction_of_Travel, Latitude, Longitude, Vehicle_ID, Vehicle_Speed.
Approach 2: Import ParseTransitEvents Process Group
Warning: If you Imported the Previous DataFlow, Read these steps first
1. In your process group, if there are any queues left with data, remove the data. Right click the queue, select Empty queue, click EMPTY.
2. Navigate back to the NiFi Flow breadcrumb level to delete your flow.
To delete your previous flow, hold command or ctrl and press A to highlight your dataflow, then press delete or backspace.
Import the New DataFlow Template
3. Download the tutorial-4-ParseTransitEvents.xml template file.
4. Use the template icon  located in the Operate Palette.
5. Browse, find the template file, click Open and hit Upload.
6. From the Components Toolbar, drag the template icon  onto the graph and select the tutorial-4-ParseTransitEvents.xml template file.
7. Hit the start button  to activate the dataflow.

Figure 8: tutorial4-ParseTransitEvents.xml template includes a NiFi Flow that pulls in San Francisco Muni Transit Events from the XML Simulator, parses through the data to extract key values and stores the transit observations as a JSON file.
Overview of the Process Groups and their Processors:

SimulateXmlTransitEvents (Process Group)

GetFile fetches the vehicle location simulator data for files in a directory.
UnpackContent decompresses the contents of FlowFiles from the traffic simulator zip file.
ControlRate controls the rate at which FlowFiles are transferred to follow-on processors enabling traffic simulation.
UpdateAttribute renames every FlowFile to give them unique names
PutFile stores data to local file system
Output Port makes the connection for the process group to connect to other components (process groups, processors, etc)


ParseTransitEvents (Process Group)

Input Port ingests data from SimulateXmlTransitEvents Process Group
ExtractTimestamp extracts the timestamp of the last update for vehicle location data returned from each FlowFile.
SplitXML splits the parent's child elements into separate FlowFiles. Since vehicle is a child element in our xml file, each new vehicle element is stored separately.
ExtractTransitObservations extracts attributes: vehicle id, direction, latitude, longitude and speed from vehicle element in each FlowFile.
Output Port outputs data with the new FlowFile attribute (key/values) to the rest of the flow



Refer to NiFi's Documentation to learn more about each processor described above.
Summary
Congratulations! You just built a NiFi ParseTransitEvents process group to parse the XML content and extract transit observations into FlowFile attributes. The Input Port pulls data from the SimulateXmlTransitEvents process group, which goes into an ExtractTimestamp processor to pull out the timestamp for the vehicle observation and add that timestamp as a FlowFile attribute. The FlowFile content rows are then split into multiple FlowFiles via SplitXml processor. These single FlowFile records are routed to another ExtractTransitObservations processor to extract transit observations for multiple transit vehicles of that timestamp from earlier. This data with new FlowFile attributes is routed to the rest of the flow via Output Port.
