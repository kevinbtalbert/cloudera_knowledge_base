Summary

Implement a Zeppelin Notebook to Visualize Sentiment Scores
Create Hive Table Mapping to HBase Table
To visualize the data stored in HBase, you can use zeppelin's JDBC Hive Interpreter:

%jdbc(hive)
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tweets_sentiment(`key` BIGINT, `handle` STRING, `language` STRING, `location` STRING, `sentiment` DOUBLE, `tweet_id` BIGINT)
STORED BY 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HBaseStorageHandler'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES("hbase.columns.mapping" = ":key,social_media_sentiment:twitter.handle,social_media_sentiment:twitter.language,social_media_sentiment:twitter.location,social_media_sentiment:twitter.sentiment,social_media_sentiment:twitter.tweet_id")
TBLPROPERTIES("hbase.table.name" = "tweets_sentiment");


Load a Sample of the Data
Load data from the Hive table:

%jdbc(hive)
SELECT * FROM tweets_sentiment;


Visualize Sentiment Score Per Language in Bar Chart
To see each tweet's sentiment score per language, copy and paste the following query.

%jdbc(hive)
SELECT language, sentiment FROM tweets_sentiment;


Summary
Congratulations! You just learned to write Hive code to access an HBase table, query against the table and visualize the data using Zeppelin's JDBC Hive Interpreter.
