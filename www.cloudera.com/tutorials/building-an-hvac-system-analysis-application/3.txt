Introduction
You have been brought onto the project as a Data Engineer with the following responsibilities: acquire the HVAC sensor data feed, split the feed into two separate flows and store them into their respective locations in storage. You have been tasked with using Apache NiFi to build this portion of the data pipeline.
Prerequisites

Enabled CDA for your appropriate system
Set up the Development Environment

Outline

Approach 1: Build a NiFi Flow to Acquire HVAC Sensor Data
Approach 2: Import NiFi AcquireHVACData Process Group via UI
Approach 3: Auto Deploy NiFi Flow via REST Call
Summary

Approach 1: Build a NiFi Flow to Acquire HVAC Sensor Data
After starting your sandbox, open HDF NiFi UI at http://sandbox-hdf.hortonworks.com:9090/nifi.
Create AcquireHVACData Process Group
Drop the process group icon  onto the NiFi canvas.
Add the Process Group Name: AcquireHVACData or one of your choice.

Double click on the process group to dive into it. At the bottom of the canvas, you will see NiFi Flow >> AcquireHVACData breadcrumb. Let's began connecting the processors for data ingestion, preprocessing and storage.
Ingest Sensor Data Source
Drop the processor icon onto the NiFi canvas. Add the GetHTTP.

Hold control + mouse click on GetHTTP to configure the processor:

Click APPLY.
Store the Data Into Storage
Drop the processor icon onto the NiFi canvas. Add 2 PutHDFS processors.
Create connection between RouteOnAttribute and both PutHDFS processors. Hover over RouteOnAttribute to see arrow icon, press on processor and connect it to PutHDFS. Repeat the the previous step to connect to the other PutHDFS processor.
For one of the PutHDFS processors, Configure Create Connection:

Connection
Value

building_csv (checked)

Click ADD.
For the other PutHDFS processor, Configure Create Connection:

Click APPLY.
Start Process Group Flow to Acquire Data
At the breadcrumb, select NiFi Flow level. Hold control + mouse click on the AcquireHVACData process group, then click the start option.

Once NiFi writes your sensor data to HDFS, which you can check by viewing data provenance, you can turn off the process group by holding control + mouse click on the AcquireHVACData process group, then choose stop option.
Verify NiFi Stored Data
Enter the AcquireHVACData process group, press control + mouse click on PutHDFS processor of your choice, then press View data provenance.

Press on i icon on the left row to view details about a provenance event. Choose the event with the type SEND. In the Provenance Event window, choose CONTENT tab. On Output Claim, choose VIEW.

You will be able to see the data NiFi sent to the external process HDFS via NiFi's data provenance. The data below shows hvac dataset.

Let's verify that the data is actually present in HDFS from Ambari Files View. Login to HDP Ambari at http://sandbox-hdp.hortonowrks.com:8080.
Click the Ambari Views selector at the top right corner, then click Files View.
By entering the path: /sandbox/sensor/hvac_building, you should be able to view the .csv data for building.csv. The HVAC.csv is in the hvac_temperature folder.

The building.csv data does look distorted, but when we clean it further with Apache Hive, it will be formatted appropriately in a table.
Approach 2: Import NiFi AcquireHVACData Process Group via UI
Head to HDF Ambari at http://sandbox-hdp.hortonowrks.com:8080 with login user admin and the password you set, then enter the NiFi UI using Ambari Quick Link and import the NiFi template.
Download the NiFi template acquire-hvac-data.xml to your local computer.
After starting your sandbox, open HDF NiFi UI at http://sandbox-hdf.hortonworks.com:9090/nifi.
Open the Operate panel if not already open, then press the Upload Template icon .
Press on Select Template icon .
The file browser on your local computer will appear, find acquire-hvac-data.xml template you just downloaded, then press Open, then press UPLOAD.
You should receive a notification that the Template successfully imported. Press OK to acknowledge.
Drop the Template icon  onto the NiFi canvas.
Add Template called acquire-hvac-data.
Start the NiFi flow. Hold control + mouse click on the AcquireHVACData process group, then click the start option.

Once NiFi writes your sensor data to HDFS, which you can check quickly by looking at the PutHDFS processors inside the process group, you can turn off the process group by holding control + mouse click on the AcquireHVACData process group, then choose stop option.
Approach 3: Auto Deploy NiFi Flow via REST Call
Open CDF Sandbox Web Shell Client at http://sandbox-hdf.hortonworks.com:4200. Copy and paste the following shell code:

NIFI_TEMPLATE="acquire-hvac-data"
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/data-tutorials/master/tutorials/cda/building-an-hvac-system-analysis-application/application/development/shell/nifi-auto-deploy.sh
bash nifi-auto-deploy.sh $NIFI_TEMPLATE

Open HDF NiFi UI at http://sandbox-hdf.hortonworks.com:9090/nifi. You will see the NiFi template was uploaded, imported and started.

Once NiFi writes your sensor data to HDFS, which you can check quickly by looking at the PutHDFS processors inside the process group, you can turn off the process group by holding control + mouse click on the AcquireHVACData process group, then choose stop option.
Summary
Congratulations! You have now added a NiFi dataflow to the data pipeline to ingest the data from the sensors embedded on HVAC machine systems, prepared the data to be in a readable format for external services to do data analysis. In the next portion of the data pipeline, you will use Apache Hive to perform cleaning and analysis on the data.
