Introduction
Your next objective is to act as a Data Analyst and use Apache Zeppelin built-in visualization tools to provide insights on your data, such as illustrating which countries have the most extreme temperature and the amount of NORMAL events there are compared to HOT and COLD. You will also illustrate which HVAC units result in the most extremetemp readings.
Prerequisites

Enabled CDA for your appropriate system
Set up the Development Environment
Acquired HVAC Sensor Data
Cleaned Raw HVAC Data

Outline

Visualize HVAC Building Temperature Characteristics Per Country
Visualize Extreme Temperature in Buildings Having HVAC Products

Visualize HVAC Building Temperature Characteristics Per Country
Click on Zeppelin Notebook service in Ambari stack, in the box on the rightside called Quick Links, click on Zeppelin UI.
Click Create new note.
Insert Note Name as Visualizing-HVAC-Machine-Sensor-Data, select jdbc for default interpreter, then click Create.
We will use the JDBC Hive interpreter to run Hive queries and visualize the results.
First we need to select the columns from hvac_sensors.hvac_building table that will illustrate hvac_building country location, whether temperature in a hvac_building is extreme and what the temprange level is for an hvac_building. Copy and paste the Hive query:

%jdbc(hive)
SELECT country, extremetemp, temprange FROM hvac_sensors.hvac_building LIMIT 1000;


Select the bar chart button located just under the query to change the table visualization to bar chart.

Let's further configure this chart, click settings to open up more available fields.

Arrange the fields according to the following image.
Drag the field temprange into the groups box.
Click SUM on extremetemp and change it to COUNT.
Make sure that country is the only field under Keys.


From the chart above we can see the countries that HVAC Buildings come from that have the most extreme temperature indicated by a count for extremetemp associated with temprange level for NORMAL events there are compared to HOT and COLD.
Visualize Extreme Temperature in Buildings Having HVAC Products
Is it possible to figure out which buildings might need HVAC upgrades, and which do not? Let’s determine that answer in the steps ahead...
Let's create one more note to visualize which types of HVAC systems result in the least amount of extremetemp readings.
Copy and paste the Hive query into the next Zeppelin note:

%jdbc(hive)

select hvacproduct, extremetemp from hvac_sensors.hvac_building;


Arrange the fields according to the following image so we can recreate the chart below.
Now choose bar chart, then arrange the fields for hvacproduct and extremetemp.

Make sure that hvacproduct is in the Keys box.
Make sure that extremetemp is in the Values box and that it is set to COUNT.


Now we can see which HVAC units result in the most extremetemp readings. Thus we can make a more informed decision when purchasing new HVAC systems.
Summary
We’ve successfully gained more insights on our data by visualizing certain key attributes using Apache Zeppelin. We learned to visualize a graph that shows the countries that have the most extreme temperature and the amount of NORMAL events there are compared to HOT and COLD. We learned to see which HVAC units result in the most extremetemp readings.
