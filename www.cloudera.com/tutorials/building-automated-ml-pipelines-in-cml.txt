 Tutorials
Building Automated ML Pipelines in Cloudera Machine Learning



















 
Introduction
 
Data Lifecycle - Predictive Analytics. Using synthetic datasets for an electric car company, we will predict the amount of inventory that may be required for a specific part based on historical part consumption. We will create a pipeline that when new data is collected, it will automatically predict inventory needed for seven (7), fourteen (14) and twenty-one (21) days.
 






 
Prerequisites
 

Have access to Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud
Have created a CDP workload User
Ensure proper CML role access
MLUser - ability to run workloads
MLAdmin - ability to create and delete workspaces


Basic AWS CLI skills

The video below provides a brief overview of what is covered in this tutorial:
 



























 



 









 



 
Download Assets
 
There are two (2) options in getting assets for this tutorial:

Download a ZIP file

It contains all necessary files used in this tutorial. Remember its location. No need to unzip the file.

Clone GitHub repository

It provides assets used in this and other tutorials; organized by tutorial title.
 






 
Create ML Workspace
 






If your environment doesn’t already have a Machine Learning Workspace provisioned, let’s provision it.
Select Machine Learning from Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) home page:
 
















 



 









 



In the ML Workspaces section, select Provision Workspace.
Two simple pieces of information are needed to provision an ML workspace - Workspace Name and the Environment name. For example:

Workspace Name: Electric-Car-ML
Environment: <your environment name>
Select Provision Workspace

 
















 



 









 



 
Create Project
 






Beginning from the ML Workspaces section:

Open your workspace by selecting on its name: Electric-Car-ML
Select New Project

Complete the New Project form using:

Project Name: Electric-Car-Inventory
Project Description:
This project houses machine learning code that creates models that predict the amount of inventory for any given part that should be produced based on historical part consumption and future car production rate. All data within this project is synthetic.


Initial Setup: Local Files
Upload or Drag-Drop tutorial-files.zip you downloaded earlier
Select Create Project

 
















 



 









 



 
Create and Test Model
 






Now that we have a working machine learning environment, let’s create a session. We will create a workbench editor with a Python 3 interpreter to create and test our model.
 
Beginning from the Projects section, select your project name, Electric-Car-Inventory.
Select New Session and complete the session form:

Session Name: Build Model
Editor: Workbench
Kernel: Python 3
Engine Image: <use default>
Resource Profile: <use default, 1 vCPU / 2 GiB Memory>
Select Start Session

 
















 



 









 



In the bottom of the session, we will find a command line prompt. Issue the following command to install the dependent libraries for this project (xgboost, sklearn and Faker):
!sh ./cdsw-build.sh
NOTE: You only need to install dependent libraries once - this step can be skipped on future sessions.
 
















 



 









 



Select file, Part_Modeling.py and click on  to run the entire program.
Using the datasets provided, a linear regression model will be created and tested.
Now that we’ve created our model, we no longer need this session - select Stop to terminate the session.
 
















 



 









 



 
Create Jobs with Dependencies
 






 
We will create a machine learning pipeline that consists of four (4) jobs. When the main job, Collect Data is run, dependent jobs will automatically run; each predicting the number of parts needed in that time.
Beginning from the Jobs section, select New Job and fill out the form as follows:

Name: Data Collection
Script: data_generator.py
Arguments: <leave blank>
Engine Kernel: Python 3
Schedule: Manual
Select Create Job

Repeat using:

Name: EV Part Forecast 7 Days
Script: Part_Modeling.py
Arguments: 12 15 18 a42CLDR 7
Engine Kernel: Python 3
Schedule: Dependent, Data Collection
Select Create Job

Repeat using:

Name: EV Part Forecast 14 Days
Script: Part_Modeling.py
Arguments: 12 15 18 a42CLDR 14
Engine Kernel: Python 3
Schedule: Dependent, Data Collection
Select Create Job

Repeat using:

Name: EV Part Forecast 21 Days

Script: Part_Modeling.py
Arguments: 12 15 18 a42CLDR 21
Engine Kernel: Python 3
Schedule: Dependent, Data Collection
Select Create Job

 
















 



 









 



Your  machine learning pipeline should look like this:
 
















 



 









 



Now that you’ve created your pipeline, whenever you manually run the Data Collection job, the other three forecasting jobs will run automatically. To see the prediction results for each job, select the job’s name. Take a look at the History and select the Run you’re interested in.
 






 
Deploy Model
 






Let’s create three (3) models so that they could be run programmatically from somewhere else.
Beginning from the Models section, select New Model and fill out the form as follows:

Name: EV Part Prediction Model 7 Days
Description: One week prediction
Disable Authentication
File: model-wrapper.py
Function: PredictFunc
Example Input: 
{  "model_C_sales": "40"
 ,  "model_D_sales": "82"
 ,  "model_R_sales":"34"
 ,  "part_no": "a42CLDR"
 ,  "time_delta": "7"} 
Kernel: Python 3
Select Deploy Model

Repeat using:

Name: EV Part Prediction Model 14 Days
Description: Two week prediction
Disable Authentication
File: model-wrapper.py
Function: PredictFunc
Example Input: 
{  "model_C_sales": "40"
 ,  "model_D_sales": "82"
 ,  "model_R_sales":"34"
 ,  "part_no": "a42CLDR"
 ,  "time_delta": "14"} 
Kernel: Python 3
Select Deploy Model

Repeat using:

Name: EV Part Prediction Model 21 Days
Description: Three week prediction
Disable Authentication
File: model-wrapper.py
Function: PredictFunc
Example Input: 
{  "model_C_sales": "40"
 ,  "model_D_sales": "82"
 ,  "model_R_sales":"34"
 ,  "part_no": "a42CLDR"
 ,  "time_delta": "21"}
Kernel: Python 3
Select Deploy Model

 
















 



 









 



Your models should look like this:
 
















 



 









 



You can now run your model programmatically from almost anywhere - shell, Python, R. Select a model name to test the API.
 
















 



 









 



 
Summary
 
Congratulations on completing the tutorial.
As you have seen, it is easy to use Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) on Cloudera Data platform. This is only the beginning - there is so much more to learn.
