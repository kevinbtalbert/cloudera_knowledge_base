 Tutorials
From 0 to Query with Cloudera Data Warehouse



















 
Introduction
 
In this tutorial you’ll learn how to analyze datasets using Data Analytics Studio (DAS) on Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) - Public Cloud. We will also visualize data using a common Business Intelligence (BI) tool - Tableau.






 
Prerequisites
 

Have access to Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud with a Data Lake running.
Basic AWS CLI skills
(optionally) Installed Tableau. For this tutorial, we're using Tableau Desktop version 2020.2.0 for Windows.

The video below provides a brief overview of what is covered in this tutorial:
 



























 



 









 



 
Become Familiar with Data Analytics Studio (DAS)
 
There are 3 tabs to interact with in Data Analytics Studio:
Queries: Allows you to view, search and run previously executed queries. Clicking on query provides additional information such as query details, visual explain, configurations and timeline.







 



 




 
Compose: Worksheets are used to write SQL statements. You can execute SQL statements, view results and get visual explain for queries. You can also save worksheets for re-running later or download results as a CSV file.







 



 




 
Database: Provides detailed information about the structure and metadata of tables within databases.







 



 




 
Create Virtual Warehouse
 
Before we create a virtual warehouse, we need to make sure the environment is activated and running.
If you see  next to the environment name, no need to activate it because it's already been activated and running.
Otherwise, click on  to activate the environment. This will create the default database catalog; environment_name-default.
In the Virtual Warehouse section, click on  to create a virtual warehouse:

Name: usermarketing-demo
Type: HIVE
Virtual Warehouse Catalog: usermarketing-default
Virtual Warehouse Size: XSMALL
AutoSuspend Timeout: 300 seconds
Nodes: Min: 2, Max: 4
WaitTime: 30 seconds
Click CREATE








 



 




 
Create and Populate Table
 
Open DAS from your virtual warehouse.
Beginning from CDP home page > Data Warehouse:

Click on Overview
Search for your Virtual Warehouse
Click on 
Open DAS








 



 




 
Now that we have DAS opened, click on Compose, copy-paste the following DDL into the Worksheet, make one modification, then execute:

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS usedcars (
  id            INT,
  year          INT,
  manufacturer  STRING,
  model         STRING,
  price         DECIMAL(12,2),
  odometer      INT,
  color         STRING,
  transmission  STRING,
  cylinders     STRING,
  fuel          STRING,
  condition     STRING,
  title_status  STRING,
  region        STRING,
  url           STRING,
  description   STRING
)

ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE
-- Modify <storage-location> with Hive Metastore attribute:
--                      hive.metastore.warehouse.external.dir
LOCATION '<storage-location>/usedcars'
tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count"="1")

NOTE: The modification needed above is to specify the storage location for the CSV file. Download dataset and place it in the storage location.
For example:

Hive Metastore attribute hive.metastore.warehouse.external.dir is s3a://usermarketing-cdp-demo/warehouse/tablespace/external/hive
modify <storage-location> with s3a://usermarketing-cdp-demo/warehouse/tablespace/external/hive
After I downloaded/decompressed dataset, I used AWS CLI to copy the file using command:
aws s3 cp usedcars.csv s3://usermarketing-cdp-demo/warehouse/tablespace/external/hive/usedcars/usedcars.csv

















 



 











 




 



 




 
Let's run a simple query to get the average price of cars, grouped by the model year. Copy-Paste the following query into the Worksheet and execute:


SELECT year, CAST(AVG(price) AS DECIMAL(12,2)) AS avg_price, count(*) AS num_cars
  FROM usedcars
  WHERE year > 1900
    AND year <= 2021
  GROUP BY year
  ORDER BY year DESC
;

 







 



 




 
Visualize Data
 
Two things are needed to visualize data using Tableau.

JDBC Driver (*.jar)
JDBC URL

Both of these may be obtained by our virtual warehouse. Starting from CDP home page > Data Warehouse:

Click on Overview
Search for your Virtual Warehouse
Click on 
select Copy JDBC URL or Download JDBC Jar








 



 




 
We will use Tableau for our BI tool. According to Tableau's website, the JDBC driver must be stored in specific location:

Windows: C:\Program Files\Tableau\Drivers
Mac: ~/Library/Tableau/Drivers
Linux: /opt/tableau/tableau_driver/jdbc

 
To begin visualizing your data, Open Tableau:

Select Other Databases (JDBC)
URL: Past the URL you copied from your virtual warehouse
Dialect: SQL92
Username/Password: use credentials used to connect to DAS
Sign In








 



 




 
In the Data Source tab:

select default schema
select and drag table usedcars to the top-right








 



 




 
Select Sheet 1 tab:

select and drag Year into Columns
select and drag Price into Rows
modify measure for Price to use Average








 



 




 
Finally, for our finishing touches:

click on Show Me and select area charts
right-click on Avg. Price > Edit Axis > Uncheck Include zero








 



 




 
Summary
 
Congratulations on completing the tutorial.
As you have seen, it is easy to analyze datasets using Data Analytics Studio (DAS) on Cloudera Data Platform (CDP). I'm sure you will agree that connecting a BI tool, in this case Tableau, was easy and painless.
