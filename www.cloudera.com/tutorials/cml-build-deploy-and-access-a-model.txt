 Tutorials
Build, Deploy and Access a Model in Cloudera Machine Learning



















 
Introduction
 
See for yourself how easy it is to use Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) on Cloudera Data Platform Public Cloud (CDP-PC).
In this tutorial, we will create a linear regression model using housing data, deploy the model within CML, and test it using a web application.
 






 
Prerequisites
 

Have access to Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud
Have created a CDP workload User
Ensure proper CML role access
MLUser - ability to run workloads
MLAdmin - ability to create and delete workspaces


Installed npm (Node Package Manager)

The video below provides a brief overview of what is covered in this tutorial:
 



























 



 









 



 
Download Assets
 
Download and unzip tutorial files; remember this location.
For now, this is all we need to do. We will use these files later in the tutorial.
Note: House price dataset is publicly available from Kaggle.

 






 
Setup ML Environment
 
Create Workspace
 
If you don’t already have a machine learning workspace provisioned for you, let’s create it.
Select Machine Learning from Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) home page:
 
















 



 









 



 
In the ML Workspaces section, select Provision Workspace:
 
















 



 









 



 
Two simple pieces of information are needed to a provision workspace - Workspace Name and Environment. For example:

Workspace Name: cml-tutorial
Environment: usermarketing
Select Provision Workspace

 
















 



 









 



 
Create Project
 
Beginning from the ML Workspaces section:

Open your workspace by selecting on its name: cml-tutorial

Select New Project

 
















 



 









 



 
Complete the New Project form using:

Project Name: Predicting House Prices

Project Visibility: Public

Initial Setup: Local
Upload or Drag-Drop cml-project-houseprice.zip you downloaded earlier

Create Project


 
















 



 









 



 
Create Model
 
Train Model
 
Now that we have a working environment, let’s create a session in our project. We will use the housing data to train a linear regression model. 
 
Beginning from the Projects section, select the project name, Predicting House Prices.
Select New Session and complete the session form:

Session Name: Home Price Prototype

Editor: Workbench

Kernel: Python 3

Engine Image: Default

Resource Profile: Default (1 vCPU / 2 GiB Memory)

Start Session


 
















 



 









 



 
Let’s open a terminal window by selecting, >_ Terminal Access and type:
sh cdsw-build.sh
This will install the dependent libraries needed for the project (sklearn, pandas and numpy). Once it completes, close the terminal window.
 
















 



 









 



NOTE: You only need to install dependent libraries once - this step can be skipped in future sessions.
 
Select file, train-model.py and click on  to run the entire program.
Using house_data.csv, a linear regression model will be created and saved in a new file called, housePredictor.pickle.
Now that we’ve created our model, we no longer need this session - select Stop to terminate the session.
 
















 



 









 



 
Add Model to Project
 
In the Models section, select New Model to add the model we’ve just created to the project. Complete form as follows:
Name: HousePredictor
Description: Predicts the price of a home
File: model-wrapper.py
Function: PredictFunc
Example Input:

{
  "bathrooms": "2",
  "bedrooms": "3",
  "sqft_living": "1800",
  "sqft_lot": "2200",
  "floors": "1",
  "waterfront": "1",
  "condition": "3"
}

Example Output: { "result" : 100000 }
Kernel: Python 3
Engine Profile: Default
Replicas: 1
Select Deploy Model
 
















 



 









 



 
Setup and Run Web Application
 
There are two pieces of information we need to get before we could deploy the website.
Beginning from the Projects section, select the project name, Predicting House Prices. Next, select the model name, HousePredictor.
 
















 



 









 



 
Under the Overview and Shell tabs, capture hostURL and accessKey.
 
As part of the download assets, we provided a folder named, cml-webapp-houseprice. Using your favorite editor, modify cml-webapp-houseprice/src/App.js by replacing:
<accessKey> with accessKey
<hostURL> with hostURL
 
















 



 









 



 
In the command line, move into folder cml-webapp-houseprice and run the following commands:
npm install
npm start
 
















 



 









 



 
A new browser window/tab should automatically open using http://localhost:3000. You are encouraged to play with different home configurations and see its predicted value.
 
















 



 









 



Congratulations on completing the tutorial.
While playing with the web application, you may have noticed interesting price values being predicated. If you in the mood for a good challenge, modify train-model.py and improve the model.
As you have seen, it is easy to use Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) to deploy your machine learning projects. This is only the beginning - there is so much more to learn.
