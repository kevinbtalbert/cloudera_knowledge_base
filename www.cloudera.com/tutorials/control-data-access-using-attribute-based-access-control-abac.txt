 Tutorials
Control Data Access using Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)



















Introduction
Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) leverages the best tools for data security and governance - Apache Atlas and Apache Ranger. Administrators can easily define security policies based on Atlas metadata tags and apply a security policy in real-time to the entire hierarchy of entities, including databases, tables, and columns.
You will learn how to classify your data, who can access the data and how to mask the data.






 
Prerequisites
 

Have access to Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud
Be familiar with Cloudera Essentials for CDP (A Tour of the CDP User Interface)

Environment Setup
 

























 



 



























 



Our environment consists of

One Hive table (employee_data) - focus on salary column.

Three users (your environment will be different)
gdeleon, administrator; associated with group cdp_sandbox-default
joe_analyst, user; not associated with any group
ivanna_eu_hr, user; not associated with any group



 
Let's begin:
Select Data Warehouse from Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) home page







 



 




 
Open DAS by first locating your virtual warehouse, then:

Click on 
Open DAS








 



 




 
From Data Analytics Studio (DAS):

Click Compose
Enter the following code in the Worksheet


CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS dbgr;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dbgr.employee_data (
  id INT,
  first_name  STRING,
  last_name   STRING,
  email       STRING,
  title       STRING,
  salary      DECIMAL(10,2)
);

INSERT INTO dbgr.employee_data
  SELECT INLINE(array(
 struct(1  ,  "Patty"     ,  "Harvison"   ,  "PattyHarvison@somewhere.com"     ,  "Accountant I"              ,  48532.04)

));




EXECUTE








 



 




 
Have each user (gdeleon, joe_analyst and ivanna_eu_hr) run the query below. It should be successful for everyone.

SELECT * FROM dbgr.employee_data;








 



 




 
Create Classification (Atlas)
 

























 



 



























 



Open Atlas for your tenant:

Beginning from CDP home page > Data Warehouse:

Click on Overview
Search for your Database Catalog
Click on 
Open Atlas








 



 




 
Let's create a new classification:

Click on CLASSIFICATION
Select PLUS symbol











 



 




 
Create a new classification, sensitive, with the following attributes:

Name sensitive
Description holds sensitive data











 



 




 
Search for the table we want to assign this new classification.
Use the following search criteria:

Basic search
Search By Type hive_table

Search By Text employee_data

Click on Search
Click on table name - employee_data









 



 




 
Let's assign our new classification, sensitive, to column salary:

Click on Schema

Click on + sign, next to column salary

Select sensitive and Propagate option

Click Add









 



 




 
Create Tag Based Policy (Ranger)






Open Ranger for your tenant:

Beginning from CDP home page > Data Warehouse:

Click on Overview
Search for your Database Catalog
Click on 
Open Ranger








 



 




 
Let's create a tag-based policy, also known as, Access-Based Attribute Control (ABAC).

Click on Access Manager
Select Tag Based Policies
Click on cm_tag to edit existing service

Note: Your service name may be different from ours.







 



 




 
We have two policy types to choose from: Access and Masking. Let's look at both.
 
Access Policy
 

























 



 



























 



Access policies allow us to place restrictions on data columns that are specially marked. In this example, we will restrict our sensitive classified columns only to users in group cdp_sandbox-default and joe_analyst. No one else should be able to access or read data marked as sensitive.

Select Access tab, then Add New Policy.
 
Add a new policy using:


Policy Type Access
Policy Name sensitive_access
TAG sensitive
Description access to sensitive classified columns
Audit Logging YES
enabled
Allow Conditions #1: > Select Group > cdp_sandbox-default
Allow Conditions #1: > Component Permissions > hive(all permissions)
Allow Conditions #2: > Select User > joe_analyst
Allow Conditions #2: > Component Permissions > hive(only select permissions)
Deny All Other Accesses True
click on Add








 



 




 
Have each user (gdeleon, joe_analyst and ivanna_eu_hr) re-run the query below.

SELECT * FROM dbgr.employee_data;

User gdeleon belongs to group cdp_sandbox-default, therefore it successfully ran.
User joe_analyst was explicitly given select access, therefore it successfully ran.
 
It failed for ivanna_eu_hr - Permission denied: user [ivanna_eu_hr] does not have [SELECT] privilege. This user does not belong to group cdp_sandbox-default nor was given select access.
Using the select statement below, let's modify the query by removing the sensitive column (salary); statement now runs successfully.

select id,first_name,last_name,email,title from dbgr.employee_data;

 
Knowledge growth questions/problems:

Disable/Enable the policy, what happens?
Modify the policy to allow ivanna_eu_hr select privileges

 
Masking Policy
 

























 



 



























 



We are going place viewing restrictions on our sensitive classified columns. Although a user may have access to the sensitive data, we may want mask the real data.
Only users in group cdp_sandbox-default should see real data. All others should see masked data.

Select Masking tab, then Add New Policy.
 
Add a new policy using:


Policy Type Masking
Policy Name sensitive_masking
TAG sensitive
Description mask sensitive data
Audit Logging YES
enabled
Mask Conditions #1: > Select Group > cdp_sandbox-default
Mask Conditions #1: > Access Types > hive(select)
Mask Conditions #1: > Select Masking Option > Unmasked(retain original value)
Mask Conditions #2: > Select User > joe_analyst
Mask Conditions #2: > Access Types > hive(select)
Mask Conditions #2: > Select Masking Option > Nullify

Click on Add








 



 




 
Have user (gdeleon) re-run the query below. It runs successfully - showing all data; no masking.

SELECT * FROM dbgr.employee_data;








 



 




 
Have user (joe_analyst) re-run the query below. It runs successfully. However, salary data is masked with nulls.

SELECT * FROM dbgr.employee_data;








 



 




 
Knowledge growth questions/problems:

Disable/Enable the mask policy, what happens?
Modify the masking policy to conceal data with a different option, other than nulls.








 
Summary
Great job! You have learned to classify your data, created an access policy to restrict access and created a masking policy to preventing users for seeing sensitive data.
