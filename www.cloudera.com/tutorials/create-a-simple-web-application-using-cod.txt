 Tutorials
Create a Simple Web Application using Cloudera Operational Database



















 
Introduction
 
See for yourself how easy it is to create a simple inventory management web application using Cloudera Operational Database (COD) and Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) on Cloudera Data Platform (CDP).
 






 
Prerequisites
 

Have access to Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud
Have created a CDP workload User
Ensure proper CML role access
MLUser: ability to run workloads
MLAdmin: ability to create and delete workspaces

The video below provides a brief overview of what is covered in this tutorial:
 



























 



 









 



 
Download Assets
 
There are two (2) options in getting assets for this tutorial:

Download a ZIP file

It contains only necessary files used in this tutorial. Remember its location. No need to unzip the file.

Clone our GitHub repository

It provides assets used in this and other tutorials; organized by tutorial title.
 






 
Setup Operational Database
 
If your environment doesn’t already have a database created, let’s create one.
Select Operational Database from Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) home page:
 
















 



 









 



 
Two simple pieces of information are needed to create a database - the Environment name and Database name. For example:

Environment: <your environment name>
Database Name: sample-opdb
Select Create Database

 
















 



 









 



 
Get Database Connection URL
 

Open your database by selecting its name, sample-opdb.
Select Phoenix Python tab
Copy the Phoenix Python URL
Later in the tutorial, we will use this URL to configure our web application to connect to this database.

 
















 



 









 



 
Setup Machine Learning
 
Provision ML Workspace
 
If your environment doesn’t already have a Machine Learning Workspace provisioned, let’s provision it.
Select Machine Learning from Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) home page:
 
















 



 









 



 
In the ML Workspaces section, select Provision Workspace.
Two simple pieces of information are needed to provision an ML workspace - the Workspace name and the Environment name. For example:

Workspace Name: cml-tutorial
Environment: <your environment name>
Select Provision Workspace

 
















 



 









 



 
Create Project
 
Beginning from the ML Workspaces section, open your workspace by selecting its name, cml-tutorial.
Select New Project
Complete the New Project form using:

Project Name: opdb-web-application
Project Description:
Simple inventory management system using Cloudera Operational Database (COD)


Initial Setup: Local Files
Upload or Drag-Drop tutorial-files.zip you downloaded earlier
Select Create Project

 
















 



 









 



 
Application Configuration
 
Beginning from the Projects section, select the project name, opdb-web-application.
Select New Session and complete the session form:

Session Name: configuration
Editor: Workbench
Kernel: Python 3
Edition: Standard
Resource Profile: 1 vCPU / 2 GiB Memory
Select Start Session

 
















 



 









 



 
Let’s make a minor configuration change and install the dependencies:

Modify the configuration file, config.ini.template, with the Phoenix Python URL we retrieved earlier and username/password.
[COD]
Username=<cdp_workload_username>
Password=<cdp_workload_password>
Url=<URL from Phoenix Thin JDBC connection>
Serialization=PROTOBUF
Authentication=BASIC

Save the file as config.ini: File > Save As > config.ini

Install the dependencies by issuing the following statement in the command-line:
!pip3 install -r requirements.txt

 
















 



 









 



 
In the same session (or a new one), let’s create and populate a table that we’ll be using in our application.
Select file db_setup.py and click on
 
















 



 









 



 
Create and Run Web Application
 
Let’s create our inventory management system web application.
Beginning from the Applications section, select New Application and fill out the form as follows:

Name: opdb-web-app
Subdomain: opdb-web-app
Description: Simple inventory management system
Script: main.py
Kernel: Python 3
Select Create Application

 
















 



 









 



 
After a few moments, the application is up and running. Select the application’s name, opdb-web-app, to open the web application.
 
















 



 









 



 
This web application accepts a part number and quantity. It first verifies that the part exists, if it does, it will decrease/increase the quantity on hand. For example:
A positive quantity value, decreases the quantity on hand.
A negative quantity value, increases the quantity on hand.
 
















 



 









 



 
Summary
 
Congratulations on completing the tutorial.
While this was a simple example of a web application, I hope it sparks your imagination and inspires other creative solutions.
