 Tutorials
Enrich Data using Cloudera Data Engineering



















 
Introduction
 
Data Lifecycle - data enrichment. This tutorial will walk you through running a simple PySpark job to enrich your data using an existing data warehouse. We will use Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) on Cloudera Data Platform - Public Cloud (CDP-PC).
 






 
Prerequisites
 

Have access to Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud
Have access to a virtual warehouse for your environment. If you need to create one, refer to From 0 to Query with Cloudera Data Warehouse
Have created a CDP workload User
Ensure proper CDE role access
DEAdmin: enable CDE and create virtual clusters
DEUser: access virtual cluster and run jobs


Basic AWS CLI skills

The video below provides a brief overview of what is covered in this tutorial:
 



























 



 









 



 
Download Assets
 
There are two (2) options in getting assets for this tutorial:

Download a ZIP file

It contains only necessary files used in this tutorial. Unzip tutorial-files.zip and remember its location.

Clone our GitHub repository

It provides assets used in this and other tutorials; organized by tutorial title.
 
Using AWS CLI, copy the following files to S3 bucket, defined by your environment’s storage.location.base attribute:
car_installs.csv
car_sales.csv
customer_data.csv
experimental_motors.csv
postal_codes.csv
Note: You may need to ask your environment's administrator to get property value for storage.location.base.
 
For example, property storage.location.base has value s3a://usermarketing-cdp-demo, therefore copy the files using the command:
aws s3 cp . s3://usermarketing-cdp-demo --recursive --exclude "*" --include "*.csv"
 
















 



 









 



 
Setup Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE)
 
Enable CDE Service
 
If you don’t already have Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service enabled for your environment, let’s enable one.
Starting from Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Home Page, select Data Engineering:
 
















 



 









 



 

Click on  to enable new Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service
Name: data-engineering
Environment: <your environment name>
Workload Type: General - Small
Make other changes (optional)
Enable

 
















 



 









 



 
Create Data Engineering Virtual Cluster
 
If you don’t already have a CDE virtual cluster created, let’s create one.
Starting from Cloudera Data Engineering > Overview:

Click on  to create cluster
Cluster Name: data-engineering
CDE Service: <your environment name>
Autoscale Max Capacity: CPU: 4, Memory 4 GB
Create
 

















 



 









 



 
Create and Run Jobs
 
We will be using the GUI to run our jobs. If you would like to use the CLI, take a look at Using CLI-API to Automate Access to Cloudera Data Engineering.
In your virtual cluster, view jobs by selecting .
 
















 



 









 



 
We will create and run two (2) jobs:

Pre-SetupDW

As a prerequisite, this PySpark job creates a data warehouse with mock sales, factory and customer data.
IMPORTANT: Before running the job, you need to modify one (1) variable in Pre-SetupDW.py. Update variable s3BucketName definition using storage.location.base attribute; defined by your environment.


EnrichData_ETL

Bring in data from Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW), filter out non-representative data, and then join in sales, factory, and customer data together to create a new enriched table and store it back in CDW.
 
In the Jobs section, select Create Job to create a new job:

Name: Pre-SetupDW
Upload File: Pre-SetupDW.py (provided in download assets)
Select Python 3
Turn off Schedule
Create and Run

 
Give it a minute for this job to complete and create the next job:

Name: EnrichData_ETL
Upload File: EnrichData_ETL.py (provided in download assets)
Select Python 3
Turn off Schedule
Create and Run

 
















 



 









 



 
Review Job Output
 
Let’s take a look at the job output generated.
 
First, let’s take a look at the output for Pre-SetupDW:
Select Job Runs tab.

Select the Run ID number for your Job name
Select Logs
Select stdout

 
The results should look like this:
 
















 



 









 



 
Next, let’s take a look at the job output for EnrichData_ETL:
Select Job Runs tab.

Select the Run ID number for your Job name
Select Logs
Select stdout

 
The results should look like this:
 
















 



 









 



 
Summary
 
Congratulations on completing the tutorial.
As you've now experienced, Cloudera Data Engineering Experience (CDE) provides an easy way for developers to run workloads.
