 Tutorials
From 0 to Dashboard with Cloudera Data Warehouse on CDP



















 
Introduction
 
Learn to quickly visualize datasets and create stunning dashboards using Cloudera Data Visualization on the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) - Public Cloud.
CDP Data Visualization enables data engineers, business analysts, and data scientists to quickly and easily explore data, collaborate, and share insights across the data lifecycle.
 






 
Prerequisites
 

Have access to Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud environment
Have created a CDP workload User
Basic AWS CLI skills

Watch Video
 
The video below provides a brief overview of what is covered in this tutorial:
 



























 



 









 



 
Download Assets
 
There are two (2) options in getting assets for this tutorial:

Download a ZIP file

It contains only necessary files used in this tutorial. Unzip tutorial-files.zip and remember its location.

Clone our GitHub repository

It provides assets used in this and other tutorials; organized by tutorial title.
 
Using AWS CLI, copy the following data file to your S3 bucket, defined by your environment’s storage.location.base attribute:
shipping-data.csv
For example, property storage.location.base has value s3a://usermarketing-cdp-demo; we will copy the file using the command:
aws s3 cp shipping-data.csv s3://usermarketing-cdp-demo/tutorial-data/shipping-data.csv
 
Note: shipping dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.
 
















 



 









 



 
Create Virtual Warehouse
 
Before we create a virtual warehouse, we need to make sure the environment is activated and running.
Beginning from the CDP Home Page, select Data Warehouse.

 
















 



 









 



Locate your environment by using the filter. If you see  next to the environment name, no need to activate it because it's already been activated and running.
Otherwise, click on  to activate the environment. This will create the default database catalog, environment_name-default.
 
















 



 









 



 
Now that the environment has been activated, in the Virtual Warehouse section, select  to create a virtual warehouse:

Name: Shipping-VW
Type: HIVE
Database Catalog: environment_name-default
Size: xsmall - 2 Executor Nodes
AutoSuspend Timeout: 300 seconds
Nodes: Min: 2, Max: 4
Install Data Visualization
CREATE

 
















 



 









 



 
Create and Populate Table
 
Open HUE from your virtual warehouse:

Filter using your Virtual Warehouse, Shipping-VW
Click on 
Open HUE

 
















 



 









 



 
Now that we have HUE opened, select </> Editor, copy-paste the following SQL statements onto the worksheet, make one modification and execute it:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS default.shipping;


CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS default.shipping (
    ID                  integer,
    Warehouse_block     string,
    Mode_of_Shipment    string,
    Customer_care_calls integer,
    Customer_rating     integer,
    Cost_of_the_Product integer,
    Prior_purchases     integer,
    Product_importance  string,
    Gender              string,
    Discount_offered    string,
    Weight_in_gms       integer,
    Arrive_on_time      integer
  )
  ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
  STORED AS TEXTFILE
  LOCATION ${dataset_location}
  tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");


SELECT * FROM default.shipping;

 
 
IMPORTANT: You need to provide the value for variable named, dataset_location. Set the value to the location of the dataset you specified when you downloaded the dataset. For example, 's3a://usermarketing-cdp-demo/tutorial-data/'.
 
















 



 









 



 
Visualize Data
 
Open Data Visualization from your virtual warehouse.

Filter using your Virtual Warehouse, Shipping-VW
Click on 
Open Data Visualization

 
















 



 









 



 
Create Dataset using Table Data
 
Starting from Cloudera Data Visualization home page, select DATA.

Select Default Hive VW connection
Select Datasets tab
Select NEW DATASET

Create New dataset using table source:
Dataset Title: Shipping
Dataset Source: From Table
Select Database: default
Select Table: shipping
Edit dataset to adjust Dimensions/Measures:

Select dataset named Shipping
Select Fields
Select EDIT FIELDS

Modify product_importance as a Measure
Modify discount_offered as a Measure
Modify id as a Dimension
Click on SAVE
 
















 



 









 



 
Visualize Data
 
Open Data Visualization from your virtual warehouse.

Filter using your Virtual Warehouse, Shipping-VW
Click on 
Open Data Visualization

 
















 



 









 



 
Let’s build the Dashboard.

Select VISUALS
Select NEW DASHBOARD

 
















 



 









 



 
We will use:
Title: Shipping Dashboard Example
Subtitle: Visually appealing representation of shipping data
 
In Dashboard Designer, select the Visuals tab. We are going to create four (4) new visuals using the Default Hive VW connection and Shipping dataset.
