 Tutorials
How to Create a CDP Private Cloud Base Development Cluster



















 
Introduction
 
This tutorial walks you through the installation of CDP Private Cloud Base (trial version). We will use AWS for the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to create the underlying infrastructure needed.
At the time of writing,  CDP Private Cloud Base is built using Cloudera Manager 7.4.4 and Cloudera Runtime 7.1.7.
 






 
Prerequisites
 

Have administrative access to an AWS account
Installed and configured AWS CLI
Installed jq, a command-line tool for parsing JSON. Refer to stedolan.github.io for assistance on installing.

The video below provides a brief overview of what is covered in this tutorial:
 



























 



 









 



 
Download Assets
 
There are two (2) options in getting assets for this tutorial:

Download a ZIP file

It contains only necessary files used in this tutorial. Unzip tutorial-files.zip and remember its location.

Clone our GitHub repository

It provides assets used in this and other tutorials; organized by tutorial title.
 






 
Create Infrastructure
 
In the Downloads Assets section, bash script create-iaas.sh was provided. This script facilitates the creation of the infrastructure and requirements needed to install CDP Private Cloud Base (trial version) using AWS as the cloud service provider. 
There is no need to edit or modify the script.
IMPORTANT: Make note of the script output, SUMMARY and ACTION ITEMS sections. It provides information about the infrastructure created and the necessary action items you must take.
 
On your local computer’s command-line, issue the following command:
./create-iaas.sh
 
















 



 









 



 
Map IP Addresses
 
Based on the infrastructure the script created, your hosts file needs to be updated to map the IP addresses to host names.
From the script output, select and copy the text underneath 1. APPEND TO HOST FILE: and append it to your host file.
NOTE: You must have administrator/sudo privileges to modify the host file.
 
Host file location depends on your operating system:
macOS: /private/etc/hosts
Linux: /etc/hosts
Windows: c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
 
















 



 









 



 
Run Commands on each Node
 
As explained in the script output, under ACTION ITEMS, run the specified commands on each node.
NOTE: We deliberately update the primary node last; not exiting the terminal. We need to run more commands in the next step.
 
Reason for updates:

As explained in, Before You Begin a Trial Installation, we need to disable SELinux.
Reducing value for vm.swappiness enhances performance by keeping more pages in memory.

 
















 



 









 



 
Download Trial Version
 
Let’s download the trial version of CDP Private Cloud Base from the Cloudera Downloads site:

Select CDP Private Cloud, Free Trial.
Select CDP Private Cloud Base, Try now
Select Trial Version CDP Private Cloud, TRY NOW
Follow the Trial Installation instructions provided on the page.NOTE: In the previous step, we deliberately left the ssh connection opened for  the primary node. This is where we will run the Cloudera Manager installer, cloudera-manager-installer.bin.


 
















 



 









 



 
Install Cloudera Manager Server
 
Let’s run the Cloudera Manager installer, cloudera-manager-installer.bin, on the primary node as explained earlier.
After reading Cloudera Manager README, click Next.
 
















 



 









 



 
After reading the Cloudera Standard License agreement, click Next.
If you agree to the license agreement, click Yes to accept the license.
 
















 



 









 



 
It will take a few minutes to install Cloudera Manager Server.
When it completes, you will be asked to point your browser to the URL provided and log in using credentials provided.
NOTE: In the Map IP Addresses section, you modified the hosts file.
















 



 









 



 
Select OK to close the window.
Select OK to exit the Cloudera Manager installer.
Type exit on the primary node’s command-line to close the ssh connection.
 
Install Cluster
 
Now that you have opened your web browser to http://cdptrial:7180 and logged in to Cloudera Manager, let’s configure Cloudera Manager.
When asked for License File, select Try Cloudera Data Platform for 60 days, accept the Terms and Conditions and select Continue.
 
















 



 









 



 
After reading the welcoming message, Select Continue.
NOTE: The warnings received about AutoTLS and KDC can be ignored since we’re installing the trial version.
 
















 



 









 



 
Cluster Basics
 
Choose a name for your cluster - we will use the default, Cluster 1.
Select Continue
 
















 



 









 



 
Specify Hosts
 
Enter the cluster host names or IP addresses in the Hostname field.
The IP addresses, CDP Hosts, are provided in the create-iaas.sh script output. 
 
















 



 









 



 
Make sure the SSH Port is 22, select Search, then Continue.
IMPORTANT: Make sure all hostnames are successfully scanned and select all IP address.

Setup Database
 
This step configures and tests the database connections.
Make sure Use Embedded Database is selected.
NOTE: You may receive a warning stating that PostgreSQL database is not supported for use in production environments. This warning can be ignored because we are using the trial version.
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select Test Connection. All tested connections should be successful.
Click Continue.
