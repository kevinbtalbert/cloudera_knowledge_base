How to Create a CDP Private Cloud Base Development Cluster
All Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) related tutorials

 






Introduction
In this tutorial, we’ll focus on taking advantage of the improvements to Apache Hive and Apache Tez through the work completed by the community as part of the Stinger initiative, some of the features which helped make Hive be over one hundred times faster are:

Performance improvements of Hive on Tez
Performance improvements of Vectorized Query
Cost-based Optimization Plans
Multi-tenancy with HiveServer2

Prerequisites

Downloaded and deployed the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) Sandbox
Learning the Ropes of the HDP Sandbox

Outline

Download Data
Create Hive Tables From CSV files on DAS
Speed Improvements
Configure MapReduce as Execution Engine in Hive view Settings Tab
Test Query on MapReduce Engine
Configure Tez as Execution Engine in Hive view Settings Tab
Test Query on Tez Engine
Execute Query as MapReduce Then Tez Engine
Track Hive on Tez Jobs

Download Data
Download the data from our repository:

wget https://github.com/hortonworks/data-tutorials/raw/master/tutorials/hdp/interactive-query-for-hadoop-with-apache-hive-on-apache-tez/assets/driver_data.zip
unzip driver_data.zip

Alternatively, click here to download.
We will be uploading two csv files - drivers.csv and timesheet.csv on to DAS to create tables from them.
Create Hive Tables from CSV files on DAS
DAS can be accessed by selecting the service from Sandbox Splash Page

DAS is also accessible by navigating to sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:30800
You will find the Data Analytics Studio UI:

Next, we will create tables based on the csv files we downloaded earlier.
1. Click on Database
2. Select the + button to add a new table
3. Click on UPLOAD TABLE

4. Select the Is first row header? checkbox
5. Select Upload from Local
6. Drag and drop drivers.csv and timesheet.csv onto the browser or select the files from your local directory

7. Review the data and the DDL, once you are satisfied select create

Here is a table of the DDL for your reference:
Driver Table

Item
Data Type
driverId
int
name
string
ssn
big int
location
string
certified
string
wageplan
string

Timesheet Table

driverId
int
week
int
hoursLogged
int
miles_logged
int

Speed Improvements
To experience the speed improvements of Hive on Tez, we will run some sample queries.
By default, the Hive view runs with Tez as it's execution engine. That's because Tez has great speed improvements over the original MapReduce execution engine. But by how much exactly are these improvements? Well let's find out!
Configure MapReduce as Execution Engine in Hive view Settings Tab
Great, now that our tables are created and loaded with data we can begin experimenting with settings:
Navigate back to Ambari and sign in as Username/Password: raj_ops/raj_ops
Next select Hive and then CONFIGS

Finally, use the filter to find and modify these specific configurations:

Configuration
New Value
hive.execution.engine
mr
hive.auto.convert.join
false (unselect box)



Save the changes and restart all services required.
Test Query on MapReduce Engine
We are now going to test a query using MapReduce as our execution engine. Head back to DAS then execute the following query and wait for the results.

select d.*, t.hoursLogged, t.milesLogged
from drivers d join timesheet t
on d.driverId = t.driverId;


This query was run using the MapReduce framework.
Configure Tez as Execution Engine in Hive Settings Tab
Now we can enable Hive on Tez execution and take advantage of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) execution representing the query instead of multiple stages of MapReduce program which involved a lot of synchronization, barriers and IO overheads. This is improved in Tez, by writing intermediate data set into memory instead of hard disk.
Great, now that our tables are created and loaded with data we can begin experimenting with settings:
Navigate back to Ambari and sign in as Username/Password: raj_ops/raj_ops
Next select Hive and then CONFIGS

Finally, use the filter to find and modify these specific configurations:

Configuration
New Value
hive.execution.engine
tez
hive.auto.convert.join
true (select box)

Save the changes and restart all services required.
Test Query on Tez Engine
Run the same query as we had run earlier to see the speed improvements with Tez.

select d.*, t.hours_logged, t.miles_logged
from drivers d join timesheet t
on d.driverId = t.driverId;


Take a look at the Visual Explain to visually see the execution plan.

Notice that the results will have appeared much quicker while having the execution engine set to Tez. This is currently the default for all Hive queries.
Congratulations! You have successfully run your Hive on Tez Job.
Execute Query as MapReduce Then Tez Engine
Now let’s try a new query to work with

SELECT d.driverId, d.name, t.total_hours, t.total_miles from drivers d
JOIN (SELECT driverId, sum(hoursLogged)total_hours, sum(milesLogged)total_miles FROM timesheet GROUP BY driverId ) t
ON (d.driverId = t.driverId);

Try executing the query first on MapReduce execution engine, then on Tez. You should notice a considerable gap in execution time. Here is the result.

To experience this further, you could use your own dataset, upload to your HDP Sandbox using steps above and execute with and without Tez to compare the difference.
Track Hive on Tez Jobs
You can track your Hive on Tez jobs in HDP Sandbox Web UI as well by navigating to http://sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:8088/ui2, here you can observe the running state of the queries we just experimented with, as well as the engine used in the background.

You can click on your job and see further details.
Summary
You learned how to create Hive tables from .csv files using DAS. We also experimented with MapReduce and Tez to observe the speed improvements of Hive on Tez.
