Objective
To understand the concepts behind messaging systems in distributed systems, and how to use them to pass on information between the producer (publisher, sender) to the consumer (subscriber, receiver). In this example, you will learn about Kafka.
Outline

What is a Messaging System?
Point to Point System
Publish-Subscribe System
What is Kafka
Architectural Overview
Benefits of Kafka
Next: Kafka in Action

What is a Messaging System?
Messaging systems transfer data between client applications. One application produces the data, such as reading from sensors embedded on vehicles and the other application receives the data, processes it to be ready to be visualized to show the characteristics about the drivers driving behavior who drive those vehicles. As you can see each application developer can focus on writing code to analyze the data and not worry about how to share the data. There are two messaging systems used in this scenario, point to point and publish subscribe. The system most often used is publish subscribe, but we will look at both.
Point to Point System
Point to Point are messages transmitted into a queue

Key Characteristics of generic figure above:

producer sends messages into the queue, each message is read by only one consumer
once the message is consumed, it vanishes
multiple consumers can read messages from the queue

Publish-Subscribe System
Publish-Subscribe are messages transmitted into a topic


message producers are known as publishers
message consumers are known as subscribers

How does the Pub-Sub messaging system work?

publisher sends messages into 1 or more topics
subscribers can arrange to receive 1 or more topics, then consume all the messages

What is Kafka
Apache Kafka is an open source publish-subscribe based messaging system responsible for transferring data from one application to another.
Architectural Overview
At a high level, our data pipeline looks as follows:

NiFi Producer
Produces a continuous real-time data feed from truck sensors and traffic information that are separately published into two Kafka topics using a NiFi Processor implemented as a Kafka Producer.
To learn more about the Kafka Producer API Sample Code, visit Developing Kafka Producers
Kafka Cluster
Has 1 or more topics for supporting 1 or multiple categories of messages that are managed by Kafka brokers, which create replicas of each topic (category queue) for durability.
Storm Consumer
Reads messages from Kafka Cluster and emits them into the Apache Storm Topology to be processed.
To learn more about the Kafka Consumer API Sample Code, visit Developing Kafka Consumers
Benefits of Kafka
Reliability

Distributed, partitioned, replicated and fault tolerant

Scalability

Messaging system scales easily without down time

Durability

"Distributed commit log" which allows messages to continue to exist on disk even after the processes that created that data have ended

Performance

High throughput for publishing and subscribing messages
Maintains stable performance for many terabytes stored

Next: Kafka in Action
Now that we've become familiar with how Kafka will be used in our use case, let's move onto seeing Kafka in action when running the demo application.
