Introduction
This tutorial is aimed for users who do not have much experience in using the Sandbox.
The Sandbox is a straightforward, pre-configured, learning environment that contains the latest developments from Apache Hadoop, specifically the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP). The Sandbox comes packaged in a virtual environment that can run in the cloud or on your personal machine. The Sandbox allows you to learn and explore HDP on your own.
Let's begin our Hadoop journey...
Prerequisites

Downloaded and deployed Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) Sandbox

Appendix B: Troubleshoot
Appendix C: Determine Network Adapter of Your VirtualBox Sandbox

Environment setup
This is the administrative section to get started with the Hortonworks Sandbox environment. Generally, this will only be done once.
Determine IP Address of Your Sandbox
Once the Sandbox VM or container is installed, it settles to the host of your environment, the IP address varies depending on your Virtual Machine (VMware, VirtualBox) or container (Docker). Once the sandbox is running, it will tell you the IP address. An example of typical IP addresses for each supported environment:
Docker: IP Address = 127.0.0.1
VirtualBox: IP Address = 127.0.0.1
VMWare: IP Address = 192.168.x.x
If you're using VirtualBox or VMWare, you can confirm the IP address by waiting for the installation to complete and confirmation screen will tell you the IP address your sandbox resolves to. For example:

Map Sandbox IP to Your Desired Hostname in the Hosts File
Mac, Linux and Windows all have a hosts file. This file once configured enables the IP address of the sandbox to be mapped to a hostname that is easier to remember than a number.
Mac users:

echo '{IP-Address} sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com sandbox-hdf.hortonworks.com' | sudo tee -a /private/etc/hosts

Linux users:

echo '{IP-Address} sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com sandbox-hdf.hortonworks.com' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

Windows users:

Run Notepad as administrator.
Open hosts file located in: c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
Add {IP-Address} localhost sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com sandbox-hdf.hortonworks.com
Save the file

IMPORTANT: Replace  with Sandbox IP Address

Terminal Access
Refer to Login Credentials for list of users and passwords. You can also login using root, using password hadoop, which may require you to change the password - remember it!
If you login using credentials other than root, you will be required to use sudo before the command. For example: sudo ambari-server status.
Secure Shell Method:
Open your terminal (mac/linux) or Git Bash (Windows). Type the following command to access the Sandbox through ssh user@hostname -p port. For example: ssh root@sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com -p 2222

Shell Web Client Method:
The shell web client is also known as Shell-in-a-Box. It's an easy way to issue shell commands without needing to install additional software. It uses port 4200, for example: sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:4200
Send Data Between Sandbox and Local Machine
Using the terminal of your choice, you can transfer files to/from sandbox and local machine.

Transfer file from local machine to sandbox:

scp -P 2222 <local_directory_file> root@sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:<sandbox_directory_file>


Transfer file from sandbox to local machine:

scp -P 2222 root@sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:<sandbox_directory_file> <local_directory_file>



Do you notice the difference between the two commands?
To send data from local machine to sandbox, the local machine directory path comes before sandbox directory. To transfer data from sandbox to local machine, the command arguments are reversed.
Welcome Page
The Sandbox Welcome Page is also known as the Splash Page. It runs on port number :1080. To open it, use your host address and append the port number. For example: http://sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:1080/
It looks like this:

Launch Dashboard opens two browser windows - Ambari interface and beginner tutorial. You should login to Ambari using the username and password based on the tutorial requirements. Most of the tutorials use raj_ops or maria_dev. Refer to Login Credentials for list of users and passwords.
Advanced HDP Quick Links provide quick access to Ambari Services such as Zeppelin, Atlas, Ranger, Shell-in-a-box and others.
Explore Ambari

Ambari Dashboard runs on port :8080. For example, http://sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:8080
Login to as admin, refer to Admin Password Reset
Select Manage Ambari


The following screen will be displayed:


“Dashboard” will take you to the Ambari Dashboard which is the primary UI for Hadoop Operators
“Cluster Management” allows you to grant permission to Ambari users and groups
“Administration of Users” allows you to add & remove Ambari users and groups
“Ambari User Views” list the set of Ambari Users views that are part of the cluster


Click on Go to Dashboard and you should see a similar screen:


Explorer by click on:
1. Metrics, Heatmaps and Config History
and then on:
2. Background Operations,Alerts, Admin and User Views, icon (represented by 3×3 matrix ) to become familiar with the Ambari resources available to you.

Open a port for custom use
Refer to the Sandbox Guide for ports available for custom use.
In this example we will use the fictional port 1234, note that this port is not available for custom use.
SSH onto the Sandbox Host
If you are running the VirtualBox VM:

# SSH on to VirtualBox Virtual Machine
ssh root@sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com -p 2200

Or if you are using VMWare:

# SSH on to VMWare Virtual Machine
ssh root@sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com -p 22

Note: The default password is hadoop.

Change directories to /sandbox/deploy-scripts/assets/

cd /sandbox/deploy-scripts/assets/

NOTE: On the docker version of the Sandbox the script is found on deploy-scripts/assets/generate-proxy-deploy-script.sh

Under the assets directory you will find a file named generate-proxy-deploy-script.sh, edit it:

vi generate-proxy-deploy-script.sh

search for the tcpPortsHDP array and enter the port that you would like to forward:

to save and exit press esc and enter :x
to execute your changes re-run the script:

cd /sandbox/deploy-scripts
assets/generate-proxy-deploy-script.sh

and deploy the reverse proxy with your changes:

/sandbox/proxy/proxy-deploy.sh

Finally, add the port forward on your virtual environment
Settings -> Network -> Advanced -> Port Forwarding -> Add New
Now restart the virtual machine and enjoy your new port.
Sandbox Version
When you run into an issue, one of the first things someone will ask is "what sandbox version are you using"? To get this information:
Login using shell web client and execute: sandbox-version. The output should look something like:

Note: refer to Login Credentials

Admin Password Reset
Due to possibility of passwords being vulnerable to being hacked, we recommend you change your Ambari admin password to be unique.

Open Shell Web Client (aka Shell-in-a-Box):

The login using credentials: root / hadoop

Type the following commands: ambari-admin-password-reset


IMPORTANT: The first time you login as root, you may be required to change the password - remember it!

Appendix B: Troubleshoot

Hortonworks Community Connection (HCC) is a good resource to find answers to problems you may encounter during your Hadoop journey.

hangs / Long running processes


At times you may encounter a job, query or request that just seems to run forever and does not complete. It may be because it's in the ACCEPTED state. A good place to begin looking is in the ResourceManager. If you know a job has completed, but the Resource Manager still thinks it's running - kill it!

Appendix C: Determine Network Adapter of Your VirtualBox Sandbox
Once the Sandbox VM is installed, it attaches to a virtual network. There are 8 different network modes, but the default network your sandbox will attach to is NAT. We will cover relevant networks for our tutorial use cases: NAT and Bridged Adapter.
Network Address Translation (NAT)
By default, the VM attaches to Network Address Translation (NAT) network mode. The guest's IP address by default translates over to the host's IP address. NAT allows for the guest system to connect to external devices on external networks, but external devices cannot access the guest system. Alternatively, VirtualBox can make selected services on the guest reachable to the outside world by port forwarding. VirtualBox listens to certain ports on the host, then re-sends packets that arrive at those ports to the guest on the same port or different port.
How we are forwarding all incoming traffic from a specific host interface to the guest in our sandbox is by specifying an IP of that host like the following:

VBoxManage modifyvm "Hortonworks Sandbox HDP 3.0.1" --natpf1 "Sandbox Splash Page,tcp,127.0.0.1,1080,,1080"
.
.
.
VBoxManage modifyvm "Hortonworks Sandbox HDP 3.0.1" --natpf1 "Sandbox Host SSH,tcp,127.0.0.1,2122,,22"

You can find the set network by opening the VM settings and then select the network tab.
Bridged Networking
In this mode, the guest receives direct access to the network, which the host has been connected. The router assigns an IP address to the guest. On that network, instead of there being just the host IP address visible, now the guest IP address is visible too. Thus, external devices, such as MiNiFi running on a Raspberry Pi, are able to connect to the guest via it's IP address.
When would you need this mode? It is needed for Connected Data Architecture(CDA). To configure this mode, first power down your guest vm, click settings, switch to the network tab and change the attach to network to be Bridged Adapter.

WARNING: First make sure your computer is connected to a router, else this feature will not work cause there is no router to assign an IP address to the guest vm.

If you're using VirtualBox or VMWare, you can confirm the IP address by waiting for the installation to complete and confirmation screen will tell you the IP address your sandbox resolves to. For example:
