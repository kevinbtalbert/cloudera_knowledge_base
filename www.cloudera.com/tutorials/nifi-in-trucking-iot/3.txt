Introduction
We are aware of the role NiFi plays in this Trucking IoT application. Let's analyze the NiFi DataFlow to learn how it was built. Let's dive into the process behind configuring controller services and configuring processors to learn how to build this NiFi DataFlow.

Summary

NiFi Components
Check out the Core Concepts of NiFi to learn more about the NiFi Components used in creating a NiFi DataFlow.
Starting to Build a NiFi DataFlow
Before we begin building our NiFi DataFlow, let's make sure we start with a clean canvas.

Press CTRL-A or COMMAND-A to select entire canvas
On the Operate Palette, click DELETE


Note: You may need to empty queues before deleting DataFlow. Do this by **right-clicking** non-empty queue, then select **Empty queue**.

Setting up Schema Registry Controller Service
As the first step in building the DataFlow, we needed to setup NiFi Controller Service called HortonworksSchemaRegistry. Go to the Operate Palette, click on the gear icon, then select Controller Services tab. To add a new controller service, you would press on the " + " icon in the top right of the table. However, since the service has already been created, we will reference it to see how a user would connect NiFi with Schema Registry.
HortonworksSchemaRegistry
Properties Tab of this Controller Service

Property
Value
Schema Registry URL
http://sandbox-hdf.hortonworks.com:7788/api/v1
Cache Size
1000
Cache Expiration
1 hour

A schema is used for categorizing the data into separate categories: TruckData and TrafficData will be applied on the data during the use of the ConvertRecord processor.
From the configuration in the table above, we can see the URL that allows NiFi to interact with Schema Registry, the amount of cache that can be sized from the schemas and the amount of time required until the schema cache expires and NiFi has to communicate with Schema Registry again.
Building GetTruckingData
NiFi Data Simulator - Generates data of two types: TruckData and TrafficData as a CSV string.

Keep Configurations across Setting Tab, Scheduling Tab, Properties Tab as Default.
Configuring RouteOnAttribute
RouteOnAttribute - Filters TruckData and TrafficData types into two separate flows from GetTruckingData.

Right click on the processor, press configure option to see the different configuration tabs and their parameters. In each tab, you will see the following configurations:
Setting Tab

Setting
Value
Automatically Terminate Relationships
unmatched

The rest should be kept as default.
Scheduling Tab
Keep the default configurations.
Properties Tab

Property
Value
Routing Strategy
Route to Property name
TrafficData
${dataType:equals('TrafficData')}
TruckData
${dataType:equals('TruckData')}

Building EnrichTruckData
EnrichTruckData - Adds weather data (fog, wind, rain) to the content of each flowfile incoming from RouteOnAttribute's TruckData queue.

Learn more about building the GetTruckingData processor in the Coming Soon: "Custom NiFi Processor - Trucking IoT" tutorial.
Configuring ConvertRecord: TruckData
ConvertRecord - Uses Controller Service to read in incoming CSV TruckData FlowFiles from the EnrichTruckData processor and uses another Controller Service to transform CSV to Avro TruckData FlowFiles.

Right click on the processor, press configure option to see the different configuration tabs and their parameters. In each tab, you will see the following configurations:
Setting Tab

Setting
Value
Automatically Terminate Relationships
failure

Scheduling Tab
Keep the default configurations.
Properties Tab

In the operate panel, you can find more information on the controller services used with this processor:

Configuring ConvertRecord: TrafficData
ConvertRecord - Uses Controller Service to read in incoming CSV TrafficData FlowFiles from RouteOnAttribute's TrafficData queue and uses another Controller Service to write Avro TrafficData FlowFiles.

Right click on the processor, press configure option to see the different configuration tabs and their parameters. In each tab, you will see the following configurations:
Setting Tab

Value
Automatically Terminate Relationships

Configuring PublishKafka_1_0: TruckData
PublishKafka_1_0 - Receives flowfiles from ConvertRecord - TruckData processor and sends each flowfile's content as a message to Kafka Topic: trucking_data_truck using the Kafka Producer API.

Right click on the processor, press configure option to see the different configuration tabs and their parameters. In each tab, you will see the following configurations:
Setting Tab
