Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy a modern real-time streaming application. This application serves as a reference framework for developing a big data pipeline, complete with a broad range of use cases and powerful reusable core components. You will explore the NiFi Dataflow application, Kafka topics, Schemas, SAM topology and visualize slices from Superset.
Prerequisites

Downloaded and deployed the Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) Sandbox
Getting Started with HDF
Enabled Connected Data Architecture:
Enable CDA for VirtualBox
Enable CDA for VMware
Enable CDA for Docker

Concepts
SuperSet
SuperSet is a visual, intuitive and interactive data exploration platform. This platform offers a fast way to create and share dashboards with friends and business clients of your visualized datasets. Various visualization options are available to analyze the data and interpret it. The Semantic Layer allows users to control how the data stores are displayed in the UI. The model is secure and allows users to intricate rules in which only certain features are accessible by select individuals. SuperSet can be integrated with Druid or other data stores (SQLAlchemy, Python ORM, etc) of the user's choice offering flexibility to be compatible with multiple systems.
Druid
Druid is an open source analytics database developed for business intelligence queries on data. Druid provides low-latency live data ingestion, flexible data exploration and aggregation. Deployments often reach out to trillions of event in relation to numerous petabytes of data.
Overview of Trucking IoT Ref App
The Trucking IoT Reference Application is built using Cloudera DataFlow Platform.
The Trucking IoT data comes from a truck events simulator that is ingested by Apache NiFi, NiFi sends the data to Kafka topics which are then ingested by Stream Analytics Manager (SAM) to be stored into Druid. Superset is used to create a visual representation of the Druid data sources. A more in depth explanation of the pipeline will be explained as you explore the NiFi Dataflow application, Schema Registry, SAM, Druid and Superset.
Step 1: Configure SAM for CDA
1. Open Stream Analytics Manager (SAM) at http://sandbox-hdf.hortonworks.com:7777/
Add a Service Pool for HDP
SAM needs to be told where to find the HDP node to allow data transmission between the HDF and HDP nodes.
1. Hover over the wrench to open the Configuration dropdown, select Service Pool, so we can add a new service pool for HDP.
In the field to the left of AUTO ADD, include the following:

http://sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:8080/api/v1/clusters/Sandbox

and then click AUTO ADD.
2. There will be a popup screen asking for username/password as seen below:

Use your HDP admin credentials to sign in.
Table 1: Ambari Login credentials

Username
Password
admin
**setup process

Setup Ambari Admin Password Manually

You should now see services from the HDP Sandbox on the SAM Service Pool Dashboard to the right of the CDF Sandbox Service Pool. We have now shared the web address of where SAM can find the services for the HDP Ambari Stack as seen on the image below:

Create a multi-node Environment
With SAM environments, we can select the services that we want our SAM application to have access to. So, we will add the necessary services from HDF and HDP Service Pools and create a multi-node environment from those services.
1. Head to the Configuration dropdown, select Environments.
Click on the green plus symbol to create a new environment, add the following:

NAME: SandboxCDAEnvironment

DESCRIPTION: HDF and HDP Services Selected for CDA

SELECT SERVICES:

HDF:

KAFKA, STORM, ZOOKEEPER

HDP:

DRUID, HBASE, HDFS, HIVE

The configurations should look like this:

Now that these configurations are complete, we are ready to import and run our SAM topology for CDA.
Step 2: Configure HDFS for CDA
1. Open the HDP Shell-in-a-Box
2. Login as user/password: root/hadoop
Note: If this is not your first time login into Shell-in-a-Box then use the previous password you set up for root.

3. Enter the following commands:

su hdfs

hdfs dfs -chmod 777 /apps

The commands above will allow the service Storm in HDF to write to HDFS which resides in HDP.
Step 3: Deploy SAM Topology CDA Version
1. Open Stream Analytics Manager (SAM) at http://sandbox-hdf.hortonworks.com:7777/
2. Download the SAM topology for CDA and save it somewhere on your computer as "Trucking-IoT-CDA-V2.json".
3. Now on the SAM UI click the green plus sign and select Import Application

SELECT JSON FILE*
Choose File: Trucking-IoT-CDA-V2.json

APPLICATION NAME
Trucking-IoT-CDA

ENVIRONMENT
SandboxCDAEnvironment

4. Click on the Run button to deploy the topology:

A window will appear asking if you want to continue deployment, click Ok.
5. You will receive a notification that the SAM topology application deployed successfully and your topology will show Active Status in the bottom right corner.
Overview of the SAM Canvas:

My Applications: Different Topology Projects
1st Left Sidebar: My Applications, Dashboard, Schema Registry, Model Registry, Configuration
2nd Left Sidebar: Different stream components (source, processor, sink)
Gear Icon: configure topology settings
Status Icon: Start or Stop Topology

Overview of SAM topology:

TrafficData source data of "trucking_data_traffic" Kafka topic

TruckEnrichedData source data of "trucking_data_truck_enriched" Kafka topic

JoinStreams stream TruckEnrichData and TrafficData by "routeId"

FilterEvents checks if not "Normal" eventType, then will emit them

AverageSpeed computes average speed for driverId along routeId

ToDruidStore1 stores violation events from FilterEvents processor into Druid

ToDataLake1 store violation events from FilterEvents processor into HDFS

ToDruidStore2 stores average speed events into Druid

ToDataLake2 store average speed events into HDFS


Step 4: Visualize Trucking Data Via Superset
1. Open Ambari at http://sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:8080/. User credentials are username/password = raj_ops/raj_ops
2. Ensure that the services HDFS, YARN, Druid and Superset are on and to turn off maintenance mode.
For example, to turn on HDFS, click on the service name in Ambari, click on the Service Actions dropdown and click Start. In the window, you will be asked if you want to start, confirm and also click on the checkbox to turn off maintenance mode.
3. Open Superset at http://sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:9089/
Note: The username and password for Superset is admin/admin

4. Wait about 25 - 30 minutes for Kafka data to be consumed, then periodically, select the Sources dropdown and click on Refresh Druid Metadata. Eventually, the two Druid data sources will appear.

5. Select average-speed-cube-01 druid data source.
6. You will be taken to the Superset visualization slice where you can visualize that druid data source.

7. Under Datasource & Chart Type, select Visualization Type: Sunburst.

8. Under Hierarchy, add driverId, speed_AVG.
9. Press on Query to visualize the data into a Sunburst representation.

10. Select Save and name the slice: AvgSpeedSunburst. Create a new dashboard and call it: Trucking-IoT-Demo. Click Save.

The following visualization slice is a "Sunburst" of average-speed-cube-01 data source.

The following visualization slice is a "Sunburst" of violation-events-cube-01 data source:

All created visualization slices will be sent to the dashboard you assign them to, in the two above examples, both slices are apart of the Trucking-IoT-Demo dashboard.

Summary
Congratulations! You deployed the CDA Trucking IoT demo that processes truck event data by using the NiFi, Kafka, SAM, Schema Registry and SuperSet.
