Introduction

This tutorial walks through the general approach for installing the Hortonworks Sandbox (HDP or HDF) onto VMware on your computer.
Prerequisites

Download the Hortonworks Sandbox
VMWare Installed, version 14 or newer
VMWare Workstation For Linux/Windows
VMWare Fusion For macOS


A computer with minimum 10 GB RAM dedicated to the virtual machine

Outline

Import Hortonworks Sandbox
VMWare Workstation
VMWare Fusion


Update Virtual Machine Memory
Enable Connected Data Architecture (CDA) - Advanced Topic
Further Reading

Import Hortonworks Sandbox
VMWare Workstation
Open VMWare and select Open a Virtual Machine:

Browse and select the sandbox image you downloaded and click Open.
Next, you're given the opportunity to save the virtual machine under a different name and/or location. After changes are made, click Import. You should then see the importing progress dialog:

Once import is complete, you will see the newly imported machine listed.
Select the virtual machine you want to start and click Play virtual machine.

When the virtual machine fully boots up, you will see a similar screen as below.
Enter the URL into your browser - you're ready to begin using the sandbox.

Welcome to the Hortonworks Sandbox!
VMWare Fusion
Open VMWare and navigate to File -> Import... -> Choose File....

Select the sandbox image you downloaded and click Open, then Continue.
You are given the opportunity to save the virtual machine under a different name/location. If you have no preference in renaming, you can just leave the default name and click Save. You should then see the importing progress dialog:

Once finished, the following screen is displayed:

Click Finish to start your new virtual machine.
When the virtual machine fully boots up, you will see a similar screen as below.
Enter the URL into your browser - you're ready to begin using the sandbox.

Welcome to the Hortonworks Sandbox!
Update Virtual Machine Memory
Make sure the virtual machine is shutdown before modifying configurations. Right-click on virtual machine and select Settings....

First we must upgrade the virtual image to be able to upgrade the memory click on compatibility:

Next, click upgrade:

next return to "Show All" and select Processors & Memory and modify memory accordingly.

Finally restart the virtual machine for changes to take place.
Enable Connected Data Architecture (CDA) - Advanced Topic
Prerequisite:

A computer with minimum 22 GB of RAM dedicated to the virtual machine
Have already deployed the latest HDP/HDF sandbox
Update virtual machine settings to minimum 22 GB (22528 MB)

Hortonworks Connected Data Architecture (CDA) allows you to play with both data-in-motion (CDF) and data-at-rest (HDP) sandboxes simultaneously.
HDF (Data-In-Motion)
Data-In-Motion is the idea where data is being ingested from all sorts of different devices into a flow or stream. While the data is moving throughout this flow, components or as NiFi calls them “processors” are performing actions on the data to modify, transform, aggregate and route it. Data-In-Motion covers a lot of the preprocessing stage in building a Big Data Application. For instance, data preprocessing is where Data Engineers work with the raw data to format it into a better schema, so Data Scientists can focus on analyzing and visualizing the data.
HDP (Data-At-Rest)
Data-At-Rest is the idea where data is not moving and is stored in a database or robust datastore across a distributed data storage such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Instead of sending the data to the queries, the queries are being sent to the data to find meaningful insights. At this stage data, data processing and analysis occurs in building a Big Data Application.
Run Script to Enable CDA
The sandbox comes prepackaged with the script needed to enable CDA. Assuming you have already deployed the HDP sandbox, you need to SSH into Sandbox VM using password hadoop:

Issue command: ssh root@sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com -p 22

Note: if you originally deployed HDF sandbox, replace sandbox-hdp with sandbox-hdf in the ssh command above.


Run bash script:


cd /sandbox/deploy-scripts/
sh enable-vm-cda.sh

The script output will be similar to:
