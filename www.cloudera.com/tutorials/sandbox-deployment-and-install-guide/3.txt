Introduction

This tutorial walks through the general approach for installing the Hortonworks Sandbox (HDP or HDF) onto Docker on your computer.
Prerequisites

Docker Installed, version 17.09 or newer
Docker For Linux
Docker For Windows
Docker For Mac


A computer with minimum 10 GB RAM dedicated to the virtual machine
Microsoft Windows users must have bash shell installed. Instructions have been tested using Git Bash.

Outline

Memory Configuration
Memory For Linux
Memory For Windows
Memory For Mac


HDP Deployment
Deploy HDP Sandbox
Verify HDP Sandbox
Stop HDP Sandbox
Restart HDP Sandbox
Remove HDP Sandbox


HDF Deployment
Deploy CDF Sandbox
Verify CDF Sandbox
Stop CDF Sandbox
Restart CDF Sandbox
Remove CDF Sandbox

Memory Configuration
Memory For Linux
No special configuration needed for Linux.
Memory For Windows
After installing Docker For Windows, open the application and click on the Docker icon in the menu bar. Select Settings.

Select the Advanced tab and adjust the dedicated memory to at least 10GB of RAM.

Memory For Mac
After installing Docker For Mac, open the application and click on the Docker icon in the menu bar. Select Preferences.

Select the Advanced tab and adjust the dedicated memory to at least 12GB of RAM.

HDP Deployment
Deploy HDP Sandbox
Install/Deploy/Start HDP Sandbox

Download latest scripts Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) for Docker and decompress zip file.


In the decompressed folder, you will find shell script docker-deploy-.sh. From the command line, Linux / Mac / Windows(Git Bash), run the script:

cd /path/to/script
sh docker-deploy-{HDPversion}.sh

Note: You only need to run script once. It will setup and start the sandbox for you, creating the sandbox docker container in the process if necessary.
Note: The decompressed folder has other scripts and folders. We will ignore those for now. They will be used later in advanced tutorials.

The script output will be similar to:

Verify HDP Sandbox
Verify HDP sandbox was deployed successfully by issuing the command:

docker ps

You should see something like:

Stop HDP Sandbox
When you want to stop/shutdown your HDP sandbox, run the following commands:

docker stop sandbox-hdp
docker stop sandbox-proxy

Restart HDP Sandbox
When you want to re-start your sandbox, run the following commands:

docker start sandbox-hdp
docker start sandbox-proxy

Remove HDP Sandbox
A container is an instance of the Sandbox image. You must stop container dependancies before removing it. Issue the following commands:

docker stop sandbox-hdp
docker stop sandbox-proxy
docker rm sandbox-hdp
docker rm sandbox-proxy

If you want to remove the HDP Sandbox image, issue the following command after stopping and removing the containers:

docker rmi hortonworks/sandbox-hdp:{release}

HDF Deployment
Deploy CDF Sandbox
Install/Deploy/Start CDF Sandbox

Download latest scripts Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) for Docker and decompress zip file.


In the decompressed folder, you will find shell script docker-deploy-.sh. From the command line, Linux / Mac / Windows(Git Bash), run the script:

cd /path/to/script
sh docker-deploy-{HDFversion}.sh

Note: You only need to run script once. It will setup and start the sandbox for you, creating the sandbox docker container in the process if necessary.
Note: The decompressed folder has other scripts and folders. We will ignore those for now. They will be used later in advanced tutorials.

The script output will be similar to:

Verify CDF Sandbox
Verify HDF sandbox was deployed successfully by issuing the command:

docker ps

You should see something like:

Stop CDF Sandbox
When you want to stop/shutdown your HDF sandbox, run the following commands:

docker stop sandbox-hdf
docker stop sandbox-proxy

Restart CDF Sandbox
When you want to re-start your HDF sandbox, run the following commands:

docker start sandbox-hdf
docker start sandbox-proxy

Remove CDF Sandbox
A container is an instance of the Sandbox image. You must stop container dependencies before removing it. Issue the following commands:

docker stop sandbox-hdf
docker stop sandbox-proxy
docker rm sandbox-hdf
docker rm sandbox-proxy

If you want to remove the CDF Sandbox image, issue the following command after stopping and removing the containers:

docker rmi hortonworks/sandbox-hdf:{release}

Enable Connected Data Architecture (CDA) - Advanced Topic
Prerequisite:

A computer with minimum 22 GB of RAM dedicated to the virtual machine
Have already deployed the latest HDP/HDF sandbox
Update Docker settings to use minimum 16 GB (16384 MB)

Hortonworks Connected Data Architecture (CDA) allows you to play with both data-in-motion (CDF) and data-at-rest (HDP) sandboxes simultaneously.
HDF (Data-In-Motion)
Data-In-Motion is the idea where data is being ingested from all sorts of different devices into a flow or stream. While the data is moving throughout this flow, components or as NiFi calls them “processors” are performing actions on the data to modify, transform, aggregate and route it. Data-In-Motion covers a lot of the preprocessing stage in building a Big Data Application. For instance, data preprocessing is where Data Engineers work with the raw data to format it into a better schema. Data Scientists will focus on analyzing and visualizing the data.
HDP (Data-At-Rest)
Data-At-Rest is the idea where data is not moving and is stored in a database or robust datastore across a distributed data storage such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Instead of sending the data to the queries, the queries are being sent to the data to find meaningful insights. At this stage data, data processing and analysis occurs in building a Big Data Application.
Update Docker Memory
Select Docker -> Preferences... -> Advanced and set memory accordingly. Restart Docker.

Run Script to Enable CDA
When you first deployed the sandbox, a suite of deployment scripts were downloaded - refer to Deploy HDP Sandbox as an example.
In the decompressed folder, you will find shell script enable-native-cda.sh. From the command line, Linux / Mac / Windows(Git Bash), run the script:

cd /path/to/script
sh enable-native-cda.sh

The script output will be similar to:

Appendix A: Troubleshooting
Drive not shared


Docker needs write access to the drive where the docker-deploy-.sh is executed.

The easiest solution is to execute script from Downloads folder.

Otherwise, go to Docker Preferences/Settings -> File Sharing/Shared Drives -> Add/Select path/drive where deploy-scripts are located and try again.


No space left on device

Potential Solution
Increase the size of base Docker for Mac VM image



Port Conflict
While running the deployment script, you may run into conflicting port issue(s) similar to:

In the picture about, we had a port conflict with 6001.
Go to the location where you saved the Docker deployment scripts - refer to Deploy HDP Sandbox as an example. You will notice a new directory sandbox was created.

Edit file sandbox/proxy/proxy-deploy.sh
Modify conflicting port (first in keypair). For example, 6001:6001 to 16001:6001
Save/Exit the File
Run bash script: bash sandbox/proxy/proxy-deploy.sh
Repeat steps for continued port conflicts

Verify sandbox was deployed successfully by issuing the command:

docker ps

You should see something like:
