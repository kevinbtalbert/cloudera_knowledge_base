Introduction

We should now have some understanding of the benefits that Schema Registry provides a modern data architecture. Let's take a closer look at the main components that make up the registry.
Outline

Main Components
Schema Entities
Integration with HDF
Next: Using the Web Interface

Main Components
Schema Registry has the following main components:


Component
Description
Registry Web Server
Web Application exposing the REST endpoints you can use to manage schema entities. You can use a web proxy and load balancer with multiple Web Servers to provide HA and scalability.
Schema Metadata Storage
Relational store that holds the metadata for the schema entities. In-memory storage and mySQL databases are supported.
Serdes Storage
File storage for the serializer and deserializer jars. Local file system and HDFS storage are supported.
Schema Registry Client
A java client that HDF components can use to interact with the RESTful services.

Below is a graphic outlining how the different components come into play when sending and receiving messages affected by a schema.

Schema Entities
Schema Registry can be seen as being made up of different type of metadata entities.


Entity
Description
Example
Schema Group
A logical grouping of similar schemas. A Schema Group can be based on any criteria you have for managing schemas. Schema Groups can have multiple Schema Metadata definitions.
The group name trucking_data_truck or trucking_data_traffic
Schema Metadata
Metadata associated with a named schema. A metadata definition is applied to all the schema versions that are assigned to it.
Key metadata elements include: Schema Name, Schema Type, Description, Compatibility Policy, Serializers/Deserializers
Schema Version
The versioned schema (the actual schema text) associated with a schema metadata definition.
(Schema text example in following sections)

Integration with HDF
When Schema Registry is paired with other services available as part of the Cloudera DataFlow (CDF), integration with Schema Registry is baked in.

Component
Schema Registry Integration
NiFi
New processors and controller services in NiFi interact with Schema Registry. This allows creating flows using drag-and-drop processors that grant the benefits mentioned in the previous section without writing any code.
Kafka
A Kafka serializer and deserializer that uses Schema Registry is included with Kafka, allowing events to be marshalled and unmarshalled automatically.
Streaming Analytics Manager (SAM)
Using a drag-and-drop paradigm to create processing jobs, SAM will automatically infer schema from data sources and sinks, ensuring that data expected by connected services are compatible with one another.

Next: Using the Web Interface
Now that we have some understanding of what Schema Registry looks like under the hood, let's take it for a ride and poke around its web interface. The interface makes it easy to create and modify schemas for any application running on our cluster.
