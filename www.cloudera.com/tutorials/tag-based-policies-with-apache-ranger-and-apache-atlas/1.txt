How to Create a CDP Private Cloud Base Development Cluster

Introduction
In this section of the tutorial we will prepare the Sandbox environment by enabling relevant services and turning off services that are not used.
Prerequisites

Downloaded and deployed the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) Sandbox
Learning the Ropes of the HDP Sandbox

Outline

Concepts
Enable Ranger Audit to Solr
Stop Services not Used in Tag Based Policies
Restart Affected Services
Verify "ranger_audits" is created in Ambari Infra Solr
Summary

Concepts
Before we begin creating, assigning, and editing tag policies we must enable Ranger audit to Solr and start the services needed to assign policies. Additionally, we will stop services not necessary for this tutorial.
Furthermore, we should become acquainted with the personas who reside within the HDP Sandbox.
Here is a brief description of them:

raj_ops: Big Data Operations
maria_dev: Big Data Developer

Raj is our administrator and thus has full access to most of Ambari's services. Maria is our developer and thus has limited access to our cluster's services.
Username – raj_ops Password – raj_ops
Username – maria_dev Password – maria_dev
In order to set up our environment we will use our cluster administrator admin.
Enable Ranger Audit to Solr
Use your HDP admin credentials to sign in.
Table 1: Ambari Login credentials

Username
Password
admin
**your password

If this is your first time setting up the admin password follow the instructions in Setup Ambari Admin Password Manually.
Once in Ambari click on the Ranger service on the service Stack on the left and follow these steps to enable audit to Solr:
1. Ensure you are in the Ranger service
2. Select the Configs tab
3. Go to the Ranger Audit tab
4. Turn ON Ranger's Audit to Solr and SolrCloud features
5. Save this configuration
In the Save Configuration window that appears, write Enable Audit to Solr and SolrCloud Feature, then select Save, next click OK button on Dependent Configurations window. Finally, click Proceed Anyway on the Save Configuration Changes window, and click OK.

Stop Services Not Used in Tag Based Policies
Before we restart all the services that were affected by enabling the Audit to Solr and SolrCloud, we need to stop services that will not be used as part of the Tag Based Policies tutorial. We do this because we will be starting additional services, our sandbox is meant to have limited resources and might not respond well to having many services on at the same time.
We will start with Spark2. Go to the Spark2 service, click on the Stop button located in Service Actions.

1. Stop the following services in this order:

Spark2
Zeppelin


Restart Affected Services
Enabling Solr and SolrCloud affected other services on the stack. In order for the changes that we made to take effect on our sandbox we need to restart the affected services. We will start with Zookeeper.
Restart the Zookeeper Service
1. Select Zookeeper, then click on Service Actions. Click on Restart All to restart all components of Zookeeper. It will also restart all affected components of Zookeeper.

2. On the Confirmation window, press Confirm Restart All.

Background Operation Running window will appear showing Zookeeper currently is being restarted. This window will appear for other services you perform a service action upon.

Click OK button in bottom right corner.
3. Once Zookeeper finishes restarting, you will be able to see the components health.

4. Let's get back to Ambari Dashboard, click on the Ambari icon  in the top left corner.
Restart the Remaining Services
1. We will follow a similar approach as we did with the Zookeeper service to restart all the remaining services.
Restart the remaining services in this order:

Infra Solr
Ranger
HDFS
YARN
Hive
HBase (Turn Off Maintenance Mode then Restart All HBase)
Storm (Turn Off Maintenance Mode then Restart All Storm)
Atlas (Turn Off Maintenance Mode then Restart All Atlas)
Kafka
Knox (Turn off Maintenance Mode then Restart All Knox)


If Knox doesn't restart due to the KNOX GATEWAY failing, then:

Click on Knox Gateway

Find Knox Gateway under components and Start Knox Gateway

Go back to Knox's Host Actions and Restart All Components


2. In your Background Operations Running window, it should show that all the above services are being restarted.

Verify "ranger_audits" is created in Ambari Infra Solr
Once services have been restarted, you should verify that ranger_audits is started:
Ambari -> Infra Solr -> Quick Links -> Solr Admin UI
Make sure "ranger_audits" is displayed in Ambari Infra Solr as in the picture below:
Dashboard -> Cloud -> Graph

Summary
Great now that we have set up the environment for us to work with let's get to work assigning Tag Based Policies with Atlas.
