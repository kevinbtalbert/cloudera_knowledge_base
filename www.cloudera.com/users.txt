Meetup
Special Hybrid Event – Apache Iceberg: Looking Below the Waterline

Thursday, December 8, 2022
In a very short span of time since its advent, Apache Iceberg has become the most popular, fastest growing and widely adopted open table format in the big data space. It addresses some of the known big data pain points around data consistency, scalability, performance, schema and partition evolution. In this meetup, you'll hear from the key partners in the open source community leading and driving Iceberg enhancements and roadmap. We have a full agenda; here's a summary of the four talks we plan to deliver:
Apache Iceberg for BI use cases
This talk will cover the integration of Iceberg open table format with Apache Hive and Impala compute engines, Iceberg v1 and v2 capabilities support, customer use cases and future Iceberg enhancements and innovations in the works at Cloudera. We'll take a detailed look into the following capabilities supported in Hive and Impala:

Critical functional and performance enhancements
Materialized views support
In-place Table migration of Hive external to Iceberg tables
Row level update/delete
Table rollback
Table maintenance

Learn how Teranet keeps up with the changing growth and requirements of their business using Apache Iceberg for their change data capture use case leveraging Spark and Impala.
 
Multi-function Analytics with Apache Iceberg
This session will present a demonstration of using Spark with Iceberg tables, highlighting key Iceberg features. We'll show the interoperability of Spark with Hive and Impala. Along the way, we'll cover Cloudera's contributions for improving Spark and Impala support on Iceberg.
 
Apache Iceberg's REST Catalog - Real and Potential Uses Beyond Data Workflows
Iceberg's new REST catalog provides a friendly access point for the rich metadata and functionality that comes with an Iceberg-powered data warehouse. This makes Iceberg even easier to integrate into compute engines and makes catalog operations available from pretty much any client you can imagine. However, the power of the REST catalog doesn't stop there. There are a myriad of tools and features that sit on the edge of the data platform that benefit highly from the REST catalog design. In this talk, we want to cover a few creative uses that currently exist as well as some imaginative uses that could exist.

Incremental compaction using Apache Iceberg
At Linkedin, streaming data in the form of Kafka topics is ingested to the data lake by low-latency ingestion pipelines powered by Apache Gobblin. This often leads to smaller files that can contain duplicate records due to at-least once delivery semantics, which lead to the creation of another set of pipelines that deduplicate data for correctness and compact into larger files for storage and query efficiency.
Those compaction pipelines are bursty, compute intensive and have higher latency due to their batch processing nature. With the increase in data volume, it becomes increasingly important to process/compute data in an incremental fashion for optimal resource utilization and lower latency. In this talk, we present how Linkedin leverages Iceberg to migrate its compaction pipelines from batch to incremental processing models and solve such latency and compute problems. We also show how that leads to an improvement in overall cluster resource utilization and more uniform workload distribution. Furthermore, we will also focus on how we optimize compaction and data deduplication in light of late data.

Digital Transformation is a Data Journey From Edge to Insight
By Tui Leauanae, David LeGrand, and Nicolas Pelaez
This is the first in a six-part blog series that outlines the data journey from edge to AI and the business value data produces along the journey. The data journey is not linear, but it is an infinite loop data lifecycle – initiating at the edge, weaving through a data platform, and resulting in business imperative insights applied to real business-critical problems that result in new data-led initiatives.

How to Connect Go Applications to Cloudera Operational Database

The Cloudera Operational Database (COD) experience is a managed dbPaaS solution. It can auto-scale based on the workload utilization of the cluster and will be adding the ability to auto-tune (better performance within the existing infrastructure footprint) and auto-heal (resolve operational problems automatically) later this year.
