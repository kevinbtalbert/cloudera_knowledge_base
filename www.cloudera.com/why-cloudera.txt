Why Cloudera?
We believe that data can make what is impossible today, possible tomorrow









 Watch the video















 




















Unmatched freedom of choice—any cloud, any analytics, any data—without compromise

We taught the world the value of big data, creating an industry and ecosystem powered by the relentless innovation of the open source community. And now we enable the world’s largest enterprises to transform not just their organizations but their entire industries with data.

When you're making history, limitations are simply unacceptable, especially when it comes to accessing all your data. You cannot sacrifice the needs of the business due to the constraints of IT.

Thanks to the ’Power of And,’ you don't have to.











 









Flexibility and  Simplicity

Building a data-driven culture across the enterprise no longer has to add layers of complexity that impact business agility.

As the growth and distribution of data continues, businesses must provide employees easy access to the data needed to make the right decisions.

It’s essential. Because where data flows, ideas follow.

Performance and  Cost-Efficiency

Cost or performance? That's not a choice companies want to make. By taking a cloud-first approach, enterprises are forced to focus on how they spend money, not how they deliver value.

To change this dynamic, choose a data-first strategy. When companies do right by their data the entire organization can access and analyze without limitations.

Be in control of data; own the advantage.

Speed and  Control

Businesses need to manage risk and security while moving at speed.

To be a leader, not a laggard, companies have to be able to share data across multiple clouds, international borders, suppliers and partners, acquisitions, and legacy data centers.

Secure, well-governed, and accessible data, on-demand, fuels growth.
