Overview
Turn AI hype into business reality with Cloudera’s Open Data Lakehouse. 













Generative AI and Large Language Models are only as good as the data they’ve been trained on, and they need the right context. 
For these models and AI to be successful, all your data needs to be trusted. Cloudera’s Open Data Lakehouse is the safest, fastest path to Enterprise AI you can trust.





















 

















Reuse foundation models with confidence knowing that any data driving them is secured, governed, and ready for AI.






        Cloudera Data Platform
        















Models need continuous access to fresh data that is secure and governed to repeatedly and reliably tune models.






        Shared Data Experience (SDX)
        















As AI adoption accelerates, our Open Data Lakehouse adapts, supporting continuous innovation for whatever comes next.
