Capitalize on the value of all your data






We help businesses manage and analyze data of all types—machine data, structured data, transactional data, and unstructured data—with data anywhere. In clouds like AWS, Azure, and GCP. In on-premises data centers. And at the edge where machine data originates.

We deliver cloud-native data analytics for data distribution, data engineering, data warehousing, transactional data, data science, and machine learning that are portable across infrastructures. We enable you to bring the right analytics to the right cloud at the right time.

Just imagine the possibilities.











 








Hybrid cloud adoption: A growing enterprise priority















A singular focus on cloud overlooks the vast amount of enterprise data residing on premises. Organizations are realizing the value of a hybrid data platform that runs anywhere, enabling them to put all their data to work and make better decisions faster.

Modern data architectures shoulder the complexity, so IT doesn't have to















Organizations have been increasingly challenged to access, use, and create value from hybrid data due to its complexity. That is, until modern data architectures entered the picture.











 













 



 



      
      
      Unified data fabric
      






Stay in control without hampering the speed of implementation thanks to consistent security and governance:

Orchestrating all your disparate data sources intelligently and securely in a self-service manner

Creating a unified, trusted, and comprehensive view of all your data

Providing a single view across multiple clouds and on premises

      Scalable Data Mesh
      






Empower next-generation data applications more quickly, more easily, and more cost-effectively by:

Deploying familiar and common self-service data services for the complete lifecycle to each domain
Giving individual users and teams the ability to own and serve up their own data products
Providing consistent security and governance both within and across domains to deliver global governance and open standards

10 essential elements of a hybrid data platform












1. Distributed cloud model
Operates as a single platform across private and public clouds and the edge so data and workloads move friction-free bi-directionally without costly rewrites or refactors

2. Portable, interoperable data services
Covers the data lifecycle from ingestion to transformation, warehousing, and machine learning, with data services portable across clouds without refactoring or redevelopment

3. Data services for all eventualities
Handles all data types—structured, semi-structured, and unstructured—as provided or must be delivered: real time, streaming, and batch

4. Separated compute and storage 
Sizes compute and storage independently and flexibly, letting organizations dictate an optimal mix of providers based on factors such as price, performance, or locality

5. Common tools
Provide users with a single, consistent view to track utilization, resource consumption, performance, and cost along with the tools to manage and optimize data center hardware and cloud infrastructure

6. Orchestration and management
Easily orchestrates and automates management workflows, removing the complexity of leveraging multiple data services across heterogeneous clouds

7. Cross-platform security and governance
Delivers consistent security and governance across all deployments to ensure hybrid cloud success and enable mobility of data and services

8. Automated, optimized workload placement
Adapts to change, ensuring continuous, optimal delivery without refactoring by automatically placing or moving data and workloads

9. Intuitive experience
Provides simple, consistent, and intuitive user experiences, streamlined with a unique identity across all clouds for each user

10. Open and extensible
Is future-proof, able to extend for and adapt to new clouds, new data types, and new data services
